If this is a fixed list (which it seems it is, or else you shouldn't store it as an enum), I wouldn't use #1. The main reason to use #3 over #2 is for ease of use with self-service querying utilities. However, I'd actually go with a variant of #2: Store the value as an integer and map to an enum on data retrieval. However, also create a table representing the enum type, with the value as the PK and the name as another column. That way it's simple, quick, and efficient to use with your code, but also easy to get the logical value with self-service querying and other uses that don't use your data access code.
