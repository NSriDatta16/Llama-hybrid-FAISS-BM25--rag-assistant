Actually, customary neural networks does not extract features from data. It means that you can not get the outputs of e.g. the second layer and feed them to another machine learning algorithm. If you want to ectract features from your data, you should use auto-encoders (special type of neural nets) but even in auto-encoders, the process of feature extraction is automated and is managed by the model (neural network) itself. So, even with auto-encoders, you can not assign a specific feature to each layer.
