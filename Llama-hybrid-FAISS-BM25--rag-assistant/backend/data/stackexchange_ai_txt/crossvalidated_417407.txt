You can't meaningfully talk about DNNs or ARIMA being "better at time series forecasting". It depends enormously on what kind of series you are looking at: short vs. long series, many vs. few or only one related series, causal drivers or not etc. Anyone who makes sweeping statements here is like a salesman who knows exactly what kind of car you need - without bothering to find out whether you need to drive offroad, commute two miles to work, need to move a Little League baseball team, or want to transport cattle. As a very rough rule of thumb, classical methods perform competitively if you have few short series. DNNs may work better if you have many related series. (It depends heavily on whether the person setting them up knows what she or he is doing.)
