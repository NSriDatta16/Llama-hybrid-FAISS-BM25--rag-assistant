How can I interpolate a time series subject to stochastic perturbation?

I have a data set of gas prices. They are not evenly spaced in time, and have quite a few days missing. Here is a sample of the data Date Price 2016-05-18 0.9931994220059637 2016-05-19 0.9484317771304708 2016-05-20 0.93686097538978 2016-05-21 2016-05-22 2016-05-23 2016-05-24 2016-05-25 2016-05-26 0.9416552772446175 2016-05-27 0.9312735217012867 Is there a widely used way to interpolate the data? I don't want to do polynomial or linear interpolation since gas prices are subject to perturbation.
