y'know, create table, alter, add a column, etc are operations you can do at run time in many modern rdbms implementations. Why be EAVil? Especially if you are using dynamic sql. It's not for the fainthearted. I recall an implementation at Boeing which resulted in 70,000 tables in a database. Obviously there are pitfalls in dynamic table creation, but they also exist for EAV tables. Things like two attributes for the same key expressing the same fact. Or transitive dependencies and other normalization gotchas. So why not at least leverage the power of the RDBMS on your behalf?
