Low cost/home computing. Something that (at least here in Blighty) wasn't really heard of until the early 1980s. Without home computing, how many people posting here would have got into computing as a career? Or even as a hobby 1 ? Myself, had my folks not got Clive Sincliar's humble rubber-keyed ZX Spectrum back in 1982/1983, I probably wouldn't be here now. And it wasn't just the Speecy: the C64 , Vic-20 , Acorn Electron , BBC A/B/Master , Oric-1 , Dragon-32 , etc. all fuelled the home computer market and made programmers out of every 8 year old boy and girl who had access to one. If that wasn't a revolution in terms of computing and programming, I won't know what was...! 1 curious aside: what is the breakdown of hobbyists vs pro programmers on this site? I realise these stats aren't collated, but could be interesting to know.
