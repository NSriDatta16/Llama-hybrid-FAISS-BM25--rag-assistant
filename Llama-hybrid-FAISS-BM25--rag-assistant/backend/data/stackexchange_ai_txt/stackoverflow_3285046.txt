With the new OAuth2 based authorization flow and the Graph API , the amount of "work" an SDK does has been greatly reduced. I'd suggest that you choose a library that does not try to provide very high level abstractions, and instead understand and leverage the fact that you're making HTTP API calls (for instance, for parallelization of HTTP requests). We recently released an Android SDK which while not related to your question, may be a good point of reference.
