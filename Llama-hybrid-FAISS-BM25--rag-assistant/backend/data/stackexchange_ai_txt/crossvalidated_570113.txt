I also found out that calibration model has to be fit using a different dataset. That's not strictly true. As Frank Harrell explains , with data sets of this size it's generally best to develop the model on the entire data set and then validate the modeling process by repeating the modeling on multiple bootstrap samples and evaluating performance on the full data set. ( Repeated cross validation, as suggested by usÎµr11852, can also work for this.) That allows evaluation of and correction for bias, and production of calibration curves that are likely to represent the quality of the model when applied to new data samples from the population. This presentation outlines the procedure in the context of logistic regression, but the principles are general.
