Rails method as a nested resource

I'm wondering about the clever way to do this... I have methods that return a value when passed an an object as parameter, such as: I'd like to use the exact same methods as a nested resource to call via jQuery/Ajax, like so: .load('/location/8/average_rainfall') I understand how to define the route, but how do I tell my method to 'find' /location/8 and use that as it's parameter instead of @location as expected? Thanks!
