Why does Metropolis-Hastings build a simulated density function from the visit counts and not the target values?

From Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis , he states that with Metropolis-Hastings, "each position will be visited proportionally to its target value". By 'target value' he means the calculation of $P(\theta_{proposed})$ . If the visits are proportional to the target values, why not use the target values directly? Instead, it seems as though MH discards the target values after using them to calculate acceptance. At least in the discrete case, this leaves open the possibility of visiting the same $\theta_{proposed}$ multiple times and re-calculating the same target value and the acceptance ratio over and over again. I suppose what I'm proposing is more like a grid search of the posterior distribution that uses the proposal distribution (candidate generation) of MH. In my suggestion, one would still visit the same unique values of $\theta$ but ignore the visit counts and build a table mapping $\theta$ to $P(\theta)$ instead. Where does this idea break down?
