What is Bayesian Posterior Contraction?

I am currently reading about Bayesian Lasso Regression. It was stated that the Lasso Penalty is non Bayesian because the posterior does not contract at the same rate as the posterior mode. I have looked for a non technical definition of bayesian posterior contraction rate but found none. Can anyone provide me with an explanation?
