Time series analysis of image metadata

The data set that I haveâ€”a user's corpus of photos with time taken and an array of locations in each of them. Location is a bit hierarchical in nature, thus an array, like country, state, county, place. Between two users, I'm trying to find an image from user A which is closest(most relevant recommendation on the basis of time and location) to one from user B. The approach I'm taking is to convert each photo of user A(and B) into a vector with one coefficient representative of time and one representative of location and then choose between Euclidean distance or hamming distance to find the closest. I need a few suggestions here: I'm currently deriving the time coefficient using the following method. Plot images taken on each day against time. The image coefficient of each images is the number of images taken on the day / daily average I need alternative recommendations, like standard deviation, or any thing else. The intuition is, that image relevant in terms of time (which it is if the user has taken higher than average number of images on a day). For location, I'm doing a similar thing, calculating the importance of a location, by number of times the particular location is observed / total number of locations . This I'm doing for all the elements in the array. Now how do I combine these numbers to get one representative number? Is there a different formula I should be using? Finally, assuming that we have a vector of time and location, is euclidean distance a better representation than hamming distance? Any help with the thinking will be highly appreciated.
