SSRS question on calculating dates from a grouped field

I have a SSRS field called dates. I calculated the difference between the last and beginning date using the following code: =Code.MinutesToHoursMinutes(DateDiff("n",FIRST(Fields!Date.Value), LAST(Fields!Date.Value, "grp_Order"))) The Code.MinutesToHoursMinutes is jsut a function that makes it Hours Minutes format. How do I now average all of these?????
