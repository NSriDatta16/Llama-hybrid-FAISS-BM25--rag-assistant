To answer your question, try something similar to: my $f=\$b; $b="foo"; print $$f; But I do see some issues: if ($font=="arialb") {$font1 = '$arialb'} you shouldn't be doing string comparisons with ==. You should use the eq operator. Try this code: $f="sf"; $b="fs"; if($f==$b){ print "whoops"; } Also, where is $font1 declared? If it's declared inside the scope of that if statement, you won't be able to see that variable outside of that scope. I recommend that you use the pragma use strict; see http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/lib/strict.html
