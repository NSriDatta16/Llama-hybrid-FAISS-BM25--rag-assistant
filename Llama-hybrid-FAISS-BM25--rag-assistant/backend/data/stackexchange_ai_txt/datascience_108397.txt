That dataset might be too small for machine learning. You will not be able to do a train/test split. If you still choose to try machine learning, choose a model that has very few parameters. Two options are: Linear Regression - Fit only an intercept and two coefficients (one for each feature) at most. Do not add any interaction or polynomial coefficients. Decision Tree Regression - Fit a model with a very small max_depth . For example, a decision stump has a max_depth of 1, aka a single split.
