Based on the data I have, what is the most correct way to calculate variance?

I am currently extracting (scraping) data from a web page , the conclusive data I receive comes from a time serie but I don't have access to the data inside it, so I don't really know the weight of the variables (outputs) I get, but I have some important data. Minimum Price , example 5.00 Maximum Price , example 12.00 Average Price , example 11.00 Current Price , example 9.50 Is there a way I can have a good approximation of the variance or standard deviation? I'm programming in Python but I'm ok with a mathematical solution
