Clickable Areas The widget library would let you make parts of your buffer into buttons (also radio boxes, check boxes, lists), which will execute elisp when you click them. For example: (require 'widget) (defun simple-widget-example () (interactive) (switch-to-buffer "*Simple widget example*") (let ((inhibit-read-only t)) (erase-buffer)) (let ((all (overlay-lists))) ;; Delete all the overlays. (mapcar 'delete-overlay (car all)) (mapcar 'delete-overlay (cdr all))) (widget-insert "Sample button\n") (widget-create 'push-button :notify (lambda (&rest ignore) (message "Poop! Ha Ha!")) "Press Me") (use-local-map widget-keymap) (widget-setup)) See Emacs Widget Library
