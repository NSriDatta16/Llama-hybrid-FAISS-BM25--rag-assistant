How to translate product name and info in Magento

Magento provide translation feature, a nice one for e-commerce platform. But it seems to me that the translation is only for the predefined magento keyword, like 'add to cart', 'add to wishlist' etc and not for the product name, info, and description that the user input to the store. Does anybody know how to implement this?? Any help would be much appreciated Thanks! :)
