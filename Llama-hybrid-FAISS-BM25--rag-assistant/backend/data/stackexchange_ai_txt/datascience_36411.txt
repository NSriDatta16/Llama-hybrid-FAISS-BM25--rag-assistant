You do not want to remove all correlated variables. It is only when the correlation is so strong that they do not convey extra information. This is both a function of the strength of correlation, how much data you have and whether any small difference between correlated variables tell you something about the outcome, after all. The first two you can tell before you do any model, the final one not. So, it may be very reasonable to remove variables based on the combination of the first two considerations (i.e. even if the extra variables may in principle contain some useful information, you would not be able to tell given the strength of correlation and how much data you have) before you do any modelling/feature engineering. The final point can really only be assessed after doing some modelling.
