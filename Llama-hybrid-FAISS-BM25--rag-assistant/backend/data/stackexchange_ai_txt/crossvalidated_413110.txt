Encoding IP Address as a Predictor in Machine Learning

Is there some approach to "encoding" IP Address (IPv4) in a way that the new representation can capture both cardinality and the statistical distribution of the full range of IP address and also aspects like belonging to the same network. I think that converting to an integer (two-way) or hashing dont capture the aspects aforementioned. I know that using vector-representation could be an alternative but I would like to know if there is another.
