If the hens were assigned the treatment at random, and then chosen for slaughter at random, then you can think of any three slaughtered hens as a random sample from a notional population of hens treated at time $t$ and observed at some $t+n$. However, @Nick Sabbe is right that if there are herd effects, then these may confound your treatment effect. With only one group per treatment, if there are herd effects, you will have a hard time knowing whether group differences are really due to treatment. I would consider analyzing the data as follows, assuming that your outcome can be fit into a linear model directly or through some link function. $$ \begin{align} &\text{Outcome}_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}t + \beta_{2j}t^2 + \beta_{3j}t^3 + \ldots + \varepsilon_i\\ &\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\ &\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + u_{1j} \\ &\beta_{2j} = \gamma_{20} + u_{2j} \\ &\beta_{3j} = \gamma_{30} + u_{3j} \\ &\ldots \end{align} $$ Where $i$ indices a particular bird, and $j$ a treatment group, $\gamma$'s describe the development of the a bird with an "average" treatment, and the $u$'s are treatment group specific deviations (either due to shared treatment or some other group property like a herd effect). You can represent the $u$'s as a random effect or as dummy variables. If you use dummy variables you can choose another contrast baseline besides the "average" treatment. Orthogonal polynomials would make your results easier to interpret.
