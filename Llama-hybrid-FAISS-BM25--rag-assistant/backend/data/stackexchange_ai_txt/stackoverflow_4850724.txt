The problem was in result type="stream" and also in filename attribute value of "Content-disposition" header. For FF I've used ISO-8859-1, for IE6-8 I've used url-encoding. I've used user-agent header to determine browser. My solution has only one issue, but for me it's acceptabe: IE8 replaces whitespaces in file names with underscores. For example "my fav image.png" will be "my_fav_image.png" is IE8. FF does undestand default encoding for HTTP and doesn't try to corrupt filename attribute value. You can find additional info here, on StackOverflow.
