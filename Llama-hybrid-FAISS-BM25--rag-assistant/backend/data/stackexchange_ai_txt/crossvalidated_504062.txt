misclassified data in SVM

In soft margin SVM with Gaussian kernel , How will the decision boundary change, if $ \sigma $ is increased? I means what will be happened in this case. i.e: $(1)$ Dose the number of misclassified data increase? $(2)$ How about $C$ ? If $C$ is increased, Dose the number of misclassified data increase? In my opinion, When $ \sigma $ is increased, the number of misclassified data will be increased.
