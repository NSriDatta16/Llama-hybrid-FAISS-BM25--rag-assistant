Checking the user-agent will alert you to the honest bots, but not the spammers. To tell which requests are made by dishonest bots, your best bet ( based on this guy's interesting study ) is to catch a Javascript focus event . If the focus event fires, the page was almost certainly loaded by a human being. Edit: it's true, people with Javascript turned off will not show up as humans, but that's not a large percentage of web users . Edit2: Current bots can also execute Javascript, at least Google can .
