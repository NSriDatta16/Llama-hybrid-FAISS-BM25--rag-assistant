The way I understand the spaces module is this: It provides a way for the features module (and your "features" created from this) to integrate with and be available within defined areas of your site. Out of the box this includes: Organic Groups, Taxonomy, and Users. There is an API to define more "spaces" than this. So for example you could create a "feature" (with the features module) of an image gallery. Using spaces with organic groups, you would be able to have each group have the ability to enable and disable this feature and it would only be available within that "space" (group in this case). From the organic groups page: Groups get their own theme, language, taxonomy, and so on. Integrates well and depends upon Views module So in your situation, you could think of spaces as a way to make organic groups more flexible. As NoParrots said, OpenAtrium ( http://openatrium.com/ ) relies on the features/spaces/context modules heavily, so that might be a good place to review how these modules work together. EDIT: I found a great video that might explain things more clearly: http://www.archive.org/details/TheHeartOfOpenAtriumContextPurlAndSpaces_782 . Around 16:00 he starts talking about PURL. From this page (below the video) there is also an explaination of PURL/Context/Spaces which I think is pretty good: Context is a module for triggering reactive behaviors within a page load. Controlling block visibility, menu trails, page classes, and page template layouts are examples of things that fall into its jurisdiction. PURL is a library for capturing and abstracting request handling that goes beyond what the Drupal core menu system provides ($_GET['q']). Detection of request components, like subdomain, path prefix, user agent, or file extension, and sustaining their presence is its primary role. Spaces is a generalized configuration override framework. In theory it allows you to "customize everything, for anything." In practice it allows things like custom group colors and features, per-user dashboards, and multisite-like usage of a single Drupal install.
