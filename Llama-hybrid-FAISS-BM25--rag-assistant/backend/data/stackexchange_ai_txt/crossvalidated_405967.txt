Determine clusters for the encodings of a Siamese Neural Network

I implemented a Siamese Neural Network that encodes images of different objects and outputs "coordinates" for each image in a lower dimension. My goal is to measure how good the network is clustering the images. If I visualize the coordinates in two to three dimensions (by applying PCA) I can clearly see that images of the same object are close to each other. The algorithm works well enough. Therefore, I am defining the clusters based on the ground truth labels, which is obviously not the best approach. So my question is how should I determine the real clusters and also what would be the best measure to determine how "good" those clusters are? I thought about running a clustering algorithm (such as k-Means) on top of the encoding and then use an external validation metric such as the F-Score to measure the goodness of the overall model.
