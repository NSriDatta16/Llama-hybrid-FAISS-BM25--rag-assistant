disableSelection is your friend here. .disableSelection() is an undocumented (for now) core utility. It's useful for making text elements, or elements that contain text, not text-selectable. For example, if you have a draggable element, you may not want text selection to occur when the user goes to drag the element. You may want to create a helper so it looks obvious that something is being dragged. Updated demo
