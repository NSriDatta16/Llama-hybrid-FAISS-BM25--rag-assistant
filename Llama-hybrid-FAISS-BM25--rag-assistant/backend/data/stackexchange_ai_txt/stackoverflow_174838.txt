A quick note on how to handle tags: Tagging systems can vary from very rigidly defined tags, where creating new ones require explicit extra work (think gmail labels) to very loose systems where adding as many tags as possible is encouraged (think flickr, or tagging audio content where a transcription may be applied directly as tags). In general, an easily-indexable media (text!) should have a more rigid system, since the content is already searchable. Additional tags exist more for categorization only, and categorization is only helpful when different users are broadly assigning things into the same categories. If you have raw text, it should take nearly an act of God to create a new tag. On the other hand, media that's more difficult to index (images, video, audio) should have a flexible system that encourages many tags, since they and other metadata are your only hope when searching. This is important because the database schema you want could change somewhat depending on which end of that spectrum you find yourself.
