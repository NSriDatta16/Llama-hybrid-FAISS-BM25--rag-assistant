Exposing a C++ API to Python

I'm currently working on a project were I had to wrap the C++ classes with Python to be able to script the program. So my specific experience also involved embedding the Python interpreter in our program. The alternatives I tried were: Boost.Python I liked the cleaner API produced by Boost.Python, but the fact that it would have required that users install an additional dependency made us switch to SWIG. SWIG SWIG's main advantage for us was that it doesn't require end users to install it to use the final program. What have you used to do this, and what has been your experience with it?
