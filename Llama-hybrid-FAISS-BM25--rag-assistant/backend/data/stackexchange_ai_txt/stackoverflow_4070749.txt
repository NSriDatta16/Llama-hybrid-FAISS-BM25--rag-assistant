Sortable w/ Selectable Text

Is it possible to be able to have sortable elements, but still allow users to copy/paste the text inside the elements? Foo Bar other stuff that i don't care if a user can't copy (maybe images or buttoms) I can easily do: $('.sortable').sortable({cancel: '.pseudo-sortable'}); This will allow me to select the text in the browser and copy/paste if I want. However, this also makes it so that the person can't drag/drop. So I think what I'd like is to start off with the cancel but if the mouse goes a certain distance outside the container, then the pseudo-sortables are no longer canceled. Does that make sense? If this is not possible my last option would be to apply a trigger that switches containers between sortable and non-sortable, so that they can select the text, but I'd prefer to minimize ui clicks.
