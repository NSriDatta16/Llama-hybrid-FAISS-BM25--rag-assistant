It's wrong because the default behaviour of Excel is highly prominent gridlines, which are distracting and "chartjunky", and it violates the formatting rules for the journal. Journals often have lowest common denominator formatting rules. They're there so that it's harder to screw things up, not because it's the best way to do things. I remember it was only a few years ago that new APA submission format had to have indented paragraphs for each reference when the prior version was hanging paragraphs because people couldn't figure out their new fangled word processors. The prior version of APA was written for people with typewriters. The rule was in place not because indented paragraphs for each reference was better but because it was more likely all the submissions would look the same. In short, don't try to derive best principles for graphs from rules for submission to journals. They're a combination of journal consistency, graph quality, and what they can most easily get submitters to consistently do.
