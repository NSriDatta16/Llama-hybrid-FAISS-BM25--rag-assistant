Why is pruning not needed for random forest trees?

Breiman says that the trees are grown with out pruning. Why? I mean to say that there must be a solid reason why the trees in random forest are not pruned. On the other hand it is considered very important to prune a single decision tree to avoid over fitting. Is there some literature available to read for this reason? Of course the trees may not be correlated but there still will be a possibility of over fitting.
