What you are describing is called, "Episodic Learning". Look for Monte Carlo and/or TD Lambda methods. Opinion: Trying to train an RL agent to actually profit and not break your bank will be rough. My understanding is that the market moves more based on qualitative data than quantitative. Currently, there are no models that understand the context of what is being discussed enough to accurately use to feed rewards. GPT-3 has high hopes for many people though I'm skeptical. It's quite naive to think one can just jump in RL to apply to a research problem with no prior experience. I recommend attempting CartPole then LunarLander with the ALE (Atari Learning Environment) while learning the fundamentals via Sutton (book) and/or watching David Silver lectures.
