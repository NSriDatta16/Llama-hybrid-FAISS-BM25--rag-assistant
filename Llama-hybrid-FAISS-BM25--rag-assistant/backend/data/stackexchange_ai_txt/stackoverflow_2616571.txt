Howto convert to string and read data from TCP packet

I used sharppcap to capture TCP packets. Now i wanna reconstruct HTTP packet from TCP packets but i don't know how. I read somewhere i can find start of HTTP packet in TCP data... i tried to convert byte[] TCP data to string using this code: string s = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(tcp_pack.Data); but the string isn't readable. like a binary file that is opened with notepad. is it because the data is encrypted or code is incorrect? how can i reconstruct HTTP packet from TCP packets?
