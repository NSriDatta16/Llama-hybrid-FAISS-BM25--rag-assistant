The best learning route into Object Oriented Programming from C?

What is the best route to go for learning OOP if one has done some programming in C. My intention was first to take the natural leap and "increment with one" and go for Stroustrup. But since I got my hands on the little old Bertrand Meyer's OOSC2 and I qoute from the appendix page 1135 "..according to Donald Knuth, it would make Edsger Dijkstra 'physically ill to think of programming in C++" And Meyer himself "..that C++ is not the ideal OOP language..." And what about this A critiqe on C++ on this question: A critique of C++ Should I skip C++ and go for C# and or Java directly if my intention is a great and deep understanding of a modern OOP-language, or do I miss good points on this subject in C++? Well I know this is a discussion-thing but I mark it wiki and you're answers could mean a lot for me in choices to come.
