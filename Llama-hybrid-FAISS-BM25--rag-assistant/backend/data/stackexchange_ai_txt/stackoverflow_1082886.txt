indent XML text with Transformer

I'm writing an XML file with the following code: Source source = new DOMSource(rootElement); Result result = new StreamResult(xmlFile); Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes"); transformer.transform(source, result); and this is the output file: 0 274.0 316.0 ... I want this file to be indented, for example: 0 274.0 316.0 ... the call to setOutputProperty in my code doesn't solve the problem, it actually makes the text with new lines (but not indented). anyone has a solution to this, without the need of external libraries?
