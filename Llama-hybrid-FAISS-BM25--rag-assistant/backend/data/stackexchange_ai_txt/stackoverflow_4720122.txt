iPhone animation based on input values (touches) not time

For an animation effect perfectly suited to an animation group approach as shown in Brad Larson's answer here , I need the animation to proceed according to inputs. Specifically touch and position of detected touches. It is easy to handle touchesMoved: and to set the position of the elements for every touch but it just isn't smooth like the core animation approach. Imagine a marble in a grooved track. I want to push the marble along to any position at any speed in one direction or the other. The animation has to do something like that, moving a visual element along a path in response to touches. CAKeyframeAnimation has the path bit exactly but seems to always want to base the transition from frame to frame on time elapsed, not on any other factor, and in one direction. 31 January update - Thanks all for the responses so far however none is really solving the problem. I have a circular menu that is dragged to select an option. All of it needs to move together and I have worked around it by using an view that has a rotational transform applied and the inverse rotational transform applied to its subviews so the icons all rotate with appropriate ferris wheel orientation. It really looks better when the icons are animated along a slightly ovoid path though... the marble description is an attempt to make clear what I'm trying to do. Better perhaps to imagine magnets oriented to repel all travelling in a groove - move one and its neighbours move too but not necessarily in the direction that the dragged magnet moves as the path curves. Right now the problem is one of following a simple path created with one circle but I'd really like to know how to animate objects along an arbitrary path, position controlled purely by touch with no calculations involving velocity or direction.
