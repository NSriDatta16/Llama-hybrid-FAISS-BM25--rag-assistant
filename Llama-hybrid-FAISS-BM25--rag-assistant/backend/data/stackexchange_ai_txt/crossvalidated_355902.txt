Advice on choosing a likelihood distribution for data in logaritmic units

I have a Bayesian model to fit a set of parameters given some observables (flux from astronomical objects). Since many users will prefer to define the priors using logarithmic units and I could remove some exponentials I decided to write the mathematical model in log scale. My issue arrived while defining the likelihood: I decided on a normal distribution since it represents the physics well in which the $\mu=\log(y_{\text{model}})$. My issue lies in defining the $\sigma$ for this distribution for which I wanted to use the observational uncertainty. To start $\log \sigma_{\text{obs}}$ is negative in my case so it cannot be applied to define the normal distribution sigma. If I take the absolute value the likelihood is actually so wide the model is poorly fitted since basically all proposal values are accepted. I wonder if anyone could point out the error in my logic or advice me which distribution I should be using to define a likelihood for data where $\log y_{\text{obs}} UPDATE: If I were in linear scale I would generate a normal distribution with $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$, however I have $\log \mu
