How can I manipulate a RagDoll made with farseer physics in Silverlight?

I made a ragdoll similar to the one in this demo . This rag doll will be used for a turn based rpg game where the physics will be used for animations such as character taking damage, dying, falling down, etc. What I am pondering at the moment is as how should go about this, should I stick the rag doll by the head to the background (leaving the body dangling) and basically throw around its body parts around as to simulate punching etc (as shown in Fig 1), or stiffen the joints and statically rotate and move the body parts for the actions taken(as shown in Fig 2), and when it comes to the character dying(or a similar action) just loosen the joints and let the rag doll fall down. Or is there a better way to go about doing this? I am new to farseer physics and don't even know if what I mentioned is even possible or overwhelmingly hard to do.
