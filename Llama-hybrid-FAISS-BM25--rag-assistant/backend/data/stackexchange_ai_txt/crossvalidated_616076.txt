Using ML for simple rule based to obtain likelihood

Let's say I already have a simple rule which provides me the variables that help determine the output label and relationship between variables and label is rather simple and deterministic one, can I still go ahead and build ML model for the below reasons? a) Automation b) Rank the outcomes based on their probability outcome than have a binary yes or no based on rule based system? What do you think? Is it worthwhile do use simple random forest algorithm to do the above task? Our users want the likelihood than a hard yes or no. Every user has different opinion on how to rank them. And it would be close to impossible to bring the users to a conclusion on how to rank them based on their busy schedule. So, as a objective measure, can't we use ML to get probabilistic predictions though the label is generated using simple rule-based system?
