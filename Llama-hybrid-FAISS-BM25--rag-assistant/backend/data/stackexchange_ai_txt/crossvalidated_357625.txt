centering in mixed effect logistic regression

I am working with a mixed-effect logistic regression with two independents (a and b, dummy coded 0 or 1), which have a fixed effect for a, b and the paired interaction as well as a random effect of M on these three effects: glmer(dep ~ a+b+a:b + (1 +a+b+a:b |M), data = df, family = binomial) I found that the random effect of for the a:b interaction is strongly correlated (~.8) with both a and b random slope effects. But - when changing the coding for the independents (say -.5 to .5 instead of 0 and 1) these correlations are reduced dramatically. Why is this happening? Anyone knows? What will be the correct way to center in a mixed effect regression? Reduce the mean for each score relative to the total mean of the whole data or the mean for the random effect condition (in my case - each level of M)? My guess is the later - but not sure... Thank you! Nitzan.
