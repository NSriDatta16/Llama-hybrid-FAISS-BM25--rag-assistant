Why are you storing the users history in the database? Wouldn't a breadcrumb be more of where the user has been? In that case you'd probably want to store the page each time a user navigates to it, dropping off the first item when you have reached your maximum length. the issue then becomes one of where to store that history and yeah a database may be an option. You might also want to store that with the users session data if available. there are stacks of ways to implement storage of history. EDIT This is added info to what mjv said.
