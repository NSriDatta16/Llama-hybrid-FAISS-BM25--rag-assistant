This type of problem is typically referred to in econometrics and marketing research as a "choice modeling" problem. Texts dealing with such problems include: Louviere, J., D. A. Hensher, et al. (2000). Stated Choice Methods: Analysis and Application. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. Train, K. E. (2009). Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. Rossi, P. E., G. M. Allenby, et al. (2005). Bayesian Statistics and Marketing, Wiley. The simplest practical model you could estimate would be a binary logit model with the dependent variable indicating when an object is purchased versus when it is not purchased, with two independent variables: a categorical variable for merchant and a categorical variable for product. (Or, if you do not know anything about when a product is not purchased, you could use Poisson regression or some other counts model.) The parameter estimate for each merchant would be their skill score and the parameter for each product would be the "attractiveness score". The "attractiveness" score is more commonly referred to as a "utility" in choice modeling. A practical computational problem you will experience is that unless you have only a few hundred merchants and few hundred categorical variables you will struggle to estimate the model and may need a "random effects" model (sometimes referred to as a "hierarchical model" in this context). In addition to the assumption that you mention, a key set of assumptions that will determine the validity of your analysis will relate to which alternatives are available at a given time. For example, a product that is intrinsically unattractive may be purchased regularly because the more attractive products are not available at the purchase time. This effect can have a very large impact upon your resulting estimates, as when it is ignored you inadvertently will confound the attractiveness of a product with its availability. The texts cited earlier discuss various modifications of choice models to deal with many of the types of assumptions likely relevant to your problem.
