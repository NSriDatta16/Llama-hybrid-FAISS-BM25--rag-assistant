You might want to look at some of the newer projects and updates that SpringSource is working on. Spring 3.0 (Key new features are RESTful support on top of MVC, and new expression language) Spring dm Server (OSGi-based server) Spring tc Server (preconfigured tomcat) Spring AMS (centralised management and monitoring of assets) Spring Security (Now supports expression language which makes for much richer declarative security demarcations) Spring Integration (Implements a number of the patterns from Enterprise Integration Patterns: gateways, splitters, aggregators, transformers, etc..) Grails Just announced at SpringOne: Roo - a build assistant with command-line options similar to grails for creating domain classes, controllers, and views, but for vanilla java instead of groovy. SpringSource Tool Suite is now free!
