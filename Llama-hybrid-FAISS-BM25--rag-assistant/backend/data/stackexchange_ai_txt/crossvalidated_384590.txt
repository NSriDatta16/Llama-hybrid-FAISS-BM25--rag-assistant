Prerequisites for Wasserstein GAN/Autoencoder

Can someone who read WGAN/WAE papers and understood Wasserstein part, could you share how you prepared necessary Optimal Transport background? The mentioned papers seem little tough if you don't have an intuition on Wasserstein metric/optimal transport theory. The papers mostly cite some books on optimal transport - I don't think I'd be able to go through a whole book, but I wasn't able to find accessible tutorials on the topic. Alternatively, could anyone narrow the specific topics that are needed to understand these papers? I've seen that they use Kantorovich duality - can one read Villani's book mostly concentrating on that? Would it be sufficient to understand the papers?
