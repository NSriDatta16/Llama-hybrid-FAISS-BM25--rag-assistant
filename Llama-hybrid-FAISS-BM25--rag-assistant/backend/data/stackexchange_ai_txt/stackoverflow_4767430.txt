XPath axis, get all following nodes until

I have the following example of HTML: Foo bar lorem ipsum etc Bar baz dum dum dum poopfiddles I'm looking to extract all paragraphs following the 'Foo bar' header, until I reach the 'Bar baz' header (the text for the 'Bar baz' header is unknown, so unfortunately I can't use the answer provided by bougyman). Now I can of course using something like //h2[text()='Foo bar']/following::p but that of course will grab all paragraphs following this header. So I have the option to traverse the nodeset and push paragraphs into an Array until the text matches that of the next following header, but let's be honest, that's never as cool as being able to do it in XPath. Is there a way to do this that I'm missing?
