Mean squared error (MSE) prediction performance: Ridge vs Lasso?

It says that the ridge will outperform lasso in terms of prediction performance when the prediction metric is MSE, according to the answer to this post below: If only prediction is of interest, why use lasso over ridge? But why is that? Is there any somehow reasonable proof under certain assumptions? Or counterexamples? Update after answers from @EdM Here is a paper in 1995, Better subset regression using the nonnegative garrote , wherein the paragraph four mentions that the ridge regression gives more accurate predictions than subset regressions unless all but a few of the coefficients in linear regression are nearly zero and the rest are large.
