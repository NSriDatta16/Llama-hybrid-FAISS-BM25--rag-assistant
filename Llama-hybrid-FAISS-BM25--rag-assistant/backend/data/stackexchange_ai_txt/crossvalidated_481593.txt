Transforming a minimization problem to a maximization problem

I have an objective to minimize the transmission delay (D) and energy cost (E) for a wireless network device. While I am solving it using reinforcement learning (Q-Learning to be exact), hence I have to solve it to find the maximum for the value function. Hence (simplistically) if my Cost is $C(t) = T(t) + D(t)$ and I have to find $\min \gamma ^t C(t)$ , is this mathematically equivalent to the following? $$\max \gamma^t \frac{1}{C(t)}$$ Does it means if I solve for the above expressions, I practically solved the $\min \gamma^tC(t)$ problem?
