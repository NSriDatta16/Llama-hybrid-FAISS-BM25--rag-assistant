In an IDE the order of the methods seems to matter much less to me. I don't read the whole source, rather I proceed like this: read a method, spot an interesting function call, ask IDE to open declaration of that function (which may well be in a different source). Or find an interesting function, wonder where it's used, ask the IDE to list the references. The IDE usually displays a summary list of the methods in a class, and sorts it and filters it in various ways, so once again the end-to-end read is not needed. The one thing I do want is a "what's this class for" understanding. There's two things that help with that: Programming to Interfaces - and good class documentation. So I would encourage clearly documented responsibilities for the class, often expressed in terms of specific Interfaces. The order of methods in the source is less important to me.
