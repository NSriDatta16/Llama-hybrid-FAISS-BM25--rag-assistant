Neural Network Negative-Weight Meaning

hello so this should be a simple question i have a feed-forward neural network i got 10 neurons in a single hidden layer i obtained it's weights now there are some weights positive at values up to 1.1 and values at negative of down to -1.3 and values super small in both negative and positive side of like 0.00000something so i understand basic concept bigger weights more influence. the question is what does the negative represent so like is -1.3 higher influence than a positive +1.1? and i should ignore the signs completely ? or are they Negative
