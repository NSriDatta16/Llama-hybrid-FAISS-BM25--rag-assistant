Your particular example suffers from at least one problem: servlet/JSP engines won't know or care about your subclass. They'll only deal with HttpServletRequest. I suppose you can wrap it and cast it, but I'd hardly call that "elegant". You don't even cite another possibility: composition. You can have a class that's non-static that takes an HttpServletRequest as a ctor argument and defers to it as implementation of the ServletRequest methods. You add in the additional getBody call to perform your specialized behavior. Maybe reading this will help. There are other SO questions about preferring composition over inheritance. See what you think of those. I would go with the helper class for this particular example as well, but god forbid a Singleton. It's not really necessary or desirable. This example feels especially awkward. Is this really what you want to do?
