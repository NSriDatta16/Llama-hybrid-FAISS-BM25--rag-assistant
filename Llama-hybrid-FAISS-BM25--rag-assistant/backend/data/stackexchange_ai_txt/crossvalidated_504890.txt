So I think I know enough about the question to compile all the comments to a single answer. As far as I know, there is no known effect such as "as the numbers of fold increase CV scores decrease." You usually would observe @DikranMarsupial suggested, "would expect if anything the accuracy to go up as the size of the training set becomes larger." And yes, as you increase the number of folds, your training size increases because you are dividing your data into smaller pieces. But it is also possible there is a saturation point, meaning performance does not improve after some threshold even if you add more data. Also, I agree with @whuber; there is no evident trend in your plot. If you try my previous suggestion and take the mean of all the simulations and plot them, I believe you will see that curve is smooth and no evidence of a trend. Edit: Then it is certain your plot is by chance. Since your data is shuffled, the order of your folds does not mean anything. You can change the order you plot the results as you wish, but you shouldn't make any conclusions based on line plots. The only thing you need to consider is the distribution of your scores. Your scores seem like they have a mean around 0.84 and vary around above the 0.80 threshold, and this is the only conclusion you should make from here. The concept of "Trend" in stats. means: a long/short term movement in an ordered series, for instance, a time series. Your scores are not an ordered series, so the trend is irrelevant.
