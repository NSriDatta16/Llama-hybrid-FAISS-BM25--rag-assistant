Magento staging and production

I have been developing with magento for a while now and things are starting to make sense and become much more deliberate and organised. One aspect though still seems quite messy - moving a site from development to production. Can anyone offer some good processes for this - up to now I have simply been exporting/importing the the development database, copying source files over, clearing out test orders, customers etc then changing base urls, htaccess files etc. It all seems a bit messy and error prone. Do any of the more experienced Magento developers have a good process in place for this task that they could share.
