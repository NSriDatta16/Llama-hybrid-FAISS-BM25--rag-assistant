Various cache-related things can cause the request not to be made, in particular when you merely press the "go" button, so you should check your cache-headers. If caching is the issue, you can do something like: //ask browser to revalidate: context.Response.Cache.SetRevalidation(HttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches); //and hint that the page is outdated anyhow... context.Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(TimeSpan.Zero); Which should convince a browser to really get a new version every pageview. You could, for instance, set these variables in the Page_Load itself ;-). If you're not using https, then the following are risk-free too: //prevents plugin based file-open in IE+https, otherwise fine: context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); context.Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); I'll bet this solves it - and if not, I second Jeremy Steins suggestion that you use fiddler to verify that the request is really being made at all (and since you're a web-dev, get fiddler in any case, it's a handy tool to have available, and works for all browsers!). Finally - can you tell whether any other code on the page runs when you click go? (i.e. is the entire page not running, or just Page_Load - the latter would suggest an event wire up error, which would be odd considering your load handler does sometimes fire).
