Is it silly to use describe an event as "Bayesian" when not dealing with statistic per se?

For example, say it is rare that your roommate eats cereal, however, one day you see an empty bowl with milk stain and later in the day you saw some cereal crumbs. You now conclude that most likely your roommate ate cereal. But the question is can you now say well its "bayesian-like" given the new observations?
