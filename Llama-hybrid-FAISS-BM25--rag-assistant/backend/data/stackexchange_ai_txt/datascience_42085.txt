I'm not sure about what's your question exactly. If you are interested in the model architecture time series are the typical example for using RNNs (recurrent neural networks) or some more advanced form of them i.e. LSTM or GRU. They are all implemented in keras ( https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/ ). You may also can experiment with CNNs (convolutional neural networks). Usually they are used for images but in certain cases they can even outperform RNNs. They are also implemented in keras. ( https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/ )
