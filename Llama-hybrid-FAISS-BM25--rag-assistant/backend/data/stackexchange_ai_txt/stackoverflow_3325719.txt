Python: Accessing Values For Dict Key Made Using Variables

Hi I've been coding a console version of Minesweeper just to learn some of the basics of Python. It uses a coordinate system that is recorded in a dictionary. Now, I have been able to implement it successfully but accessing or assigning a value to a specific coordinate key using variables for the "x,y" of the coordinate seems... clunky. There are two different ways that I've come up with but they don't seem very elegant when I have to use them so often. for i in range(1, ROWS+1): for j in range(1, COLS+1): mine_field["%i,%i" % (i,j)] = 0 or for i in range(1, ROWS+1): for j in range(1, COLS+1): mine_field[",".join([i, j])] = 0 It works well enough but it does start to look messy when assigning or swapping values. Is there a better way that this can be done? Thanks in advance.
