Beyond what @Jason S said, I'd also encourage you to think about the readability of the code. For instance, if you are only writing to a reference once, it would make your intent more clear to use something like: String str = "write once"; while(condition){ //do stuff with str } Versus: String str = null; while(condition){ str = "write once"; //do stuff with str } Likewise, if the value of the string is really based off something that is specific to an iteration of the loop, declare the variable inside the loop.
