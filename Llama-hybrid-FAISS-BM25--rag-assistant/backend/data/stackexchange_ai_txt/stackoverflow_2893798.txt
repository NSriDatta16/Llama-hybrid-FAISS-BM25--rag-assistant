For generally starting out with pthreads, this is a good website with possibly more info than you need (but I like detail). It runs through a lot of the basics for pthreads and more. If you prefer a dead-tree tutorial, this book is pretty good and gives you a good grounding in most of the features of the Linux API, or the core libraries, if you want to call it that. This stackoverflow question deals with mutexes vs semaphores pretty concisely. Finally, I like this site for its converage of Linux Threading and Synchronisation. Hopefully these give you some reading material. Work out how you handle threads, then how you synchronise them, then attack your problem.
