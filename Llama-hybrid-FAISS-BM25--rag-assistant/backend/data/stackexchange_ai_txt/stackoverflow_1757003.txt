is it possible, that i ran out of memory? How much memory is your program using when std::bad_alloc is thrown? What is the value of mesh->numSurfacePoints when it crashes? Are you absolutely sure that the pointer passed in as mesh is a valid pointer? If you have a very fragmented address space, there might not be enough contiguous space to allocate a large array. How long does your program run before std::bad_alloc is thrown? If you aren't already, you should consider using boost::scoped_array or some other form of smart pointer for arrays so that deletion occurs automatically when heap-allocated objects are no longer needed.
