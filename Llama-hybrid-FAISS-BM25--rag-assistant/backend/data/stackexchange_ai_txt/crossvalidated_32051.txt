One way to deal with this would be to suppose that every city has a distribution with the same variance $σ^2$ for the individual responses. Then each city's average measurement $X_i$ for the predictor would have variance $σ^2/n_i$, where $n_i$ is the number of individuals in the average for city $i$. That would be a simple way to deal with the heteroskedasticity. I don't know any special name for this form of the regression problem.
