What is the most concise way to handle this Is Nothing/Empty String check?

What is the best way to checkt o see if the TelephoneNumber property has some string in it that does not Trim down to an empty string? I hate to use the Trim VB.NET function on Nothing just to give me an empty string whenever the TelephoneNumber is Nothing. Public Class TelephoneNumberType Public Property TelephoneNumber() As String End Class Public Class Form1 Private _PhoneObj As BusinessObjects.TelephoneNumberType Public Sub MySub If _PhoneObj IsNot Nothing AndAlso _ _PhoneObj.TelephoneNumber isNot Nothing AndAlso _ _PhoneObj.TelephoneNumber.Trim <> String.Empty Then MessageBox.Show("I have a non blank phone!") End If End Sub End Class Edit: Check out the accepted answer and then call it as follows If _PhoneObj IsNot Nothing AndAlso _ _PhoneObj.TelephoneNumber.IsNullOrEmpty Then MessageBox.Show("I have a non blank phone!") End If What puzzles me is that the "IsNullOrEmpty" function works as an extension method of a string instance even if the String is NOTHING. Why does this extension method work but the follow straight - .NET code raise an exception? Dim s as string If s.trim() = "" Then Message.Box.Show("This will never print") End If
