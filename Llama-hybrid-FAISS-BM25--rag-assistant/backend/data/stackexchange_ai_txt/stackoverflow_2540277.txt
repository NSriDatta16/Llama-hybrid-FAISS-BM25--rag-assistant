jQuery counter to count up to a target number

I'm trying to find out if anyone knows about an already existing jQuery plugin that will count up to a target number at a specified speed. For example, take a look at Google's number of MB of free storage on the Gmail homepage , under the heading that reads "Lots of space". It has a starting number in a tag, and slowly counts upward every second. I'm looking for something similar, but I'd like to be able to specify: The start number The end number The amount of time it should take to get from start to end. A custom callback function that can execute when a counter is finished.
