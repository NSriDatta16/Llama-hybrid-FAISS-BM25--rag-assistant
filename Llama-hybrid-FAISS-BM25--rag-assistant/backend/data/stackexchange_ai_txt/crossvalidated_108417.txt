How to perform proper data mining on time-series data?

I have some daily data from city A, B, C. Values from city A are highly correlated with values from other cities for lag -1,-2,-3 and -4. I want to use Random Forest, SVM and ANN to predict values for city A. My idea is: Split data into training and testing set. Use the formula: valueA ~ valueB-1 + valueB-2 + valueB-3 + valueB-4 + valueC-1 + valueC-2 + valueC-3 + valueC-4 Try different methods (Random Forest, SVM and ANN) on training set and use createTimeSlices to cross-validation for model training and parameter tuning, like in this example - https://stackoverflow.com/a/22338029/2602477 Evaluate obtained model on the testing set (using R2, RMSE, etc.) My questions are: How to properly split data into training and testing set? I'm not sure, but boostraping or k-fold cross-validation doesn't sound right. Are given formula is correct for this case?
