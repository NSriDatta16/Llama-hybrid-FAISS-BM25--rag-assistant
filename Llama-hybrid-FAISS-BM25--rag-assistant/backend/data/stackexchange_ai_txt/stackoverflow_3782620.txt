If you are going to be repeatedly inserting HTML (such as through a loop) then I'd use a jQuery templating plug-in. I prefer the one that Microsoft made from John Resig's original design. It gets the job done. Read about it here . It works like this... Define a template in the section of your page. ${headerText} ${someText} Click Me Here some test data: var testData = { headerText: 'Hello World', someText: 'A long random paragraph about nothing, or Lorem Ipsum.. yadayaya', href: 'http://www.stackoverflow.com/' } Then you can use the template anytime and as much as you want: $('#myTemplate').tmpl(testData).appendTo('body'); Results in: Hello World A long random paragraph about nothing, or Lorem Ipsum.. yadayaya Click Me You can create as complex structures as you want. It's very easy to read and maintain. Enjoy :) Then you can use this repeatedly.
