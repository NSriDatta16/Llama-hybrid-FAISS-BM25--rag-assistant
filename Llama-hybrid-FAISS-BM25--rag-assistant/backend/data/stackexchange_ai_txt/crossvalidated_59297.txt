Determine sample size without knowing standard deviation

I want to calculate the required sample size for a call centre with a finite population. The survey will collect data on many variables. The objective is to gain data about a range of psychological aspects as well as durations, agent performance, call resolution etc. Therefore I cannot choose a sample size and calculate the standard deviation with a pilot, because I wouldn't know what to base the deviation on. I have read that an industry standard deviation can be used, however I have no such info. So if I cannot calculate it using a pilot, do not know the industry st.d should I guess the standard deviation in order to calculate the sample size? If so, how can I make an educated guess? Could I instead calculate the sample size using proportions? as described in ( http://www.polarismr.com/research-lifeline/sample-size-calculator/ ) In this link ( http://www.surveysystem.com/sample-size-formula.htm ) there is a formula for calculating it ignoring the standard deviation. Is this recommendable? I am very grateful for replies. Please keep in mind that I am new to statistics and I might have overseen some important info above.
