Best algorithm for Feature Selection in classification use case

I am implementing some machine learning algorithms on a large data set (90K rows) with 274 different variables. I have to carry out Logistic Regression and Random Forest for this data set. meanwhile, I want to carry out feature selection to reduce the number of those variables drastically. What would be an effective feature selection algorithm (in R) for classification use case? Thanks, Aman
