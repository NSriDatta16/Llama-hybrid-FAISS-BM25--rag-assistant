If you are able to change your guid generation to a sequential guid generation easily then that is probably your quick win option. The sequential guid will stop the fragmentation on the table whilst remaining as your clustered index. The major downside with a sequential guid though is that they then become guessable which is often not desired and the reason guids are used in the first place. If you go down the Identity route for your clustered primary key and then just an index on your guid column then you will still get a lot of fragmentation on your guid index. However the fact that the table will no longer get fragmented will be a massive gain. Finally though, I know you said you can't do this for now, but, if you don't NEED to use guids as an index at all then you remove all of these problems.
