I don't think any ready made algorithm exists, so unfortunately you need to come up with something yourself. Because the problem is not really well defined (from mathematical perspective) it will require testing on some "real" data that would be reasonably representative, and a fair bit of tweaking. I would start from dividing your shifts into weekdays (because if I understand correctly you are after a weekly view) - so for each weekday we have shifts that happen to be on that day. Then for each day I would group the shifts that happen at the same time (or "roughly" at the same time - here you need to come up with some heuristic, i.e. both start and end times do not deviate from average in the group by more than 15min or 30 mins). Now we need another heuristic to decide if this group is relevant, i.e. if a shift 1pm-3pm on a Monday happened only once it is probably not relevant, but if it happened on at least 70% of Mondays covered by the data then it is relevant. And now your relevant groups for each day of the week will form the schedule you are after.
