jQuery Nested Sortable - Move LI elements within all available UL's

I have the following code which works although it runs quite slowly I feel. What I want to do is allow 's to be moved freely under existing 's or move them up a level. I also want to be able to create hierarchies so if you dragged a under another that would create a hierarchy. I think in that sense I would have to render a under each just in case. I only want to limit it to 2 or 3 levels deep. $("#sort_list").sortable({ containment: 'parent', axis: 'y', revert: true, opacity: 0.8 }); $(".sub_list").sortable({ containment: 'parent', axis: 'y', revert: true, opacity: 0.8, }); $("#sort_list").disableSelection(); one two sub one sub two three four
