Bypass Login for Magento Wishlist

I'm wanting to use the power of the wishlist functionality to send emails to the site owner so that the site owner can initiative a call to talk over the service etc etc. I want to only use the functionality of the wishlist and nothing else, so don't need the address book and the dashboard etc, but is there a way to bypass the login to the account section?
