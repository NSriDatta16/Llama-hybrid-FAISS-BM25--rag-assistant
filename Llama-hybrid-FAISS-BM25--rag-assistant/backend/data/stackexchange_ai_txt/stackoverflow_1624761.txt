As stated on the Twitter Wiki , Hashtags are a community-driven convention ...so I don't know if there's a specific API yet for that. But, as they are per-se, regular parts of tweets, you can very well use Twitter API to search and organize posts, people and topics, based on them. In the Further Reading section of Twitter Wiki, you'll find numerous resources related to this topic, and perhaps even some steps that will guide you more than I can.
