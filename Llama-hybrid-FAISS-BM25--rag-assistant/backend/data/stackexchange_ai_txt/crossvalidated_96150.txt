1) Your question suggests you have the analytical posterior distribution available. If this is the case, it is always of value to have the analytic expectations and such like if it is non intractable to derive (as someone famous said, a good Monte Carlo is a dead Monte Carlo). For one thing, it may not be easy (algorithmically, or programmatically) to sample from the posterior distribution even if you know it analytically. However, if you don't know the analytical posterior expression i.e. you can't easily compute the integral denominator, then your only choice is to sample - that's why we have Monte Carlo in the first place. 2) If you produce multiple MC runs - you can compare results. If your MC sample can guarantee independent samples, then a simple variance estimator ($\frac{\widehat{\sigma}^2}{n}$ type) can give you some idea of how good your expectation estimate is. If your MC sample is from a MCMC algorithm, say, Metropolis Hastings, some more careful thought and good diagnostics are required - typically looking at the trace plots and autocorrelation plots. I'm sure someone else can contribute much more to this discussion...
