If I have to recommend 10 movies to the users

Let's say I have some information about a user and movie data similar to the following: user: age, gender, height, nationality, etc movie : actor, genre , director info userwatch : userA watch movieA at 2009,,....... userComment : userA comments about movie In this case, if I would like to recommend 10 movies to each user, which machine learning technique would I use? I was thinking about making a data frame and running RandomForestClassifier , but in this case, it's hard to recommend exactly 10 movies to each user. I was also thinking about using K-means clustering, but when the movie number is over 200000, i'm not sure k-means is the best choice. Any help is greatly appreciated.
