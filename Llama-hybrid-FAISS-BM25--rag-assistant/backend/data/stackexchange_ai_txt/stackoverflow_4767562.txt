Is there a way to execute JavaScript in Perl?

I've worked some years now in Perl building Web scrapers, and given the problem that spam represents, and how scraping Web pages would turn out to be much more easier to those folks if, for example, Perl's LWP::UserAgent could handle its cup of JavaScript, I'm amazed no one has built a JS engine for it yet. What am I missing here? Thanks in advance. Regards. PS: I'm not a spammer. Just curious.
