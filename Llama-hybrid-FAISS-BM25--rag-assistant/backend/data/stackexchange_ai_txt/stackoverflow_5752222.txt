There is a lot of literature about detecting document similarity. You need to do a literature search and/or a web search for software / algorithms / techniques that matches your requirements. Simply replacing a brute-force sequential pair-wise comparison with a brute-force parallel pair-wise comparison is not the answer. That approach only gives you an O(P) speedup (at best), where you have to deal with O(N^2 * S^2) where N is the number of documents and S is the average document size. For a start, the classic way of finding similarities between two large text files involves breaking each file into lines, calculating hashes of each the respective file's lines, sorting the hashes and comparing them. This process is O(SlogS) ...
