WPF, How to Animate ListViewItems

I'm developing a touchscreen application, have a listview with a DataTemplate which has a single mediaelement in it. I can drag,move scale each individual listview item, now I need a code to bring all of the listview items to their first positions with scaling back to first size and moving to first position. How can I do this, any idea?
