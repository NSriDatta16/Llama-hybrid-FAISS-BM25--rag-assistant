using local storage in HTML5 can I share it between various users

I'm planning to use html5 capability of localstorage to write a simple application, I would like to share the database file across multiple browsers(users on various machines) I'm not too worried about locking etc, as the number of users are only 3-5. Could anybody help on how i could achieve this.
