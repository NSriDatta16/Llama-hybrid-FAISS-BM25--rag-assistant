Is there a way to demonstrate strength of a Hierarchical Bayesian Model versus a non-Hierarchical Bayesian Model on simulated data?

Is there a way to demonstrate strength of a Hierarchical Bayesian Model versus a non-Hierarchical Bayesian Model on simulated data? I'm ideally looking for a plot that shows that a Hierarchical Bayesian Model better succeeds in detecting a difference/effect against a non-Hierarchical Bayesian Model as we keep decreasing the amount of data. An effect is detected if the pairwise difference between estimated quantities is $> 0$ with probability $0.95$ . So this can be calculated from both the models. Is there a way to demonstrate this using simulated data?
