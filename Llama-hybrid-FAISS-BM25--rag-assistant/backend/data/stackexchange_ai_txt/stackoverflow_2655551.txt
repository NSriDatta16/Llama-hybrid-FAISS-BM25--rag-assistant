I'm not sure what you are trying to do makes sense - and I agree with Brian on a lack of way to pre-pend a file without writing a new file. A better approach would be to store the Entry items (in a separate file or other storage medium) and then generate the final version as Brian stipulates. If you are manipulating XML content generally, you might consider using Linq to XML or the native .Net XML libraries .
