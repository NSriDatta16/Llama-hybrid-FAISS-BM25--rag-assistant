I don't have any specifics or code examples for you, but I do recommend opening Visual Studio up and creating a Microsoft Word 2007 plugin (is the requirement version-free?) and playing with the available APIs. I know in our organization, we implemented a very similar solution using a Word plugin project. Unfortunately, I know little more about it so I can't be of much help other than stating that it is possible.
