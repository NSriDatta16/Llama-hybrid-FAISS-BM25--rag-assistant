Bayesian neural nets are useful for solving problems in domains where data is scarce, as a way to prevent overfitting. They often beat all other methods in such situations. Example applications are molecular biology ( for example this paper ) and medical diagnosis (areas where data often come from costly and difficult expiremental work). Actually, Bayesian nets are univerally useful and can obtain better results for a vast number of tasks but they are extremely difficult to scale to large problems.
