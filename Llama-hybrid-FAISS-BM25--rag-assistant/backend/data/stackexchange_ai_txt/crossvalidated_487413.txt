1. Calculate the Envelope The envelope $y(t)$ captures the instantaneous power of the oscillations (see the plot, where the envelope is in red), which I think is what you're looking for. The wiki page on the analytic function is a good place to start for this. 2. Be Careful of Autocorrelation As discussed here , you can't just correlate two time series. There's lots of good advice in the linked question, but the simplest thing you can do is to differentiate the two signals, $\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = x(\tau) - x(\tau-1)$ for all values of $\tau$ , check that there's no autocorrelation in the differentiated signals, and then correlate them. Actually, since you're interested in how the rate of change in $x$ predicts oscillatory power in $y$ , you need to first calculate the second derivate of $X$ (reflecting change in the rate of change, or acceleration/deceleration), and correlate it with the first derivate of envelope of $y$ (reflecting change in power). In pseudo-code: ddx = diff(diff(x)) power_y = envelope(y) d_power_y = diff(power_y) cor.test(ddx, d_power_y) For the frequency of the oscillations in $y$ , you can do the same thing with the instantaneous frequency .
