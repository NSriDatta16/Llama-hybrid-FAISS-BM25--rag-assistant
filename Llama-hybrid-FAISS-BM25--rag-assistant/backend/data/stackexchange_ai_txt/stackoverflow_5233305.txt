ASP.NET - designer

I'm using the ASP.NET designer in Visual Studio 2010. How do I change the layout of the page horizontally as well as vertically? I'm used to working in the WPF designer where you could just drag and lay out how you like, but the ASP.NET designer doesn't seem to want to allow me to move controls horizontally- like the page MUST be laid out from the top left. it'll only stack controls one after another in the line. I also can't seem to resize tags to be smaller from the left or top.
