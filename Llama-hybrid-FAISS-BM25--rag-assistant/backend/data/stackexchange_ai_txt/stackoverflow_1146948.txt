Along with Charlie's answer I can add little more towards what you can do to get this done Hopefully the DragDrop library will give you a dropped event which can give you the dragged item(Source) Source.DataContext will be an Item in your ObservableCollection and you can easly find out the OLD_INDEX by Collection.IndexOf(item). Now since your dragdrop library moved the Source. You can get the NEW_INDEX by ItemsContainerGenerator.IndexFromContainer(source) provided the Source is the ContentControl for the ItemsControl. Or else you might need to walk through the VisualTree to find out the ContentControl which made up the ItemsControl. This depends on the drag-drop library implementation. Now collection.Move(OLD_INDEX, NEW_INDEX) thats it.
