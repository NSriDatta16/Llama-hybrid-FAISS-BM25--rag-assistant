Linear regression for time series with Gnuplot

I am a big fan of Gnuplot and I used it all along my studies for various projects. Lately I wanted to use Gnuplot to chart some time series like weight loss, exercising results, gas consumptions etc. Therefore I scale the x-axis like set xdata time set timefmt "%d.%m %Y" set format x "%d.%m" Now I want to use the fit-function to give me a linear fit. My problem is, that I cannot get that to work if the x-axis is time-related.
