Rails non-image file upload to DB without using server-side temp files?

I'm looking into the feasibility of adding a function to my Rails-based intranet site that allows users to upload files. Two purposes: My users are widely distributed geographically and linking to documents on the shared network storage doesn't always work (different addresses, DNS entries and stuff outside my control or interest) so I'm thinking about providing a database-oriented alternative. We have a number of files from which we parse data at the client end. I'd rather like to be able to push that up to the server. I've looked at attachment_fu, Paperclip and another one (forgotten the name!) all of which seem very image-oriented, although attachment_fu at least can work without a image processing library present, thank goodness. The big problem is that my server does not permit my application to write files locally, and these plugins all seem to want to create a Tempfile. The questions (finally!) Is there a reasonable way to upload binary data and process it in memory and/or store it as a BLOB without any server-side file saves? Or should I give up on the file distribution idea and give the users a second-best option of copy-and-paste text boxes where possible? (Closest I could find on SO was this which doesn't really help)
