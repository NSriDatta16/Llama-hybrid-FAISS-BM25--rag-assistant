First of all, do yourself a favour and back up what you've got before touching it any further! Normally svn export would be the command to use to clean out the .svn dirs. You can run the command on a working copy to remove .svn dirs in-place, or you can export to a separate directory. But I couldn't say for sure whether it will work on a directory tree with "unusual" .svn directories. TortoiseSVN can do exports too of course. Note for doing it in-place, TortoiseSVN has a trick you can do of right-click dragging a directory onto itself, and then choosing "export". The trick is you have to drag the directory onto itself in another window . Once you have a tree without .svn dirs, do a fresh checkout somewhere else. Then, copy your previously-exported tree over the top of the checkout. How does that sound?
