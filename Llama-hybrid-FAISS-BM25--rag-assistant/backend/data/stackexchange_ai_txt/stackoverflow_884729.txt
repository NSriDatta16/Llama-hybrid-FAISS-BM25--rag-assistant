Sorry, but you can't access that kind of state from GLSL, period. In fact, in the future GLSL you have to send all unforms/attributes yourself, i.e. no automagic gl_ModelViewMatrix, gl_LightPosition, gl_Normal or the like. Only basic stuff like gl_Position and gl_FragColor will be available. That sort of voids your second question, but you could always use #ifdef's to enable/disable parts in your shader if you find that more convenient than writing separate shaders for different texture modes. Related, do note that branching is generally rather slow so if you have the need for speed do avoid it as much as possible. (This matters especially irregular dynamic branching, as fragments are processed in SIMD blocks and all fragments in a block must compute the same instructions, even if they only apply for one or a few fragments.)
