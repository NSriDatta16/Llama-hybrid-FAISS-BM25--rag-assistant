Unit testing is a tool, and there many approaches on how to use it. Here is my approach : I write my unit tests against Service and DAO signatures, and not so much against DTOs and entity types. Most of the value types will be indirectly tested. equals and hashCode methods in DTOs and entity types should be tested though. I use both pure unit tests with mocked dependencies and integration tests with the full backend. For proper coverage, one needs both.
