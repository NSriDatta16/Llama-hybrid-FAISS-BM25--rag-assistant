Using a lambda expression versus a private method

I read an answer to a question on Stack Overflow that contained the following suggested code: Action logAndEat = ex => { // Log Error and eat it }; try { // Call to a WebService } catch (SoapException ex) { logAndEat(ex); } catch (HttpException ex) { logAndEat(ex); } catch (WebException ex) { logAndEat(ex); } My question is: what is the advantage (if any) of using a lambda expression for LogAndEat as opposed to the (in my view simpler and more obvious) private method as follows: private void LogAndEat(Exception ex) { // Log Error and eat it } Edit: Thanks for the answers so far but just restating my fundamental question a little more clearly: which approach is better/would you recommend in this instance? A lambda expression or a private method?
