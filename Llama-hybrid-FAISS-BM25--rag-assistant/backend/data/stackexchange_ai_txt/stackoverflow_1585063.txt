How to retrieve the Zend_Config used by Zend_Application?

I'm migrating my app to use Zend_Application for bootstrap. I used to have the Zend_Config as a key for my $registry. Now I don't know how to use it this way anymore (without having to reload the config file). I know it's possible to use $application->getOptions(), but that gives my an array and I would have to change everywhere in my code where $config is used like an object ($config->services->storage) to array-like ($config['services']['storage']).
