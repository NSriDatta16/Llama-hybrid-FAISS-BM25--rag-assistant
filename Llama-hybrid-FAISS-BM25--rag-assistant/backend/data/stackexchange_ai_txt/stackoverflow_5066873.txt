Excluding plugins from Cobertura reports in Grails

I'm using SpringSecurity plugin in my project and also Cobertura plugin for code coverage reports. The thing is I'd like the SpringSecurity specific classes (login and logout controllers, persistent login token and so on) to be excluded from my reports, since I assume they work properly. I'd like reports to contain only my project specific classes code coverage. Is there any way I can achieve that?
