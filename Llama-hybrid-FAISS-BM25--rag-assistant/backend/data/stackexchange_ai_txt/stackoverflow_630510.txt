Thanks for your replies; the reason I want to use this approach is because one of my applications don't work with a version of Java higher than 1.6u11; if a user has auto updates set to on for Java or if he/she decides to upgrade to a higher version, that will break my other application that only works with Java 1.6u11. By embedding the jre files/folder structure with the installation of my application and pointing the ini files to execute the application using that version of Java I'll make sure that version is the one used by the application and not the one defined in JAVA_HOME, whichever that is (higher or lower than 1.6u11). Any comments are more than welcome.
