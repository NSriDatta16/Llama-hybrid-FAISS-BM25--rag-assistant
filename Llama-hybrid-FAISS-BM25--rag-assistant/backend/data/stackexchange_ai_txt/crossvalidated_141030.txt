The simple answer is No . Subsampling will not help. If by subsampling you mean a balanced sample so that the ratio of events changes from 200/1000 to 200/400. This is only used in classification models and is of no use (generally) in maximum-likelihood / probability models. What the comments are trying to suggest is that there are many other larger issues revealed in questions that could be textbook chapters by themselves: Sample size of logistic models is measured by number of events, model building as events-per-variable. With 8 EPV (assuming all are continuous predictors otherwise less) your sample size in relationship to your number of predictors is small which is going to cause issues. Detecting interactions is notoriously difficult. Forward/backward or combination variable selection methods have major issues. This a popular topic on stackexchange crossvalidated. It is likely overemphasized with limited issues with EPV>50. But this is the classic situation where you are going to get mislead by automated variable selection methods (Austin: Automated variable selection methods for logistic regression produced unstable models for predicting acute myocardial infarction mortality) variable selection is hard prediction models and descriptive models often require different methods. Not always. Differences often overemphasized. But from the limited information available it seems like these two goals are going to be difficult to combine in this case. Evaluation of logistic models avoid using correctly classified. Classification in logistic regression often based on arbitrary probability cut-off.
