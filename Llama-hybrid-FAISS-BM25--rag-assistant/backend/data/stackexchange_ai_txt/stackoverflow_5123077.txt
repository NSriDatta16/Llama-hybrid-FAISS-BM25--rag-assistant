which media player to embed in powerpoint pres as touchscreen app?

My colleague is creating touchscreen app using POwerpoint 2010. This approach worked so far because a lot can be done by just clicking through menus, setting properties etc, without writing a single line of VBA code. Now some movie clips must be integrated, and this has shown to be more problematic as expected (for a touchscreen app, that is). It is possible to embed a windows media player as an activex control, however the media control bar is really small, and must be clicked with the pinky finger. Control size cannot be changed, skins do not work in embedded mode (I was told so) What are viable alternatives? The choices are endless: use a different player (VLC for instance but it crashes all the time) writing own media control bar (the volume slider is a problem) calling windows media player in standalone mode (the user cannot be prevented to do too much) embedding a html page, and this one has something else embedded, a silverlight player for instance. embedding a flash player, converting movie clips to a different format before embedding a customized solution provided by a powepoint MVP or some other expert the list goes on and on. I don't have the time to research all of them in depth. What is the most practical alternative? Thanks.
