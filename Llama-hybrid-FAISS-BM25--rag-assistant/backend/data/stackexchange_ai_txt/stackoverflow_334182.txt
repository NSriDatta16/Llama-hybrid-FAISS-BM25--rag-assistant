The CF contains a subset of the full framework (FFx), but it is not a pure subset. There are actually several things available in the CF that aren't in the FFx, which makes it a bit more difficult. CF apps also, except in the most rudimentary cases, use P/Invoke. Those calls are never the same from the desktop to the device, so they are not directly portable (though with a little abstraction you can have a platform-agnostic interface). For the most part, behavior is the same. I've seen some cases where it's not , and I recall some event ordering not always being identical though, so trust but verify. It's possible through very careful massaging of the configurations, but I certainly don't recommend it. It's difficult to maintain and very fragile. Instead have two project files, one for CF and one for FFx. You're likely to have code file differences anyway. Add the code files as links to each project so they both use the same physical source file. I'd recommend using some form of CI to help ensure they both build at all times. Take a look at Dan Moth's MSDN article and blog entries on sharing code assets.
