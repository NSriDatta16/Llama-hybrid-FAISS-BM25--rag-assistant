Probability of heads given p is less than some value

Say I have a coin with a chance $p$ of landing heads where $p$ is drawn from the uniform distribution from 0 to 1. Now let's say I have some fixed number $x \in (0,1)$ . My question is what is the probability that the coin lands on heads, given that $p \leq x$ ? In other words, what is $\Pr(H | p \leq x)$ ? I first attempted to use Baye's rule $$\Pr(H | p \leq x) = \frac{\Pr(p \leq x | H)\Pr(H)}{\Pr(p \leq x)}$$ but I couldn't deduce the value of $\Pr(p \leq x | H)$ or the value of $\Pr(H)$ . I then tried using an integral to solve this. My idea was that the possible values of $p$ range from 0 to $x$ and for each, they have a probability $p$ of landing on heads. Hence: $$\int_0^x p \text{ }dp = \frac{x^2}{2}$$ However, my friend tells me the answer is $\frac{x}{2}$ because I need to divide the integral by $x$ since I need to "average" it. I'm afraid I don't understand what he means. An explanation of who is right and why would be much appreciated. Also, if one could explain how to find the values of $\Pr(p \leq x | H)$ and $\Pr(H)$ that would be much appreciated as well.
