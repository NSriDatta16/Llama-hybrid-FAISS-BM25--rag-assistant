What are the state-of-the-art models for identifying objects in photos?

From my observations and little experience it appears that most of the ML project are about classifying stuff. Is there cancer signs on the photo? Does the picture show car, whale or banana? Etc. I need to implement a model for face identification. Not detection/recognition, but identification: having two different photos of the same person, my model should determine if in the pictures is depicted the same person. I want to achieve that using Tensorflow with convolutional nets. I've read this paper: http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf and center loss looks promising. What do you think about that? Are there any new ideas/papers/implementations regarding that problem that are worth attention? I asked this question also on MachineLearning reddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8cysrx/d_what_are_the_stateoftheart_models_for/ ) and got an useful link with FaceNet implementation, trying here also :)
