R is widely used in scientific circles for published papers. R stores your data in RAM, so either it will be able to process your data set or it won't -- depending on whether the data and processing fit in memory -- there is no degraded mode where you get results but they are less accurate. (Technically, there are packages that let you work with larger data sets than fit in memory, but it's not trivial to use them.) There are almost always choices of packages that do similar tasks, so if you are very concerned about ltm , you can also look into other packages that do IRT. A quick search on my machine brings up packages MCMCpack , psych , and KernSmoothIRT , and there are probably others if you look on CRAN . Analyze your data with two packages to make sure that the answers are in reasonable agreement. The beauty of R is that it's free, so you can try it and see. And the packages are free, so you can try more than one. If your data set is too large, or if you're not satisfied with the results, you've only lost a bit of time.
