Logistic regression, like this is, assumes a binomial distribution, or, as I prefer, a Bernoulli distribution per event. I know of no case nor reason where this should not be safely assumed by itself (either it happens or it doesn't, and in a population you can always assign a probability to this). There is no reason the upper limit on your number of events per nest should influence this. That distribution, by linearity, is assumed conditionally on the year, where the logodds are linear in year. This could be faulty, but that has nothing to do with the possible number of events, just the fact that any model can be wrong. You can (with predict(type="response") ) get the probability of an egg hatching, conditional on the year from this type of model (technically that is not exactly the same as a rate, but for most practical purposes, it is).
