how to set gridsearchCV to ignore the errors

I want to use GridSearchCV in Python for my Logistic Regression model, and i want it to check combinations for every possible setting, but i get an error when there is time for penalty: l1 and solver lbfgs because this solver type is not supported for this penalty. My question is: is there a way to say to the gridserach if some combination isn't posible just go to the next one. parameters = { 'penalty' : ['l1','l2','elasticnet','none'], 'solver' : ['lbfgs','liblinear','sag','saga'] } clf_A = LogisticRegression(random_state=420) f1_scorer = make_scorer(f1_score,pos_label=1) grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf_A, scoring=f1_scorer, param_grid=parameters, cv=5) grid_obj = grid_obj.fit(X_train,y_train) clf_A = grid_obj.best_estimator_
