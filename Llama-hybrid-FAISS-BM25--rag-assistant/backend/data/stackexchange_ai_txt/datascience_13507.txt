Hadoop and SQL are things that you will pick up reasonably quickly and in my experience are far from necessary for a lot of jobs. I would focus on Python or on R, not on both. A lot of employers are Python and R and allow you to choose yourself as long as it's on one or both. I feel like Python is growing faster in the Data Science community than R and is in my opinion a much more sophisticated language and has a wider support for things that help with data science but are not directly related. As jab already mentioned, I think soft skills are very important, although difficult to learn without real working experience. The best thing to prepare in my opinion is just by doing some project(s) and figuring things out along the way. Join a Kaggle competition or find some personal project. I spend hours and hours working on those and I keep coming across problems that I haven't faced before, requiring me to read papers, implementing some new ideas, trying things out. This also allows you to build up a github portfolio to show off some cool projects you have been working on.
