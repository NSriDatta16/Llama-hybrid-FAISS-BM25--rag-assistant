I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're out of luck. In the few years I've been surfing the web for Cocoa-related stuff, I've rarely come across skeleton applications. Lots of sample projects, but not skeletons. For your three requirements, you've happened to list them in order from most difficult to least. Installer build script - running on login happens one of a couple ways. Either the application can be added to the user's Login Items or you can load a launchctl script to run the application as a LaunchAgent. The first option would be much simpler and the 'proper' way to do it. That's called an NSStatusItem, and examples abound on the internet. There's a handy class called NSUserDefaults that's used for saving application settings. You can easily set and read objects into this hash-table-like object, and it will handle saving them to disk for you.
