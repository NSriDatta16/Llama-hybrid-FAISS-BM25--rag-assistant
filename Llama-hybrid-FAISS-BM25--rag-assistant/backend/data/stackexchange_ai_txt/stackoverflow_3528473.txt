Before addressing the question of sprints, I think it's important to know if your team has organized around the Scrum roles. Product Owner - prioritizes product backlog items ScumMaster - conducts daily meetings, helps keep the team on track, eliminates obstacles... Team - the group of folks committed to delivering the completed backlog items The Product Owner and ScrumMaster should be two different people. Have these roles been defined in your unit? If not, I'd recommend considering who should fill these slots. Anyway, I think it's better to start small, pick some projects and pilot the process. Learn from your mistakes. See what works and what doesn't. Since you know that other work may take precedence over planned activities. Try completing sprints in 4-week time intervals for a few months. Iterate, reflect and adjust as you go. Lastly, get your customers involved, invite them to your sprint reviews. You'll get great feedback and your product will get better faster.
