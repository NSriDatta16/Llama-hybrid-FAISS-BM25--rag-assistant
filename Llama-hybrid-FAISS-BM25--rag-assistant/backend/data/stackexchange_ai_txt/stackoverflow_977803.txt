In our system we have the concept of a unit of work. A unit of work to us is a single operation against the system. For instance withdrawing money from an account or depositing money into an account would be a single unit of work. The unit of work class wraps the NHibernate session (and a few other things) and then our Repositories work against the current unit of work (via thread storage). In terms of what you're trying to do we would then do the following... For WCF we have a UnitOfWorkContext attribute which we apply to an operation that is responsible for beginning/ending the unit of work. For WinForms we would just have the presenter begin/end a unit of work For WebContext we would do the same in HttpContext.Begin and .End
