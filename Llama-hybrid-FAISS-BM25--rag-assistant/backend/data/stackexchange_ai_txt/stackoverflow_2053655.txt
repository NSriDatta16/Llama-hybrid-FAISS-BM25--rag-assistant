How to check two hashed passwords are the same?

I'm writing a program where I use MD5 to hash login details before I send them to a server, but there I have to compare it to a blowfish (jBCrypt) hashed password retrieved from a database. jBCrypt uses: if (BCrypt.checkpw("candidatePassword", hashedPwd)) { // they are the same } The problem is that, I don't have a candidate password to test. How can I have both secure transmission of my login details and secure storage of these details on the database. What is the best way to approach this? I use username, timestamp, random bytes and password to create my md5 digest value. Thanks, Vladimir
