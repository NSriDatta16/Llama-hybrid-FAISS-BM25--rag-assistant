Getting TeamCity to run NUnit tests, with both NCover and TypeMock integrated?

Basically I'd like to use the NUnit plugin for TeamCity (the program, not necessarily the specific build step using it) to run my unit tests, with NCover for code coverage, and since my unit tests uses TypeMock 6, I need that too working. So far I've tried: Just basically pointing the TeamCity NUnit build-step to my dll's, but that fails with the following error message: Typemock Isolator needs to be linked with Coverage Tool to run, to enable do one of the following: link the Coverage tool through the Typemock Isolator Configuration run tests via TMockRunner.exe -link use TypeMockStart tasks for MSBuild or NAnt with Link Trying to figure out the right command line, I tried this: C:...\Isolator\6.0\TMockRunner.exe "C:\TeamCity...\JetBrains.BuildServer.NUnitLauncher.exe" v4.0 MSIL NUnit-2.5.9 MyAssembly.dll This fails with the exact same error. Setting the environment variables found in the mocking_on.bat file part of TypeMock, this doesn't change the outcome. Note that the above examples doesn't contain any reference to NCover (yet), that's because I've been hacking around on the command line for a couple of hours with the above examples and still haven't gotten basic unit-tests running. NCover is extra options to the nunit-launcher of TeamCity so I hope this is as simple as just enabling that when I get that far.
