Both are correct. As said by blooraven (+1), this is the same kind of correction as in the unbiased estimator for sample variance . The second formula is used with linear regression corrects for the number of degrees of freedom. Notice that the second formula would not make sense in every context. Some models can be used with more features than samples, so the denominator would be zero or negative. In non-parametric models, or even some parametric ones (neural networks), it may be hard to say how many degrees there are and what exactly they are . Because of that in machine learning, to compare different models, you would almost always see the first formula with the denominator that is simply $n$ .
