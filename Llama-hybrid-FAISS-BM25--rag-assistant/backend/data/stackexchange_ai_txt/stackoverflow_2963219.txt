If I take the html that is being rendered and place it inside a DIV on the page it renders fine in IE8. Any suggestions? Does the ashx handler render a complete html page or only the table fragment? Make sure the page is valid html with html, body tags. Also tables freeze the layout process in most browsers. Have you tried using div tags just to see if it crashs IE 8
