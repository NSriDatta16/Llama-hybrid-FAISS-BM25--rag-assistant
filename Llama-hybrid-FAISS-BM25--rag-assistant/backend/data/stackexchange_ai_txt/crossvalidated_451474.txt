We can use sample_weights in SVM-C or any other classifier with weights being the ratio. There would be two data points for each data point in the original case: With 1 as target variable where sample_weight is equal to ratio With 0 as target variable where sample_weight is (1-ratio). Consider the effect of sample_weights here on SVM-C https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_weighted_samples.html We can then use the predicted probability for target value 1 as our ratio estimate. Here weights refer to the sample_weights in the fit method of sklearn
