Jobi is correct that there are really no implications either way, but my gut instinct has always been to use a Container to hold multiple controls. A lot of that is driven by my need for highly structured organization, but mostly it just makes sense to me. I do end up with a lot of nested Grids, StackPanels, etc. Yes, the tree can get pretty deep, but I use Blend almost exclusively for layout and design, so navigating the tree is not so bad, especially if you remember to give everything good descriptive names. I don't know if it's "Best Practice" but it certainly works best for me.
