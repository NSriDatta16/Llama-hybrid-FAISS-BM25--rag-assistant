Here are some biased opinions for your consideration. To put it into the context, let me first take an excerpt from this great STL tutorial ( http://www.gardner.fyi/blog/STL-Part-II/ ): " the notional of seasonal variation is always intrinsically ambiguous: whether the temporal variation should be considered Seasonal, Trend, or Remainder is, to a degree, a matter of opinion and determined by choice of model and model parameters. This is true in STL as well as any seasonal variational approach. " Translated differently, time series decomposition is more of an art than a science; the models/algorithms can't tell whether the results make sense or not and the interpretations need to be informed by domain expertise. In that tutorial, you can see that, due to the use of Loess, the edge effects from STL are inevitable, but whether the effects matter or not is a judgment call. There is no way to avoid such edge effects unless bringing more data or introducing more model assumptions. To me, the most straightforward way to determine whether the dip you got is a 'true' signal or a model artifact is to resort to the domain knowledge. If that is not possible, a least thing to do is to test out several alternative algorithms/models and see if consistent patterns are found. Here is a quick example using a monthly Google search trend time series for the term beach to illustrate with three model settings ( STL and Rbeast ). Rbeast is a Bayesian time series decomposition method where I implemented the BEAST algorithm (if needed, more info about it is available here https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast ). beach = c(59,56,60,60,67,73,76,69,59,46,43,46,58,58,62,60,67,78,81,69,53,49,49,44,57,56,60,57,64,73,78,67,50,45,43,43,54,56,61,59,65,73,77,67,51,45,41,43,53,54,61,59, 64,73,76,69,47,43,40,44,54,55,60,58,65,71,77,64,51,44,41,42,53,52,58,59,64,76,77,66,50,43,40,42,55,62,66,65,71,83,93,77,57,51,46,50,60,62,65,68,74,87,89,78,57, 49,48,48,54,57,62,63,70,81,91,76,55,48,46,49,58,59,64,65,74,83,91,74,51,47,46,47,55,59,68,64,74,89,95,76,60,49,46,49,56,65,73,71,78,93,100,84,61,57,47,50,56, 61,71,72,75,93,98,80,62,50,45,49,60,63,68,71,73,89,100,78,61,54,46,48,57,61,70,69,73,92,92,76,58,48,46,49,57,59,52,40,70,92,83,72,59,50,42,45,52,62,72,78,82, 93,95,78,61,54,49,51,58,63,69); beach = ts(beach, start=c(2004,1), frequency=12); o1 = stl(beach, 'per') plot(o1) # Rbeast is a Bayesan time series decomposition method I developed # It does time series decomposition and changepoint detection at the # same time library(Rbeast) o2 = beast(beach, season='harmonic') # use a harmonic curve to fit the seasonal component o3 = beast(beach, season='svd') # use a svd-based curve to fit the seasonal component plot(o2) plot(o3) Here is the result from the STL decomposition: Below are the results from the BEAST decomposition using the harmonic seasonal and SVD-based seasonal forms, respectively. The BEAST results are quite different from the STL one. The two BEAST results look similar but differ a bit for the end of the time series: This reflects exactly what whuber commented about the compensation between the terms: In the harmonic version, the observed anomaly at the end went mainly to the trend component; and in the svd version, it went mainly to the seasonal component. I don't think there is any way to tell which is practically better, which is a problem that can be best addressed with more future data. Rbeast/BEAST also captures some robust patterns that fit the expectation of some "domain" knowledge (i.e., more search popularity expected for hotter weather). Take the detected changepoints/abrupt changes (i.e., those times indicated by the vertical dashed lines in either the seasonal or trend signals) as an example. There was a sudden jump (or structural break) around the summer of 2011 (The summer of 2011 was the hottest one on record for the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_North_American_heat_wave#:~:text=Record%20heat,-The%20National%20Climatic&text=Since%201901%2C%20only%20the%20Dust,the%20hottest%20summer%20on%20record ). There was also an abrupt rise at the start of 2016, again possibly attributed to the abnormally warm temperature (January 2016 Was the Most Abnormally Warm Month Ever Recorded: https://weather.com/news/climate/news/record-warmest-january-global-2016 ). There was a sharp drop in the search popularity around April 2020 (attributed apparently to the covid outbreak, supported by our "domain" knowledge, but in our version, the abrupt change was reflected in the seasonal curve and another was more reflected in the trend curve.
