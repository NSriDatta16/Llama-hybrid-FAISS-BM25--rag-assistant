Periodogram Interpretation

I'm trying to understand why the following definition describes a function that does the job of producing a graph where the highest point indicates the frequency of the strongest periodic signal. I've tried expanding it out and I know how to read of graphs that one might produce in R - I want to understand the mechanics of the expression. Can someone explain it without the use of Fourier Analysis or other higher maths concepts? Definition: Given a time series $s_1,\ldots,s_J$ the periodogram is defined by: $I(\omega) = \frac{2}{J} \left\{\Big(\sum_js_j\cos(\omega\times j)\Big)^2+\Big(\sum_js_j\sin(\omega\times j) \Big)^2 \right\}$ The function $I(\omega)$ is then computed for $\omega_p=\frac{2\pi p}{J}$ with $P=0,1,\ldots,\frac{J}{2}$.
