The problem might be that you have initialized draggable on a collection of elements, and destroying it on the single element causes some weirdness. What you might try doing is removing the ui-draggable class from that particular element: jQuery('.mydiv').removeClass("ui-draggable"); Of course, that might not change a thing.
