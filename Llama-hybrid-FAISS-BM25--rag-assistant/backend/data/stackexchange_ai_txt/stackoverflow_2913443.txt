GWT, jcifs, and multiple prompting for login

We have a gwt app that uses jcifs to pull the user name from our NT domain. Here is a clip of our web.xml: NtlmHttpFilter com.xxx.gwt.server.MyNTLMFilter jcifs.netbios.wins 192.168.109.20 jcifs.smb.client.domain its NtlmHttpFilter /trunkui/greet greetServlet com.xxx.gwt.server.GreetingServiceImpl greetServlet /trunkui/greet So currently when the user goes to our site they get about 2 or 3 repeated prompts asking them to log onto the domain even though they already are (you have to be on the domain to get to our app). I would like to at least reduce the prompting to only happen once. So I was going to make a dummy servlet off of "/trunkui/dummy" and let that get called only when I ask for the name. The remote servlet has this method that we call asynchronously: public String getUser() { String userAgent = ""; try { userAgent = getThreadLocalRequest().getUserPrincipal().getName(); int slashIdx = -1; if ((slashIdx = userAgent.indexOf('\\')) >= 0) userAgent = userAgent.substring(slashIdx + 1); } catch (Exception npe) { npe.printStackTrace(); } return userAgent; } So I wanted to do some sort of call to the dummy servlet to do the domain prompting, but I am unsure on how to do this from the gwt remote service. Or if there is a better way to do this?
