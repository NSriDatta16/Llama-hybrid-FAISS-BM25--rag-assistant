In this case, it's the same. Use the smallest scope possible for the most readable code. If int were a class with a significant constructor and destructor, then the first (declaring it outside the loop) can be a significant savings - but inside you usually need to recreate the state anyway... so oftentimes it ends up being no savings at all. One instance where it might make a difference is containers. A string or vector uses internal storage that gets grown to fit the size of the data it is storing. You may not want to reconstruct this container each time through the loop, instead, just clear its contents and it may not need as many reallocations inside the loop. This can (in some cases) result in a significant performance improvement. The bottom-line is write it clearly, and if profiling shows it matters, move it out :)
