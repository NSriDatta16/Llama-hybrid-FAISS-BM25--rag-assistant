The original stacked denoising autoencoder paper contains some comparisons to deep belief networks (i.e. stacked RBMs) Vincent et al. (2010) . Stacked denoising autoencoders: Learning useful representations in a deep network with a local denoising criterion. However, the comparisons are about classification performance, using the models in generative mode (to synthesize examples), and conceptual points (how the methods work). As far as I recall, they don't directly address your questions about computational cost, etc.
