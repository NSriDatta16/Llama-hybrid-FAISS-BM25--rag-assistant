How do I create drop lines while dragging a menu item on a WinForm?

I want to mimic the functionality of Google Chrome/FireFox for example, when rearranging your bookmarks, when you are dragging the menu item, it creates a black line at the proposed drop point, like this: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/977900a13a.jpg I've already implemented the Drag/Drop functionality to rearrange the menu, but I would like to add these separator lines as an additional feature. Is there a way to do this within the .NET Framework (3.5) or shall I have to resort to Win32 api calls? Just wanted to ask before I went down that path.
