A nice post focusing on this question (specifically deep learning rather than general machine learning theorems) is here: https://medium.com/mlreview/modern-theory-of-deep-learning-why-does-it-works-so-well-9ee1f7fb2808 It gives an accessible summary of the main emerging theorems for the ability of deep neural networks to generalize so well.
