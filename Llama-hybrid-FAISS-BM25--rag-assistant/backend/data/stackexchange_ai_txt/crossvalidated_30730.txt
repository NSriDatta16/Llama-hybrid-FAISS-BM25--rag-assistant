Some quick rules If you have unordered categorical data (i.e., three or more unordered categories; which you do), then you don't use Cronbach's alpha. If you have binary data (e.g., incorrect/correct data), then many people do use Cronbach's alpha, but see the Sjitsma reference given by @Momo. If you have conditional data, then that would at the very least complicate the application of Cronbach's alpha. Skip patterns often imply the existence of an implicit additional category (e.g., "Do you play soccer?" if yes, "what day of the week do you play most often?", you could say that for the second question, there is an implicit category of "not applicable") . However, in your example, skipping item 2 means that the person does not have a degree in painting. So you could fill in that information. In all these examples there are more than 2 unordered categories so you would not apply cronbach's alpha. Other thoughts Cronbach's alpha relies on internal consistency to evaluate reliability. However, if your scale is formative, then internal consistency measures don't make much sense. In your case, I think your scale could be conceptualised as formative rather than reflective. I.e., the items in their totality represent something like "painting experience". You might want to look at something like test-retest correlation or categorical PCA if you need to calculate some form of reliability.
