functional xml building in scala

What's the best way to take a document with arbitrary text formatting, say: Hello world 1.1.1 (John Doe) Paragraph one here... pargraph one continued here paragraph two here and convert it into an XML document that looks something like this: Paragraph one here... paragraph one continued here paragraph two here The only thing I can think of is the standard imperative way of using an XMLBuilder type class was say a Scanner . But that doesn't seem very much like idiomatic Scala. Thanks!
