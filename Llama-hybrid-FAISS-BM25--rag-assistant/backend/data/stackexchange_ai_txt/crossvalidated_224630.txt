Single link - You link two clusters based on the minimum distance between 2 elements. A drawback of this method is that it tends to produce long thin clusters since you make the link based on only 2 points. Complete link - You link two clusters based on the max distance between 2 elements. Opposite problem with single link. Clusters tend to be overly conservative. Average link - Instead of making a decision based on a single pair of elements, you take the distance between every pair of elements. When in doubt, use average link for hierarchical clustering if your computation allows it!
