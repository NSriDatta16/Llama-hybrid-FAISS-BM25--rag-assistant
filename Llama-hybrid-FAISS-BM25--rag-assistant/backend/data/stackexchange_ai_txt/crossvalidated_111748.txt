Goodness of fit (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test for a time series?

This is a somewhat basic question, I guess. I have a sequence of random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ that I believe to be i.i.d. uniform on $[0,1]$. Being i.i.d. uniform corresponds to my model predicting the correct distribution for $P(Y_k\mid Y_{1:k-1})$ for some time series $Y$. I can test that by, say, applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov or the Anderson-Darling test. However, there is a type of dependence that I want to check: all together they might have a uniform ecdf, but, $X_1,\ldots,X_{n/2}$ and $X_{n/2+1},\ldots,X_n$ separately might not. But if I apply the KS test to each half, the result will not be independent from the statistic generated by the KS test for the whole sequence. Furthermore, if I apply the KS test to each window $X_k,\ldots,X_{k+m}$, and get a function $k\mapsto \text{p-value}$, $k=1,\ldots,n$, I can check visually whether there are intervals where KS says they are not uniform. But there are $n-m$ tests for each $k$, so they are very much not independent of each other, so this isn't very sound. What goodness-of-fit test should I use here? How do I justify this procedure properly? Should I be doing this differently? Which textbooks/articles do I need to read?
