Working with tiered data

I have data on a sample of individuals infected with a disease, which has several serovars (distinct variations of the bacteria - e.g., Bratislava, Hardio, Grippo). An infected individual can test positive for multiple serovars, and it is common practice to (a) identify which serovar is most prevalent for each case use that as the (categorical) response variable (b) determine whether the case is infected (i.e., tests positive for at least one serovar) and use that as the (binary categorical) response variable, or (c) count the number of different serovars the case tested positive for and use that as the (quantitative) response variable. But is there a way to somehow use the relative ranking (or even quantitative variations between serovars) for each person as the response variable in something like linear regression or a structural equation model? The goal of the research is to use something like regression or structural equation models to evaluate the effects of various environmental risk factors on these infections, so a single (but perhaps multifaceted) response variable would be ideal. A example (with fewer variables and cases) is below: id Bratislava Hardio Grippo TopSerovar Infected CountSerovar 1 2.8 1.45 0 Bratislava YES 2 2 8.9 2.3 9.8 Grippo YES 3 3 0 0 0 NA NO 0 For each person, the measurement could essentially be a string of which serovars they tested positive for, and in what order (e.g., Case 1: Bratislava-Hardio). Alternatively, it could be a set of number indicating the magnitude of each serovar (e.g., Case 1: 2.8, 1.45, 0) My first thought was just to use all the serovars as independent response variables at the same time in a multivariate regression framework, but since there is a fair amount of correlation between them (a person who tests positive for one serovar is more likely to test positive for a second), I'm assuming it would require some dependence structure among the response variables. My hope is that there exists a more elegant solution!
