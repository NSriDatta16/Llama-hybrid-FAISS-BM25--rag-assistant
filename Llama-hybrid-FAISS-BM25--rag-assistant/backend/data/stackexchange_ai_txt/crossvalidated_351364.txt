How does k-fold validation affect the model coefficients?

My question on k-fold is not about evaluations of the model, but rather the coefficients that are returned by it. In the R code below, I am performing 3-fold cross validation, which is to say the model is trained and tested three times. The keyword I am looking at is "trained". My question is... how do the coefficient values get set? Is it an average of the three folds or another method? library(caret) formula
