A quote from cplusplus.com ( http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/vector/ ), which offers a very useful hint: "Reallocations may be a costly operation in terms of performance, since they generally involve the entire storage space used by the vector to be copied to a new location. Therefore, whenever large increases in size are planned for a vector, it is recommended to explicitly indicate a capacity for the vector using member function vector::reserve ." Using vector::reserve will almost certainly give a performance increase in your case. EDIT: You could try using random_shuffle ( http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/random_shuffle/ ) to shuffle your vector once it's been created (apparently, random_shuffle is linear in the number of elements).
