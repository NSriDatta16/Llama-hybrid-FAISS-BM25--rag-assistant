window.onerror = MyFunction(msg,url,line); we pop up a window with the error details, browser type (i.e. navigator.userAgent), etc. all in fields marked READONLY and inviting the user to Submit them. We have a checkbox "Don't show this again" which is stored in a session cookie - so if they keep getting errors than can disable the Popup. Despite the fact that we thought this was "well cool", we get very few reports - and I'm not convinced that that is because we get close to zero runtime errors!
