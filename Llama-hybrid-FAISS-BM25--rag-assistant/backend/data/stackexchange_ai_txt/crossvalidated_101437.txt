I believe Graham Cookson's answer to a similar question would be of assistance. Basically, he recommends Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models . According to Mr. Cookson, the book "covers basic regression, multilevel regression, and Bayesian methods in a clear and intuitive way" and "would be good for any scientist with a basic background in statistics".
