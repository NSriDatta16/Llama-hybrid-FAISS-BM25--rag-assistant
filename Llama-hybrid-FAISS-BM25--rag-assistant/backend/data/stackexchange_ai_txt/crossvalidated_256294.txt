people often highly recommend Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis as a great intro book. From there maybe try Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis . Then finish it off with the excellent Monte Carlo Statistical Methods Without more information on what specifically you are looking for this is probably best I can do.
