In java (and this assumes the only constructor is the private default constructor, otherwise checking of the array is required): Constructor[] constructors = YourClass.class.getDeclaredConstructors(); constructors[0].setAccessible(true); YourClass currentInstance = (YourClass) constructors[0].newInstance(null); Then, currentInstance is available for you to use. Typically I'll only do this for code coverage, if I make a constructor private, it's generally to avoid instantiation.
