Google is having courses on Deep Learning to train its employees. Given that most of them are in the situation you describe (not much math experience, but good software skills) I would say it's proof that you can profit from Deep Learning without excelling at math. Now there are tons of tools and sample codes online on lots of cool deep learning projects so it's easy to get started and play with them. For example there's tensorflow which already doesn't require much knowledge of how the backpropagation algorithm works, but there are even simpler layers build on top of it that require even less Deep Learning/theory knowledge, such as Keras. If you want to build your own you have to keep in mind that you will sometimes need lots of data and lots of computing power for a subset of those projects. (For example, at MIT's Machine Learning class lots of students wanted to replicate the atari project you mentioned, but the TAs suggested not to because of lack of Google-level compute power). Things you will probably be able to do with 1-2 days of effort include: Build your own, relatively simple, architecture. Train a complex architecture (using online code) on a dataset of your interest. Finally, if what you want is to create your new cool architecture that overperforms the state of the art I would say this will be hard to do without understanding the math behind it well.
