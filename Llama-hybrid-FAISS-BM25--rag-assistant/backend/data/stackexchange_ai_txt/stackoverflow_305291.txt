Embedding SMO dlls in Setup and deployment

I have a .NET Set and Deployment project which has to execute a set of really long SQL Scripts as a part of the installation process. I have used SMO dlls to make calls to the .sql script files.These SMO dlls are however not a part of the .NET framework but they come bundled with SQL Server 2005 or 2008. Now, if the setup is run on a machine which does not have SQL Server 2005/2008 installed the SQL script execution fails. This is a perfectly valid use case for my setup as the user might not have SQL server on his local machine but on a network server. How do i embedd the SMO dll's along with the setup .msi so that it doesnt have to depend on any SMO dlls on the machine it is being run?
