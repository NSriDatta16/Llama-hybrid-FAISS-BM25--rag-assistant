If you have no way of knowing the true concentration, the simplest approach would be a correlation. A step beyond that might be to conduct a simple regression predicting the outcome on method 2 using method 1 (or vice versa). If the methods are identical the intercept should be 0; if the intercept is greater or less than 0 it would indicate the bias of one method relative to another. The unstandardized slope should be near 1 if the methods on average produce results that are identical (after controlling for an upward or downward bias in the intercept). The error in the unstandardized slope might serve as an index of the extent to which the two methods agree. It seems to me that the difficulty with statistical methods here that you are seeking to affirm what is typically posed as a null hypothesis, that is, that there are no differences between the methods. This isn't a death blow for using statistical methods so long as you don't need a p value and you can quantify what you mean by "equivalent" and can decide how much deviation the two methods can have from one another before you no longer consider them equivalent. In the regression approach I detailed above, you might consider the methods equivalent if confidence interval around the slope estimate included 1 and the CI around the intercept included 0.
