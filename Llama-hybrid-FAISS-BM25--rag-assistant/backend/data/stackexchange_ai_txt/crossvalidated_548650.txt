Uncertainity band in Neural networks

I am working on a problem where I have to give the uncertainty band of my predictions like the image attached. I have seen a StackExchange solution for this, but in the solution code, we are using the true output(y) to calculate the noise, which is then used to plot the uncertainty. Is it possible to plot an uncertainty band like the image attached, without using the true output? If yes, can someone please put a sample code?
