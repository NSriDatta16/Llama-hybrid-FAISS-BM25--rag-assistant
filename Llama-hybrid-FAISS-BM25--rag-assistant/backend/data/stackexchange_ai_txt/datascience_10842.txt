How/What Correlation for Position Ranking?

I'm newbie to Data Science. I'm trying to understand how to correlate the position of an app in the app store, e.g. 1-10, to the number of backlinks, e.g. #1 = 250 links, #8 = 50 links, to the app store listing page in Python. I've manage to correlate both rows entirely, which obviously gives me a nonsense figure. Could someone point me in the right direction to allow me to fill this knowledge gap. I'm not entirely sure of the correct terminology for this, making Googling it pretty impossible.
