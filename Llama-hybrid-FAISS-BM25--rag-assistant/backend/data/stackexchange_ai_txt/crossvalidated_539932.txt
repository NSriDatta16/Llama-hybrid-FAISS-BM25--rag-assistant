Why is the size of the feature bagging sample typically the square root of the total predictor set size?

Applying feature sampling to each tree in the context of a Random Forest model, if the set of predictors is of size $p$ , why does the size of the sample of predictors for each split typically be of size $m \approx \sqrt{p}$ ? I get why the sample size should not be enough to allow to choose among the majority of the predictors, but why this precise value?
