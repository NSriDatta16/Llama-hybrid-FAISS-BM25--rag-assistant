I think, you need to provide more information, as there are a lot of possible causes: you have a small dataset , for example (extreme one) only 10 points your classifier depends strong on randomness , for example the random forest you are using a bad metric with an unbalanced dataset (say accuracy) What you should do: ensure, the dataset is big enough and you don't use (by a bug for example) only a small part of your data try other classifiers, which work completely different (XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, SVM etc.) if that is easy to implement use another metric (ROC AUC should generally do a good job) use the same integer all the times to feed the pseudo-random number generator Is anything special about your data/classifier compared to other classification problems you have done?
