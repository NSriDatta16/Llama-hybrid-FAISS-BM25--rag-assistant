How to study auto-correlation of time series when shocks are present?

The time series I want to model has several shocks due to law changes. Basically, I do not have a lot of data that isn't impacted by these shocks/shifts/pulses. Now, I want to study the ACF and PACF of the series- is the auto-correlation still useful for modelling the series knowing that the shocks disturb the "real" data? Also, how do I deal with shocks when I want to study the cross correlation with another time series. ACF and PACF of the original data:
