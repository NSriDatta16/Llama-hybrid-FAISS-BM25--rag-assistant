from mysql to mongodb - designing collections

I'm curious to get peoples opinions on they would design this collection scheme. I want to try using mongodb for an app (as i have been using mysql for the past 8 years) I will give a relational table schema first. Tables users user_friends user_notifications articles article_categories article_participants comments If I were to implement that table structure into mongodb, would this be the right way to define my collections: users => array { _id email, password, name, ... user_friend => array{ _user_id, date_created } user_notifications => array{ _notification_id } my_articles =>array{ _article_id } } article { _id, content_, date_created, ..., article_category => array{ _category_id } article_participants = array{ _user_id } comments=>array{ _user_id name, comment, date } } categories { _id, _user_id name comments=>array{ _user_id name, comment, date } } Please feel to comment or explain how you would organize your collections. Any help is much appreciated. As well, should i even be using mongodb for this type of application? (a social blog sharing app)
