XCode: Linking projects inquiry

I have 2 projects and I want to use in the first project, a class (i.e. view controller) of the second. Instead of importing all the files of the second project in the first one, is there a way to link it like a framework or library? I tried the following unsuccessfully: Dragged-dropped SecondProject.xcodeproj and checked SecondProject.app as a target Added it as a dependency project in the first project dependencies Pointed to the header files by adding in the "Header Search Paths" a path pointing to the second project which I copied in a subfolder of the first project. When I include "SecondProjectViewController.h" I get no errors but when I try to instantiate it I get the "OBJ C referenced from" error. Any help is deeply needed and appreciated! =) F.
