Are the number of channels increasing with conv2d filter?

So, I've been looking into CycleGAN code from Kaggle written by Amy Jang and..... I came to this code where we are basically downsampling our supplied image which has an input size of [256, 256, 3]. . And we are basically using Conv2D for this task. . Does that mean that while we are reducing pixels from its length and width, we are essentially retaining out valuable information by passing it onto the channel of the image? or whats really happening over here?
