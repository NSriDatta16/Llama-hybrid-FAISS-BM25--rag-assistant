I have sports injuries, and I cannot type more than few characters without serious pain. Instead, I use emacs together with Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I have written macros and scripts to help it get by. The system is not perfect, but it works. I program mostly in C++, but I also use python. If you want to, I will help you with that. I have to warn you, it takes few months to get used to speech to text software and train it. moreover, I am not native English speaker, am sure that gets in the way Do not despair, there are solutions. here a link to emacs and Dragon files (unfortunately have not documented yet) http://code.google.com/p/asadchev/source/browse/#svn/trunk/home/Dragon http://code.google.com/p/asadchev/source/browse/#svn/trunk/emacs/elisp also, if you need more info, my number is 515 230 9363 (United States, Iowa). I will be glad to help you if I can
