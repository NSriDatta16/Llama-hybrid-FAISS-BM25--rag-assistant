Where to put DTOs, Result Objects etc?

I have a fairly clean ASP.NET MVC project structure. However, I'm struggling on how to organize the mass of classes which are DTOs (data transfer objects), e.g. just to encapsulate post data from forms (viewmodels) but don't represent full domain objects or anything near that yet; and then the many "result" objects I have which communicate complex result information from my service layer back to the controller. Where do you stuff these/how do you organize them? I have one folder with well over 60 classes now and it's getting cluttered. Appreciate suggestions!
