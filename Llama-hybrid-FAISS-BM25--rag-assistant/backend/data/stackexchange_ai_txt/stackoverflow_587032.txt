You can use z for size_t and t for ptrdiff_t like in printf("%zu %td", size, ptrdiff); But my manpage says some older library used a different character than z and discourages use of it. Nevertheless, it's standardized (by the C99 standard). For those intmax_t and int8_t of stdint.h and so on, there are macros you can use, like another answer said: printf("value: %" PRId32, some_int32_t); printf("value: %" PRIu16, some_uint16_t); They are listed in the manpage of inttypes.h . Personally, I would just cast the values to unsigned long or long like another answer recommends. If you use C99, then you can (and should, of course) cast to unsigned long long or long long and use the %llu or %lld formats respectively.
