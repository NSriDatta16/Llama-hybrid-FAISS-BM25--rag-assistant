Software/languages for online structured data collection from (human) clients

I need to develop a web interface to collect and validate a range of data from many of my organization's clients. This isn't a single form, but a collection of forms with interdependencies (i.e., field X on form Y is needed if field A was equal to C on form B), and variable length lists (please provide the details for all Xs in your possession). I had a look at the marketing on Microsoft InfoPath and Adobe LiveCycle, but I get the impression that they're principally electronic forms solutions rather than data collection tools. (e.g., If a user has entered their address once, they should never have to see it on a form again). Any suggestions of good tools, applications or domain-specific languages?
