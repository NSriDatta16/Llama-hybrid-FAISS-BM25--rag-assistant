Partially because your other variables 'take credit' of X4sq or X8sq when they are not present in your models yet. Considering the situation when number of shark attack is significantly increased by the increase in ice-cream sales at the beach. But when we add temperature variables to the equation, which in turn causing more people to go to the beach, the ice-cream sale effect is no more. It would be interesting to check the correlation among variables by using pairs(data) Further improvement: Only some variables are significantly predictors to age. So you can consider to remove some of the variables and check the R squares using Bayesian Information Criterion.
