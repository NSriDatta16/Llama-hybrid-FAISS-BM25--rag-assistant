Principal component analysis with random effects?

How can I do a Principal Component Analyisis considering also the Random Effects? (*) Is there any R package able to do so? Something like PCA+lme4 or PCA+nlme. (*) I mean I want to transform my variables to get a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables, but taking also into account that I have some random effect variable (repeated measures on each individual). PD: Maybe it could be done with a bayesian package that does PCA?
