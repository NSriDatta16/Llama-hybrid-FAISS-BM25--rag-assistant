Need a list of Android devices with specs

I am looking for a list of Android devices that has the following info (at least): Device Name User Agent String Screen Format (of the three supported Android screen sizes) Touch Enabled? Maximum HTML5 Database Size There are some lists online (like the one on Wikipedia), but it does not have all of this data.
