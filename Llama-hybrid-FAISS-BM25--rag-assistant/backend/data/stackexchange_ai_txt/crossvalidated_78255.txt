How to resolve Simpson's paradox?

Simpson's paradox is a classic puzzle discussed in introductory statistics courses worldwide. However, my course was content to simply note that a problem existed and did not provide a solution. I would like to know how to resolve the paradox. That is, when confronted with a Simpson's paradox, where two different choices seem to compete for the being the best choice depending on how the data is partitioned, which choice should one choose? To make the problem concrete, let's consider the first example given in the relevant Wikipedia article . It is based on a real study about a treatment for kidney stones. Suppose I am a doctor and a test reveals that a patient has kidney stones. Using only the information provided in the table, I would like to determine whether I should adopt treatment A or treatment B. It seems that if I know the size of the stone, then we should prefer treatment A. But if we do not, then we should prefer treatment B. But consider another plausible way to arrive at an answer. If the stone is large, we should choose A, and if it is small, we should again choose A. So even if we do not know the size of the stone, by the method of cases, we see that we should prefer A. This contradicts our earlier reasoning. So: A patient walks into my office. A test reveals they have kidney stones but gives me no information about their size. Which treatment do I recommend? Is there any accepted resolution to this problem? Wikipedia hints at a resolution using "causal Bayesian networks" and a "back-door" test, but I have no clue what these are.
