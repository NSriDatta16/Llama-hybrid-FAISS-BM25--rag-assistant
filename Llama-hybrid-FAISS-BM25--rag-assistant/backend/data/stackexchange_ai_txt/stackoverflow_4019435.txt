Your template for the Slider has a pretty big lack of behavior. It draws itself, but has no triggers to define reactions to user clicks / drags, etc. If you want to customize the look of the slider, I would suggest that you start with the original template and customize it. To do this, download the app Show Me The Templates! , extract the template to your project, then start customizing the thumb. I hope this was helpful. Edit: This is wrong. This only works in WPF. In Silverlight, the tool I'd recommend is Blend OR you can use Visual Studio's "Extract to Resource" feature on the template: Link Edit Edit: I modified the builtin slider template to include your thumb style as a reference to the type of system of small tweaks you should go for rather than a "rip and replace".
