The standard error of the mean is: a parameter . calculated based on the believed population SD and the sample size a property of the distribution used when you are considering the parameters to be known (e.g., you are calculating what a probability would be under a null hypothesis) a fixed number The standard deviation of the sample is: a statistic empirically measured a property of the sample used when you want to describe the actual data a random variable that follow a chi-square distribution, assuming that the samples are IID standard normal (or, more precisely, the sample variance is so distributed) So, for instance, suppose someone tells you that a distribution has a standard deviation of 1. You take a sample of 16 measurement. The SEM is $1/\sqrt{16}$ = .25 . You then find the sample mean, find the deviations, square them, and take the average, and then take the square root. That’s the SD of the sample. You can then compare that to .25. If they’re close, then the assertion that the population SD is 1 is reasonable. If they’re far apart, then it’s likely false.
