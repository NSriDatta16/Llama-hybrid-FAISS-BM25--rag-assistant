Yes, you typically need to redo preprocessing such as PCA for each surrogate model. Preprocessing steps that do not violate independence may be pulled in out of the cross validation loop and be done only once. All steps that are calculated for each case (cases being the factor for which independent splitting into folds is done) separately (= independently of all other cases) before the first step that involves multiple cases qualify. This are steps like row-(case-)wise normalization as opposed to normalizing the range of a variate across all cases.
