How to use predict() function to average over polynomial terms in a linear model, so that it does not over- or under-estimate the data?

I have been having trouble with the predict function underestimating (or overestimating) the predictions from an lmer model with some polynomials. Update: The same trouble happens when I use lm models, i.e. it has nothing to do with mixed models. The example code below is still given with lmer models but one can ignore random effects as far as this question is concerned. I have scaled data (posted here ) that looks like this: Terr Date Year Age T.092 123 0.548425 -0.86392 T.104 102 1.2072 -0.48185 T.104 105 1.075445 -0.86392 T.104 112 0.94369 -1.24599 T.040 116 -0.2421 2.192652 T.040 114 -0.37386 1.810581 T.040 119 -0.50561 1.428509 T.040 128 0.15316 -0.09978 T.040 113 0.021405 -0.48185 I’m trying to determine how Year affects lay date after controlling for Age, with Terr (territory) as a random variable. I usually include polynomials and do model averaging, but whether I use a single model or do model averaging, the predict function gives predictions that are a bit lower or higher than they should be. I realize that the model below would not be a good model for this data, I’m just trying to provide a simplified example. Below is my code library(lme4) m1 When plotted with the means, the graph looks like this: When I use effects, I get a much better fit library(effects) ef.1c=effect(c("Year"), m1, xlevels=list(Year=-2:1)) pred.lc=data.frame(ef.1c) pred.lc Year fit se lower upper 1 -2 126.0226 0.6186425 124.8089 127.2363 2 -1 124.7911 0.4291211 123.9493 125.6330 3 0 123.5597 0.3298340 122.9126 124.2068 4 1 122.3283 0.3957970 121.5518 123.1048 After much trial and error, I have discovered that the problem is with the Age polynomial, because when the Age polynomial is not included, the predicted and fitted are equal and both fit well. Below is the same model but with Age as a linear term. m2 I do many similar analyses, and this issue with the predictions being slightly lower (or higher) than they should be often happens when Age is included as a polynomial. When I include a polynomial for Year, there is no problem and the predicted and fitted are equal, so I know the problem is not with all polynomials. m3 I've looked for answers (e.g., here ) but haven't found anything that is directly helpful. Does anyone have any insight?
