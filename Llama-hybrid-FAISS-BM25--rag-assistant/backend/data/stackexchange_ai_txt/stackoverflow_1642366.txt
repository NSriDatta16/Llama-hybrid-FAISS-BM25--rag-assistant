Well, this is what I finally did. Although it is not an optimal solution, at least it works: I force a reload of the parent by passing a dummy parameter with a timestamp on it, like this: click Generated with something like: $("#link").attr("href", "http://top.dom.com/?d="+(new Date().getTime())+"#frag"); This is ugly as hell, but at least it works
