LINQ with SQLite (linqtosql)

I have a small project that require a storage (I choose SQLite) and I got good result with the ADO DLL for .Net for Sqlite . After the Install, I noticed that it contain a SQLLinq.dll. Before investigating too much effort, and because I haven't see any good example on the web, I would like to know if anyone got any good result with SQLite and LINQ? *If linqtosql work the same way what ever the SQL database, let me know it. I was interesting with the Dll when I saw it because I never use Linqtosql before and I thought it would be a great opportunity to try,
