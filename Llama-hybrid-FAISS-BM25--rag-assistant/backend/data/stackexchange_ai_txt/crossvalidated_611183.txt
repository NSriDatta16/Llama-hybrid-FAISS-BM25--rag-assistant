Distribution for a sequence of events which the first one follows a Poisson distribution

Imagine a simple website where a user can access and can click on a button that will refresh the page. On average, 50 000 requests are made to the webserver of this website in a month. We can assume that the number of number accesses to the website(the first request) in a month follows a Poisson distribution, but we know that, after accessing the page, on an interval of 20s, on average, the user will refresh the page 9 times(make 9 more requests). What would be the distribution of the request to the server in a range of a month then? PS: One more piece of information: The website has a delay of 30ms to respond, so the user needs to wait at least 30ms to refresh the page. It's a really interesting problem that came to my mind I dare say, basically a sequence of events in which the start follows a Poisson distribution, any idea how to solve this?
