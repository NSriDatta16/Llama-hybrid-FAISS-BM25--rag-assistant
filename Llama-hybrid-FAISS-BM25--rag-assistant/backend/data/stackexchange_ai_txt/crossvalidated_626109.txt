Can I say that the relative root mean squared error is the averaged percentage error?

RMSE is an error metric in which the mean of the data minimizes its loss function: $\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}(y_t - \hat{y_t})^2}{n}}$ But it gives the error in the unit of the data. In order to have a percentage RMSE different alternatives exist : RMSE / $\text{max}(y_t)$ RMSE / $\text{mean}(y_t)$ RMSE / ( $\text{max}(y_t) - \text{min}(y_t)$ ) #if mean is zero RMSE / $\text{sd}(y_t)$ RMSE / $\text{IQR}(y_t)$ If I choose option 2, can I interpret it as simple as 'the average percentage error'? (Or should I say 'the weighted average percentage error'?) Given the fact that the interpretation of RMSE is the weighted average error . I want to make the interpretation as simple as possible for business people. Thanks
