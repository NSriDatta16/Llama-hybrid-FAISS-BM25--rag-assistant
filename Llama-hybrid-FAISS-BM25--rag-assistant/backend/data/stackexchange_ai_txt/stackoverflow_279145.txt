What is the most elegant way of bubble-sorting in F#?

What is the most elegant way of bubble-sorting in F#? UPDATE As pointed out in one of the answers, bubble sorting isn't efficient in a functional language to begin with. A humourously-cynical commenter also pointed out that bubble sorting is only appropriate when the list is small and it's almost sorted anyway. However, I'm curious to see how a clever bubble-sort can be written in F#, since I've done bubble sorts in C#, C++, and Java EE in the past, and since I'm an F# newbie.
