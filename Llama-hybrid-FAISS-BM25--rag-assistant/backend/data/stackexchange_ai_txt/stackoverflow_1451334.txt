Here is an example in C++ that simulates generators using fibers: Yield Return Iterator for Native C++ Using Fibers The "yield return" iterator is a language feature that was created for one reason: simplicity. It is generally much easier to iterate across whole collectionl, storing all context needed in local variables, rather than crafting a complicated, custom iterator object that stores its state across subsequent retrieval operations. There are also the primitive C routines setjmp, longjmp to achieve similar results. (Lua coroutines are implemented with the above method)
