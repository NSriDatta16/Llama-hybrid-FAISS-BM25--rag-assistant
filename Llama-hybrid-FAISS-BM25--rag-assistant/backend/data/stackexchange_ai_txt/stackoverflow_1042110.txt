Using scanf() in C++ programs is faster than using cin?

I don't know if this is true, but when I was reading FAQ on one of the problem providing sites, I found something, that poke my attention: Check your input/output methods. In C++, using cin and cout is too slow. Use these, and you will guarantee not being able to solve any problem with a decent amount of input or output. Use printf and scanf instead. Can someone please clarify this? Is really using scanf() in C++ programs faster than using cin >> something ? If yes, that is it a good practice to use it in C++ programs? I thought that it was C specific, though I am just learning C++...
