One solution is to eschew sessions and instead use a boolean value for if the user clicked on your CTA/button/whatever within some specified time range from their initial exposure. For example, You could measure if users click on the CTA within 24 hours of their initial exposure. Any click, would yield a 1 in their row. No click in 24 hours would yield a 0. This would yield one row per user, with a treatment status indicator and and indicator for if the outcome was observed within the desired time. Note that "power users" can not influence this metric like they can when analyzing session level outcomes; the outcome for each user is either a 0 or a 1. There are no outliers in this respect. The problem is then the comparison of success rates for two binomial random variables and you can use a z test of proportions, or a logistic regression, or whatever you want. Appropriate techniques for statistical power can be taken from there depending on which analysis you intend to perform. What you lose in this approach is the interpretation. If CTR is defined as # clicks per # impressions then we are analyzing something different (namely, the risk of observing the outcome within time t, which is of course different). Maybe that doesn't matter, maybe it does, but it is important to know you are answering a slightly different question.
