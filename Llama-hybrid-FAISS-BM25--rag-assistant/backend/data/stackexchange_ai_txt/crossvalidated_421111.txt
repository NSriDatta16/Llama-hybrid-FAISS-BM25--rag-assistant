Statistical test to check whether an item meets the specification

I have a data on emission of an automobile which a company manufactures. The emission test was conducted on roads near towns and villages and the data is as follows. According to a new rule passed by the govt., all automobiles emission should be below 550. Does the vehicle manufactured by the company meet the specification? If not, where is it being breached? Can I do this using a t-test, using group average as population mean and checking for how many standard deviations is 550 from this mean? How do I approach the other problem?
