C# WinForms - filtering one combobox based on the value of another combobox in a databound datagridview

I have 4 tables - Agents, Customers, Counties and Towns. Agents and Customers both have a Town field and a County field. I have a DataGridView for each table. These are working great. I have the Town and County as comboboxes using the Towns and Counties table as the datasource. The problem is that it does not filter the Town based on the selected County. I would like it to do this, but there is no option to filter a combobox field based on the value of another field. I have searched this up for a while but cant find anything useful. Can anyone talk me through how to do this, please? Thanks in advance. Regards, Richard PS I am using Visual Studio 2010 and mostly design view.
