Correlation of categories

I am comparing the Facebook posts of a TV news organization's Facebook Page to the contents of the TV news broadcast. (This is called "agenda setting" in communications research.) I have used a grounded theory approach to code hundreds of Facebook posts and segments of the TV show. Here is the problem: There are about 1500 Facebook posts with 500 code categories and 51 TV segments with 300 code categories. When I test the correlation, I have been testing the top 20 Facebook post categories against the number of times the same categories appear on the TV show. Some people have suggested that I need to test all of the Facebook categories against all of the TV show categories. Is this true? They are not equal in number. As a compromise I have converted the number of times a code appears in Facebook or on TV to percentage - percentage out of 1500 for Facebook and percentage out of 51 for the TV show. Does this seem reasonable? Is there a better way to do this without comparing the 500 to the 300 codes. I am using Pearson's correlation coefficient.
