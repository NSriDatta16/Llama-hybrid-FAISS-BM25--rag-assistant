As unwind said , your array is about half a terabyte. You need a disk big enough, and a pagefile big enough. Then, you probably also need an extremely extremely large RAM. Finally, your cache size also matters, so the order you access elements will make a huge difference. Address calculation will be in the noise. If this is actually a sparse array, you should treat it as such. In fact, organizing it with pointer arrays might be a good way to do that. As it is, simply loading data into that array, if done in the fastest possible way, might take hours. BTW, I hope you are on a 64-bit machine. A 32-bit address can only access about 4 GB.
