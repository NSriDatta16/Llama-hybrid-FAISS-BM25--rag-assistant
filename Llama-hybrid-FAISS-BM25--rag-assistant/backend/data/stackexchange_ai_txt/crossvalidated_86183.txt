David Binkley provides a literature review summarizing current work done in the field of (semi-) automated analysis of source code. He discusses many recent papers which might point you in the right direction of your particular question. Alternatively, Ugurel et al. (2002) develope machine learning methods to automatically classify archived source code. Overall it is difficult to direct you to more specific papers given the amount of information provided in the question and the size of this literature which has been rapidly expanding over the past twenty years. I hope the above literature review or the Ugurel paper will get you somewhere. References - Binkley, D. (2007) "Source Code Analysis: a road map" - Ugurel, S. et al. (2002) "What's the code?
