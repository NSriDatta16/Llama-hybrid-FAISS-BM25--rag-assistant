Exclude file types in teamcity artifacts

I'm just about to setup teamcity for the first time on my own. Very nice and simple in most ways I have to say. However, I have one issue that I haven't manage to solve and find any information about. When I wanna publish my artifacts I want to exclude some file types. example: %system.agent.work.dir%\trunk\Source\Projects\Webproject.Web/Controllers => Webproject.Web/Controllers However, I don't want to copy all the .cs files in the folder. I just need the folder. Is it possible to copy just the folder and not the content, and then copy what ever content I need? Or can I exclude files if I copy a directory?
