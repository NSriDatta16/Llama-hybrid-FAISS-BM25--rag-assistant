Tooltip on scrollviewer in documentviewer

I have a documentviewer which i used in my wpf project to show xps document reports of having around 600 pages which is working great. But from user point of view i like to show the current page number as a tooltip on my scrollviewer while dragging the scroll stating the current page number in view. Somewhat like in a PDF file like this - I was looking out for some ideas how to implement this. Just a current page number if not possible to show a thumbnail image would be good enough for me. Is there any in-built support in documentviewer for this functionality?? Thanks for any help..
