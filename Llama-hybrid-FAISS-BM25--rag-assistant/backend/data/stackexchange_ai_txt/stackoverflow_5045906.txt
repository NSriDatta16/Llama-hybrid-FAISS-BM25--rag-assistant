Shells like Bash are quite powerful but I think you'll find that their limited support for arrays, no support for hashtables, and other limitations would make it tedious to implement anything more than very basic algorithms. Python or Perl would be a much better general scripting language. (added later) Since learning that Bash 4 has associative arrays, I'd like to add that implementing some algorithms with shell scripts could be done. It wouldn't be fast, and wouldn't be elegant, would be tedious as hell, and limited in its application; but if you want to be forced to learn the intricacies of the shell while you learn to implement algorithms, that is, purely as a mental exercise, this might be a good thing for you.
