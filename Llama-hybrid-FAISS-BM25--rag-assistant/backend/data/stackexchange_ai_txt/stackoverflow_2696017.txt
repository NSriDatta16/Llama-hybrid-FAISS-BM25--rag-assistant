You'll probably have to use a windows browser to fake the browser-agent header. This page gives more information as well as the browser agent string. You could use Chris Pederick's User Agent Switcher in Firefox, but you won't get webkit rendering. The best option is probably to use the developer tools in Safari and change the browser agent in the Develop menu. You should also make sure your screen size matches the iPad (1024x768 if I'm not mistaken). To test landscape, just change the screen size. What you won't get is multitouch and gesture testing... What are you actually trying to test? If it's just a website, that should be sufficient.
