There's something you can do to intercept the touch in both views. Top view: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Do code in the top view [bottomView touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; // And pass them on to bottomView // You have to implement the code for touchesBegan, touchesEnded, touchesCancelled in top/bottom view. } But that's the idea.
