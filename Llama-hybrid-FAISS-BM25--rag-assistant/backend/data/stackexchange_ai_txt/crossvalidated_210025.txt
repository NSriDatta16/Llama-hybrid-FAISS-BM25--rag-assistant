Power of Uniform Distribution?

In the Bayesian analysis, $\mathtt{rjags}$ in particular, it is very frequent to see the code: sigma ~ dunif(0, 100) sigma.1 But, what does this mean? Is this meaning that $\sigma\sim Unif(0.01, 100)$ and $\sigma_1=\sigma^{-2}$ and we are doing a transformation of the uniform distribution? As I do the transformation, I got the pdf of $\sigma_1$ to be $\frac{y}{50}$ over $(100^{-2}, +\infty)$, which indeed is not a valid density if I did not make any mistake in my calculations. Any explanations? Thanks!
