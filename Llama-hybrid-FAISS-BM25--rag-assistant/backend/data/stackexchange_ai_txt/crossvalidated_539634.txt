Rank of Logistic Regression Model

I've built a logistic regression model in R using below lines of code. I tried extracting an element of model object called rank. How is this rank calculated internally? fit = glm(vs ~ hp + mpg, mtcars, family = "binomial") fit$rank # returns 3 Is it simply 1 more than number of independent variables?
