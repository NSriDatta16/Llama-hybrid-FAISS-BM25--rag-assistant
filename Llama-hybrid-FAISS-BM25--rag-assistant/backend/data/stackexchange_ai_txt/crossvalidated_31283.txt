MCMCpack has implemented a multinomial logit which will probably be considerably faster than one you've implemented yourself in JAGS, presuming that it meets your needs. MCMCmnl(formula, baseline=NULL, data=NULL, burnin = 1000, mcmc = 10000, thin = 1, mcmc.method = c("IndMH", "RWM", "slice"), tune = 1, tdf=6, verbose = 0, seed = NA, beta.start = NA, b0 = 0, B0 = 0, ...)
