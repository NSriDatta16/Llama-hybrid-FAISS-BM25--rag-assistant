Appropriateness of ANOVA after k-means cluster analysis

The notification after the ANOVA table after K-means analysis indicates that significance levels should not be looked at as the test of equal means, as the cluster solution has been derived based on Euclidean distance to maximize the distance. What test should I use to show whether the means of the clustering variables differ among the clusters? I have seen this warning in k-means outputs' provided ANOVA table, but in some references I see that post-hoc ANOVA tests are run. Should I ignore k-mean ANOVA outputs and run one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests and interpret them in a traditional way? Or can I only imply about magnitude of F value and which variables contributed more to difference? Another confusion is that clustering variables are not normally distributed violating assumption of ANOVA, then I could use Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test, but it has assumption about the same distributions. The inter-cluster distributions for the specific variables do not seem the same, some are positively skewed, some are negatively... I have 1275 large sample, 5 clusters, 10 clustering variables measured in PCA scores.
