I browse with Firefox, so I use Foxmarks to organize and sync. all my bookmarks across all my computers (you can also access them on a web page) I have a special folder called "Brain" where I store all my good code links, generally i just store obscure little hacks that are hard to find, along with some of the good programming blogs / sites I visit often. I organize them using sub folders etc. Also, when I come across an article and I don't have time to read it, I just Read It Later , then when I have time I read it over, either I trash it, or bookmark it. Also, I subscribe to a bunch of different sites using Google Reader.
