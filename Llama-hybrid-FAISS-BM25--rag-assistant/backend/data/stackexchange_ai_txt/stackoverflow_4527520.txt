I doubt you'll be able to check the external parent page's URL because the Same Origin Policy should prevent access to any of its properties. Maybe there is some trickery that I'm aware of that allows it anyway. Barring that, the best idea that comes to my mind is checking document.referrer . As far as I know, a document requested in an iframe will always have the embedding page's URL in the referrer across browsers. If the referrer is http://www.bar.com/page2.html , the page is either in an iframe on that page, or it was linked to from there (which is the only really big shortcoming of this method: You can't tell for 100% sure whether it's an incoming link, or an iframe embed). Obviously, the document's referrer is spoofable by the client but I don't think that's an issue here.
