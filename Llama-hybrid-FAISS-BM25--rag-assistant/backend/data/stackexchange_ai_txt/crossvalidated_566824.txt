How to understand the density in machine learning?

We can calculate the conditional density using Eq.1[ 3 ]. $$ p_{\theta, \Lambda}(y \mid \boldsymbol{x})=\frac{\exp \left(f_{\theta, \Lambda}(\boldsymbol{x})[y]\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \exp \left(f_{\theta, \Lambda}(\boldsymbol{x})[k]\right)}\tag{1} $$ where $f$ is the classifier. $f_{\theta, \Lambda}[k]$ represents the $k^{th}$ output of the last layer. However, I cannot understand the sample space[ 4 ] of $x$ (an event in the sample space of $x$ is a pixel or an image?) a and $y$ (an event in the sample space of $y$ is outputting a certain logit vector or choosing $y$ as the prediction?). Moreover, I don't know how to calculate $p(x,y)$ . Assume that there are 6 images in the dataset and there are only 4 pixels ( $x_0$ , $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $x_3$ ) in each image. The images belong to 3 classes(i.e. the ground truth $y$ is 0, 1, and 2). Here is the dataset: After the neural network to classify these images is trained, we can get the density of the dataset using Eq.1: Then how can we calculate $p(x,y)$ using the above dataset and classifier(can we use $p(x,y)=p(y \mid x)p(x)$ to calculate $p(x,y)$ ? What's more, what's the difference between density and probability in machine learning? Can anyone help me? Thanks very much.
