Stopping a jQuery Content Slider while Flash content plays

Does anyone know a simple script that one could add to a custom jQuery content slider that would make the slider stop while Flash content is being played inside? Or, alternatively, just make the slider stop while hovering the mouse over it? All the best, Robert
