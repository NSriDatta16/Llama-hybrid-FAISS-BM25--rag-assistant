I know this is an old question, but there's an important aspect of it that hasn't been addressed... Are you refering to a library symbol that is declared to be a "Graphic" (as opposed to a MovieClip or Button)? If you are referring to the notion of a Library symbol that is a "Graphic" then you can't. A Graphic can be thought of like a glorified "group" with the main difference being that a Graphic lives in the Library while a group does not. Like a group, a Graphic allows you collect different items together in a single "container" and manipulate them in the .fla, but it doesn't actually exist as a programmatic construct in the published swf... so you can't add script or commands to a Graphic because as far as the flash player is concerned There is no graphic. As an experiment, you can create a movieclip symbol in the library, then create another library item that is a graphic containing the movieclip. Put both of these on frame 1 of an empty fla, with the following code: for(var i:int = 0 ; ilen:int = this.numChildren ; i Notice that both children are your MovieClip... the graphic is nowhere to be found. This is why you can't add any script to a Graphic. So what can you do to solve this? If you absolutely need that symbol to be a Graphic in the library, and you absolutely need to be able to drag and drop it as a whole (or perform any other action on it) then you need to put it inside a MovieClip container and then drag/drop that MovieClip.
