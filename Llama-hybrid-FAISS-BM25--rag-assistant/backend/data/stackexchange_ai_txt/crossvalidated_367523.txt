before receipt of your actual recorded data .. since your series has anomalies ( pulses to be sure ... ) possible seasonal pulses since your series has possible change in error model variance over time .. your acf is of little value as it is effected by non-gaussian structure. correct model identification is done in a robust way. see I have correlogram ACF and PACF below for a temperature time series. Can I say it is MA(2) from ACF? What about AR? for further comments.
