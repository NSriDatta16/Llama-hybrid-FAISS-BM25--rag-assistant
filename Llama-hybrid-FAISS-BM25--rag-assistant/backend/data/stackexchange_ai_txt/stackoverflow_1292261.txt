Have a look in the urllib2 source, at the line specified by the traceback: File "C:\Python26\lib\urllib2.py", line 1105, in do_open raise URLError(err) There you'll see the following fragment: try: h.request(req.get_method(), req.get_selector(), req.data, headers) r = h.getresponse() except socket.error, err: # XXX what error? raise URLError(err) So, it looks like the source is a socket error, not an HTTP protocol related error. Possible reasons: you are not on line, you are behind a restrictive firewall, your DNS is down,... All this aside from the fact, as mcandre pointed out, that your code is wrong.
