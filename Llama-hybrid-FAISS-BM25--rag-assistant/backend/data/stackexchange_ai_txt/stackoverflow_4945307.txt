Can someone explain Magentos Indexing feature in detail?

I kind of get how the indexing in Magento works, but I haven't seen any good documentation on this. I would kind of like to know the following. How it works What is its purpose Why is it important What are the details everyone should know about it Anything else that can help someone fully understand what indexing is and how it is used in Magento I think having this information will be of great use for others in my boat that don't fully get the indexing process. UPDATE: After the comment on my question and Ankur's answer, I am thinking I am missing something in my knowledge of just normal Database Indexing. So is this just Magento's version of handling indexing and is it better for me to get my answer in terms of Database indexing in general, such as this link here How does database indexing work?
