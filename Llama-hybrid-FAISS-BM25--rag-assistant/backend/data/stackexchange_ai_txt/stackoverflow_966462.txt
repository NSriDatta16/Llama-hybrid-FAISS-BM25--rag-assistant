How much video are you thinking of using? You can buy huge drives fairly cheaply now. I'd try to store it on-site if possible rather than going through a 3rd party... You'll have much easier access to the data and will be able to change the structure as you want. It's hard to recommend any method of storage without details of how the site will be used. i.e. are all videos 'owned' by a registered user, or are they all communally owned etc??
