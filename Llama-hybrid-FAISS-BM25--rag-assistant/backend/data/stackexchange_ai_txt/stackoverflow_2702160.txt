I am going to try to answer my question because I think this is the only way it could be: The only way server side controls get created is on the server thus you can trust that they will have the id that you set them too. This is one reason the controls must be created on every page instantiation. You may not trust any form submitted data but controls and there IDs are generate server side and thus safe. Likewise, it is not possible to edit the HTML to ever generate a server side control. Thus my method is relatively secure even if it is not elegant. The only security flaw is the id revealed.
