If you want to get it to work, as opposed to implementing a more elegant solution. ==================== Workaround: Its a security vunerability (but you said you must just get it to work)... however, have you tried adding the IUSR and IWAM accounts to the local activation and launch permissions for the COM+ application in question? steps: open Dcomcnfg.exe open Component Services > My computer > DCOM Config Search for {00024500-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} right click properties > go to the Security tab under launch/activation permissions, click customise and edit make sure Admins, interactive, service and system are already added (local launch/act only) its classic ASP (on IIS 5 or 6 i assume) so try machine IUSR and IWAM accounts intially. If adding these doesn't work (local act and launch), if you have app pools try adding the account used for the application pool also (lookup the identity tab of the app pool). click ok/ok/ok. restart IIS/app pool.
