confusing notion in Bayesian inference

My confusion is on the observed data $D$, I think for $D$, (1) it could be only one observation, and it could be multiple observation, correct? (2) when there are multiple observations, do we need to assume the multiple observation are independent? I have the confusion here since I referred some text book and wiki, but do not see it is always mentioned the multiple observations are independent. Want to confirm with the expert here, (3) when there are multiple observations and they are independent, then $P(D_1,D_2,...,D_n|w)$ = $P(D_1|w)*P(D_2|w)*...*P(D_n|w)$, correct?
