Cox model vs. Fine-Gray: hazard ratios & predicted cumulative incidence under competing risks

I am unclear about deriving both hazard ratios and a predicted cumulative incidence curves under competing risks. After reading this interesting article: https://statisticalhorizons.com/for-causal-analysis-of-competing-risks/ I was under the impression that the most approriate way to estimate hazard ratios (for effect estimation / causal inference) under competing risks, is to perform an oridnary Cox model, but censor at the time of the competing event. So if the focal event is diagnosis of x, but competing risk is death, then we truncate the time to x variable at time of death i.e. censor on death. I believe this is then simply called the cause-specific hazard model. Often we also want to estimate adjusted (predicted) cumulative incidence, which can be done after fitting the Cox model, see here: Can we compute predicted cumulative incidence after fitting a Cox model? However, since the Fine Gray method (as I understand it) models the cumulative incidence (i.e. as the response variable), isn't that the best way to get a predicted cumulative incidence curve under competing risks? Indeed, in this linked article, it says in the third from last paragraph that "Cumulative incidence functions are particularly useful for prediction" , also see post from @FrankHarrell: https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1297258973163331589?lang=en
