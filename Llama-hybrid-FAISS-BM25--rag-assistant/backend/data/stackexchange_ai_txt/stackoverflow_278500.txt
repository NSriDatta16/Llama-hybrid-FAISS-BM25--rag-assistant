Do you have the "View extensions for known types" option on? EDIT: @Comments.... Yes, its a stupid/insulting question, but when troubleshooting a problem I have learned to assume nothing, and trust the users 0%. BUT, I tried it, and you're right. Its stupid that MS has this kind of behavior, and it can only lead to security vulnerabilities, which led me on a search for your answer. From the posts at http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jan/0444.html "You have stumbled on an age-old quirky behavior of Windows. Office document formats are based on a standard Windows container format, OLE structured storage files, also known as "docfiles". A docfile's name and extension are irrelevant - the file is, conceptually, a serialization of an OLE object, and like all serialization formats it contains the identifier of the application that produced it, in the form of an OLE class id (in GUID format) in this case. You can easily verify that it doesn't work with the newer Office XML formats" Indeed it doesnt work for the 2007 *X file types, but 2K3 is still a problem. To solve this problem... Upgrade! =) And here at security focus under TOC point 2. So, there you go.
