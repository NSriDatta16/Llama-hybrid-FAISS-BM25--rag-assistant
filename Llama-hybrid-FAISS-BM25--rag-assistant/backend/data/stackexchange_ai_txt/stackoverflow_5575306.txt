Why can't you just do: String result = dom.toXML().toString(); If you want to do it the long way, then you use a TransformerFactory to transform the DOM to anything you want. First thing you do is wrap your Document in a DOMSource DOMSource domSource = new DOMSource(document); Prepare a StringWriter so we can route the stream to a String: StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); StreamResult streamResult = new StreamResult(writer); Prepare a TransformationFactory so you can transform the DOM to the source provided: TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = transformerFactory .newTransformer(); transformer.transform(domSource, streamResult); Finally, you get the String : String result = writer.toString(); Hope that helped!
