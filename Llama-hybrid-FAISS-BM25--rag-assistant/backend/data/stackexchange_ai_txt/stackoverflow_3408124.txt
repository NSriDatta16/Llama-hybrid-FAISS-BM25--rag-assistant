I have recently just completed the major work for a site that does much of what you're trying to do. I use the HIJAX technique, which is similiar to what you are doing. The major SEO concern is that your site be accessible with full titles, and meta keys, WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT. That is the way web spiders (google, bing, yahoo, et al) will crawl your site. to make the site dynamic for visitors, I recommend embedding a hidden span inside of the content that is returned via ajax. Inside of this span, include the page title using PHP. then use javascript to get the content of that span, and set the document.title to it. Summary: make the site function without javascript Add ajax to hijax links insert a hidden dom node inside of the returned ajax contents Parse that hidden node for it's title on ajax success, and set the document.title to it.
