First Come, First Served process scheduling

i have 4 processes: p1 - bursts 5, priority: 3 p2 - bursts 8, priority: 2 p3 - bursts 12, priority: 2 p4 - bursts 6, priority: 1 Assuming that all processes arrive at the scheduler at the same time what is the average response time and average turnaround time? For FCFS is it ok to have them in the order p1, p2, p3, p4 in the execution queue?
