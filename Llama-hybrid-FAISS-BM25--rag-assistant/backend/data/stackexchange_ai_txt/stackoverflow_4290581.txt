perldoc perlpod says that "every command needs the blank line after it, to end its paragraph" and "Many older Pod translators require the lines before every Pod command and after every Pod command (including "=cut"!) to be a blank line". Paragraphs are delineated by blank lines, so I find it difficult to imagine starting a command paragraph without a blank line immediately preceding it. Maybe at the start of a file? Note that in Perl 6, Pod is redefined so that blank lines around commands (before and after) are no longer necessary.
