How to re-trigger (or late-trigger) a `mousedown` event in jQuery?

One question bugs my mind lately: In a mousedown handler I use .preventDefault on the event to prevent text selection while dragging: $(document).bind('mousedown', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); }); So far so good. Then, while still having the mouse button pressed down, I would like to wait for a longclick event to be triggered ( http://github.com/pisi/Longclick ) and have the longclick handler to somehow resume the original mousedown event and commence the text selection like if the event's default wasn't ever prevented. Is there a way to kind of late-trigger an otherwise native mouse event? Is .trigger capable to somehow accept an existing (stored) event object? For example something like this?: var originalEvent; $(document) .bind('mousedown', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); originalEvent= event; }) .bind('longclick', function(event){ $(event.target).trigger(originalEvent) }) I'm after being able to drag an entire text paragraph and still offer the possibility to perform text selection within the paragraph. All answers, suggestions and thoughts are welcome!
