• When analyzing the the time series, does strucchange consider possible arima structure? No . It ignores this without telling you that explicitly since it doesn’t allow you to pre-specify OR to identify the arima structure it is implicitly telling you NO. •I know that other predictors have a relationship on with dependent variable: is it possible to consider the effect of these (and possible lagged effects, too?) NO . It ignores this without telling you that explicitly since it doesn’t allow you to pre-specify OR to identify the confounder regression structure it is implicitly telling you NO. • can strucchange not only detect level changes/pulses, but trend changes as well? Implicitly YES since you were able to do it by setting a switch/control BUT not explicitly in the way that you want as delivered by AUTOBOX where time variables are included as causal series. • can I test for the significance of the detected breakpoints/interventions to avoid considering spurious level shifts? NO that requires estimation of a model’s parameters and computation of t tests Is there any (freely) available program that can help me with my question? NO ( to my knowledge ! As a disclaimer I am one of the developers of AUTOBOX a time series analysis piece of software) NOTE: Your question is primarily abour software AND that is usually off-limits here and may me deleted by a moderator
