Customising Objective Function in R

I wondered if there were R packages that allow the user to customise the loss function? For example, if a random forest package like ranger had a loss function which minimises OOB MSE. Is it somehow possible to customise this into a model which minimises negative log likelihood? Would appreciate if someone knew of examples/code of doing this on a toy dataset
