Catch an exception/error from an OCX hosted in a .NET Windows Form

I have a .NET Windows Form that I use to host an older VB6 OCX form. That’s something I can’t run from! At least for now... I’m not sure if this paragraph will be useful, but just in case I will share this information. In order to load this control, my .NET application provides a configuration file that will contain the information about the OCX control. I will then load the control using reflection, create an instance with Activator.CreateInstance and cast this object to a System.Windows.Forms.Control. Then, I add it my .NET form’s Controls collection. This approach works for me. So, what I want is to catch the OCX exceptions and errors in my .NET Form, or to have any way of knowing that this OCX form crashed. Is this possible? Did anyone have a similar experience? By the way, I’m using .NET 2.0. Thanks.
