which is irrelevant because I just need the tag attributes I am not sure where are the attributes in your example. And am no PHP xpath implementation expert. However you may try the following: use the text() xpath function at the end of your expression (e.g. "/html/head/text()" ) to get only the text nodes, not tags the xpath function should return a NodeList. You shoud use that to get an entire fragment XML - e.g. DOMXpath does just that.
