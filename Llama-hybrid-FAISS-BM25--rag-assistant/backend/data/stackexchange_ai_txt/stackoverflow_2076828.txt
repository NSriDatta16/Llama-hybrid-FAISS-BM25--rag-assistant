AppDelegate is nothing more than a common NSObject class with needed connections in MainMenu.xib. You can easily recreate your own: Create a class, name it AppDelegate Open MainMenu.xib and add NSObject object to object palette In object inspector's Identity tab (the last one) set object's class to AppDelegate (you should get autocomplete) Ctrl+drag from Application object to your newly created AppDelegate object and choose "delegate" from opened panel.
