There's nothing wrong with it, though you will raise eyebrows. The primary advantage of keeping the access specifiers separate is it encourages placing all the private members and methods at the top of the class -- together. If your class is too big to fit on one screenfull than it probably should be either broken up into more than one class, and/or any implicitly inline functions should be explicitly declared inline with the implementation moved out of the class.
