TFS 2010 CI Build with two UI projects

Ok, so I'm a total newbie to TFS and automated builds. I see how to set up a CI build in TFS pretty easily, along with the drop folder for output files. However, my solution has two UI projects in it. One is our main website, the other is a mobile site. When developers check in, basically what I want to happen is for a CI build to fire, and then publish the "mobile" project to one server and the "website" project to another. On a very high level, what steps do I need to take to make this happen? I'm not looking for a detailed explanation, I can Google individual things as needed I just want to know the basic process and what tools are leveraged to make this happen.
