MVC: Lots of small models or a couple of big models?

I am in the process of writing and organizing my unfinished application in codeigniter and I am just wondering weather it is better to have lots of small models, so your only loading what you need when you need it; or making a couple of big models so it just loads all functions even though you only need one of them? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
