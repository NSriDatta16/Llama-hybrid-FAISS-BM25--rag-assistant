A uniform distribution has an upper and a lower bound. If you use your proposed method, and your deltas happen to be chosen large enough that you run into the upper bound before you have generated all your numbers, what would your algorithm do next? Having said that, you may want to investigate the Poisson distribution , which is the distribution of interval times between random events occurring with a given average frequency.
