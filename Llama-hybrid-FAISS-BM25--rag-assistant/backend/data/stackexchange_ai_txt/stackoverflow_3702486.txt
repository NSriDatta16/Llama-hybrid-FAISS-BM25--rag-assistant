Windows 7 - WPF - Framework 3.5 - Content not displaying in developer or when running

Help. I seem to have broken WPF 3.5 on my development box. If I bring up VS2008 and create a new, blank WPF app, it does not display the designer. If fact, I can see the desktop wallpaper through VS 2008. If I run the app, I get a window with the same see-through properties. Plus if I drag the app window around, it leaves artifiacts all over the screen. If I create a new WPF 4.0 app in VS 2010 - no problem. If I target the app to 3.5 - the designer does not go crazy, but I get the same run-time issue as with VS 2008. Please help! L. Lee Saunders
