Windows Forms or WPF - Remember User Profile on DataGridViews

I have some tab controls on a windows form. For each of these tabs I might want to be able to sort by the column header, apply a filter, change the order that the columns are displayed in, and also add additional columns from a predetermined list. The question I have is using Windows Form (Current Implementation) or making the tab controls WPF and embedding them in the Windows Form, how could I implement a feature such as remebering the users state of each tab, when i.e. they have changed the order of columns, have this persisted when they leave the form and when they reopen it, for the changes be applied to the control. I know there is a similar profile framework in ASP.NET but is there a similar thing for Windows Forms/WPF. I am currently in .NET 3.5 with a view to moving to .NET 4.0 soon. The code base is C# If anyone has a link to any articles or suggestions I would be very grateful. Cheers
