I'm not sure exactly what behavior you're seeing for VS2005, but it shouldn't be the case that "most of the Visual Studio used .NET 2.0 but I was able to make use of an assembly targeting .NET 4.0 framework". That config should cause everything in the process to run on v4. If this is not the case, I'd certainly like to know about it because it's likely a bug. (BTW, I'm sure you realize that you're outside a supported scenario by rolling VS2005 forward to v4.) As to the invalid operation exception, my guess would be that you're hitting some kind of incompatibility between frameworks. I'm sure we'd like to get a bug on that as well. Can you share the stack trace at the exception? As far as taking an incremental upgrade approach... There is not really a good answer. The CLR supports in-proc SxS activation automatically for COM components, so if your app is implemented in a way where you can extract modules as COM components, then you could leverage that. The problem is that most apps are not written in this way, and simply upgrading everything to v4 is less work that re-architecting the app. Individual assembly loads occur in the runtime that triggered the load. There's no in-proc SxS activation for normal assembly loads.
