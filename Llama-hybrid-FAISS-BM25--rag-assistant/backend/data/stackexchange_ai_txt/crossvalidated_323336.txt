Mini-metanalysis repetead mesures ANOVA 2x2 interaction

I performed two studies on the relation between the stimulus valence (positive/negative) and the action tendencies (approach/avoid) measured with TMS motor evoked potentials technique. For each study I performed a Repeated Measures ANOVA with the 2 within factor (the stimulus valence and the action tendencies). I got a highly significant interaction in the first study and just a tendency in the expected direction in the second study (p=.08). Thus, we decided to do a mini metanalysis to present the results in a scientific paper. Both the studies have the same design, the same experimental question, study 2 is different from study 1 just for the manipulation of a variable concerning the experimental setting and also the samples are independent. I would like to know whether it is correct to calculate Cohen d as effect size in each study, the correct formula. Moreover, once that I have the effect size for each study, I guess I have to average the two effect size, do I need to weight the variance in the mean effect size?
