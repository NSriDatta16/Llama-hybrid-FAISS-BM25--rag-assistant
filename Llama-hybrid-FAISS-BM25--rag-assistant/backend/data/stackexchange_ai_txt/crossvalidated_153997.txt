Multinomial distribution pdf and fisher information matrix

The question is from Robert Hogg et al's Introduction to Mathematical Statistics 6th Edition Page 347 Example 6.4.5. It says: Consider a random trial which can result in one, and only one, of k outcomes or categories. Let $X_j$ be 1 or 0 depending on whether the $jth$ outcome occurs or does not, for $j = 1, . . . , k$ . Suppose the probability that outcome $j$ occurs is $p_j$ ; hence, $\sum_{j=1}^{k}p_j=1$ . Let $X = (X_1, . . . , X_{k−1})'$ and $p = (p_1, . . . , p_{k−1})'$ . The distribution of X is multinomial; see Section 3.1. Recall that the pmf is given by $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{p})=(\prod_{j=1}^{k-1}{p_{j}}^{x_j}){(1-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}p_j)}^{1-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}x_j}$ My question is for the last term why it is : ${(1-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}p_j)}^{1-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}x_j}$ ? It think it should be ${(1-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}p_j)}^{\mathbf{n}-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}x_j}$ . Is it a typo? or just because it doesn't matter whether it is a "1" or "n" for fisher information matrix then the authors leave it as a "1" there.
