Django and GeoSpatial Queries on Google App Engine - How to overcome the 'one inequality per query' issue?

I've just began to use the GAE and I have stumbled upon an issue which has let me questioning the feasibility of using Django on GAE. All I'm trying to do is a simple query with Django's ORM: addresses = Address.objects.filter(lat__gte=form.cleaned_data['north_east_lat']) addresses = addresses.filter(lat__lte=form.cleaned_data['south_west_lat']) addresses = addresses.filter(lon__gte=form.cleaned_data['north_east_lon']) addresses = addresses.filter(lon__lte=form.cleaned_data['south_west_lon']) But apparently it's not that easy with Bigtable: BadFilterError: invalid filter: Only one property per query may have inequality filters ( =, ).. How can I get around this issue? (Using Django's ORM preferably)
