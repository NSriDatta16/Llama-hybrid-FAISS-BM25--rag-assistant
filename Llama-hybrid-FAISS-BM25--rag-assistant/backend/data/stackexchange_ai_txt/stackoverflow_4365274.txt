ASP.NET DragPanelExtender

I have 3 colums with a lot of boxes in it. I'm trying to drag all those different boxes. So far so good. But I can't put them between two boxes, they're just in front of each other. A second problem is that when the page refreshes the boxes are back on their begin position, but I want them on the new position till I move them again. Can some one help me? Thanks! The code is on: link text because I had a problem with this editor and the ASP.NET code.
