There is a very elegant way to do this with Applicative Functors: import Control.Applicative (,) [1,2,3] [4,5,6] -- [(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)] The basic idea is to apply a function on "wrapped" arguments, e.g. (+) (Just 4) (Just 10) -- Just 14 In case of lists, the function will be applied to all combinations, so all you have to do is to "tuple" them with (,) . See http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#applicative-functors or (more theoretical) http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf for details.
