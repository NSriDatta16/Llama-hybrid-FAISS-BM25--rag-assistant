how "Continuous control with Gaussian policies" are compute?

in blog about Reinforcement learning in part, they discuss "Continuous control with Gaussian policies" Hui define the values for actions as Gaussian distributed . and the policy is defined using a Gaussian distribution with means computed from a deep network: . I have questions about how he compute the partial derivative of the log Ï€ as: and then how backpropagate update become
