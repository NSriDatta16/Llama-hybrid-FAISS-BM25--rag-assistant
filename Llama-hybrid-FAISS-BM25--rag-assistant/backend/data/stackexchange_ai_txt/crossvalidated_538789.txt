A farmer is growing a magical tree

This is not homework. It's a story I came up with to explain a statistical distribution I became interested in. If this is a known distribution, I'd love to be pointed in that direction. A farmer has planted a crop of magical trees. Each tree has one long root that runs near the surface of the soil. This species of magical tree sprouts one flower each day from its surface root. That sprouting flower is randomly placed along the root . However, if the sprouting flower is further from the trunk than another flower, it does not grow . Perhaps this is because the flowers closer to the trunk soak up all the nutrients that would have allowed a new flower to sprout. Here's an example of what a magical root could experience. _ is the root, f is a flower, n is a new flower that's trying to sprout, || is the trunk Day 0. ||____________________ Day 1. ||___________n________ new flower attempts to sprout Day 2. ||_____n_____f________ flower from yesterday grew up, new flower attempts to sprout Day 3. ||_____f__n__f________ flower from yesterday grew up, new flower attempts to sprout Day 4. ||_____f_____f____n___ flower from yesterday did not grow, new flower attempts to sprout Day 5. ||__n__f_____f________ flower from yesterday did not grow, new flower attempts to sprout Day 6. ||__f__f_____f___n____ flower from yesterday grew up, new flower attempts to sprout Assume that the root is infinitely long (i.e. the root is best described by the reals, where the location of each flower is between $(0, 1)$ ). Questions I have: How many flowers can a farmer expect to harvest from the average magical tree after 100 days of growth (including the newly sprouted flowers on the 100th day)? After n days? What's the average location of a flower (given as a real number $x$ between 0 and 1) after 100 days? After n days? I know the answer to these questions by writing a program for it, but I'd love to better understand how to calculate this theoretically. If this doesn't belong here, I'm happy to move it to a different stack exchange.
