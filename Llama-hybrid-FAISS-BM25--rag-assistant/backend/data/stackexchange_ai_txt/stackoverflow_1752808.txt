NetBeans profiler is probably the best out of free ones. It does its job well, there are no special hints on working with the profiler itself. With respect to your code, pay attention to hashmaps where you cache something (especially static ones). Very often they are the sources of memory leaks. Try using WeakHashMap for caching (roughly, it doesn't create strong references to the cached values).
