asp.net mvc file path issue \

i am using this to create a new folder System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(@" + somevariable); the thing is that when i enter the folder c:\newfolder\newfolder in the textbox and is trying to recieve the value up in the controller it is replaced with double slash( \) c:\\newfolder\\newfolder . how would i prevent \ quotes from coming in the path Secondly the string.replace is also not working for replacing \ with \\ string strText = OrganMeta.vcr_MetaValue; string gf = strText.Replace("\\", @"\");
