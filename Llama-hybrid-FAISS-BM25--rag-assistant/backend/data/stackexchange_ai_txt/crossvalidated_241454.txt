How to compare linear regression and classification trees? [without measuring error]

Im trying to show how both linear regression and classification tree performed on a dataset. I know by this and this that RMSE or MAPE are adequate metrics to assess goodness of fit, but Im in a working enviroment where people can understand the concepts of correlation and average only. I thought comparing the correlation of predicted values and the observed ones for each model would be ok for my purpose, but I don't know if there is a huge mistake I'm comitting in doing so.
