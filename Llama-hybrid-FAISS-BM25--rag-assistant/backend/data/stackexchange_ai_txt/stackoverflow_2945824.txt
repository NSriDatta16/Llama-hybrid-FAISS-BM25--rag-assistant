Is it possible to get Semantic (emacs) to visit all files automatically?

From what I can tell from the docs, semantic works by slowly building up an idea of what's in your project by analysing each file (and possibly its neighbours) as you visit them. This is too slow. I'd like to just have it visit all the files in my project. Is there an easy way to do this? Having to visit hundreds of files before I can get decent autocomplete working seems crazy. I've also got a etags file generated. Can I leverage that somehow? Relevant info: Emacs on Windows, version 23.2.1
