Detect seasonality/ periodicity of a univariate time series with consecutive zeroes

I am working on a time series problem with a single variable which has consecutive zeroes at different periods. The TS plot looks like this: Upon closer examination, the variable has consecutive zeroes in between spikes of activity. Following are the acf and pacf plots. I am not quite able to wrap my head around these. Any pointers on which techniques could be used to develop a forecast model for such data? EDIT: Because the initial time series plot looked very much like a stationary differenced series, i tried to apply a inverse (discrete integration) on it. Here is what the plots look like: Acf and Pacf indicate an AR(1) component. I am very new to forecasting, so I am doubtful if this makes sense.
