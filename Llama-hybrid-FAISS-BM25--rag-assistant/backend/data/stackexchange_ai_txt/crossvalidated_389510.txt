In your answer, there are some fundamental mistakes regarding Bayesian networks. but the v-structure of the graph tells me that X is independent of Z... If $Z$ is dependent on $X$ , $X$ cannot be independent of $Z$ . The arrow direction doesn't matter. Independence is symmetric. The graph tells the parent nodes of each node, while writing the joint PDF. The rest is corollary, i.e. your joint PDF is $P(X,Y,Z)=P(Z|X,Y)P(X)P(Y)$ . Implications of this joint PDF (i.e. network) are: $X$ and $Y$ are independent given nothing, but dependent given $Z$ . $X$ and $Z$ or $Y$ and $Z$ are dependent. For the other condition, you state that $P( X = T ) but it seems you got rid of $Z$ assuming independence. Your actual condition was $P(X = T|Z = T) .
