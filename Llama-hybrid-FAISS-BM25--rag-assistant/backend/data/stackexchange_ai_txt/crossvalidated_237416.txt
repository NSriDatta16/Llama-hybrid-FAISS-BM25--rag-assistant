Why choose a non-seasonal model and manually perform seasonal adjustment instead of using a seasonal model?

Given that seasonal models such as Holt-Winters and SARIMA estimate seasonal components of a time series, when would it be necessary or advantageous to manually apply seasonal decomposition and then fit a non-seasonal model? Another way to ask this question is why or when would one choose a non-seasonal model with seasonal adjustment (e.g. manually calculate seasonal indices using ratio to moving average and apply simple exponential smoothing) over a seasonal model when the data are seasonal?
