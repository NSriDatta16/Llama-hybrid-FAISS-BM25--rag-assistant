There are lot of places where bit shift operations are regularly used outside of their usage in numerical computations. For example, Bitboard is a data structure that is commonly used in board games for board representation. Some of the strongest chess engines use this data structure mainly for speed and ease of move generation and evaluation. These programs use bit operations heavily and bit-shift operations specifically are used in a lot of contexts - such as finding bit masks, generating new moves on the board, computing logarithm very quickly, etc. There are even very advanced numerical computations that can be done elegantly by clever use of bit operations. Check out this site for bit twiddling hacks - a lot of those algorithms use shift operators. Bit shift operations are regularly used in device driver programming, codec development, embedded systems programming and so on.
