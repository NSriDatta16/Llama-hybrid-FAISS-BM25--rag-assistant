Java/Sql: return an average from a specific column problem

I'm using embedded SQL with Java. I have a simple table where I want to return an average from the column that contains temperatures. I tried to use ResultSet but it wasn't successful, I think this may be because average returns just a single data not a set. I tried to google it and look on the sun website documentation but no luck. Even my teacher couldn't remember how to do it : ) ResultSet aveTemp = stat.executeQuery("SELECT AVG(T_TEMP) FROM TrailTracker"); System.out.println("avg temp is " + aveTemp); It outputs: avg temp is com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4ResultSet@16897b2 I know sql pretty well, but embedded with Java is new to me. Please help. Thanks in advance
