There is an extensive account of how to do model selection using the metafor and glmulti packages on the metafor project home pages here . Note that this does not use step-wise selection which has been widely criticised but fits all possible models from a specified set (all main effects, all two-way interactions and main effects, and so on). The main criterion used in the example is AICc but others are available. One advantage of this approach over step-wise is that it encourages examination of all (or a subset) of the models rather than having a focus just on the "best" one which usually reveals that there are a number of models virtually indistinguishable from the "best" one.
