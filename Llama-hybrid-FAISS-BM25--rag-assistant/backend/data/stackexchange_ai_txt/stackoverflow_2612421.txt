you have to add following delegate method of scrollview in your *.m file. - (UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{ } Ok. Let me explain in deep. open your yourViewCtr.h file. Place following two statements in yourViewCtr.h ( here yourViewCtr is assumed your view controller ) IBOutlet UIScrollView *scrForImg; IBOutlet UIImageView *imgForScr; Save yourViewCtr.h file & open yourViewCtr.xib file. Drag & drop UIScrollView in your view controller's view from Interface builder library Now, drag & drop UIImageView in that scroll view from Interface Builder library Now, Connect both of them to files owner of xib. Don't forget to connect the scrollview's delegate to files owner Now, Set Max zoom to 5 ( according to your need ) Save yourViewCtr.xib -(UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{ return imgForScr; } Hope, It works for you dear. Add comment if any doubts.
