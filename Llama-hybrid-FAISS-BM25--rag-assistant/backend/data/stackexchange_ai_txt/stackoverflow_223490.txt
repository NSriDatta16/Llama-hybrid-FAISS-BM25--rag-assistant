Saving/Organizing/Searching Outlook E-mail outside of Outlook

My company requires me to use Outlook for my E-mail. Outlook does virtually nothing the way I want to do it and it frustrates me greatly. (I'm not trying to start a flame war here, it must do exactly what thousands of CEO's want it to do, but I'm not a CEO.) I would like to be able to automatically extract the thousands of E-mails and attachments currently in my Outlook account and save them in my own alternative storage format where I can easily search them and organize them the way I want. (I'm not requesting suggestions for the new format.) Maybe some nice open source program already can do this... that would be great. Please let me know. Otherwise, how can I obtain the message content and the attachments without going through the huge collection manually? Even if I could only get the message content and the names of the attachments, that would be sufficient. Is there documentation of the Outlook mail storage format? Is there a way to query Outlook for the data? Maybe there is an alternative approach I haven't considered? My preferred language to do this is C#, but I can use others if needed.
