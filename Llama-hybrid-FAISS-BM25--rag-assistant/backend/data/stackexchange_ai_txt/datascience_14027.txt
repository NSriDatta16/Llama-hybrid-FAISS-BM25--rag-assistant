Counting the number of layers in a neural network

I am going over the Udacity tutorial on Neural Networks. Here's a diagram from the tutorial: What makes this a '2 layer neural network'? I was under the impression that the first layer, the actual input, should be considered a layer and included in the count. This screenshot shows 2 matrix multiplies and 1 layer of ReLu's. To me this looks like 3 layers. There are arrows pointing from one to another, indicating they are separate. Include the input layer, and this looks like a 4 layer NN.
