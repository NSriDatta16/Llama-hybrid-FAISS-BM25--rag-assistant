You'll have to start by adding a context loader listener into your web.xml, along with the locations of the Spring configuration XML files. You should configure the Spring DispatcherServlet to accept all URLs that you wish for it to handle. You should write Controllers to bind and validate HTTP requests, call services, add data to ModelAndView for rendering, and map JSPs to success/failure views as needed. You should put interfaces in front of your service and persistence tiers. Move implementations into implementation classes that Spring can inject. Leverage Spring AOP for security and transactions and logging as needed.
