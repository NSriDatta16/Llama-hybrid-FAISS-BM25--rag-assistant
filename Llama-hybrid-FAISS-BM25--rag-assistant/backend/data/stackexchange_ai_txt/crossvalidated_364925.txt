How should I sample data from my dataset to be manually labeled for a SVM?

Assume I have a $2$-dimensional dataset $X=(x_1, x_2)$ where both features are not uniformly distributed over their respective ranges. I now need to select $100$ datapoints from this dataset to be manually labeled, which will be used to train a 2-class SVM. Should I choose these datapoints randomly or s.t. $x_1$ and $x_2$ are uniformly distributed? Intuitively the latter makes more sense and should give a more accurate model, right? Unfortunately I can't find any source for that, even though I think it should be a common question. Probably just not googling right.
