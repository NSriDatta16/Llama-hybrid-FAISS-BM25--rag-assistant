k-fold CV of forecasting financial time series -- is performance on last fold more relevant?

I am working on an ANN-based forecasting model for a financial time series. I'm using 5-fold cross-validation and the average performance is so so. Performance on the last fold (the iteration where the last segment is omitted from training and used for validation) is better than average. Is this a coincidence / data-dependent, or is validation performance on the last fold usually better? (presumably because training with all preceding data is more related to the subsequent data in time series) This feels a bit like a weird question, but I'm hoping for some responses anyway. Thanks in advance :)
