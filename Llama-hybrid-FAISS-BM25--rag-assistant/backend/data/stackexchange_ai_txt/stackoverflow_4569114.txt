Try setting the Accept HTTP header ; e.g.: request.Accept = "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml"; I arrived at this suggestion by running Fiddler2 (as suggested in a comment to another answer) in order to see how my browser (Firefox 4 Beta) makes the HTTP request to the website you mentioned. I then set all headers in the code and eliminated one by one. As soon as I removed the Accept header, the 403 status code was returned. Exact request made by my browser: GET / HTTP/1.0 Host: www.nseindia.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b8) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b8 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: de,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 PS: The other URIs you mention in the comments seem to be invalid. One is incomplete and yields a 500 Internal Server Error , the other yields a 404 Not Found response.
