Globally suppress c# compiler warnings

In my app I have a fair number of entities which have fields which are getting their values set via reflection. (In this case NHibernate is setting them). I'd like to get rid of the "x is never assigned to and will always have its default value 0" warnings, so I can more easily pick out the other warnings. I realize you can surround them in pragma directives, but AFAIK you have to do this for each one. Is there a project wide or solution wide way I could do this?
