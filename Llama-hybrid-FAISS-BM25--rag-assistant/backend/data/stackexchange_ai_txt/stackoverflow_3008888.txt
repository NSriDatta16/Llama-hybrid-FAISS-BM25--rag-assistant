Redirect Using htaccess

I am trying to redirect /folder to / using .htaccess but all am I getting is the Apache HTTP Server Test Page. My root directory looks like this: / .htaccess -/folder -/folder2 -/folder3 My .htaccess looks like this: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/folder/ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ folder/$1 [L] What am I doing wrong? I checked my httpd.conf (I'm running Centos 5.3) and the mod_rewrite library is being loaded. As a side note, my server is not a www server, its simply a virtual machine so its hostname is centosvm. Addition: I have found that the mod_rewrite module is loaded, but none of my .htaccess redirects seem to be working. Addition: My httpd.conf directory directive looks like: Options FollowSymLinks #AllowOverride None
