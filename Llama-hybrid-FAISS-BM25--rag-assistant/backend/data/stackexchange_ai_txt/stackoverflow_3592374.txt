Applications tend to have more heap memory than stack, so you could allocate instead of using automatic storage. This is what you're already doing when you use std::vector. Allocation can be slow though. To get the best of both worlds, rewrite your recursive function by using iteration instead. Then you can pre-allocate once, and re-allocate in the event you use up the preallocated space.
