WPF: Referencing the Window from a Custom Control

I have followed the Accepted Answer's instructions from this post as regards creating a code behind file for a Resource Dictionary, and it worked...so now I can attach events to controls in the generic.xml file. But now I want to be able to call the DragMove() method from an event in there and since there aren't any references to the window hosting the dictionary at the time, I don't know how to call this DragMove() method. So, from a Resource Dictionary Code behind file, is there any way I can make a reference to the window that will currently be hosting that Resource Dictionary? [Update] (Temporary Solution) As a simple (yet stupid) workaround, I have currently done the following: Since I can reference the Application.Current.MainWindow from the Generic.xaml.cs code-behind, I now have this in the Generic.xaml.cs : private void Border_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { Application.Current.MainWindow.DragMove(); } And then I'm attaching PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown handler to each Window I have, like such: private void Window_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { Application.Current.MainWindow = this; } It, well, it works...and until someone can come up with the proper way on how to do this, It should serve me well enough.
