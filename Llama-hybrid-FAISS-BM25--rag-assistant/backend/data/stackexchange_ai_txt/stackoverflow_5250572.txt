Don't you Thread . Use AsyncTask instead which should handle your references to windows correctly. On a different note, I would change this to a different implementation. Why don't use the Preferences storage on the phone to store some kind token. If the token is not valid then request a new token and all the stuff you are doing currently. This way is better because you don't want to request a REST call every time. I imagine something like this (pseudo code) Check if credentials exist in Preference if (valid) then do nothing else use AsyncTask and pop up a loader screen "Waiting..."
