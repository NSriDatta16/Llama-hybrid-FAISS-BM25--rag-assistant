Never store passwords! Rather store the hash of a password. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypt_(Unix)#Library_Function . I'm aware this does not answer the question, but the more programmers who ignore this advice, the easier it will be for criminals to steal data. Don't let your organization become a news story.
