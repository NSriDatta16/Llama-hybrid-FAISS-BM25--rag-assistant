Goo question. Well, mostly the "remember me" functionality is implemented by using a cookie, storing a "token" that verifies the user. If this is not done, and no cookies are sent to the server, the only possible way would be that the server is "guessing" that it is you based on a serial of parameters. These parameters could include: IP, User-agent string, and so on... But this might work in many cases but it not considered best practice since it is representing a security-risk. Ex. many users are sharing network, proxy servers etc... and this could in worst case make a user login to someone elses account.
