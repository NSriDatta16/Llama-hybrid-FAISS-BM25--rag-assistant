all this crazy talk about cats..and it's just a guess the number problem with minimum guesses (number of cats). there shouldn't be a need to artificially (and incorrectly) define infinity as part of the solution either. the variable should have been named upper-bound or max-try or some such. the problem definition (the cat thing) has some serious issues though, with people responding to animal cruelty potential and also the many facets of such a problem posed in real life, e.g. air-drag, gravity is acceleration, and other such real life parameters of the problem. so perhaps it should have been asked in a totally different way.
