a) In the case of unbalanced data, AUPRC should be the best choice as a metric, since in this case AUROC can be easily inflated to values close to 1. b) Sounds interesting! You should definitely include the cases where your classification decided wrongly, since you can "learn more" out of these if you include them in your training set. You should take a read into reinforcement learning , since your problem is a mixture of supervised learning with prediction on new data and reinforcement learning afterwards.
