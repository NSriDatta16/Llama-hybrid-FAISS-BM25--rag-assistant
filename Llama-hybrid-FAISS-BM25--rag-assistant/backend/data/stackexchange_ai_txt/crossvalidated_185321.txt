Yes, sampling all predictors would typically hurt the model accuracy. It is predictor importance values we are after, not accuracy. Either way, this is a heuristic procedure. Using random forest to estimate predictor importance for SVM can only give you a notion of what predictors could be important. One can construct datasets in which RF fails to identify predictors that are important for SVM (false negatives) and the other way around (false positives). If you want to have more trust in your predictor selection procedure, do sequential backward elimination using SVM as the underlying learner.
