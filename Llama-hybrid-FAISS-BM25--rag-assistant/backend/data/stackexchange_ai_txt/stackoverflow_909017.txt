As I see from your Delphi code, all information of the email has been packed into one variable, but in your php script how do pass it your many php variables? You have to unpack/parse it to pass each variable (target address, subject, mail body etc) in your php script. (In your current php script there are many $_posts, but it receives only 1 actual post from Delphi code.) Below is my working code to a php script. result := 'POST /index.php HTTP/1.1' + a + 'Host: somehost.com' + a + 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080406 K-Meleon/1.1.5' + a + 'Accept: text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5' + a + 'Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5' + a + 'Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate' + a + 'Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7' + a + 'Keep-Alive: 300' + a + 'Connection: keep-alive' + a + 'Referer: http://somehost.com/index.php' + a + 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' + a + 'Content-Length: 73' + a + a + 'link=' + MyHttpEnCodedStrData + a + a; a is #13#10. Another important thing is "link='; it is the variable name in my php script that receives/holds the data I'm sending. Since I'm sending only 1 variable, and it is not email script, no php parsing needed, so I didn't paste my php code here. Hope I made it clear :)
