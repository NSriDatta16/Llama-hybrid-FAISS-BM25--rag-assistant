How can I use information from a variable-length list of categories?

I am building a machine learning model using information from the sales of a store. One information that is important in my scenario is the category of each of the products associated with the sale. If each sale was only associated with one item, then I would just use that item's category as a categorical variable. However, given that a sale might be associated with a variable number of items, each belonging to possibly different categories, I wonder how I could be using information for the category of all items in my model. Right now I'm simply selecting only one of the categories, and discarding the others, but that obviously throws away important information. I thought about maybe using some embedding related procedure for encoding that information, but I'm not too sure about it.
