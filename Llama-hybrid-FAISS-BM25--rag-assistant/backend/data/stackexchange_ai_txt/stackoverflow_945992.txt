The data stored in the cmi.suspend_data field is simply a bucket of data that the SCO (the the content) can use to persist its current state. There is no semantic meaning or defined structure to the data. In many cases, the meaning of the data can be guessed at or reversed engineered, but that does not appear to be the case in with content produced by Adobe Presenter. The suspend_data field is limited to 4096 ASCII characters. For some SCOs this doesn't provide enough storage to fully persist the current state. In many cases, a content developer faced with this predicament will apply a compression algorithm to the state data in order to squeeze it into the limited size. It looks like that is what Adobe Presenter is doing here. My guess is that they compressed their data to the unencoded state that you found, then applied url encoding to ensure that all of the resulting characters were safe to send to the LMS. The string of 1's and 0's at the start of the suspend data might be something meaningful. It could likely correspond to which of the slides in the course have been previously viewed by the learner. To verify this, it might be helpful to run the course through a tool like SCORM TestTrack (freely available at scorm.com ) and use the generated debug logs to watch how the suspend data changes as the user progresses through the course. SCORM provides quite a few other data model elements which do have a specific meaning relating to the current status of the course. Here is a list of all available data model elements . The SCORM TestTrack debug logs will also show you which of those data model elements Adobe Presented content uses.
