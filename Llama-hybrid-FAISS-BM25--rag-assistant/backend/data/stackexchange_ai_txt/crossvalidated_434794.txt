How would I find $P(X \ne Y)$ given independent conditional probability mass functions?

Suppose that $W$ has a discrete uniform distribution on $\{1,\cdots,n\}$ . Further, suppose that given $W=w$ , the random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independently identically distributed geometric random variables with pmfs: $f_{X|W=w}(x)=w^{-1}(1-w^{-1})^{x-1}, x=1, 2, \cdots$ $f_{Y|W=w}(y)=w^{-1}(1-w^{-1})^{y-1}, y=1, 2, \cdots$ How can I find $P(X \ne Y)$ ? I was thinking that I could potentially find the joint distribution of $X,Y,W$ , then sum out the $W$ and obtain the joint distribution of $X,Y$ . Then, I could somehow leverage this new distribution to obtain $P(X \ne Y)$ . In this case, would we get the following? $f_{X,Y,W}(x,y,w)=f_W(w)f_{X|W=w}(x)f_{Y|W=w}(y)$ This seems difficult to sum out the $W$ , so would there be a more efficient way to solve this problem?
