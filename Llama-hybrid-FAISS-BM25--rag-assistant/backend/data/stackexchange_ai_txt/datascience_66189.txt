Classify pdf files - image approach vs. text approach

I'm about to start a project with the objective to classify PDF-documents. I'm wondering if there's a best practice approach to tackle this problem. Concretely I'm wondering if one of the following two approaches performs usually better: use an OCR reader to convert the files to text and train the classifier model on the text data convert the files to images and train a CNN classifier model I'm planning to classify different testimonials and certificates mostly. Since most of these files share a similar layout and text within the classes the ideas should both work out. I'm wondering if anybody has already made experience with this and could tell me about some advantages/disadvantages when using a specific approach. I'd highly appreciate any kind of help.
