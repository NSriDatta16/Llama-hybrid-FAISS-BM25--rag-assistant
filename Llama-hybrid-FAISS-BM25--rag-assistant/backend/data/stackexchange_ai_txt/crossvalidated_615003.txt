The most straightforward analysis would be of the time and location of the first recurrence. That would be a competing-risks model, with the locations (and death without recurrence) coded as separate types of event, and allowing for different regression coefficients for the biomarker among the different types of event. The competing risks vignette of the R survival package shows how to set up not only such a simple competing-risks model but also more complicated models that allow for transitions among multiple states. You could extend that approach to the multiple locations over time, but you would then have to be very specific about your assumptions. At the simplest level, you could set up a model of all recurrences by having a separate data row for each recurrence within an individual, with the time to recurrence and an event indicator coding the recurrence location or death as above, along with an ID for the individual. You could then model similarly to the competing-risks model, using a cluster term (based on the ID values) to account for within-individual correlations while modeling the different locations in parallel. That would, however, ignore some very important aspects of cancer biology. In particular, the correlations over time and among tumor sites are likely to be very important. Once there's a recurrence at one location, the probability of metastasis to multiple locations increases greatly. Furthermore, different organs tend to support metastases having different biological properties, so once there is a metastasis to one organ the probability will increase of further metastasis to an organ that supports a biologically similar metastasis. At the other extreme of modeling, you thus could have a complicated multi-state model that allows for each possible combination of recurrence locations over time. But with 10 possible locations, the number of coefficients to estimate would grow quickly with the number of recurrences: 10 possibilities for the first recurrence location, with each location then having 9 possibilities for the next recurrence (90 combinations at that level), and each combination of second recurrences over time having 8 possibilities for the third recurrence (720 possibilities at that third level). You might be able to apply your understanding of the subject matter to find a model intermediate in complexity between the completely parallel/independent model and the all-possible-combinations model. I'd recommend getting some experienced statistical consultation if you decide to do anything beyond the competing-risk model for the location and time of the first recurrence.
