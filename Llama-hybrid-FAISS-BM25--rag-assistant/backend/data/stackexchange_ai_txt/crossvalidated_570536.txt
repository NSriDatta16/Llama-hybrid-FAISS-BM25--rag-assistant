What are "prior distribution" and "posterior distribution" in the case of Bayesian statistics?

What are "prior distribution" and "posterior distribution" in the case of Bayesian statistics? Can you give layman's examples? I understand prior and posterior probabilities . However, I don't know " distribution ".
