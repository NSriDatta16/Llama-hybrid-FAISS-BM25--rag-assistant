Neural networks does not require priors, but each hidden node (neurons) of a neural network can be considered as CPD - Noisy OR/AND CPD for a linear node - Sigmoid CPD for a logistic node So, neural networks could be viewed as multiple layers of hidden nodes, each with linear/sigmoidal CPDs Koller's class on Coursera OR her textbook should be a good reference for types of CPDs.
