If you don't explicitly model such constraints, there is no way for the SVM to adhere to them. Without adding constraints, the outputs of SVM regression can be any real number. The most straightforward way to impose range constraints is by postprocessing the SVM predictions, for instance by applying the logistic function and then mapping $[0, 1]$ to $[-0.05, 0.05]$. Note that postprocessing often changes the optimal hyperparameters ($\epsilon$, $\gamma$), so you would need to tune those again.
