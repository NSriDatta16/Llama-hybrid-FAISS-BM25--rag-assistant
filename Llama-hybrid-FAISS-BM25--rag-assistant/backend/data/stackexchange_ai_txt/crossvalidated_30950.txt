To add to what Macro said, You can test the assumption of the poolability of the monthly data based on time series analysis. But it would require a lot more monthly data. With the time series analysis you could look for a season trend of a yearly cycle. Even without time series analysis assume several years of data is available you could look for differences between the monthly means and if they appear to be significant then you would not pool the data. The assumption for the test would probably be that the monthly data for any month (say January) is independent from one year to the next. Given a long enough series you could check that assumption to by estimating the year to year correlation.
