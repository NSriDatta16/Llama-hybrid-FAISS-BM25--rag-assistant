I would recommend Java on Jetty , as long as you stick to the Servlet standards, then switching the servlet container between Tomcat and Jetty should be fairly straight forward. Have a look at restlet for rest support. From the way things appear to me lately, you'll probably want to look at a Dependency Injection framework, so look at either spring or guice . Logging frameworks ... probably slf4j . Build scripts ... I like maven , but its not everyone's first choice. The learning curve can be a bit steep, although there may be some very useful archetypes , that can be used to set up an initial skeleton project structure. You could use a maven archetype and then switch to using an ant build script. If you choose not to use maven, I would encourage you to at least adopt the maven-style directory structure for your project layout. Hmmm, having said all of that I wouldn't blame you for wondering how bad it could be to just do it the old way, like we used to with apache httpd and cgi scripts in C or perl. Good Luck.
