You said that you have potentially money-making ideas, in moments of inspiration, and that most of them are bad. I suspect most of us are like that. How do you tell which ideas are bad and which are good? It's usually impossible to do so without trying them out. If you're willing to go out and work on one, you're at least showing that you have confidence in that one. If you aren't willing to, why am I to have confidence in your idea? Give me some reason to believe somebody (perhaps you) thinks it a good idea. (Alternatively, you could try patenting it, which last I heard cost about ten thousand dollars or more in the US, but that could also turn me against the idea.) How do you handle a situation where I might have had the same idea, and for whatever reason didn't pursue it? I'm not interested in giving you money if I implement an idea I came up with independently. If you tell me the idea, I can always (honestly or otherwise) claim I had it also. I'm not interested in signing anything that restricts my actions in the future (like the ability to profit off an enterprise without cutting you in) unless I get something for it. I'm also not interested in putting myself in the crosshairs of a lawsuit if I start a business and you think it was from your idea. I have no business reason to listen to your idea unless I already have some confidence it will be profitable to me, and for that see the paragraph above. Ideas come to everybody. I have ideas. You have ideas. Why should I pick an idea that gives you a cut of the profits, when I can pick an idea I had myself? Sure, I probably overestimate the value of my own ideas, but you probably do also. You see people making lots of money for no particularly good reason, an author cleaning up on a book that's not all that good, a financial analyst getting millions while bankrupting his company, that sort of thing. What you don't see is that those people put in a lot of time and work to get into that position, where they could profit unfairly. If you're willing to put in that effort, maybe you can get an undeserved profit too. So, if you have an idea that could be worth millions, get a start on it. Don't try to profit from it without something to show, preferably something that shows off advantages without giving away the whole idea. That shows that one person, at least, has some confidence in the idea. It puts you out in front, if only slightly, and demonstrates that you're probably the logical person to keep going with the idea. It allows you to discuss possible ways to exploit it without giving away the whole thing. It allows me to save face; rather than admit that you have better ideas than mine, it allows me to finance you on the basis of something tangible. (Never expect somebody to pay you just for being smarter than they are. If you are, they won't want to admit it. If not, well, why should they pay you?)
