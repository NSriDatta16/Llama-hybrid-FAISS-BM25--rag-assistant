What are typical "theta" values for an LDA topic model with k = 50 or 100?

I have performed LDA using the topicmodels package in R. When I was inspecting my theta values for each document in the corpus, I noticed that the average max theta, or in other words, the average highest probability that the document is in a certain topic, was ~9%. This seems very low, but I am unable to find any literature that would give me an idea of what it should be around. In case I am doing something else wrong, here are the parameters I am using: burnin % as.matrix theta % as.matrix`
