.ToUniversalTime() gives you the current date time in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In summary this is the current time (GMT) without any seasonal/regional changes. Typically server applications use UTC for datetime storage as this gives a known baseline for users that may in different time zones. As for a solution, well this depends on your application and how it is used. You could store your dates as the current date from the users perspective and ignore UTC but you could run into problems if you have multiple users in different time zones. Or you could store in UTC and then manage datetimes in the code per the current users locale. For nothing more than curiosities sake, more info on UTC can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time
