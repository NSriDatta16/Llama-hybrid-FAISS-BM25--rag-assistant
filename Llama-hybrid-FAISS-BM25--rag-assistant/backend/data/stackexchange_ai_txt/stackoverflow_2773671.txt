By default, IIS recycles the worker process after a certain period of inactivity (20 mins if I recall correct). This causes your data to be lost. You can turn off this behavior in the Properties page of the ApplicationPool under which your app is running. EDIT: having said that, if it is really important that this data is never lost, I would consider storing it in a database or some other form of storage.
