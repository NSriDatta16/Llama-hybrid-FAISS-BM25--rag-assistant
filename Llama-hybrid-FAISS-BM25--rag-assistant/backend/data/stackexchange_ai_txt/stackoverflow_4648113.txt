I don't know of a CSS-only way as Opera 11 is still VERY new. You can either use server-side languages like PHP to detect the User Agent of the browser or you can use the freely available Javascript solution CSS Browser Selector . The above solution does not yet include Opera 11, so let's check Opera 11's User Agent string by checking their references . (Actually they have their own article on how to detect opera ) Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.7.39 Version/11.00 When you now look at the Javascript of the above mentioned CSS Browser selector you can see it is just reading out the navigator.userAgent and comparing it to many variations - just add your Opera 11 variation and you are good to go (or wait until the developer updates the javascript - or even better, update the script and tell the author about it!).
