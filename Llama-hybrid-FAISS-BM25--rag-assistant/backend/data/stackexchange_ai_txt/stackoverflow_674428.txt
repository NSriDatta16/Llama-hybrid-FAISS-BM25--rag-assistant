Embedding an image in an AJAX response

Is it possible (and supported cross-browser) to embed an image into the XML of an AJAX response, and then load that image using JavaScript? I have a system that does some calculations based on the number of sessions running through it. The results are then graphed, and returned in two parts: 1) XML containing information about the graph, totals, and Image map data allowing the user to click on relevant areas. 2) The graph image. As the data can change between the two requests (and could be expensive to calculate), I'd prefer to do it in a single request (return the image with the XML). The current implementation caches the stats for a small period so that the results of multiple requests will still match. As the amount of data that needs to be cached is going to be increasing (from ~2.5K to ~1.2MB), I would like to try an alternative method. NOTE: I do not want to use inline b64 PNG images as they are not supported in IE.
