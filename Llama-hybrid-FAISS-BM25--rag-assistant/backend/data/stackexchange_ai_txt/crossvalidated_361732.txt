Interpretation of "scale function" in Foster-Lyapunov drift condition

I'm reading about Markov chains and I'm starting to bump into these drift conditions , and their relationship with a chain's ergodic properties. The drift condition is that there exists a "scale function" $V: X \to [1,\infty)$, a small set $\mathcal{C}$, and constants $\beta \in (0,1)$, $b I'm wondering if anyone can give me some direction on how to interpret this $V$ function, especially in the context of analyzing the convergence of MCMC algorithms, and especially if this interpretation can be supported by some results. Right now I imagine that $V$ is some sort of distance function describing how far away from the "good spot" you currently are, as the expected value of $V$ one step in the future decreases, unless of course you are already in this good (small?) set.
