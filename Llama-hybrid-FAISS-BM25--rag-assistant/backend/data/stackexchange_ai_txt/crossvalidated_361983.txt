Random forest fully fits training sample

Using the randomforest package in R, I am getting 100% accuracy on the training dataset. Here is a reproducible example : library(randomForest) #### generate dataset #### n.obs 0)) # split the dataset in two halves split Note that I am not interested in the OOB error. In Breiman's original paper, it is mentionned that overfitting is not an issue with this algorithm. What am I missing?
