Python: convert variables into correct format for DataFrame

I have 3 variables that I would like to use to build my dataset but since they are in a weird shape/format, I had no success so far. I'm quite new to this and really appreciate any help!! The 3 variables I have are: print(newspaper) ['Bolero'] ['Schweizer Illustrierte Style'] ['Bolero'] print(title) ['Schönheit und Tragik'] ['magie pur'] ['Das sind unsere Favoriten'] print(pubDate) ['2007-01-01'] ['2007-01-01'] ['2007-01-01'] It seems to like all variables are a list of lists, but I'm not quite sure. However, since the data is scrapped from a private website, I can't post the entire code here, but I hope this is already enough for you to access what the problem is with that variable format. What I would like to have is a dataset of this format: Newspaper Title PubDate Bolero Schönheit und Tragik 2007-01-01 Schweizer Illustrierte Style magie pur 2007-01-01 Bolero. Das sind unsere Favoriten 2007-01-01
