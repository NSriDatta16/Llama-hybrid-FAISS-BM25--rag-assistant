Jquery UI Sortable - Get the item being sorted

When using Jquery UI Sortable (which is great by the way) how do you get the item that is currently being sorted. When you use $(this); it return the actual sortable list, not the current sorted item. I want to do fancy-pants things with the widget when the user is dragging it around. E.g. Animate it when dragging between two lists. So how do I get the current item being sorted? There a little code below just to explain a little more... $(function() { $("#sortable_1").sortable({ start : function(event, ui){ //get current element being sorted }, stop : function(event, ui){ //get current element being sorted } }).disableSelection(); });
