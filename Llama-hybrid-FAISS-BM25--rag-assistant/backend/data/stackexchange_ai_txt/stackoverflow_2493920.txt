How to switch position of two items in a Python list?

I haven’t been able to find a good solution for this problem on the net (probably because switch, position, list and Python are all such overloaded words). It’s rather simple – I have this list: ['title', 'email', 'password2', 'password1', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'next', 'newsletter'] I’d like to switch position of 'password2' and 'password1' – not knowing their exact position, only that they’re right next to one another and password2 is first. I’ve accomplished this with some rather long-winded list-subscripting, but I wondered its possible to come up with something a bit more elegant?
