Shooting oneself in the foot. No other language offers such a creative array of tools. Pointers, multiple inheritance, templates, operator overloading and a preprocessor. A wonderfully powerful language that also provides abundant opportunities for foot shooting. Edit: I apologize if my lame attempt at humor has offended some. I consider C++ to be the most powerful language that I have ever used -- with abilities to code at the assembly language level when desired, and at a high level of abstraction when desired. C++ has been my primary language since the early '90s. My answer was based on years of experience of shooting myself in the foot. At least C++ allows me to do so elegantly.
