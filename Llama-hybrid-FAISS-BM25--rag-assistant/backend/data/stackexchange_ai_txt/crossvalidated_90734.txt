I would write ~ attitude + gender + (1|subject) + (1|scenario) as $$ y_i \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(\textrm{attitude}=\textrm{pol}) + \beta_2 I(\textrm{gender}=\textrm{male}) + b_{1,j[i]} + b_{2,k[i]} + \epsilon_i \\ b_1 \sim N(0,\sigma^2_1) \\ b_2 \sim N(0,\sigma^2_2) \\ \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2_r) $$ where $\beta$ indicates a fixed-effect coefficient, $b$ indicates a random variable, $I$ is an indicator function (this is basically the same as what you said above, just slightly different notation). ~ attitude + gender + (1+attitude|subject) + (1+attitude|scenario) adds among-subject variation in response to attitude and scenario (we could equivalently write the random-effects part as (attitude|subject) + (attitude|scenario) , i.e. leaving the intercept implicit; this is a matter of taste). Now $$ y_i \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot I(\textrm{attitude}=\textrm{pol}) + \beta_2 I(\textrm{gender}=\textrm{male}) + \\ b_{1,j[i]} + b_{3,j[i]} I(\textrm{attitude}=\textrm{pol}) + b_{2,k[i]} + b_{4,k[i]} I(\textrm{attitude}=\textrm{pol}) + \epsilon_i \\ \{b_1,b_3\} \sim \textrm{MVN}({\mathbf 0},\Sigma_1) \\ \{b_2,b_4\} \sim \textrm{MVN}({\mathbf 0},\Sigma_2) \\ \epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2_r) $$ where $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are unstructured variance-covariance matrices, i.e. they are symmetric and positive (semi)definite but have no other constraints: $$ \Sigma_1 = \left( \begin{array}{cc} \sigma^2_1 & \sigma_{13} \\ \sigma_{13} & \sigma^2_3 \end{array} \right) $$ and similarly for $\Sigma_2$. It might be instructive to group terms as follows: $$ y_i \sim (\beta_0 + b_{1,j[i]} + b_{2,k[i]}) + \\ ( \beta_1 + b_{3,j[i]} + b_{4,k[i]}) \cdot I(\textrm{attitude}=\textrm{pol}) + \beta_2 I(\textrm{gender}=\textrm{male}) + \epsilon_i $$ so you can see which random effects are affecting the intercept and which are affecting the response to attitude. Now if you leave out the fixed-effect attitude term (i.e. set $\beta_1=0$, or drop the attitude term from the formula) you can see (without rewriting everything) that, because the random effects are assumed to have zero mean, we will be assuming that the average response to attitude across subjects and scenarios will be exactly zero, while there is still variation among subjects and scenarios. I won't say this never makes sense from a statistical point of view, but it rarely does. There are discussions of this issue on the r-sig-mixed-models@r-project.org mailing list from time to time ... (or it may be discussed on StackExchange somewhere -- if not, it would make a good follow-up SE question ...)
