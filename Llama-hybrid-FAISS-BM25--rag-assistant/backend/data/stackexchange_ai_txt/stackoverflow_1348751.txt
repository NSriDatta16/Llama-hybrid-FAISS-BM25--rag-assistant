It sounds like you have the wrong package. I installed it yesterday from the "Download Now" button at http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/javaappdev/javaeclipseplug.jsp and it had both the menu option and the Blackberry project type. It should have an installer if you get the correct one. I would post a direct link, but RIM likes to ask for your info before allowing the download. Try installing it to a different directory and using a new workspace. It could be that the old install is interfering somehow. -Hope that helps
