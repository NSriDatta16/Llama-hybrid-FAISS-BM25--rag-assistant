Why is the square root in the forward process of the Diffusion Model?

I am trying to make sense of the diffusion model (one of the videos I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoKDTa5jHvg&t=706s ). I came across this formula in the model: This picture clearly explains the components of the formula. My question is the middle term - the mean. Why is the square root? At the very beginning, I thought it had something to do with the normal distribution. In Binominal Distribution, mean = = variance = 2 = SD = = square root() Where p is the probability of success and q = 1 - p. It looks like this is not relevant. Then I think would it be related to the Root Mean Square? If yes, then why the X needs to be squared to start with? Would anyone please help? I have read this paper, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03585.pdf . Perhaps I overlooked, I can't find the answer from it.
