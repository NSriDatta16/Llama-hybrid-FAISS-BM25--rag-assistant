I tried the following methods. double.TryParse double.Parse Convert.ToDouble I used the following code. public static void Main() { string text = "3.14"; var timer = new Stopwatch(); timer.Start(); for (int i = 0; i On my machine I saw these results. I averaged 3 different runs. double.TryParse = 4.45 seconds double.Parse = 4.45 seconds Convert.ToDouble = 4.75 seconds Of course, I used a string that was convertable. If the string is not convertable then I highly suspect double.TryParse will be the fastest by a long shot.
