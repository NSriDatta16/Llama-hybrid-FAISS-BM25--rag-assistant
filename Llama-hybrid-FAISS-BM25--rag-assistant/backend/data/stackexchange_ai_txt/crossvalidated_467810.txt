Summarizing MFCC frames (n_mfcc, n_timesteps) for an entire clip is done quite often (at least pre deep-learning). The most common summarization is to take the mean and standard deviation across time (for each MFCC coefficient). The result is a feature vector (2, n_mfcc) - often flattened to a 1D vector (2xn_mfcc,). Then any ML classifier can be used, such as LogisticRegression or RandomForest. This however has nothing to do with PCA.
