How to compute the algorithmic space complexity

I am reviewing my data structures and algorithm analysis lesson, and I get a question that how to determine to the space complexity of merge sort and quick sort algorithms ? The depth of recursion is only O(log n) for linked list merge-sort The amount of extra storage space needed for contiguous quick sort is O(n). My thoughts: Both use divide-and-conquer strategy, so I guess the space complexity of linked list merge sort should be same as the contiguous quick sort. Actually I opt for O(log n) because before every iteration or recursion call the list is divided in half. Thanks for any pointers.
