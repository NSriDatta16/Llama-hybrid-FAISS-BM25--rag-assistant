How to compute P values for Breusch pagan test?

I got bptest() output for my OLS model as follows; studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: modelfit BP = 3.3201, df = 3, p-value = 0.3449 I read that BP test is an F test of squared residuals and independent variables. There are 40 records and 3 independent variables in the data. My question is, is the test statistic in the R output the F test statistic of the auxiliary equation. How do I compute the p-value?
