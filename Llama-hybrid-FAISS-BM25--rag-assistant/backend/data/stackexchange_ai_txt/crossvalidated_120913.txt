Bayesian inference in a T noise model with an appropriate prior will give a robust estimate of location and scale. The precise conditions that the likelihood and prior need to satisfy are given in the paper Bayesian robustness modelling of location and scale parameters by Andrade and O'Hagan (2011). The estimates are robust in the sense that a single observation cannot make the estimates arbitrarily large, as demonstrated in figure 2 of the paper. When the data is normally distributed, the SD of the fitted T distribution (for fixed $\nu$) does not match the SD of the generating distribution. But this is easy to fix. Let $\sigma$ be the standard deviation of the generating distribution and let $s$ be the standard deviation of the fitted T distribution. If the data is scaled by 2, then from the form of the likelihood we know that $s$ must scale by 2. This implies that $s = \sigma f(\nu)$ for some fixed function $f$. This function can be computed numerically by simulation from a standard normal. Here is the code to do this: library(stats) library(stats4) y = rnorm(100000, mean=0,sd=1) nu = 4 nLL = function(s) -sum(stats::dt(y/s,nu,log=TRUE)-log(s)) fit = mle(nLL, start=list(s=1), method="Brent", lower=0.5, upper=2) # the variance of a standard T is nu/(nu-2) print(coef(fit)*sqrt(nu/(nu-2))) For example, at $\nu=4$ I get $f(\nu)=1.18$. The desired estimator is then $\hat{\sigma} = s/f(\nu)$.
