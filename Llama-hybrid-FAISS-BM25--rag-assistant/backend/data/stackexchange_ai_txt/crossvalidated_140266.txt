Classifier with adjustable precision vs recall

I am working on a binary classification problem where it is much more important to not have false positives; quite a lot of false negatives is ok. I have used a bunch of classifiers in sklearn for example, but I think none of them have the ability to adjust the precision-recall tradeoff explicitly (they do produce pretty good results but not adjustable). What classifiers have adjustable precision/recall? Is there any way to influence the precision/recall tradeoff on standard classifiers, eg Random Forest or AdaBoost?
