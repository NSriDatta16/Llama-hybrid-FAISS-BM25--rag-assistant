how do I approach forecasting problems using deep neural networks?

I am new to machine learning in general, and I have been requested to predict a price given a date. I have been trying to make a neural network for the task but it does poorly in the testing set, so I was hoping for some advice. the data consists of 300 entries of a string date (YYYY-MM-DD) and the corresponding price starting from 1922. here is what the price curve looks like: I had to find a way to featurize the dates somehow so here is what I came up with: data = pd.read_csv("DataSet", header=0) dates = pd.to_datetime(data["date"]) # the ratio of the current day of the year to the maximum number of days a year can have dayOfYear = np.array(dates.dt.dayofyear).reshape(1, -1) / 366 # the ratio of the current week of the year to the maximum number of weeks a year can have weeks = np.array(dates.dt.week).reshape(1, -1) / 52 # the ratio of the current month of the year to the maximum number of months a year can have months = np.array(dates.dt.month).reshape(1, -1) / 12 # I wanted to squish the year to be between [0,1] so i shifted the tanh function to the right, # and divided it by a 100 just so I wouldn't end up with an array of mostly 1s. # I have no idea if that causes any issues or not, and Idid this based on nothing. years = ac.tanh((np.array(dates.dt.year).reshape(1, -1) - 1922) / 100) # the ratio of the current quarter of the year to the maximum number of quarters a year can have quarter = np.array(dates.dt.quarter).reshape(1, -1) / 4 # the ratio of the current day of the week to the maximum number of days a week can have # (starting from 0). weekDay = np.array(dates.dt.dayofweek).reshape(1, -1) / 6 # did the same thing I did with years. the number of days passed since the base date squished to [0,1], # and the 10000 is there to delay convergence of the tanh function to 1. # Again, I have no idea if any of this works since I had no upper bound to the data. delta = np.array((dates - pd.Timestamp('1922-3-31'))).reshape(1, -1) daysSince = ac.tanh(delta / (np.timedelta64(1, 'D') * 10000)) that's the best I could think of when I tried extracting features from dates. after that randomized the data, and took the last 50 examples of the 300 to be the validation set. As for the network, I tried multiple configurations and after hours of trial and error, a 5 hidden layer network is what worked best with me. the number of neuron along with their activation functions (including the output layer): [256 ,128 , 110. ,42. , 18. , 1] ["swish","tanh", "swish","swish","relu", "relu"] I had to include activations other than relu because a mostly relu network kept calculating linear functions. I have tried multiple loss functions, and I ended up using the MSE loss function. I used a learning rate of 0.02 and a learning rate decay coefficient of 0.003273. the learning create decay function is as follows: learning_rate / (1 + i * learning_rate_decay) I also used mini batch gradient descent with a mini batch size of 32 and and Adam as an optimizer, and I train the network for 4600 epochs. with this configuration I get an accuracy of 83% on the training set and 32% on the validation set (any prediction within 5 units of the expected output value is considered = ) . here is the training set predictions vs the actual values: the validation set predictions vs the actual values: and the cost function(MSE) change per 100 epochs: obviously there are tons of mistakes in this network and I just want to know what am I doing wrong, and can this architecture work or is it unfit for such problems.
