A vector maintains its own storage and copies values into it. Since you did not implement a copy constructor, the default one is used, which just copies the value of the pointer. This pointer is thus deleted twice, once by the local variable destructor and once by the vector. Don't forget the rule of three . You either need to implement the copy and assignment operators, or just use a class that already does this, such as shared_ptr. Note that this line causes a memory leak, since the object you allocated with new is never deleted: vecTest.push_back(*(new Test(5)));
