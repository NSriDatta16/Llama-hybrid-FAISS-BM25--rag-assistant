Why is Average Treatment Effect different from Average Treatment effect on the Treated?

In RCTs, randomisation balances unmeasured confounders and, I'm told, ATE and ATT would be the same. In observational studies, this is not possible and Propensity Scores are used in various ways to estimate ATT and/or ATE. The analyses that I've performed and examples that I've seen (eg this helpful text ) shows different ATT and ATE (albeit slightly). Please can anyone help me understand why they are different and, more importantly, what the differences mean (eg. if ATE>ATT or ATT>ATE), if anything?
