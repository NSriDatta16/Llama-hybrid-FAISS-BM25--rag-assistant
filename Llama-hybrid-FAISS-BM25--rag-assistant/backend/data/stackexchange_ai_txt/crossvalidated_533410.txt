Look at mean st.dev cv Snapchat 93.6 94.6 1.0106838 Facebook 54.7 62.3 1.1389397 Instagram 78.1 78.0 0.9987196 Twitter 101.6 94.0 0.9251969 Andere 76.3 87.0 1.1402359 The coefficient of variation is close to a constant, so that might be a better assumption than constant variance. So a glm (generalized linear model) with constant coefficient of variation could be a possibility, that is, a gamma glm. For this data, maybe an identity link function. But your data is quite strange. Average time on Twitter almost double that on Facebook? Wouldn't have guessed that!
