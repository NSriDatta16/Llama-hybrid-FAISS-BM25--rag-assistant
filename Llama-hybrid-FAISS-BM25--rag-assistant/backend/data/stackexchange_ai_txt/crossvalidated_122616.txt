If you're taking a frequentist approach, it sounds you're trying to compute the distribution that's used in a prediction interval. You can do that with a regression, but you do rely on the distributional assumption more than for other forms of inference. The usual way is to construct a version of a pivotal quantity , but there are some differences from the usual definition of pivotal quantity because instead of trying to get a pivot for a parameter, you need something that will work for a future observation. In regression, if $y_f$ is that future observation and $\hat{y}_f=x_f\hat{\beta}$ its predicted value, then $Q=\frac{y_f-\hat{y}_f}{s_f}$ has a t-distribution with $n-p-1$ d.f. where $p$ is the number of predictors and $s_{f}$ is the standard error of the prediction. The formula for $\text{Var}(y_f-\hat{y}_f)$ is often given in derivations of the prediction interval; $s_f$ is the square root of its sample estimate. If $x_f$ is the row-vector of predictors (including the constant) for the future observation, $y_f$, then $\text{Var}(y_f-\hat{y}_f) = \sigma^2(1+x_f (X'X)^{-1} x_f')$ To obtain $s_f$, replace $\sigma^2$ by $s^2$ in the above formula and take the square root. You can make probability statements about $Q$, and from those, derive statements about $y_f$ in terms of $\hat{y}_f$ and $s_f$ that should have the appropriate coverage if the assumptions hold. Packages that will give one-sided prediction intervals can be used to help with the sort of computation you need, but it's easy enough to do directly.
