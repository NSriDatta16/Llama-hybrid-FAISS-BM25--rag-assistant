Estimate event probability from yes/no data

I need to predict (estimate) probabilities of (rare) events when the training data only contains the yes/no indicator. I.e., my target (dependent) variable is binary (logical). What I need is not just to predict yes/no, but estimate the probabilities of yes/no for each observation. If I use logistic regression, then the model output is, indeed, an estimate of the probability. What if I am using a different model, e.g., vw ? (because, e.g., it is faster and outperforms logistic regression as a binary classifier). So, I have a model which produces a score for each observation and I want to convert the score to probability. It is natural to use total variation distance to evaluate the probability prediction, which motivated my previous question . The accepted answer there suggests Liblinear with L1 loss, but that produces a binary classifier, not a probability estimator. So, how do I calibrate model scores so that they actually estimate the event probabilities? I now train a single-independent-variable logistic regression to map the scores to probabilities. Can I do better?
