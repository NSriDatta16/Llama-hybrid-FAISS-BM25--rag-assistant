What can you think up that would make your coding/text editing/documention tasks easier? Correctness highlighting. Update: I think of this as self-explanatory, but it obviously isn't. Here is the annotated version of the image. Basically, this is a toy language, but the concepts can extend to real languages and IDEs; the language features inline tests, and the tests are executed at every keystroke. Passing tests, and functions that have 100% coverage and pass all their tests, are colored blue; failing tests and failing functions are colored pink; uncovered code is colored yellow. So it is, as I said above, "correctness highlighting" - you can look at the colors and know immediately which functions are correct (as defined by the tests).
