Converting pandas series object to int in pandas

I started my machine learning journey by deciding to explore recommender systems so that I can apply it in some of the projects for my company. Now, I am using Pandas for data analysis. The data set is the imdv movies data set. Here, I am trying to convert a pandas series object to int but it converts the series to float64 . Here is the screenshot: ' clean_ids ' is the method that I am using to do this and you can see that ' id ' changes to float64 . Please help me with this.
