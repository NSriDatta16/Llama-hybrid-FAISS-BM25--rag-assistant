You can definitely do this with CSS alone (and a little js for poor ie6). First, make it work in FF with :hover, :active, whatever. then add some js to add classes to the buttons on hover, click.... Add these classes to your :hover, :active... declarations (button:hover, button.hover{color:red}) and off you go. You'll need to do some massaging for safari and the IEs but it can absolutely be done. Another possibility is a sort of mashup of the previous suggestions. If I'm not mistaken, JAWS will read elements with visibility:hidden (not sure about window eyes). Instead of removing the button with js or setting it display:none, setting it to invisible should work cross user agent. Then just us JS to bind the link click to the form submit.
