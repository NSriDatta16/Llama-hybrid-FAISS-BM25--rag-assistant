How to pick bitflag values?

I have a set of options, some orthogonal (can be combined in any combination), some exclusive (only one from the set is allowed), and need to pick a set of enum values so that they can be combined with bit-wise or and extracted with bit-wise and . I would prefer that or -ing invalid combination would be detectable. Are there any tools for generating enums like this? Edit for clarity I'm looking for something that can leverage the fact that some flags are invalid in combination to reduce the number of bits used. The requirement that I be able to detect errors is soft. I don't need to be able to tell what was used if things are mucked up. I'm using C#, but any solution should be helpful. An example pattern would be: 0011 00 0101 00 1001 00 0110 00 1010 00 1100 00 0000 01 0000 10 that gets 6 exclusive flags and an orthogonal pair of 2 into 6 bits a quick test show that 5-bits gives 9 values, 6-bits give 20,...
