What portable data backends are there which have fast append and random access?

I'm working on a Qt GUI for visualizing 'live' data which is received via a TCP/IP connection. The issue is that the data is arriving rather quickly (a few dozen MB per second) - it's coming in faster than I'm able to visualize it even though I don't do any fancy visualization - I just show the data in a QTableView object. As if that's not enough, the GUI also allows pressing a 'Freeze' button which will suspend updating the GUI (but it will keep receiving data in the background). As soon as the Freeze option was disabled, the data which has been accumulated in the background should be visualized. What I'm wondering is: since the data is coming in so quickly, I can't possibly hold all of it in the memory. The customer might even keep the GUI running over night, so gigabytes of data will accumulate. What's a good data storage system for writing this data to disk? It should have the following properties: It shouldn't be too much work to use it on a desktop system It should be fast at appending new data at the end. I never need to touch previously written data anymore, so writing into anywhere but the end is not needed. It should be possible to randomly access records in the data. This is because scrolling around in my GUI will make it necessary to quickly display the N to N+20 (or whatever the height of my table is) entries in the data stream. The data which is coming in can be separated into records, but unfortunately the records don't have a fixed size. I'd rather not impose a maximum size on them (at least not if it's possible to get good performance without doing so). Maybe some SQL database, or something like CouchDB ? It would be great if somebody could share his experience with such scenarios.
