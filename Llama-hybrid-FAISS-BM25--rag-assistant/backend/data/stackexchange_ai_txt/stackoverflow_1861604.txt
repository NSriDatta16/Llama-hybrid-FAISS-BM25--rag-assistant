I hit this exact same problem recently and it appears there is no real elegant solution to this short of using something like Json.NET (which I've not tried myself but is supposed to not throw the circular reference error). The solution I ended up using (for my tiny project) was to set the referenced entity to null prior to serialisation. This could get old very quickly for larger projects which I where Json.NET would come in handy I think.
