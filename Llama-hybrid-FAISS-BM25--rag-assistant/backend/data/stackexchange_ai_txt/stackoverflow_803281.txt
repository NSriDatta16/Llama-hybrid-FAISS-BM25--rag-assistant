If the user can function without the database they should be a local xml file. If the app requires the database to be functional, I'd add them to the database. Why add some new concept to the app, just keep storage of data in a single place. Your app will be able to run with lower privileges as well. If you're using the asp.net membership model (yes, for the desktop app) then you'll be able to take advantage of the profiling. I vote database!
