Is SVD non-linear while PCA (by eigendecompostion) is linear?

I am quite confused because a colleague of mine recently told me that he preferred using SVD instead of PCA (by eigendecomposition) because, contrary to the latter, the former is non-linear so it can identify also some non-linear patterns. However, I cannot see exactly in what way SVD is non-linear since I have the impression that it simply applies a series of linear matrix multiplications (see also this StackExchange answer ). I know that t-SNE is certainly non-linear and for this reason it is sometimes called as non-linear PCA. Is SVD non-linear while PCA (by eigendecompostion) is linear?
