You could use object_getIvar() to get at the value without going through the accessor. In essence, it lets you get at _view without needing to link against it. On the other hand, it has the potential to break if the actual ivar goes away or is renamed. Traditionally that was never a real concern, but the iPhone uses the modern runtime which does not suffer from fragile base class issues, so Apple might feel more inclined to make those sorts of changes.
