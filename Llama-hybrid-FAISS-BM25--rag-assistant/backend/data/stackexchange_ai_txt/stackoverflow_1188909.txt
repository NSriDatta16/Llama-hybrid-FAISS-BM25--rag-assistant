It appears to me that LastUpdatedTime is actually a string (since you can do the assignment) not a DateTime. In that case, the format applied won't do anything. You'll want to parse the LastUpdatedTime into a DateTime then reformat into the format that you want before assigning it to your string. DateTime lastUpdated = DateTime.Parse( mergeSubscription.SynchronizationAgent.LastUpdatedTime ); HUD.LastSyncDate = string.Format( "{0:G}", lastUpdated ); public static string LastSyncDate { get; set; } Note that you may need to use ParseExact instead. DateTime lastUpdated = DateTime.ParseExact( "yyyyMMdd HH:mm:ss:fff", ..., CultureInfo.InvariantCulture );
