How to interpret straight line as forecasting

I would like to make some short term forecasting using an AR(I)MA model. having the following daily time series, which is for the raw data: It seems to be like a white noise, based on the acf and pacf plots, which are the following: From my understanding from what I've read, a good choice would be AR(1) and MA(1) . Also, using ndiffs to find an appropriate number of the times to difference the series, I get 0 (which might be clear from the ACF graph). So, it seems I would need to create an ARIMA(1,0,1) model. However, when I try to apply out-of-sample cross validation, it seems to be a straight line, i.e. Question : How to interpret that? Probably I miss something or because of the lack of trend and seasonality I get these predictions? P.S. If necessary, I can provide the code to generate the data and creating the corresponding graphs. Edit : The model is the following one: model = pm.auto_arima( train, start_p=1, start_q=1, d=0, seasonal=False, trace=True, error_action='ignore', stepwise=True ) which actually produces an ARMA(1, 1) model. EDIT2 : Here is summary of the ARMA(1,1) model:
