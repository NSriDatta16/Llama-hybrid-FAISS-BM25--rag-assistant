Sure that it can happen. The most obvious example is normal distribution with known variance $\sigma^2$ , where for the mean $\mu$ , we assume normal prior with mean $\mu_0$ and variance $\sigma^2_0$ , then by conjugacy, the posterior mean is $$ E(\mu|x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) = \frac{\sigma^2_0}{\sigma^2/n + \sigma^2_0} \bar x + \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2/n + \sigma^2_0} \mu_0 $$ Basically, it is a weighted average between the sample mean and prior mean. What follows, if sample mean is smaller then the prior mean, this will be higher then the sample mean.
