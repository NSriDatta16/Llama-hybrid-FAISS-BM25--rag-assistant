Don't ever use atof( s ). It's a quick & dirty shortcut for strtod( s, 0 ) without the error reporting. (Same for atoi() and strtol().) If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though the checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing fingers, for if thou thinkest ’it cannot happen to me’, the gods shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance. (Henry Spencer, "Ten Commandments for the C Programmer", Commandment #6)
