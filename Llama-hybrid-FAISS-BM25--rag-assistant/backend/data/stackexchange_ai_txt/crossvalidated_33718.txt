Company tweets do vary with time and so have time dependence as well as dependence on covariates. But it is possible to model covariates in time along with an ARMA structure in such a model. Instead of using them continuously you choose to create categories. There is nothing wrong with that (except that some quantitative information is lost). I would keep track of these covariates as a function of time as recent news reports will have more influence and relevance than old ones. Treat the problem as a time series forecasting problem rather than as a simple regression problem.
