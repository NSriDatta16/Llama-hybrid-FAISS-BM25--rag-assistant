How to calculate the asymptotic p-value for a test on a Poisson i.i.d random variable?

Disclaimer : This is a question I couldn't solve. I feel it is ethical to state this here so you can evaluate how much of your solution will share through either statements or hints. Let $X_{1},…,X_n $ be an $i.i.d.$ $Poiss(\lambda)$ distributed random variable for some unknown $\lambda . 0$ . Now consider the following hypothesis test: $H_0:λ=λ_0$ v.s. $H_1:λ≠λ_0$ where $λ_0>0$ . Question: What is the asymptotic p-value? Here's what I know: Let $\overline{X}_n$ be the average of the random variable $X$ . Thanks to the Central Limit Theorem, I can write: $\dfrac{|\overline{X}_n - \lambda_0|}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{(d)} N(0,1)$ as $n$ goes to infinity. Given it's a two-sided test, according to [1] I can write $P_{\lambda_0}\left(\dfrac{|\overline{X}_n - \lambda_0|}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} > z_{\alpha/2}\right)$ $\rightarrow \alpha$ $P_{\lambda_0}\left(|W| > z_{\alpha/2}\right)$ $\rightarrow \alpha$ where $W$ is the Wald Test and $z_{\alpha/2} = \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha/2)$ Also from [1], I can write $p-value = P_{\lambda_0}(|W| > |z_{\alpha/2}|) = 2.\Phi(-|z_{\alpha/2}|)$ This is where I'm stuck. I know all of these statements are true, however, I cannot work with the knowledge I have to obtain the answer I need. I'm still re-reading about hypothesis testing and p-values to have a better grip on problems like this. References [1] Wasserman, Larry. All of statistics: a concise course in statistical inference.
