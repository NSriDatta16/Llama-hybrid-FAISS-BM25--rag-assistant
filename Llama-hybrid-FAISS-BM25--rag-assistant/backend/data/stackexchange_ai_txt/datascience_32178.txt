For that, you would probably need something more granular than just the score (e.g., in-game analytics, etc.) to help you assess the attributes of each player. Even then, it would be difficult to map the outcome to multiple attributes (i.e., defending skills, offensive skills). If you only care about a single score of a player (i.e., say, how effective is a player in helping her team to win, etc.), you could potentially look at something like Corsi which essentially measures puck possession (not without its criticism or flaws). There are many variants out there, but it should give you an idea how to leverage in-game analytics to assess a player. But then, Corsi is merely a calculation from in-game statistic; you will need more than that to call it a machine learning exercise.
