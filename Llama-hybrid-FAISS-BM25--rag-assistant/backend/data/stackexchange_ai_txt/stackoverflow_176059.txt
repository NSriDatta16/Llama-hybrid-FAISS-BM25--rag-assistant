I doubt that you can speed things up using another backup tool. As Mike mentions, you can add TSM to the stack, but that will hardly make the backup run any faster. If I were you, I'd look into where backup files are stored: Are they using the same disk spindles as the database itself? If so: See if you can store the backup files on a storage area which isn't contented for access during your backup window. And consider using incremental backups for daily backups, and then a long full backup on Saturdays. (I assume that you are already running online backups, so that your data aren't unavailable during backup.)
