What test should be used to test if DV1 is significantly higher than DV2, where both DVs are continuous over the same range?

I am looking at relationships between student scores in different subjects. I have the following 4 variables: V1: score subject 1: continuous from 0-30, converted to categorical: low ( =20) V2: score subject 2: continuous from 0-40, converted to categorical: low ( =20) V3: score subject 3: continuous from 0 to 10 V4: score subject 4: continuous from 0 to 10 I want to test a hypothesis of the following form: Students that have a high score in subjects 1 and 2 score better in subject 3 than in subject 4. So I am considering V1 and V2 as independent variables (IV) and V3 and V4 as dependent variables (DV). What statistical tests can I use and which one would be most appropriate? Because V3 and V4 are of a similar nature and have the same range, it seems like it should be possible to compare their means in some sort of ANOVA. Is that correct? My current thoughts are: They cannot be compared because they are two separate dependent variables? Is there any test to compare the means of two separate variables? I need to create a special continuous variable to evaluate which score is better and then compare the mean of that between groups. Ex: V5 = V3 - V4 I need to create a special binary variable to evaluate if V3>V4 and then do a logistic regression of that versus V1 and V2 as continuous variables instead of categories. Flip it around so that V1 and V2 are DVs and V3 and V4 are IVs.
