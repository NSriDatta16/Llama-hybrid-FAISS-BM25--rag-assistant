This is not really a Solr-specific problem, but a general problem with pagination of any external data source, because the data source has an independent state from the (web) application. For example, it also happens on relational databases. Here's a good coverage of pagination in relational databases, along with the possible solutions. Most web applications / websites take the first solution: "Repeat the query for each new request" since the other solutions are much more complex and not scalable, but this suffers from the problem you describe. Browse the questions on stackoverflow.com for a while and you'll notice it, since questions are being created constantly. In your case I'd consider modeling the Solr documents as your whole legal documents instead of their individual sections. You'll get a lot less documents (therefore a slower rate of inserts/deletes) and you can use the highlighting parameters to get snippets of the sections that matched the user query. Another option would be decreasing your commit rate, but this could end up in less-than-ideal document freshness.
