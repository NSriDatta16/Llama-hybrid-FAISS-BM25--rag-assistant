Access SDExplorer (System Folder) from my C# app

I am trying out Windows Live SkyDrive, and I installed SDExplorer ( http://www.cloudstorageexplorer.com/ ) It works by adding my SkyDrive folder to Windows Explorer, but it does not get a drive name or anything, so how can I access that drive/folder from my C# application? When I go into the folder and look at the address bar it says "Computer\SDExplorer". Directory.GetDirectories(@"\Computer\SDExplorer") does not work, because it translates to "C:\Computer\SDExplorer". I would like to be able to create a small application that can create folders and upload files to my SkyDrive account. Anybody know how these special folder/drives work? - I noticed MozyHome appears in the same way in my Windows Explorer.
