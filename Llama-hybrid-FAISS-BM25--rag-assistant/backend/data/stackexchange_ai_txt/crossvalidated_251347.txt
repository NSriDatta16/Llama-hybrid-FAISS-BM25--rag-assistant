Uniform level density from the sum of i.i.d random variables

I am generating a series of $N$ variables as $X_n=\sum_{i=1}^n{\delta x_i}$ where $n=1,...,N$ and $\delta x_i$ are i.i.d in $[0,\inf]$ with $ =\int p(\delta x_i)\delta x_i=1$. I am interested in the density of the generated values $[X_1, X_2,... X_N]$ in the domain $[0,N]$. Histograms of these values suggest a constant density over $[0,N]$. This is in agreement with the intuition that the $n+1$ value is obtain by always adding something that is 1 on average. I know the CLT would hold for each $X_n/n$ and here I guess I am getting a constant density within most of the domain of interest from the sum of normal distributions. Can anyone help me in putting this on a better ground? Can I say something about the behaviour at the boundaries (around zero and around $N$)? Thanks
