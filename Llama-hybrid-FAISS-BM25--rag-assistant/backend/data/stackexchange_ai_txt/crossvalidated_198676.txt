MOOC about GARCH model

I have a fundamental math PhD background, but very little knowledge (only undergraduate) about statistics. Even by reading lots of online documents about GARCH , I find it hard to find the global philosophy. I'd like to find a MOOC about GARCH, and more generally time series. What are your recommendations?
