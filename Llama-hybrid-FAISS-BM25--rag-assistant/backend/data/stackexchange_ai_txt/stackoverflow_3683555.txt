I suspect that you are probably going about this the wrong way. Take a look at the answer to this question: How to lazy load Infragistics UltraWebTree control? This question was specifically about lazy-loading a tree view, but the same principles apply for lazy loading menu items. Follow these steps: On first page load, render the top level menu Include a function on the page that makes an ajax call to the server with the parent id and retuns the next level items for that parent (getNodes in my example) Bind this function to the click event of the top level menu items (that have sub items) In the success handler of the ajax call, inject the returned menu items below the parent and bind the same function to the click event of these items only. On callback, be careful not to bind the function to the click event of ALL menu items, because then you will end up getting the function bound multiple times to the top level items and called multiple times. Just bind to the returned items. Also, you need some way of determining that an item's sub items have already been loaded. That is what the following line in my example was for, but you might need something slightly different: if (jQuery(nodesDiv).text() == 'Loading...') { I used jQuery because it is the most concise, but you culd do this in pure js - I wouldn't recommend it.
