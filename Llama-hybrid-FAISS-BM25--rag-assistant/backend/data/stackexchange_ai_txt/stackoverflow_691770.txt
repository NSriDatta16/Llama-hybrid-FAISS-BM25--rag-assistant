When you select /config/a/b/ , you are selecting all children of b , which includes three text nodes and two elements. That is, given your XML above and only showing the fragment in question: p1 p2 the first child is the text (whitespace) following and preceding p1 ... . The second child is the first param element. The third child is the text (whitespace) between the two param elements. And so on. The whitespace isn't ignored in XML, although many forms of processing XML ignore it. You have a couple choices: Change your xpath expression so it will only select element nodes, as suggested by Ted Dziuba, or Loop over the five nodes returned and only select the non-text nodes. You could do something like this: for (int i = 0; i You can use the node type to select only element nodes, or to remove text nodes.
