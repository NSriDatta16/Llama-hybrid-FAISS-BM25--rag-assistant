Don't forget you can get all your client-side goodness that Mootools et al give you but on the server side, make coding a sheer joy when you get that up and running. As for speed, depends what you what it to do. We have a site running 1000's of lines of code in JScript ASP per page request, 60K users per day, 1000's of pages. Its is lightening fast! So fast that the case for re-coding it in .net is just not strong enough as the current code handles it perfectly well. Writting Javascript client side can hurt your head a bit at first, no elements to mess with just nice coding style with some really quirky feature (we pass an annoymous functions/closures into our DB code like so for instance: var hotels = DataLayer.FindByHotelByStarRating( 4 ) hotels.each( function( hotel ) { %> is rated as star Now thats pretty powerful and damn fun too, and the time spent learnng Mootools or advanced JS is not wasted as we can use it both Server-side and client side. We can use the same validation logic, the same JSON funcitons, the same Objects (if your careful) and so on. ASP with JScript is 100 times better/cleaner/simpler/nicer than VBScript and makes my job a joy rather than a VBScript head ache. Plus most importantly, its damn fun!
