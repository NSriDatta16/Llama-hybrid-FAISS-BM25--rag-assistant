Driver development is not an easy task at all. Anti-virus software require dealing with file system ( file system filter driver) that make the life more complex. It would be useful if you try to describe what are you trying to achieve more detailed. The most recommended resources for driver development is OSR . There is 2 related mailing lists: ntdev For general driver development ntfsd For file system drive development Book list can be found here . Unless the driver is your core busyness (in this case find the person with kernel experience) i would strongly suggest outsourcing this work. On lists above you can find plenty of consultants. Windows source basically can't be accessed :) unfortunately. To play with the virtual memory manager you must be in kernel mode, if this is possible at all. Try asking this question on ntdev, you will ask most of kernel developers in the world. You will need to ask more concrete question to get reasonable answer (i will watch the thread, interesting topic). If understand correctly what you are you want to do, this is impossible on Windows. At least not without major reverse engineering work, but i mostly work with standard types of drivers so it's i think i don't know enough to make a final conclusion. Response to comment : I'm not sure what exactly Entercept doing (did not find anything in product description suggesting they playing the memory or processes permissions). So defining final goal rather specific technology how to achieve this might be more productive way. Response to comment 2 : 1.1. What is LIDS? LIDS is an enhancement for the Linux kernel written by Xie Huagang and Philippe Biondi. It implements several security features that are not in the Linux kernel natively. Some of these include: 1. Mandatory access controls (MAC) - Don't know what is really mean. 2. Port scan detector - This is definitely doable look on this site. 3. Pile protection - File system filter driver explained above. 4. Process protection - You can hook process creation in your driver, look in ntdev archives there is a lot of discussions about this.
