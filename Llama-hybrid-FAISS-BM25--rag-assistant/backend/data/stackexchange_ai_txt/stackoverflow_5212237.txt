RSS management in MVC3 applications

My question is mainly inspired by the issues raised in response to RSS Feeds in ASP.NET MVC - a question that looks like it's drawn more than average amount to attention (ranks high in google's "RSS feeds from asp.net MVC" return. Because 2 distinctly different approaches have been voted up I'm hoping folks will find it worthwhile to re-examime the core question: What's the best way to handle the management of RSS feed in an MVC framework. In the time since that question was asked: Have the releases of .net v4 and/or MVC3; Experience acquired in the real world; or 3rd party libs changed a 'best practices' approach to handling RSS feeds?
