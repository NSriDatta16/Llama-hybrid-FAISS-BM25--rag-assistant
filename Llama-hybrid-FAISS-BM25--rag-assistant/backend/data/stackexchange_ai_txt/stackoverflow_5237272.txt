Store and Retrieve Multiple Avatar Image Sizes

I am building a forum type site whereby the users will have an avatar. The main page will have a small version whereas the single page will have a large version of the avatar. So for sake of bandwidth, I will have different sizes: example.png example_thumb.png What is the preferred storage and retrieval method for the different sizes? Here's what I have come up with so far: User Table UserId | AvatarName | AvatarExt 1 | example | .png This way I can get the base and thumb version with the same query as long as I know that there is a '_thumb' version Or should I create a meta table like so: UserMeta UserId | Avatar | AvatarType 1 | example.png | original 1 | example_thumb.png | thumbnail I would love some advice
