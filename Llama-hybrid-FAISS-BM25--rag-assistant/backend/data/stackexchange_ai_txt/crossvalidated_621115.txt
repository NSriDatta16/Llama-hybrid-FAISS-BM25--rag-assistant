Hi: The non geometric series version of the ES model is $\tilde y_t = \lambda \tilde{y}_{t-1} + (1-\lambda) y_{t-1}$ . ( you left out the multiplicative factor $(1-\lambda)$ on the outside of your sum ). The equivalent time series model ( in the sense that they give the same predictions ) is an arima(0,1,1). So, if you fit the arima(0,1,1) $y_t - y_{t-1} = \theta \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ and get back the value of the estimated MA coefficient $\theta$ , then you can use the mapping : $\hat{\lambda} = ( 1 - \hat{\theta})$ . That will give you the estimated value of $\lambda$ . Note that there's a proof somewhere that they are equivalent but it's been so long that I can't remember where you can find it. It might be in the Box-Jenkins-Reinsel text or in Harvey's structural time series text. Check Box-Jenkins-Reinsel first. Note: The arima(0,1,1) is also equivalent to a random walk plus noise model so, if you're more familiar with the state space framework, you can fit that instead. See Harvey's text for details on that equivalence.
