Problem using js jquery helper

I am using cakephp 1.3.6 and am trying to use inbuilt js helper. I have added var $helpers = array('Js' => array('Jquery')); in my controller. In my layout, I have included the jquery files and have also included echo $this->Js->writeBuffer(); before the tag. I checked if the jquery libraries correctly but trying to create a simple accordian from the jqueryui.com, it works fine. But when I try Js->get('#element'); $this->Js->drag(array( 'container' => '#content', 'start' => 'onStart', 'drag' => 'onDrag', 'stop' => 'onStop', 'snapGrid' => array(10, 10), 'wrapCallbacks' => false )); ?> something It does not work. I appreciate any help. Thanks.
