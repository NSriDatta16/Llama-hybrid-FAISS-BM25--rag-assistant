Credibility factor(Z) is weighting factor on data from risk itself, and (1-Z) weight on complement data(it is external information for the same risk). Now, you have variance from your complement data as 0, that is other information is statistically correct, no need for weightage-average. The expected-risk should be mean(complement data), so Z=0.
