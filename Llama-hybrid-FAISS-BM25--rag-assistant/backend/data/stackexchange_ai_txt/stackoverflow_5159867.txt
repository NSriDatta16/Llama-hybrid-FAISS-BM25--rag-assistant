Magento multiple stores on one server?

We have a Magento commerce store with a database of around 700 products. The store has one URL and one theme. It doesn't have any other language versions or anything like that. I am looking into our options for having a new URL for a second company (all under one company umbrella) with a different theme. So essentially there would be one database in use by two Magento stores with different themes. originalstore.com newstore.com Is this possible with the Community edition? Also, if it is possible can the newstore.com have different prices for the same products as originalstore.com? Any help or suggestions would be gratefully received!
