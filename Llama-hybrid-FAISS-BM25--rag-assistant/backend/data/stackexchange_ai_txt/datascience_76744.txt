There are something like 30 random forest packages in R. "randomForest" is one of the first implementations and so is well known, but it's not great for large datasets. "ranger" is a good R package; it's fast, handles large data, and has parameter tuning searches. It's easier to use with package "parsnip". library(ranger) library(parsnip) Build model: forest_model % set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% set_mode("regression") %>% fit(dependent_variable ~ . , data = training_data) Make guesses: predict(forest_model, new_data)
