There must be some interpreter or compiler for the scripting language. Check if it supports embedding in C or C++. Most script languages do. Next choice, or perhaps first, would be to just run the script externally, using the existing compiler/interpreter. I can't think of any reason why one of the first two options won't do, but if not, consider building an interpreter using ANTLR or for a small language Boost Spirit. Disclaimer: I haven't used the first, and I've only tried out Boost Spirit for a small toy example. Cheers & hth., PS: If you can choose the script language, consider JavaScript and just use Google's reportedly excellent embedding API.
