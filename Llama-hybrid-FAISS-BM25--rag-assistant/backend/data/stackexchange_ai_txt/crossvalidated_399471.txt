Generally, there is no reason to expect the model order for ARIMA to be the same as for GARCH, so would really question the use of the same orders in practice. It could be noted that sometimes very simple models such as ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) are used as rough approximations to the underlying autoregressive structure in the conditional mean and variance of, say, financial returns time series (e.g. these orders are the default in the ugarchspec function in rugarch package in R). But I doubt there is any general justification for other orders not equal to (1,1) or perhaps (1,0) or (0,1) (though I have shown here that GARCH( $p$ ,0) does not make much sense for any $p>0$ ).
