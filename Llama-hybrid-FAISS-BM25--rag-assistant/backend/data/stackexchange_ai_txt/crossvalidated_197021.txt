A SVM is a binary classifier. That means, you can distinguish only 2 classes. If both classes are the same, classification doesn't make sense. If you have more then 2 classes you need to use different classification methods, such as k-means or neural networks. However, multi-class classification with SVM can still be done by reducing the multi-class decision problem to multiple binary classifications .
