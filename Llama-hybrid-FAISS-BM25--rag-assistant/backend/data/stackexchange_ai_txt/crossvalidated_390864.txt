How to check randomness in a machine learning dataset?

given a standard machine learning dataset, is it possible to check whether the relationship between the inputs and outputs is random or not? If the relationship between inputs and outputs is random (or nearly random) then we should not expect much performance from any machine learning algorithm. Thanks Yes, this question is almost the same as mine question. But I'm not sure I understood the answers, so I would like to make my question more specific. Assume two continuous valued variables x and y. Is it possible to show that the relation between x and y is random (or almost random)? For example we can check the correlation between x and y, if there is no correlation then can we say the relationship is random? But is being correlated the opposite of being random? Any ideas?
