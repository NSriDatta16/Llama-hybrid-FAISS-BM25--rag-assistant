No, I see no value in it. Better to use a proper primary key and add an index to the column. The people who have spent years writing relational databases know how to optimize access far better than you do. I'd make the PK column auto increment, leaving the updating to the database. I'd add an index to the city name column so you can search by name as quickly as possible. You're presuming that you understand something about the physical storage of the database. At best, your efforts will have no effect; at worst, you'll screw up the fast access that a properly indexed b-tree will already give you.
