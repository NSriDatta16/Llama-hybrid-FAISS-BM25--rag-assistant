implementing jacobi algorithm to implement laplace equation

The Algorithm traverses a 2D NxN array, making every element the average of its 4 surrounding neighbors (left, right, top, down). The NxN array has initially all zeros and is surrounded by a margin with all 1’s as shown in the example below. The 1’s never change, and the 0’s increase little by little. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 I have implemented the following code and and am getting array index out of bounds exception . pls correct me . my code : public class Main { static int NO_OF_THREADS =8; /** * @param args the command line arguments */ public static void main(String[] args) { // TODO code application logic here Jacobi jacobi = new Jacobi(NO_OF_THREADS); jacobi.initialize(); jacobi.create_threads(); } }//end of Main class public class Jacobi { int ROWS=1000,COLS=1000; private int i; private int upper=100;//prevents buffer overflow private int lower=99;//prevents buffer overflow private int j; private double[][] jacobi=new double[ROWS][COLS]; private int NO_OF_THREADS; public Jacobi(int k) { NO_OF_THREADS=k; } public void initialize() { for(i=1;i
