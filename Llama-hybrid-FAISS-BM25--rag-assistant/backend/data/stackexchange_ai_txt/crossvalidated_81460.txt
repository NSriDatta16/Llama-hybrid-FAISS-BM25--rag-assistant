Regarding hurdle models, here's a quote from Advances in Mathematical and Statistical Modeling (Arnold, Balakrishnan, Sarabia, & Mínguez, 2008): The hurdle model is characterized by the process below the hurdle and the one above. Obviously, the most widely used hurdle model is the one that sets the hurdle at zero. Formally, the hurdle-at-zero model is expressed as: $P(N_i=n_i)=f_1(0)$ for $n_i=0$ $P(N_i=n_i)=\frac{1-f_1(0)}{1-f_2(0)}f_2(n_i)=\phi f_2(n_i)$ for $n_i=1,2,...$ The variable $\phi$ can be interpreted as the probability of crossing the hurdle, or more precisely in the case of insurance, the probability to report at least one claim. As for zero-inflated models, Wikipedia says : A zero-inflated model is a statistical model based on a zero-inflated probability distribution, i.e. a distribution that allows for frequent zero-valued observations. The zero-inflated Poisson model concerns a random event containing excess zero-count data in unit time. $^{[1]}$ For example, the number of claims to an insurance company by any given covered person is almost always zero, otherwise substantial losses would cause the insurance company to go bankrupt. The zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model employs two components that correspond to two zero generating processes. The first process is governed by a binary distribution that generates structural zeros. The second process is governed by a Poisson distribution that generates counts, some of which may be zero. The two model components are described as follows: $$\Pr (y_j = 0) = \pi + (1 - \pi) e^{-\lambda}$$ $$\Pr (y_j = h_i) = (1 - \pi) \frac{\lambda^{h_i} e^{-\lambda}} {h_i!},\qquad h_i \ge 1$$ where the outcome variable $y_j$ has any non-negative integer value, $\lambda_i$ is the expected Poisson count for the $i$ th individual; $\pi$ is the probability of extra zeros. From Arnold and colleagues (2008), I see that a hurdle-at-zero model is a special case of the more general class of hurdle models, but from a reference on Wikipedia ( Hall, 2004 ), I also see that some zero-inflated models can be upper-bounded. I don't quite understand the difference in the formulas, but they seem to be quite similar (both even use a very similar example, insurance claims). I hope other answers can help explain any important difference(s), and that this answer will help set the stage for those. Wikipedia's reference: Lambert, D. (1992).
