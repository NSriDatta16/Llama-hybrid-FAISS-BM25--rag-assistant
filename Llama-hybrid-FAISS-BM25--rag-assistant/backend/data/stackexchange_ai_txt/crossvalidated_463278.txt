How to apply hypothesis or A/B test to 2 distributions obtained using 2 different methods

I am new to running statistical experiments. Thanks for your help in advance. Suppose now I have 2 different machine learning algorithm to enhance a picture's resolution from a neural networks. The metric I used to measure the output is PSNR, the higher the better. Now, I run a baseline model over 5000 samples with ground-truth, and got a PSNR distribution; then I applied my model on that same 5000 samples and got another PSNR distribution. Upon here, I want to validate if my model works no significant difference than the baseline model because the baseline model is using ground- truth and in turn my assumption is that if the baseline model is used with raw inputs instead of ground truth, the performance would not be better than ours. But I am still quite confused about how should the pipeline look like. Could you guys please give me some inspirations? Thanks. The plots for 2 distribution can be found here:
