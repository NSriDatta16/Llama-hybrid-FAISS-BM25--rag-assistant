What is the effect of highly correlated data on a Convolutional Neural Network?

A speech audio sample can be converted to MFCC coefficients for further analysis. I wanted to know the effect of correlated data on a CNN. I know the process of computing the MFCC coefficient, which applies Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to decorrelate the filter bank coefficients and yield a compressed representation of the filter banks. I wanted to argue on the usage of filter banks vs MFCC when we want to further analyze using a CNN. Filter banks result in highly correlated data. MFCC result in decorrelated data. Which of the two should i choose if i plan to train a CNN model for speech classification?
