From your code, it looks like you may be using random training/validation splits to fit models. This is OK for data sets where each observation is statistically independent, but it's not appropriate for time series analysis. Because there's autocorrelation in time series data, there's a lot of similarity between adjacent time points. If you split the data randomly into training/validation sets, there will be points that contain very similar information in both the training and validation sets. For example, y100 is probably very similar to y101, so when y100 is in your training set and y101 in the validation set, this point is no longer acting as an independent validation of your model. I recommend you use a rolling time window cross-validation instead to tune your model. There's some more description of this here: https://otexts.com/fpp2/accuracy.html
