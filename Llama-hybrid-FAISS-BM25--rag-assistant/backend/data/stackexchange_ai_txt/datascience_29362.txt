How to find relation between N components and predict the value of any one component using the predicted relation?

I am new to Machine learning and trying to learn by practicing. I have a situation where I am reading a set of N data. Each of N data will have independent state at any moment of time. I want to use these N data to find a relation between them. In case if I am not receiving one or more sets of data, I should be able to use available relation between N data to predict the missing data. What type of machine learning algorithm can be used?
