loop fails when increasing string from elements in list

I have some problem with sequence generator. I have a file where each line contain one fragment (8 letters). I load it from file in to list, where each element is one fragment. It is DNA so it should go that way: 1. Takes first 8-letter element 2. Check for element in which first 7 letters is the same as last 7 letters in first. 3. Add 8th letter from second element in to sequence. It should look like this: ATTGCCAT TTGCCATA TGCAATAC So sequence: ATTGCCATAC Unfortunately it only add one element. :( First element is given (we knew it). I do it that way its first in file (first line). Here is the code: from os import sys import random def frag_get(seqfile): frags = [] f_in = open(seqfile, "r") for i in f_in.readlines(): frags.append(i.strip()) f_in.close() return frags def frag_list_shuffle(frags): random.shuffle(frags) return frags def seq_build(first, frags): seq = first for f in frags: if seq[-7:] == f[:7]: seq += f[-1:] return seq def errors(): pass if __name__ == "__main__": frags = frag_get(sys.argv[1]) first = frags[0] frags.remove(first) frags = frag_list_shuffle(frags) seq = seq_build(first, frags) check(sys.argv[2], seq) spectrum(sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3]) I have deleted check and spectrum functions because it's simple calculations e.g. length comparison, so it is not what cause a problem as I think. I will be very thankfully for help! Regards, Mateusz
