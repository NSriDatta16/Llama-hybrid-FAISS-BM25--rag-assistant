How to add a JLabel on the DRAG_LAYER under the mouseDragged event

I am currently working on a drag n drop application and I would really like to know what's happening inside the JLayeredPane and I get a particular program behaviour... Here's the deal: I have a chessboard placed on the DEFAULT_LAYER. I also have a chessPiece which I'd like to be added to the DRAG_LAYER when I move it. But I have a fetish... I want to use this line layeredPane.add(chessPiece, JLayeredPane.DRAG_LAYER); only under the mouseDragged event. So, when I do this, my chessPiece disappears while moving my mouse and gets hidden behind the chessboard (?!?) When I change the above line into this: layeredPane.add(chessPiece, JLayeredPane.DRAG_LAYER,0); everything becomes normal again. Why is that happening?
