.Split() does not provide this information. You will need to use a regular expression to accomplish what you are after, which I infer as the desire to split an English-ish paragraph into sentences by splitting on punctuation. The simplest implementation would look like this. var input = "some text. with punctuation! in it?"; string[] sentences = Regex.Split(input, @"\b(? .*?[\.!?](?:\s|$))"); foreach (string sentence in sentences) { Console.WriteLine(sentence); } Results some text. with punctuation! in it? But you are going to find very quickly that language, as spoken/written by humans, does not follow simple rules most of the time. Here it is in VB.NET for you: Dim sentences As String() = Regex.Split(line, "\b(? .*?[\.!?](?:\s|$))")
