401 seems grammatically correct, however a 401 is actually a statement presented back to the browser to ask for credentials - the browser would then expect to check the WWW-Authenticate header so that it could challenge the user to enter the correct details. To quote the spec. The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity might include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication" [43]. If you do a 302 you at least guarantee that the user will be directed to a page where they can log in if non-standard log in is being used. I wouldn't care much what search engines and the like think about 401's.
