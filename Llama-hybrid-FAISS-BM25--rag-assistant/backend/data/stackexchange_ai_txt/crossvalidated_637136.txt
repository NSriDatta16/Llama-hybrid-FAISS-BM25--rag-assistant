In your notation, given the posterior distribution $p(\theta|h_t)$ and the density of a future observation $p(y_{t+1}|\theta,x_{t+1})$ , posterior predictive distribution is $$ p(y_{t+1}|h_t,x_{t+1}) = \int_{\theta\in\Theta}p(\theta|h_t)p(y_{t+1}|\theta,x_{t+1})\,\text{d}\theta. $$ Therefore, the posterior predictive distribution doesn't depend on unknown quantities, such as the parameter $\theta$ . If $Y_t$ are continuous random variables, then as for any continuous random variable $P(Y_{t+1} = a|h_t,x_{t+1})=0$ , for any scalar $a$ . You could undoubtedly compute the posterior predictive probability that $Y_{t+1}$ is within some interval if that's what you are after. The Bayesian approach equips you with the entire distribution of a future observation $Y_{t+1}$ conditional on the past data and the prior information. What you can achieve with that depends on the purpose of the analysis. For instance, you could compute the expected value of such a prediction, the variance, or you may compute the 95% prediction interval, etc.
