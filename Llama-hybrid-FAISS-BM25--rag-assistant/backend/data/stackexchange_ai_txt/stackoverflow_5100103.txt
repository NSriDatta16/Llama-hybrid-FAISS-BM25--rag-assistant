What do you mean by "guarantee transaction"? There are two conepts in MongoDB that are similar; Atomic operations Using safe mode / getlasterror ... http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Last+Error+Commands If you simply need to know if there was an error when you run an update for example you can use the getlasterror command, from the docs ... getlasterror is primarily useful for write operations (although it is set after a command or query too). Write operations by default do not have a return code: this saves the client from waiting for client/server turnarounds during write operations. One can always call getLastError if one wants a return code. If you're writing data to MongoDB on multiple connections, then it can sometimes be important to call getlasterror on one connection to be certain that the data has been committed to the database. For instance, if you're writing to connection # 1 and want those writes to be reflected in reads from connection #2, you can assure this by calling getlasterror after writing to connection # 1. Alternatively, you can use atomic operations for cases where you need to increment a value for example (like an upvote, etc.) more about that here: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations As a side note, MySQL's default storage engine doesn't have transaction either! :) http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/myisam-storage-engine.html
