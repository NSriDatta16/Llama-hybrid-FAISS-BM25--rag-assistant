One case of theorem 2.2 in this paper says that if we define (for positive numbers rather than whole probability distributions) $S(p,q) = (p-q)\log(p/q)$ then $\sqrt S$ is a metric. (I haven't looked at the paper closely enough to vouch for its correctness, but in any case you have no more reason to trust me than to trust its author :-).) If so, then your symmetrized KL divergence is a metric on probability distributions, because of the following theorem: if you have metric spaces $(M_1,d_1)$, $(M_2,d_2)$, etc., then $(M_1 \times M_2 \times \cdots$, $\sqrt{d_1^2+d_2^2+\cdots}$ is also a metric space; see e.g. Wikipedia . EDITED in the light of the now-accepted answer to add: So, clearly it is not true that $\sqrt S$ (as in my first paragraph above) is a metric. And indeed it isn't; specifically (taking the counterexample in that answer as inspiration) we have both $S(0.1,0.2) + S(0.2,0.3)
