Unconditional variance with external regressor in volatility model

I am analysing the unconditional variance of a time series, with the rugarch package in R. However with an external regressor which is a dummy variable 0 before a certain date and 1 after this date. Here is the code: specgarch My question is: How can the unconditional variance of this model be calculated and how can the conditional variance be calculated (i.e., when dummy = 0 and when dummy = 1)? How does rugarch do it? Here is the output: mu omega alpha1 beta1 vxreg1 -1.938049e-04 1.428670e-06 5.485199e-02 9.420126e-01 1.751348e-06 and unconditional variance: 0.0007350932
