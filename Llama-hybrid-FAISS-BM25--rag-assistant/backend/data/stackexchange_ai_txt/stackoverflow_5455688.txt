I think the staticfiles app is exactly what you're looking for, unfortunately it's new in Django 1.3. Are you able to upgrade? From the docs: django.contrib.staticfiles collects static files from each of your applications (and any other places you specify) into a single location that can easily be served in production. EDIT: As per Wogan's comment, if you don't want to upgrade to 1.3 then you can use the Staticfiles standalone app . It's what Django's built in staticfiles app was originally derived from.
