Using .data() method in jQote – client-side templating plugin

For the past few weeks, i have been using jQote – client-side templating plugin to generate html fragments in runtime. For months i have been using the dom attributes like, id, class, alt to store critical data. Now, I came to know about .data() method in jquery to store and retrieve data. All over my project i am generating html fragments dynamically using templates. Now i need to know how can i use .data() in these templates dynamically and store critical data within any dynamically created element. The template js code is like this, var template = templateCache.idOfTheTemplate; // say its a for(var i = 0; i Template: ">//here i want to use .data() and store the id with different key " href="#"> Solution: $("#ulID").jqotepre(template, data); After this line has been executed, that element was available in the DOM. So, you can just do this, $("#ulID").jqotepre(template, data); $('#' + data.id).data('liInfo', data);//data.id is the ID of the li element in the DOM
