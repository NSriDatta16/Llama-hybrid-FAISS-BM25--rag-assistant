Swing Matisse GUI - cannot add custom made bean to "Other components"

I made a custom ValueObject class with properties (getters/setters) and I need this class for data binding of elements on form. So I want to drag it to "other components" on matisse editor so I can bind it - and nothing happens.... Any similar experiences? The same issue is happening both on NetBeans 6.5 and MyEclipse 7.0M2
