Random forest interpretation

I don't understand if in random forest the features mean that a variable is positively correlated with the probability or simply it means that the feature has an influence in the prediction. For instance, I have a target variable called "churn", with 1 meaning churn happened. The variable age=25 has a 25% weight in feature. Does it mean that age=25 influences churn=1 or does it simply influence churn and could for instance influence more churn=0?
