Your solution is about one of the only pragmatic ones. There is nothing new under the sun. The IETF Routing Information Protocol wasn't the first attempt at addressing this problem, but it is well documented and works. Note well, that there is no optimal (or perfect) solution to the class of problems which you are facing, the best you can do with in-band monitoring is make good guesses about where the fault is. In systems that need a very high degree of accuracy of fault information (e.g. the public switched telephone network ) a parallel out-of-band monitoring network is established which itself must necessarily be monitored by humans.
