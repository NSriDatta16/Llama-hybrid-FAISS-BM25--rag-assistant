what does IB do behind the scene when I link IBoutlets/IBActions?

I am new to mac dev, xcode and IB etc. I understand how to build simple applications and basic dragging & dropping in IB, but i don't know what and where does IB do with the objects. the second questions is how to write a MVC without using IB?
