Sign of the unnormalized log likelihood in Ising model

Here is a section of Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Patrick Murphy I don't understand in (19.18) why there is a negative sign. For me, $\log \tilde{p}(\mathbf{y})=\sum_{s\sim t}\log\psi_{st}(y_s,y_t)$ holds. When $y_s$ and $y_t$ agree, $\log\psi_{st}(y_s,y_t)=w_{st}$, otherwise $\log\psi_{st}(y_s,y_t)=-w_{st}$. So shouldn't it be $\log \tilde{p}(\mathbf{y})=\sum_{s\sim t} y_sw_{st}y_t$? Also, when all entries of $\mathbf{y}$ agree, $\sum_{s\sim t} y_sw_{st}y_t$ is maximized because all summands are positive. So where is the problem? Do I miss something? Thank you.
