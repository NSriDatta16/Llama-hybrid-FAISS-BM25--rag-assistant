Although your solution works, it's not interacting with the WebDateChooser as a user would. This might be what you want, however after having a quick look at the with example demo at http://samples.infragistics.com/2007.3/webfeaturebrowser/WebDateChooser/Grid/webform1.aspx I was able to put together a simple script to interact with the WebDateChooser: clickAt | id=UltraWebGrid1_rc_0_5 waitForVisible | id=WebDateChooser1_img clickAt | id=WebDateChooser1_img waitForVisible | id=WebDateChooser1_DrpPnl_Calendar1_504 select | id=WebDateChooser1_DrpPnl_Calendar1_504 | label=July select | id=WebDateChooser1_DrpPnl_Calendar1_506 | label=1978 click | id=WebDateChooser1_DrpPnl_Calendar1_d13 These locators are using the IDs, that look like they may be dynamic and unreliable. If so, you might want to look into some more reliable XPath or CSS locators.
