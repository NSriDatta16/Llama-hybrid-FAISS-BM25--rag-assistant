Using Ifstream to add numbers from text file to a C Style Array

I am having trouble with the title above. I have tried the following but it does not act in the correct behaviour. void ArrayIntStorage::read(ifstream& in) { if(in.is_open()) { while(!in.eof()) { in.getline(arrayStorage, sizeof(in)); } } } ofstream& ArrayIntStorage::write(ofstream &out) const { for (int i = 0; i I am a novice at C++ programming, so I am probably doing something stupid. Thanks in advance.
