A common way to do this (which is typically advised against) is to render into a string in your model or rake task: cached_content = ActionView::Base.new(Rails::Configuration.new.view_path).render(:partial => "newsletter", :locals => {:page => self,:collection => posts}) see here for a more full description: http://www.compulsivoco.com/2008/10/rendering-rails-partials-in-a-model-or-background-task/ If you are using page or fragment caching, you could pull the content out of the cache. The easiest way to do this is to just enable caching, and then look at where the files are being placed. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html
