Does the high coefficient of determination in this graph predict a huge spike in global warming?

I have had three semesters of college statistics as part of my BSBA degree. From what I recall from regression analysis the graph seems to show a very high coefficient of determination between CO2 and temperature would tend to be be a reliable predictor of future changes in one variable based on changes to the other. People here are saying that climate science does not predict the one-to-one relationship between global CO2 and global temperature that the graph seems to clearly show. How is this discrepancy explained? This is the closest to the original question. The answer seems to come from climate science rather than statistics. Even though the graph has an R-squared value of 0.752, showing a consistent linear relationship between CO2 and temperature, climate science seems to indicate that increases in CO2 have a logarithmic relation to changes in temperature. The best numbers that I could find are for every doubling of CO2 global temperature increases 3C. The average coefficient of determination (R-squared) turns out to be 0.752 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5840396/ For the entire record, the 90% confidence ranges of the correlations (R-squared) of CO2 with δD, ΔTsite and ΔTsource are 0.68–0.73, 0.76–0.80 and 0.75–0.79, respectively.
