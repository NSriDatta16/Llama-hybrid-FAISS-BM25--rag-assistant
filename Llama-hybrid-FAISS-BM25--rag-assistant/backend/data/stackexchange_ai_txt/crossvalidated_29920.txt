Without knowing the population distribution you cannot know the exact distribution of the sample variance. However each squared deviation from the mean has the same distribution and they are averaged and only weakly dependent. So for large n the sample variance is approximately normally distributed with mean Ïƒ$^2$ and variance as given above. So you can use the normal approximation to get an approximate 95% confidence interval. On the other hand if n is small and the CLT cannot be applied you can generate bootstrap confidence intervals. But keep in mind that in my paper with LaBudde I showed that for highly skewed distributions such as the lognormal the bootstrap intervals will severely undercover in the small sample size situation. But it will work fine for symmetric distributions and distributions that have mild skew.
