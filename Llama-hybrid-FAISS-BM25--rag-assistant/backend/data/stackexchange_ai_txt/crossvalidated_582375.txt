How should I report logistic regression on a poster?

An example of my odds ratio bar chart: I am developing a poster that reports on a research project I've been working on this summer. For the project, I ran a logistic regression with 1 continuous predictor and 7 binary predictors in r. Three of those predictors were significant and to show this on the poster, I reported the odds ratios of those predictors using a simple bar chart. Given that this is a simple poster meant for a general audience, I did not include the 95% CI on the forest plot graph so as not to overwhelm with data. Instead I want to include all information about the model in a small footnote. My question is, what information do I need to include about the model in the footnote? Should I calculate a pseudo-R2 for the full model and report that along with the degrees of freedom? Do I need to specify the p values and 95% CIs for each significant predictor individually? I only have a small space with which to do this so I want to be selective about which information is included.
