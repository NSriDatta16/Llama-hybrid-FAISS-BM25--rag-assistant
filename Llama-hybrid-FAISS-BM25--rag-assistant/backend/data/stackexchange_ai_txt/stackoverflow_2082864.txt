Extending GWT's Widget Class

I'm making a new class called 'Cell' which extends the GWT Widget class. The purpose of this class is to be a cell in a spreadsheet -- it therefore must be able to switch between being a GWT Label object and a GWT TextBox object. The only way that I can think of doing this is by making Cell extend Widget and include a private Widget called 'cell' which I can store the current Label or TextBox object with. Like so... public class Cell extends Widget { private Widget cell; ... } Unfortunately, this solution is not ideal because if I want Cell to fully operate like a Widget, I will have override Widget's methods to point to my inner 'cell' Widget. Is there a more elegant way of creating a Cell Widget which can be either a Label or TextBox?
