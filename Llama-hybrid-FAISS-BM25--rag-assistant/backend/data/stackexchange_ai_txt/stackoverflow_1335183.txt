Having had no tidbits submitted on this I delved further into the issue. First, I obtained some information from Microsoft (via MSDN support) that standard drag-and-drop behavior does a move while holding down Control with drag-and-drop does a copy . Next, consider these three modes of operation: User can edit text. User can move text (via drag-and-drop). Application can change text programmatically. According to Microsoft, setting read-only disables only item (1) ! To also honor read-only for item (2) one must manually code the solution rather than using the read-only property. Well, to me this is clearly a defect. I believe read-only should disable both (1) and (2). So I submitted an official defect report to Microsoft Connect espousing this opinion. Alas, the response came back as essentially "Thanks, but not important enough issue to fix." Sigh...
