Interpretation of odds in logistic regression

I have been reading the odds tutorial on UCLA's stats page . And I am trying to figure out if my interpretation of the results below is correct. Based upon looking at the data the results seem to hold true. Variables to Predict Submit or Cancel (1,0) DummyServiceA: Binary DummyServiceB: Binary DummyServiceC: Binary AT_START: Continous ID_SEQ: Continous TOT: Continous Logistic Regression Results exp(cbind(OR = coef(mymodel), confint(mymodel))) OR 2.5 97.5 DummyServiceA 0.3994 0.3215 0.4982 DummyServiceB 6.5028 5.1442 8.2549 DummyServiceC 0.2928 0.239 0.3604 AT_START 0.9986 0.9984 0.9987 ID_SEQ 0.949 0.94 0.9579 TOT 0.9992 0.9984 0.9998 Odds of Submit are 60% lower if ServiceA is selected instead of ServiceB or ServiceC Odds of Submit are 550% higher if ServiceB is selected instead of ServiceA or ServiceC Odds of Submit are 71% lower if ServiceC is selected instead of ServiceA or ServiceB For every unit increase in AT_START there is 0% change in odds for Submit 5% decrease in odds of Submit for every unit increase in ID_SEQ For every unit increase in TOT there is 0% change in odds for Submit
