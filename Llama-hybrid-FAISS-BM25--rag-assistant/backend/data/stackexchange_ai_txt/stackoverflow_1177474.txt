How can I set the Cache-Control header for every response in Catalyst?

It seems that by default Catalyst does not output Cache-Control: , etc. headers. I know I can output them in a given controller method like this: $c->response->headers->last_modified(time); $c->response->headers->expires(time + $self->{cache_time}); $c->response->headers->header(cache_control => "public, max-age=$self->{cache_time}"); It'd get pretty painful doing that in each method, though! What I'd prefer is: A default set of headers (expires now, last modified now, cache-control: no-cache, pragma: no-cache) A way to, per-method, override the default. Is there a good way to accomplish this?
