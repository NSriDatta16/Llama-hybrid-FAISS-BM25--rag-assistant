I would approach this in terms of a response trajectory whereby you can explicilty examine 1) any change in the mean level pre-to-post and 2) any change in the slope/curve before and after the stimulus. I have used multilevel models to do this in the past. The level 1 model is set up as an interupted time series and the variation in the pre-to-post change is examined at level 2 (i.e. treatment group memebership). Think about it as a segmented regression, with each segment representing the pre- and post-treatment periods. This would be the level 1 model: Yt= bo+ b1T + b2D + b3P + e Level 2 models: b2 = g2 + (person factors) + u2 b3 = g3 + (person factors) + u3 T is time from the start of the observational period; it is represented by a Continuous variable beginning at 1. b1 is the slope pre-treatment. D is a dummy variable for pre or post intervention; Coded 0 prior to intervention, 1 post intervention. b2 is the change in level post-treatment. P is time since the intervention; Prior to intervention coded 0. Post intervention; continuous starting at 1. b3 is the change in slope post-treatment. g2/3 is the grand mean of these effects and ut2/3 is the error in these models. In a mixed model, b2 and b3 could be specified as random effects; which you can model to see if person level factors explain the variation in the effects of the treatment.
