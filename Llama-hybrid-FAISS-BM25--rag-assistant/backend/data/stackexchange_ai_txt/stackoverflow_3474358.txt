HTML5 Application Cache Not Working

I've been writing a simple text-editor in HTML5 that is supposed to work offline. I can't, however, get the offline application cache to work, and I can't work out why not. My manifest file is like this: CACHE MANIFEST application.html options.html ... And it is being invoked as follows: ... I'm using Google App Engine to host the web application. I've put the webpage through the W3C HTML validator ( http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwrite-space.appspot.com%2F ) and it comes out fine. I've tested it in Chrome and Firefox. In Chrome nothing is added to the cache storage (and window.applicationCache.status returns 0). In Firefox the notification bar asking to cache the files does not appear. Basically, the files are not being cached. I've looked at various demos that do cache for offline viewing, and cannot work out why my code does not work. Can anyone help?
