When analysing time series data with lme4, how do you include both a step-change and a slope-change?

I have some time series data including four different locations. There is an intervention at a certain point in time (different in each location). d I am trying to fit a model that allows both a different step change and slope change in each location. Currently I have a model that allows the step change: m In particular, you can see the slopes for location 2 are poorly modelled: How would you modify the glmer formula so it includes a change-in-slope?
