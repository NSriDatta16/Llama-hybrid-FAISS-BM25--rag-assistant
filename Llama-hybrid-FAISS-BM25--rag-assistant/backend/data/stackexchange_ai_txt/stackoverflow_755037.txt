I thought of something along the lines of counting the average time between combats and counting the average rate of fire while in combat. To do so, you would need 5 variables like this: float avgTimeWithoutCombat; float currentTimeWithoutCombat; float avgRateOfFire; int shotsFired; float combatTimeElapsed; As long as the player does not fight, you count the "peaceful" time in currentTimeWithoutCombat. When he fires, add it to avgTimeWithoutCombat and divide it by 2 to get the average. Everytime the player attacks, increase the count of shotsFired. Also, count the time of the combat. Check in the main loop if a certain time without any attacks elasped. If so, the combat has ended and you can calculate the avgRateOfFire. Now you have two values to measure the aggressiveness of the player: avgTimeWithoutCombat: The bigger this number, the less aggressive is the player. avgRateOfFire: The bigger this number, the more aggressive the player.
