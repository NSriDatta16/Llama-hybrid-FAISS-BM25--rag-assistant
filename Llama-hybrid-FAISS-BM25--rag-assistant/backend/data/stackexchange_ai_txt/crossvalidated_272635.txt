Forecasting using SVM regression in R

I made an SVM regression model in R using e1071 package for forecasting daily electricity demand. My dataset consists of daily weather and energy consumption data from 1/01/14 till 31/12/16. I trained and tested my model. How will I start forecasting from 1/01/17 for next the 30 days
