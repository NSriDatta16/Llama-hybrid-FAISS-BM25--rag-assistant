Time series analysis: Determine if trend is deterministic fluctuating/stable or stochastic

I am analysing sales data of certain products and need to determine if the demand trend is deterministic fluctuating or deterministic stable or stochastic. How do I do that in R / what approach is usually applied to do so? Quarterly values would be for example: 2424,3030,3207,2943,2631,2863,2711,2837,2839,2876,3075,2886,2520,3136,3235,3071,2923,3237, 3054,3321,2856,3389,3092,3325
