One solution I always use to prevent duplicate file references, is to create a solution folder such as "Project Dependencies". And then all refereces are made from that folder, so when building it pulls from the Project Dependencies folder. This would work for resource files also, just copy them to the solution folder first and then drag them into your resource. And for the assembly icon, just browse to the Project Dependencies folder as well. Good Luck!
