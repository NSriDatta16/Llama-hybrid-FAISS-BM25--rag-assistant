Determining which methods to use to find how close a day is from the average pattern

Would anyone have advice on how to determine how close a day is to matching the average pattern of all days? I would like to take each day of the year and evaluate how close that day is from the average of all days in the year. Ultimate goal is to select 7 days in the year that are closest to this average pattern. I think I should be looking for which day has the lowest error, but am not positive. In this sample image, the red is the average of the year and the blue represents one day. X axis is hours, y is observation.
