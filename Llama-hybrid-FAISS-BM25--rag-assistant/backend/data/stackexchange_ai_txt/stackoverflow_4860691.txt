Actually the error was something else, the code provided by RobertPitt is correct for clearing of form fields and my code was also correct for clearing of form fields. But the problem is that, on the clear button I had applied a class="cancel" so that the form should not get submitted because it was an aspx:button . But according to what is written in JQuery docs, clicking of a button whose class is cancel should skip the validation, but after that if I click on a normal submit button validation should fire which was not firing in my case. I just removed the cancel class and it worked.
