Please see: Storing a file in a database as opposed to the file system? I have working C# code for SQL Server 2005 if you decide to store in the Database here: Save and Restore Files/Images to SQL Server Database This MS Research paper by the late Jim Gray: To BLOB or Not To BLOB: Large Object Storage in a Database or a Filesystem has the following advice: As expected from the common wisdom, objects smaller than 256K are best stored in a database while objects larger than 1M are best stored in the filesystem. Between 256K and 1M, the read:write ratio and rate of object overwrite or replacement are important factors.
