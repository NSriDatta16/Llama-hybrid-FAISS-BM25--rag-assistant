Using Subversive to move the head back one revision

Using Eclipse/Subversive I commanded it to delete a branch of mine. Unfortunately it also took the liberty of wiping out my trunk folder. SVN isn't my strong suit so I am trying to figure out how to get Subversive to move it's head back one revision so the trunk/branch that was deleted re-appears again. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks!
