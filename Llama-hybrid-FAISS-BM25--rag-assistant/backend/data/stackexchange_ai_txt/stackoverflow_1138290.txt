How can I move around and slide away a UIView with touches and swipes?

IÂ´m trying to animate a sort of draggable UIView where the behaviour should be something like this: Drag along the screen following the touch of the user. Detect a swipe touch and drag automatically with an initial speed and a negative acceleration that makes is stop after some time. Something like moving around a photo and then through it to one side of the screen. Any tips on this?
