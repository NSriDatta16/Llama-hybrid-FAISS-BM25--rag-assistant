Default picture for iPhone 4

How shall I manage to make a default image for my iphone application that is large enough for the Retina screen? The screenshots I take with the Organizer in XCode is 320px x 480px, however how can I manage to get a screenshot twice as large? It is just a picture of the UINavigationBar, empty area in the middle and a UITabBar at the bottom with all content removed. Thanks in advance.
