Since your data is small I would suggest generating all interaction terms you can think of first. This could be done with domain expertise (knowledge of possible interaction for example in the form of physics formula) or automatically generate everything for example with automatic feature engineering or for your case I you could probably use sklearn PolynomialFeatures up to degree 2. Please do not forget to apply standardization after that. The next step you can do feature selection. For your case you could use Lasso regression. If you haven't used lasso before it is simply a linear regression with $L_1$ norm weight regularization. This have unique properties of pushing less useful feature weights to 0 and hence you could consider removing those features.
