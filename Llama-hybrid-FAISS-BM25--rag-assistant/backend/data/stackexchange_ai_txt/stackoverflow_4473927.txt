The keypairs can only be downloaded once from Amazon, presumably for security reasons. What you could do, is assign one of your Elastic IP's to the instance and route traffic through that normally. Snapshot the instance and bring up a duplicate with a new Keypair. Switch the Elastic IP over to the new instance. This is not particularly elegant, but is much less downtime than a full shutdown. Note: If you assign the Elastic IP to the instance, it will override the current public IP, so you will have to make sure to update DNS as well.
