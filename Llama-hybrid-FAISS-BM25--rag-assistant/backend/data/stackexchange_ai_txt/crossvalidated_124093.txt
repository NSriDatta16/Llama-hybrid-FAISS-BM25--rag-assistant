Label propagation in semi-supervised learning

Suppose we have a set of labeled and unlabeled instances. 70%unlabeled 30% labeled. We apply a semi-supervised algorithm. Let's say we apply S3VM or Laplacian SVM. We use all the data available. When finish training we have a function $f(\mathbf{x})$ that predict the class label. Is it correct now to label the unlabeled samples we have used to train the classifier with this function?
