Magento CMS pages menu

I have modified the code from Magento static pages menu a little bit to include a class for the active menu link. getCollection()->addStoreFilter(Mage::app()->getStore()->getId());?> getSelect() ->where('is_active = 1'); ?> getData(); ?> " class="active" > And I have added a new field to the CMS pages to specify if the page should be included in the menu by using true or false. Actually, as you can see above I am only checking for a setting of false, everything else will get a link. You'll need to add a new field to the cms_page table if you are going to use this. $fieldset->addField('menu', 'text', array( 'name' => 'menu', 'label' => Mage::helper('cms')->__('On Menu'), 'title' => Mage::helper('cms')->__('On Menu'), 'required' => true, 'disabled' => $isElementDisabled )); I have also added another field to the CMS pages named sortorder which contains a number for the order the links should be on the menu. Has anybody got any tips on how I could use the new sortorder field to sort the order of the menu links? Cheers
