A register is the most basic data storage device. Now these are the main differences. A register file is generally a large collection of registers organised in such a way so that they are used for computations. In a modern processor, all computations are performed between values stored in several registers in a register file. A hardware register generally refers to registers that store configuration and status information. This could be for the processor or some external hardware I/O device. A programme register may refer to the programme counter, a special register that stores the memory location of the current instruction being executed by the processor.
