You can use SDTable.com. There is an simple API which you can attach to your table and get out an id form selected row. Something like: $SDT(1).SetSelectionTrigger(myfunc); function myfunc(id, row) { alert(id); // do something } You generate SDT code with an easy drag&drop interface and everything is done in minutes... Works just great for me
