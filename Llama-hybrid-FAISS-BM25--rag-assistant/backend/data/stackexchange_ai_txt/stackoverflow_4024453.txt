The UA string tells the long and tragic history of (in)compatibility attempts. See e.g. this for a brief history of the UA . It should also make clear that UA sniffing is useless, as every modern browser pretends to be many other browsers. That is also the case you see here: Mozilla - the most ancient artefact, dating from the early 1990s X11 - the graphical interface used Linux i686 - OS and processor type en_US - your locale (English, United States) AppleWebKit/534.7 - the actual rendering engine (KHTML, like Gecko) - another artifact of browser sniffing: "Gecko" is the FF rendering engine, KHTML is an old rendering engine, predecessor of WebKit (was used by Konqueror browser, then forked by Apple to form WebKit) Chrome/7.0.517.41 - the actual browser version Safari/537 - yet another artifact against scripts sniffing for "Safari" (which uses the same engine) In short: some broken sites assumed that "only allowing people with Mozilla/Firefox/Webkit/whatever" is a sensible policy; in turn, browsers started lying about their origins to get around these artificial barriers. The UA strings are the result: bloatware, full of useless garbage.
