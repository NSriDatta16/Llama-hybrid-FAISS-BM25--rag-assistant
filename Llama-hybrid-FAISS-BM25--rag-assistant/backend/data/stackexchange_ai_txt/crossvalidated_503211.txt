Logistic or convert it to dummy?

My dependent variable is a Likert scale categorical variable. I've already run a first set of ordinary logistic regressions - however, I was wondering whether it is common practice to run the regression by converting 4 or 5-scale Likert variables into two - for example, if one of my variables is has four scales "Strongly agree", "Somewhat agree", "Somewhat disagree" and "Strongly disagree", would it be useful to also run the regressions with a dummy variable 0="Disagree" 1="Agree"? Thank you
