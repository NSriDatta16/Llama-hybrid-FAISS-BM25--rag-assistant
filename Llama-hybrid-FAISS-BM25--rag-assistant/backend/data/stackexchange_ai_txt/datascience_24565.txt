Neural network predicted value

I am starting to learn about machine learning as a whole and have found a big interest in Neural Networks. My question today is, Given a simple cost function $J$ with weights $w1, w2$ and inputs $m1, m2$ and a target prediction/error $b$ so that $J = w1*m1 + w2*m2 + b$. Lets say we want to develop an algorithm that can detect by the heights and length of the flower pedal which color the flower was. To save time I have already seen clustering in the graph and the red flowers which are close to 1 while the blue are close to 0. Most cost function outputs go from 0 to 1 (I think due to the sigmoid function), 1 being yes or some desired output = red and 0 being no or another desired output = blue. Now, what if instead of looking at two different colors (red and blue) what if our Machine wants to analyze 10 colors given the heights and length of the pedals? Would we say that if the output of the cost function was 2.1 (2 being green) it would be green for example or if its 5.2 (5 being yellow) its yellow? Not sure how to analyze more than two things if we can only go from 0 to 1 due to the sigmoid function.
