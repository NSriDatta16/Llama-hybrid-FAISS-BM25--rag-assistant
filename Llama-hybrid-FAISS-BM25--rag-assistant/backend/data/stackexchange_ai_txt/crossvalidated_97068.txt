Assume you have much more variables than samples and you want to reduce the number of variables This is a typical scenario in many text mining and bioinformatics problems. The no. of features ($d$) will be very large compared to the samples ($n$) i.e. $d \gg n$. Typically, in text mining, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is more popular way of reducing dimensionality than PCA. This is because LSA tries capture the co-occurrence of features in a set of samples (whereas PCA tries to capture the correlation of features) which helps capturing latent semantics (context based meaning) better. Hence, my first suggestion: Try LSA rather than PCA. is it possible to apply clustering algorithms where you consider the features as samples and try to regroup them This is exactly what is done in co-clustering . Both features and samples will be clustered simultaneously. Second suggestion: Try co-clustering. Third suggestion: You may try feature selection , which works well in similar situations. PCA works well in reducing dimensionality when you have many redundant features or features which are highly correlated. Since you have not mentioned regarding the correlation among your features, I could not comment on ruling out PCA altogether. Fourth suggestion: You may still give PCA a try, if the aforementioned stuff didn't solve your problem!
