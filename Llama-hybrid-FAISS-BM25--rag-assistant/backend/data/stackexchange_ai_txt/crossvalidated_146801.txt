Predicted R squared would be no different than many other forms of cross-validation estimates of error (e.g., CV-MSE). That said, R^2 isn't a great measure since R^2 will always increase with additional variables, regardless of whether that variable is meaningful. For example: > x y z summary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared [1] 0.9224326 > summary(lm(y ~ x + z))$r.squared [1] 0.9273826 R^2 doesn't make a good measure of model quality because of that. Information based measures, like AIC and BIC, are better. This is especially true in a time series application where you expect your error terms to be auto-correlated. You should probably be looking at a time series model (ARIMA would be a good place to start) with exogenous regressors to account for the auto-correlation. As is, your model is likely massively overstating the explained error and inflating your R^2. I'd strongly encourage you to look at time series modeling and AIC based measures of model fit. EDIT: I wrote a little simulation to compute PRESS and the predicted R^2 for some simulated data and compared it against AIC. sim = p2, a1 Both methods preferred the better model about 85% of the time. AIC has the benefits on a stronger theoretical basis and generalizes better to other methods (e.g., GLM where R^2 is not defined). The bigger issue here is using a linear model on something with likely autocorrelated errors (a time series). Using a dataset ( Seatbelts in R) to estimate the effect of a seatbelt law, when I use just a linear model and adjust for gas price and distance driven the law's effect is estimated as -11.89 with a standard error of 6.026. If I account for the fact that the data is correlated with itself and estimate the law effect in the context of an ARIMA model, I estimate the law's effect as -20 and with a standard error of 7.9. Because the linear model ignored the time series properties, the estimate was off by 2 fold and the standard error of the major variable of interest was underestimated. The same thing (but worse) happens with the gas price and distance variables.
