There is also the bootstrap method by Fisher et al , designed for several hundred samples of high dimension. The main idea of the method is formulated as "resampling is a low-dimension transformation". So, if you have a small (several hundred) number of high-dimensional samples, then you can't get more principal components than the number of your samples. It thus makes sense to consider the samples as a parsimonious basis, project the data on the linear subspace spanned by these vectors, and calculate PCA within this smaller subspace. They also provide more details how to deal with the case when not all samples may be stored in the memory.
