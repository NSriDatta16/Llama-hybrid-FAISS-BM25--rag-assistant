A couple resources you can have a look at are : Flex Bug Tracking which you could peruse for memory leak bugs that have been fixed/logged. Also in the Flex Builder IDE you can use the Profiler to monitor memory/CPU usage etc. I cant specifically answer your question. I think that part of the responsibility here is on you, the developer, and how you have designed and managed your code. Apart from that, I have noticed using the Flex 3 framework (or ASVM2 in general) that it has done a good job of managing the GC for me. Keep in mind as well that Flex 4 is around the corner.
