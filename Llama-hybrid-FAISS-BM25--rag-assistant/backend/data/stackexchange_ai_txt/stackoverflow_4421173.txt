EDIT : Well, i think i missunderstood your question. Do you want to add a legend with a checkbox inside your legend? If so, there is no real way of doing that with code igniters built in form helpers. You could write your own, but the easiest way would be to add it manually: Your legend text Original answer: Well, the obvious way to change the folor of a legend is through CSS: fieldset legend { color: #ff00ff; } This will change only the color of the legend to magenta. To render a checkbox, use the form_checkbox. More info on the user guide .
