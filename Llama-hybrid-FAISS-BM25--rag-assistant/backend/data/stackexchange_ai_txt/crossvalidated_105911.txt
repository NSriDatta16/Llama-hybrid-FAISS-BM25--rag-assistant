Logistic regression relationship identification

Is logistic regression a correct way to identify the relationship between lead source (an independent variable), demographics (e.g., gender , income , etc., independent variables) and lead outcome (yes or no, my dependent variable)? More details: The values taken by lead source are categorical i.e. campaign , referral , cold calling , etc. and the demographic variables are gender i.e. Male or Female and income which is ordinal e.g. 2000 , 5000 , etc. The measurements are the outcomes of a lead management application which captures basic details about leads and also the status or outcome of the lead. I am planning to design a predictive logistic regression model which could tell on the basis of lead source and demographics, what the possible outcome (yes/no) of that lead could be.
