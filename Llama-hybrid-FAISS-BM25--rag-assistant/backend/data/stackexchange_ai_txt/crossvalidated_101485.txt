Examples of PCA where PCs with low variance are "useful"

Normally in principal component analysis (PCA) the first few PCs are used and the low variance PCs are dropped, as they do not explain much of the variation in the data. However, are there examples where the low variation PCs are useful (i.e. have use in the context of the data, have an intuitive explanation, etc.) and should not be thrown away?
