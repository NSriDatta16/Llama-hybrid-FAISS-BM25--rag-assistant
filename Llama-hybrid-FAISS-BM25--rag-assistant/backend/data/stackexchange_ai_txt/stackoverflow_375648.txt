ASP Web Page Logging Off Users

I was recently given an older ASP web application to maintain. I haven't touched it much, from what I understand, the actual VB6 project files are gone, so I only have the ASP files themselves to work with. Recently, users began complaining of being logged off, sometimes after a minute or less. I tried myself, and logged in once, clicked another link which checks authentication before showing page content, but had to log in again before going back to the page and having it show the content. This behavior seems to have just popped up, as no one has touched it, and it hasn't shown this type of behavior before. Any suggestions on where to begin? Thanks.
