VC dimension for Gaussian Process Regression

In neural networks, the VC dimension $d_{VC}$ equals approximately the number of parameters (weights) of the network. The rule of thump for good generalization is then $N \geq 10 d_{VC} \approx 10 * (\text{number of weigts})$ . What is the VC dimension for Gaussian Process Regression ? My domain is $X = \mathbb{R}^{25}$ , meaning I have 25 features, and I want to determine the number of samples $N$ I must have to archive good generalization.
