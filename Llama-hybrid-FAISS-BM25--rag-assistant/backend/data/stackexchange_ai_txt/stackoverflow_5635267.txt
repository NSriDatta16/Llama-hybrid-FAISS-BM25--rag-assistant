iOS: How to dynamically change DetailView in SplitView template?

I've got a SplitView template project. I want to change DetailView on user selecting item in RootViewController. In fact I can't just change what's inside that view (DetailView) like it's done in the template (when you check "use core data storage" on creating project). I want to switch between whole views. I've tried that: AppDelegate *appDelegate = [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate; [appDelegate.detailViewController setView:curretnDetailViewController.view]; appDelegate.detailViewController = currentDetailViewController; By the way I don't understand why do I need line#2 (..setView:..)? Why assigning detailViewController (line#3) is not enough? - Code looks awful=( But anyway that doesn't work exactly as I want. Everything except detailView disappears. Like I've changed the main view, not just DetailViewController's I guess I should change something in splitViewController but didn't find out what=( Thanks for your attention.
