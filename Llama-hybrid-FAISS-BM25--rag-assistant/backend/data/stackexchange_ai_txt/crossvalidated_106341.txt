representative baseline for time series-like data

I have data for several individuals that takes the following form over time. Many individuals are flat over the course of a year, meaning their measurements stay roughly the same. Others have a peak or two and are then flat. And others have many peaks. For each individual I must find an average (representative) value that is not influenced by the peaks. For example, the overall average will not be a good measure because if an individual has several peaks, this will increase the average. Overall, I need an estimate of the baseline for each individual that is not influenced by the number of peaks an individual has.
