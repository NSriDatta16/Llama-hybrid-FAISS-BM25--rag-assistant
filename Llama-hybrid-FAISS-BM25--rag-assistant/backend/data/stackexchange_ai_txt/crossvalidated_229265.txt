Work flow for multinomial text extraction of OCR data

I am interested in recreating (for cost and data sharing discrepancies) a solution that machine learning solution companies like ABBYY have done. I would like to be able to take purchase order PDFs and convert the OCR text extraction to line item data. Several features would need to be extracted and a .csv should look something like: (PO ID Number,Product/service ID: UPC/SKU, Product/ service description,Manufacturer/vendor, Etc.) To clarify my question: Do I need to train a model for each feature I want to extract or are multivariate ML models for this? Is there a documented workflow for such a task? There are thousands of PO PDF's that could have many different vendors thus the format may not be the same. I plan to use R to for this, but would eventually like to move into Microsoft Azure ML where I just use R in the pre-processing stack and run the algorithm/ deployed model with Azure so that either the client's or our dev team may find use in an application.
