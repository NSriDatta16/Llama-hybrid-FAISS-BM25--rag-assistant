In the company I had my internship in we used these standard comment headers in all source files - boy they annoyed me. Everytime I had to read a new source-code file I had to scroll 1 or 2 screenlengths down because of all change-history each file had. In the 6 months I were there I never used the change-history at all, and never saw anyone who did. My personal oppinion is that you shouldn't place stuff that you'll rarely need such a place. You need to have the change-history and stuff like that somewhere ofcourse, but it should be somewhere that you could look up in case you actually needed it. Maybe in the footer if you insist on embedding it into the source files? Standard header comments are a pain, and should be VERY minimalistic or even better non-existing. Throw that huge ASCII-art down to the footer or into the readme, I don't care, but please, leave my header alone :) You think google wouldv'e been a success if the first 800 pixels of your search result was populated with some huge google logo and copyright statements? :P
