What is the correct architecture for convolutional neural network?

I have seen several different architectures for convolutional neural network (CNN). I am confused which one is the standard and how do I decide what to use. I am not confused by the number of layers being used or the number of parameters involved; I am confused by the COMPONENTS of the network. Let assume: CL = convolution layer SL = subsampling layer(pooling) CM = convolution map NN = neural network Softmax = softmax classifier (similar to linear classifier) Architecture 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6hpQwq7Inw CL --> SL --> CL --> SL --> CM --> Softmax Architecture 2 (Do we really need NN at the end again?) http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5605630&tag=1 CL --> SL --> CL --> SL --> NN --> Softmax Architecture 3 My idea CL--> SL --> CL --> SL --> Softmax
