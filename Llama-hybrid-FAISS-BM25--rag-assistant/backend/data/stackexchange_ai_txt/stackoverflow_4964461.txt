How to indicate there is more text in a single-line C# winforms textbox?

Sometimes, a fixed-width, single-line textbox in winforms with C# Visual Studio 2010 contains just the right width of characters that the boundary between two characters (or words) lines up with the edge of the textbox making it impossible to tell there is more text without clicking and dragging with the mouse. What are the best practices for indicating there is more text?
