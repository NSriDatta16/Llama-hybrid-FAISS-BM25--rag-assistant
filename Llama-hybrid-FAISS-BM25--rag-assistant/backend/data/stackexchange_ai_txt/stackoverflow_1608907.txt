This paragraph from http://docs.python.org/3.1/reference/datamodel.html#object. hash If a class that overrides __eq__() needs to retain the implementation of __hash__() from a parent class, the interpreter must be told this explicitly by setting __hash__ = .__hash__ . Otherwise the inheritance of __hash__() will be blocked, just as if __hash__ had been explicitly set to None.
