Prevent mail sent from a server to itself from being internally handled

I have a Google apps account attached to my web server's domain. I work like to be able to test my email application using my personal email address. Web server is at thinktankdesign.ca email is going to robert@thinktankdesign.ca mail.thinktankdesign.ca is pointing to google. How can I stop the server from handling the message internally. I don't want the message send to /var/mail/*my_username* I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 Cheers!
