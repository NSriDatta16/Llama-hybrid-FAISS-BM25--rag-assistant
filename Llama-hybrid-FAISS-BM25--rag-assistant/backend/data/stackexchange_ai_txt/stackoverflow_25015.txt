In my opinion (your mileage may vary): 1- If you didn't write it don't test it. If you wrote it and you don't have a test for it it doesn't exist. 3- As everyone's said, xUnit's free and great. 2 & 4- Deciding exactly what to test is one of those things you can debate about with yourself forever. I try to draw this line using the principles of design by contract. Check out 'Object Oriented Software Construction" or "The Pragmatic Programmer" for details on it.
