Q1. The equation is still valid if $\|w\|\neq1$ , but the interpretation of $w_1$ as the (signed) distance from the origin is not. Q2. You haven't specified a learning algorithm, but for example with SVM, the popular libsvm formulates the problem(s) with $w$ not a unit vector, instead scaling so that $\|w\|$ gives the margin width. But also, quite often under the hood it solves the dual problem instead.
