As Otavio said, primary keys should not be updated. Create a column of type Int (or BigInt) and make it an auto numbering primary key. Your NVARCHAR field can simply have a unique constraint on it, because that is what you actually want, because the column is not used in relations with other tables. Update: Also note that when you use that column as a primary key and associate it with other tables, you cannot change it any more. SQL Server will throw an UPDATE statement conflicted with COLUMN REFERENCE constraint error in your face. Next there are other issues with changing primary key, for instance: performance. Changing the primary key will lead to clustered index fragmentation.
