HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the markup we use to describe the structure of our page. It defines the different constructs like Ordered List or Tables etc... HTML is the code we start with, it's human readable (well it's supposed to be anyway :p) and easily compressable & transferable. DOM (Document Object Model) is the framework your computer uses to organize the page it renders from HTML. When your computer breaks down your HTML Document it organizes it into an Object Model which it can more easily work with (and so can you, in javascript/css/etc...). CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describe how you want items in your documents to look. They're named cascading style sheets because they "cascade" down to the next one to fill in the holes or override styling. CSS describes the visual qualities of the objects in the DOM.
