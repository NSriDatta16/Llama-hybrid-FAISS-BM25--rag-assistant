Magento Performance Tuning

I have a server which is running more than 15 Magento stores, but they are not performing well, though I have a giant server for hosting them. My server configuration is - 8 CPU's Quad Core 24GB RAM and 2 TB HDD. My current page load is 1.6sec. I want it under 600ms. I have already installed APC, & eAccelerator and tuned Apache's parameters. I am using the latest Magento version. Please suggest. -Ramesh
