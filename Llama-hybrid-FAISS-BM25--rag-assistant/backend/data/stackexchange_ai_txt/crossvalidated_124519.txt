To build on the suggestion by Alexey Grigorev: You could build some multilevel model, on level one, for each individual situation ("data set") a linear regression model, such as $$ y_{ij}= \alpha_j + \beta_j x_{ij} + \sigma_j \epsilon_{ij} $$ where data sets are indexed with $j$ and observationhs within each data set is indexed by $i$. Then on the second level, that is for the coefficients $\alpha_j, \beta_j, \sigma_j$ you can have some mixture prior. That will probably need MCMC for estimation. One paper which seems to do something like this is here: http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sks/research/papers/sahudeybranco.pdf
