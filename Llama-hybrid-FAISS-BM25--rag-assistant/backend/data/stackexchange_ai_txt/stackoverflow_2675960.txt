Large Product catalog with statistics - alternatives to Sql Server?

I am building UI for a large product catalog (millions of products). I am using Sql Server, FreeText search and ASP.NET MVC. Tables are normalized and indexed. Most queries take less then a second to return. The issue is this. Let's say user does the search by keyword. On search results page I need to display/query for: Display 20 matching products on first page(paged, sorted) Total count of matching products for paging List of stores only of all matching products List of brands only of all matching products List of colors only of all matching products Each query takes about .5 to 1 seconds. Altogether it is like 5 seconds. I would like to get the whole page to load under 1 second. There are several approaches: Optimize queries even more. I already spent a lot of time on this one, so not sure it can be pushed further. Load products first, then load the rest of the information using AJAX. More like a workaround. Will need to revise UI. Re-organize data to be more Report friendly. Already aggregated a lot of fields. I checked out several similar sites. For ex. zappos.com. Not only they display the same information as I would like in under 1 second, but they also include statistics (number of results in each category). The following is the search for keyword "white" http://www.zappos.com/white How do sites like zappos, amazon make their results, filters and stats appear almost instantly?
