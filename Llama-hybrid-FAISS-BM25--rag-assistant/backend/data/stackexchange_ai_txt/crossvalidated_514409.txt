Quasi-Poisson Regression with non-integer count data

I am trying to run a fixed-effects Poisson Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator on 3-dimensional(year, country, industry) unbalanced Panel data. The dependent variable is the number of patents(non-negative and non-integer). The patent data is non-integer because some patents were registered in more than one country and were 'shared' between them. The main independent variable is deregulation(a dummy variable which equals 0 before the year deregulation was implemented in a country and 1 starting from the implementation year). I am trying to catch the effect of deregulation on patent activity. I also have some independent variables as controls(size and share). The data looks like this country industry year pt size_emp size_val dereg share id Austria Food and beverages 1990 NA 59.76742 2844243.5 0 0.10035470 1 Austria Food and beverages 1991 2.023 61.84432 3121737.4 0 0.10254747 1 Austria Food and beverages 1992 NA 61.50290 3724826.9 0 0.11448406 1 Austria Food and beverages 1993 3.344 61.19843 3699648.1 0 0.12175012 1 Austria Food and beverages 1994 6.000 61.83063 3808057.0 0 0.11251291 1 Austria Food and beverages 1995 6.665 17.42631 1073797.4 0 0.11605032 1 Austria Food and beverages 1996 5.020 16.52287 1020846.7 1 0.11730912 1 Austria Food and beverages 1997 7.467 16.84073 811186.0 1 0.10929066 1 Austria Food and beverages 1998 5.433 17.16993 837194.7 1 0.10477675 1 Austria Food and beverages 1999 4.556 17.23248 795350.9 1 0.09516772 1 I want to run quasi-Poisson regression and include year, country, and industry fixed effects. I ran this model model The results are as follows GLM estimation, family = quasipoisson, Dep.

Are the results valid with non-integer data? Is there any other critical issue in the model that I need to pay attention to? Any help would be much appreciated.
