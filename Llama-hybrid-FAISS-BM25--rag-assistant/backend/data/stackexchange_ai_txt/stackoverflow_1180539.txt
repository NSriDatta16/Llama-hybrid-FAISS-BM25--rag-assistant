In order to be able do that, you'd have to create a query that generates empty rows for all the missing Order values. Seems like a silly thing to do. I get the impression that cursors are not the right thing for whatever you're trying to achieve , maybe you could explain a little more about the intent, so people can provide viable alternatives? For example, putting your results in a table variable, and querying that table for the right Order value seems like an alternative. DECLARE @school int = 1 DECLARE @schoolData TABLE ( RID int, School int, [Order] int, Text ntext ); INSERT INTO @schoolData SELECT * FROM SCHOOL_DATA WHERE School=@school ORDER BY [Order] SELECT * FROM @schoolData WHERE [Order]=100 However. I get the distinct impression that you should be using neither cursors, nor any temporary storage.
