How can I fix a 2104 error in a Silverlight application

I have an existing Silverlight application that's been running for a few months with lots of users. This week we had a new user try to use the application but he keeps getting this error message. User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) Timestamp: Wed, 24 Nov 2010 03:49:04 UTC Message: Unhandled Error in Silverlight Application Code: 2104 Category: InitializeError Message: 2104 An error has occurred. We're running IIS 7.5 on Windows 2008 R2, the user has Silverlight 4 (4.0.50826.0) installed. Any idea what might be wrong?
