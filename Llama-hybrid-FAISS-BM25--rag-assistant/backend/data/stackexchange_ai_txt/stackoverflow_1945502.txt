Not a ton of use in day-to-day stuff when you live in C#. It's mostly when interoperating with unmanaged code that has sub-byte granularity (struct marshaling, etc), dealing with byte-order conversion (little-endian/big-endian). Under the covers, enums with FlagsAttribute already does it. Lots of unmanaged stuff uses bitfields for very efficient storage. Bitfields can be a royal pain in C#. I've done some managed user-mode driver framework coding, and some work with the raw TIFF file format in C#, and it sucked. C/C++ have better facilities for dealing with them.
