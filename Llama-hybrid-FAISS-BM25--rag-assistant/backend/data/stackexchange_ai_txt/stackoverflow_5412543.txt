Can you post an actual code fragment? If you're deleting just the elements you're allocating, there shouldn't be a problem. I'd suggest a couple things to help narrow it down: Assign NULL to all your pointers on initialization Use shared_ptr types instead of raw float pointers - these will be automatically cleaned up when no references remain.
