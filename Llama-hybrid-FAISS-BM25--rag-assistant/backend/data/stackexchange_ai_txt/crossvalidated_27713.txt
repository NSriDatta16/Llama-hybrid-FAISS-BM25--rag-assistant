Remember all bootstrap confidence intervals are only asymptotically at the stated confidence level. There are also a slew of possible methods for selecting bootstrap confidence intervals Efron's percentile method, Hall's percentile method, double bootstrap, bootstrap t, tilted bootstrap, BC, BCa and maybe a few more. You haven't told us which method you use. Schenker's paper in JASA 1985 showed that for certain chi square distributions the BC bootstrap confidence interval undercovered the advertised percentage. In small sample size problems this problem can be severe. LaBudde and I have two papers showing how in small samples even BCa can have very poor coverage when estimating a variance from a lognormal distribution and a similar problem exists for testing equality of two variances. This is just for a simple problem. I expect the same thing can happen with residuals from mixed models. In our new book "An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R" published by Wiley in 2011 we cover this topic in Section 3.7 and provide references. The surprise is that the percentile method sometimes does better than the higher order accurate BCa method, when the sample size is small.
