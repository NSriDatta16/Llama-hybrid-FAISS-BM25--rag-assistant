All Magento models have a "getData" method available, which will return an php-array of key/value pairs. Try this at the top of your grouped.phtml file (after $_product is defined) print(' ');print_r($_product->getData());print(' '); You should see output that looks something like the following. Array ( [store_id] => 1 [entity_id] => 3437 [entity_type_id] => 4 [attribute_set_id] => 27 [type_id] => grouped [sku] => [category_ids] => [created_at] => 2009-04-16 03:37:51 ... So, you can grab an array of properties and just pull the key out. You could also use Magento's convenience/magic getX and setX methods. On all Magento models, you can access any property in the data array by calling a method based on the camel case version of the name, $created_at = $_product->getCreatedAt(); $_product->setCreatedAt($date); So, whatever your custom attribute name is, you should be able to get at it using the above, and if you're not sure just print_r or var_dump the contents of the array returned by getData(). Finally, if the custom attribute is on one of the related products simple product, you'll wants something more like $_associatedProducts[0]->getCreatedAt();
