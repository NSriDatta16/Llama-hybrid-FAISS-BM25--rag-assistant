You should keep the sites in an hash and look up like that. it is simple and elegant: $excluded['www.google.com'] = true; $excluded['www.mapquest.com'] = true; $excluded['www.yahoo.com'] = true; $url = "http://www.google.com?q=barefoot+winery"; $urlArray = parse_url($url) if (! isset($excluded[$urlArray['host']])) { scrape($url) } As pascal said after a while you will run into memory problems. But at that point maintaining the urls will be a bigger issue. Go for a database when that happens.
