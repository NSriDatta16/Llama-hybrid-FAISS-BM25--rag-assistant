There do not appear to be any formal measures, at least any widely in use. It does seem to be standard practice in the realms of Markov Chains and Finite State Automata to snip out any unreachable states though. Some desultory academic papers that mention this at least in passing include those on the list below. Developing our own DIY information criterion would be straightforward, since all we would need to do is subtract the nonspecificity of the unreachable states we’ve removed from the total nonspecificity. The tricky part is determining the unreachable states in advance, which is an advanced topic in networking theory; the last item on the list is the only example I could find that discusses such algorithms at length. • Cui, Jin, 2016, “ Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks ,” Phd. thesis defended at the Intitute National des Sciences Appliques, Lyon. • Karatkevich, A.
