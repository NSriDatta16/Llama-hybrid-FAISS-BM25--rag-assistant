Override plugin convention property with project property

I am trying to understand how to set a plugin convention property from a project property. Here is the customPluginWithConvention example from the gradle distribution (gradle-0.9.2\samples\userguide\organizeBuildLogic\customPluginWithConvention\build.gradle) apply plugin: GreetingPlugin greeting = 'Hi from Gradle' class GreetingPlugin implements Plugin { def void apply(Project project) { project.convention.plugins.greet = new GreetingPluginConvention() project.task('hello') Running this script with no project property: >gradle hello :hello Hi from Gradle BUILD SUCCESSFUL And now trying to set a custom message via setting a project property: >gradle -Pgreeting=goodbye hello :hello Hello from GreetingPlugin Instead of the expected "goodbye" the default greeting of the convention is shown. Is it possible to override the message?
