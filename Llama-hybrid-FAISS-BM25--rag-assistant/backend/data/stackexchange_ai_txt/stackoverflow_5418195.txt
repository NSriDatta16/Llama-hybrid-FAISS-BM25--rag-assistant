Within the context of a web browser, you will be limited by the possibilities of that browser. You cannot access an SQLite database in an arbitrary file from browser-based Javascript. The new HTML 5 standard does have a localStorage mechanism, which stores key-value pairs in the browser itself. Mozilla browsers also support a (proprietary) WebDatabase technology, which allows you to access an SQLite database through the browser. But even then, it’s the browser who determines where that database will be stored. For a single-page, client-only app, I suggest you read http://www.diveintohtml5.org ; it’s very informative and will bring you up to speed as to the new HTML technologies that can be used. If it’s too complex for you, then I suggest starting with a regular HTML tutorial first. If you really want to be able to access a database, then you’re going to need some kind of server-side technology. For experimentation purposes, you could try node.js (or PHP/Apache, or one of a host of ‘regular’ web application frameworks).
