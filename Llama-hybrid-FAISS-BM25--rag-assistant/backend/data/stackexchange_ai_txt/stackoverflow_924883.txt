A couple more methods: There is a workaround given in the Microsoft's KB269671 . Basically, you have to use an intermediary query with a special syntax. You can also change the query to a Make Table query and then export its data. Use and intermediary invisible datasheet form whose RecordSource is set to the query and then have it's FormLoad event export the form to text then close the form. Just opening the form would prompt the user to enter the parameters and then automatically save it. Robert's answer may still be the simplest one though.
