Categorical variable as response in poisson regression

I have data on damages on flowers from different treatments. The damage was originally count data (number of damages per flower) but the person collecting the data categorized the data in four levels - no damage (0) to a high damage level (3). I know I could use logistic regression to model the odds but I wonder if it is possible to use poisson regression instead and consider the observed level of damage as a count variable? If possible, would the intepretation of the dichotomized treatment coefficients be the difference in the logs of expected counts of damage levels for treatment compared to baseline while holding the other variables constant in the model? The weird intepretation makes me think this is not at all possible.
