Based on your comment, I would like to point out a few things. 1.) First of all Neural Nets (or Deep Learning in general) is used when we have a large amount of data . The data you have is very small and Neural Net needs more data to learn from it. You would be much better off with using traditional machine learning models instead of deep learning. 2.) Since your data is imbalanced, accuracy is the worst choice of metric that your could be using. This is the reason your are getting high accuracy. Using accuracy in imbalanced data will always result in high accuracy because the model will always predict the majority class and hence will give high accuracy. You should use other metrics like f1 score and others. A simple google search would give you the answer. 3.) The reason you are getting constant validation loss might have something to do with the way you modeled your neural net. I once had the same issue but I don't remember how I solved it. Most probably it had something to do with the activation function or the number of neurons but it could be different in your case. Try different activation functions and no of neurons to see if something works. If it works out then do let me know here what the problem was! Cheers!
