If you did want to do this (to foreshadow, you don't), it is not clear why you would want to use simple linear regressions. You would use simple logistic regressions instead. The response variable is distributed as a binomial, so linear regressions would be inappropriate (in addition to the whole procedure being inappropriate). However, looking at each individual variable to see which is significant in isolation, and then adding those to a multiple logistic regression model is logically equivalent to a forward selection algorithm. Although this approach is very intuitive, it is unfortunately invalid (to understand this further, it may help you to read my answer here ).
