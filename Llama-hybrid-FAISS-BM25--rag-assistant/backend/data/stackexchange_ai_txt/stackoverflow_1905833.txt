Reporting Services - setting a field value dynamically based on parameter

I need to build a report that shows data in four grouped levels. The tricky part is: the actual fields to be displayed on those four levels are to be passed into the report as parameters. My main issue right now is this: how can I tell a textbox on the report to not display the value of the parameter @X, but the value of the field by the name which is specified in parameter @X? So if I pass in @X = 'Agent' , I don't want to show 'Agent' on the report, but really =Fields!Agent but how can I do that? It seems to me that those value expressions are all pretty much hardcoded - is there a way to define =Fields!(@X) or something like that - show the field which corresponds to the name passed to the report in parameter @X ? This is probably absolutely silly - but I'm hitting a brickwall right now and can't seem to find a way around it....
