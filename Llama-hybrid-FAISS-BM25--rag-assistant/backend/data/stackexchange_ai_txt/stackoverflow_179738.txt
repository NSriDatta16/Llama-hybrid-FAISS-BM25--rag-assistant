As far as algorithms go, that's an easy one. Just find the max and min datetimes, take the difference, and divide by the number of datetimes you looked at. If you have an array a of datetimes, you can do: mx = max(a) mn = min(a) avg = (mx-mn)/(len(a)-1) to get back the average difference. EDIT: fixed the off-by-one error
