Problems with Perl Mechanize and Proxies

I've been frustrating myself with this for way too many hours. I think this should be simple but I obviously have something fundamental wrong. I've read: I've read the cpan docs for : WWW-Mechanize/lib/WWW/Mechanize/FAQ.pod libwww-perl-5.837/lib/LWP/UserAgent.pm And every bit of sample code or article I could find on Google. This is my first time looking for help on Stack Overflow. Thanks for your help in advance. Here is the code: #!/usr/bin/perl use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new ( agent => "Mozilla/5.0" ); my $proxy = 'http://fetch4.me'; $mech->no_proxy('localhost'); $mech->proxy(['http', 'https', 'gopher'], $proxy) or die $!; $mech->get('http://www.google.com'); print $mech->uri(),"\n"; print $mech->content(),"\n"; print $mech->text(),"\n"; print $mech->status(),"\n"; Here is the output: http://www.google.com Apache is functioning normally Apache is functioning normally 200 I'm running out of ideas here. Does this code work for you? Does it produce the same results? What's wrong with it? >. Thank you for your time.
