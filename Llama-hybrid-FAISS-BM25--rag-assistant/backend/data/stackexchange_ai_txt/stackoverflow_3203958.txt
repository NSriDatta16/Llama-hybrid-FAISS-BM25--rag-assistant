Drupal installation profiles

I'm new to drupal and I'm trying to understand installation profiles. Is an installation profile just a bunch of modules that you add to the main drupal release and glue together with some instructions for ease of future installation, or do they need to be custom tweaked before an installation profile could be made out of them? I noticed a package (containing an installation profile), but the maintainer didn't get around to updating it to the latest version of drupal. My incentive for wanting to create the installation profile myself is that I could use the latest version of drupal and the latest modules of all the other modules included. Am I correct in assuming that re-creating the installation profile is like (as an example) compiling php yourself so you could get the latest php version and latest modules, etc.? For someone with php knowledge, but NO drupal knowledge, what is the relative difficulty of this subject (easy, medium, difficult)? Something that the average developer could master in a day?
