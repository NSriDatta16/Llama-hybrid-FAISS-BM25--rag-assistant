Without the stack trace it's hard to say too much, but with the logging set to verbose it's quite likely that you're seeing some internal logging from one of the dlls you're using. For example if you run a Azure Table query that causes certain kinds of errors, the error will be logged out 3 times because the storage client library is catching the error, tracing it out and then retrying. If the error is not being caught by your try catch block, then it's likely nothing you need to worry about. If deliverability of queue messages is important to you, you should ensure that you make use of the visibility timeout overload of CloudQueue.GetMessage and only delete the message when you've finished processing it. You may end up processing some messages twice, but at least you will process all of them.
