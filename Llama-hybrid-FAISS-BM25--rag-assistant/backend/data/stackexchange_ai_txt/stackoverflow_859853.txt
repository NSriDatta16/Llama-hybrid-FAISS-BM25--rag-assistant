My guess would be that you would see the DBT_DEVTYP_DEVICEINTERFACE normally anyway. USB devices are self-describing. A USB device can have any "interfaces" where each interface is a feature of the device. My guess is that when a USB is connected you get a " DBT_DEVTYP_DEVICEINTERFAC E" per USB device interface so that a USB device driver can say that they can handle that USB interface. I would assume that the USB device driver for USB mass storage driver would would handle this messages by mounting the volume and then you would get the DBT_DEVTYP_VOLUME message. I would guess that the mass storage interface driver is not working correctly (or has crashed) and is not handling the DBT_DEVTYP_DEVICEINTERFACE . Unless you starting seeing it a lot I don't think it is a situation that you should bother to handle.
