ILMerge can do this for .NET assemblies - though it has some limitations with certain types of assemblies (such as WPF Assemblies). You can, alternatively, use the assembly as a resource and load it on demand , or use one of the many commercial obfuscators which support assembly merging. Many of the third party options support more elaborate depedency merging and/or dependency embedding. A good example of this is SmartAssembly , which supports both options.
