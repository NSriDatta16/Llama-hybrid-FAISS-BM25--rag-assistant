Creating new windows that run programs in screen

My .screenrc has some initialization code that opens some windows. It's neat. What I want to do, while running screen is simply , with one command open a new screen window that is running a program. It SHOULD be: screen -t 'CADMIN' sudo cherokee-admin -b This actually works, except that it also runs my .screenrc and opens up all of my windows in a nested screen. FAIL. I know I could use ^c ( to create a new window ) ^cA ( to title it ) sudo cherokee-admin -b and get the same effect, but I'd like to bring a little elegance to my life, which is why I use screen and not some multi terminal thing. Ideas?
