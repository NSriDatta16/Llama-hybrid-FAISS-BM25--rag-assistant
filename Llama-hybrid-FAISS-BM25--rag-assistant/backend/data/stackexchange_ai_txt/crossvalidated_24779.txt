When can I use STL decomposition?

Let us say I extract all tweets containing a certain hashtag (main subject of the tweet) and bin them by the hour i.e. count the number of tweets that occurred during a certain hour. I will then be obtaining a time series for this particular hashtag. I have recently come across the STL decomposition which decomposes a given timeline into its seasonal, trend and error components and R provides a simple function stl to achieve this. I am trying to understand if using this in my context (timeline of tweet counts) is appropriate. What I would like to examine is whether two given hashtags have a similar timeline and I was wondering what I can understand by using time series decomposition. Any suggestions?
