The HTTP headers beginning with X are officious headers. They are not specified in the HTTP specification , but just coined by some 3rd party as kind of vendor-specific or "de facto" standard and taken over by many others, like HTTP X-Forwarded-For in case of proxy servers. The particular HTTP X-User-Agent header is often inserted by some independent messenger between the actual client and the server, like a proxy, loadbalancer, transcoder, etc, but also some XMLHttpRequest based libraries. It often identifies the messenger itself. The User-Agent header should still represent the actual client. You also see this header sometimes in emails, this then represents the email program/software responsible for sending the mail. That it is called HTTP_X_USER_AGENT (uppercased, HTTP prefix, underscores instead of hyphens) is PHP specific.
