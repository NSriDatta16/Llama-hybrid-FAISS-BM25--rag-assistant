How can I plot a time series graph with Perl?

I have some data from a database (SQLite), mapping a value (an integer) to a date. A date is a string with this format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm . The dates are not uniformly distributed. I want do draw a line graph with the dates on X and the values on Y . What is the easiest way to do this with Perl? I tried DBIx::Chart but I could not make it recognize my dates. I also tried GD::Graph , but as the documentation says: GD::Graph does not support numerical x axis the way it should. Data for X axes should be equally spaced
