dependent or independent t test?

Suppose I have a dataset with 1,000 people and they rating 5 shampoos across a number of attributes (cost, smell, texture, how well it cleans). If I wanted to compare the average of an attribute across brands, would I use an independent t-test? I know that multiple comparisons invite things like a Bonferroni correction, but is it appropriate to use an independent t-test here? I know I should probably do an ANOVA, but really basic, if I wanted to see if the mean for shampoo A on clean was bigger than the mean for shampoo B, would I see an independent or dependent test? And why? You can think of the dataset as long instead of very wide, with a set of rows for each respondentXbrand combination. Then can I think of the data as multiple independent samples?
