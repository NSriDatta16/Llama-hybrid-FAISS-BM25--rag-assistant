How to use entire file as unique sample for classification in scikit-learn?

My dataset is split in different files, since i'm using EEG data collected for BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) classification. Here is what i have: Each .txt file that contains data of EEG signals of 16 electrodes for a period of 2 seconds at 256Hz. So it is a 512 x 16 (+1 column for class) matrix Each .txt file represents a single class. So each file is something like: user_1_class_1.txt , user_1_class_2 , etc. I have 36 users and 5 classes, so there is 180 files in total I am using scikit-learn MLPClassifier to classify this data but my first experiments gone totally wrong. After some research, i noticed that in BCI problems we must present the the entire file as a sample to the classifier. That sounds a little confusing to me, tough i know that data is time-dependant. I'd be glad for an explanation on how to organize data and feed the MLPClassifier .
