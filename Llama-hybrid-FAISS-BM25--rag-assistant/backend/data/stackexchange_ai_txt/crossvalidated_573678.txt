Updating prior in MCMC with new estimates for parameters

I'm new to doing Bayesian analysis and I wanted to learn by using baseball data. I took a group of players and found their hits and at bats for various years and I want to be able to get estimates for their true batting average (theta) every year up to the current year. I was able to run an MCMC model using rjags for the first year using a binomial likelihood and beta(1,1) prior for theta (batting average). I got values for alpha, beta, and thetas for each player. How do I go about incorporating that into next years analysis? When I plug in the estimates for alpha and beta as that I got from the first analysis as the new prior the trace plot becomes a flat line for alpha and beta (the thetas do change). I know I could probably incorporate all the data into a single model file, but I want to do a separate file for each year of estimates. This is my model model{ for (i in 1:P){ #likelihood hits[i] ~ dbin(theta[i], atbats[i]) #prior theta[i] ~ dbeta(alpha1, beta1)} alpha1 ~ dbeta(1,1) beta1 ~ dbeta(1,1)} The estimates after running are a = 0.7, b = 0.9 On the next years set of data, what do I do with the information obtained for these estimates? and why?
