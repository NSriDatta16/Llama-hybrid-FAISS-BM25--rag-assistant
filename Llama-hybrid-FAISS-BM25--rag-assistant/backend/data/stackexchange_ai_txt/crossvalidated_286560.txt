It is not quite clear, what exactly your goal is, but I will give it a shot anyway. The estimation of probabilities is not possible without further assumptions. In general, these can be tested, but that would require a different structure of the data. First, is the creation of files independent? I.e. if N files have been created within a given time interval, is the probability for the next interval (of the same length) the same or different? I.e. can you tell anything about the probability by looking at some kind of history or not. If you cannot assume independence, we really cannot do much here, as we do not know the history and cannot derive it from this dataset. In that case you would have to get a dataset that describes the events for each day and each hour. Then you could derive some kind of autoregressive model or Fourier regression (out of scope for this question). If you can assume independence, then you have a Poisson process , for which the probabilities can easily be estimated (except for the hours with 0 events, which have insufficient data for estimating a Poisson distribution). The Poisson distribution has a single parameter $\lambda$, which is best estimated by the mean. Since you did not give any indication, how many days you averaged, it is however not possible to calculate this. For sake of example, I will just assume your data comes from 10 days of data collection. In that case, your probability for files being created between 8:00 and 9:00 is $P(k) = e^{-261/10}\frac{(261/10)^k}{k!}$, e.g. the probability of 26 files being created in this interval would be $e^{-26.1}\frac{26.1^{26}}{26!}=0.0779737$. If you want to have the probability of at least one file being created you can do this by using the usual equalities for probabilies.
