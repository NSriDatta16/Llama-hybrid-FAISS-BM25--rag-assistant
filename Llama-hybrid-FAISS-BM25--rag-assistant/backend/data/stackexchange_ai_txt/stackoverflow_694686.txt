In order to achieve what you want, and to communicate it to others in your organisation you need to demonstrate your company's business being built in a better way. Its no use using a couple of algorithms to demonstrate the power of functional programming if its totally useless for your business domain. So, take some existing code and rewrite it functionally. If you can prove through that, that it is better, people will listen to you - you've shown them a concrete, relevant example. IF you cannot, then perhaps functional programming is not the solution you've been looking for.
