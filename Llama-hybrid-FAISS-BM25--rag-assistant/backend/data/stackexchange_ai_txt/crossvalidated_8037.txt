Based upon the comments that you've offered to the responses, you need to be aware of spurious causation . Any variable with a time trend is going to be correlated with another variable that also has a time trend. For example, my weight from birth to age 27 is going to be highly correlated with your weight from birth to age 27. Obviously, my weight isn't caused by your weight. If it was, I'd ask that you go to the gym more frequently, please. As you are familiar with cross-section data, I'll give you an omitted variables explanation. Let my weight be $x_t$ and your weight be $y_t$, where $$\begin{align*}x_t &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 t + \epsilon_t \text{ and} \\ y_t &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \eta_t.\end{align*}$$ Then the regression $$\begin{equation*}y_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 x_t + \nu_t\end{equation*}$$ has an omitted variable---the time trend---that is correlated with the included variable, $x_t$. Hence, the coefficient $\gamma_1$ will be biased (in this case, it will be positive, as our weights grow over time). When you are performing time series analysis, you need to be sure that your variables are stationary or you'll get these spurious causation results. An exception would be integrated series, but I'd refer you to time series texts to hear more about that.
