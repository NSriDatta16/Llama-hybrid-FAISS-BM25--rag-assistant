The Cookie header is one of several which cannot be modified in an XMLHttpRequest . From the specification : Terminate [execution of the setRequestHeader method] if header is a case-insensitive match for one of the following headers: Accept-Charset Accept-Encoding Connection Content-Length Cookie Cookie2 Content-Transfer-Encoding Date Expect Host Keep-Alive Referer TE Trailer Transfer-Encoding Upgrade User-Agent Via â€¦ or if the start of header is a case-insensitive match for Proxy- or Sec- (including when header is just Proxy- or Sec-). The above headers are controlled by the user agent to let it control those aspects of transport. This guarantees data integrity to some extent. Header names starting with Sec- are not allowed to be set to allow new headers to be minted that are guaranteed not to come from XMLHttpRequest.
