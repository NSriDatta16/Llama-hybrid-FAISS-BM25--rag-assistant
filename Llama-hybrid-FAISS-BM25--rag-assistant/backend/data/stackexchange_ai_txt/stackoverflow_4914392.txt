Does "drag and drop" become faster under OpenGL ES vs. Canvas for Android?

I am using Canvas for basic 2D graphics in an Android app. I am implementing a drag and drop feature (just setting x/y coordinates of the sprite based on x/y coordinates of the touch event). It works fine, but when testing on my Android device, there can be a slight lag if I move my finger very fast on the screen. The bitmap just isn't keeping up with the touch/drag motion if done quickly. Would this be improved if I were to move to OpenGL ES? Not wanting to rip out my code if it doesn't.
