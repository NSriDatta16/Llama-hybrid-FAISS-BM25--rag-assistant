Since encapsulation simply refers to "information hiding" then I would imagine that a lot of things can be categorized as encapsulation. However I tend to think of encapsulation as "implementation hiding", in other words it is a tool that I use to create loose coupling between anything I write and anything client of what I have written. So I tend to believe, pragmatically, that encapsulation is any paradigm or best-practice that allows me to present a clean, solid interface to any client.
