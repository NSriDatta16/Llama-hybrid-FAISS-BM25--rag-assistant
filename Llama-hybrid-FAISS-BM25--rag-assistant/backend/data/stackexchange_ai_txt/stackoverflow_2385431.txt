From observing the Gmail's behavior in this regard I have observed their strategy: write the complete 2nd mail. Append text like: On [timestamp], [first email sender name] wrote: Append the complete first email. a. If your email is in plain text then prepend '>' before every line of the first email. b. If it's in HTML then Gmail gives a left side margin like: border-left: 1px solid #CCC; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex; user agent stylesheet blockquote and then appends the first email's text. You can reverse engineer this when parsing emails from Gmail address. I haven't looked into other clients but they should have the same behavior.
