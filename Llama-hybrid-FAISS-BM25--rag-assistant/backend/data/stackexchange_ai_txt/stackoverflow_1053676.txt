Opera: .js file won't load

I have a page that calls a script in the header, like so: (Note you will NOT be able to load this script as it is DNSd locally as a staging domain) Very Simple. Firefox, IE, Chrome all have no problem with this basic, square-one feature. Opera, however, refuses to load the script. Any variables or functions in it are "undefined" and in dragonfly, the script tag is shown in the DOM, but the "Script" tab says "No script files found." I go to google and find random pages, their external .js files seem to work just fine. Any idea why Opera hates me? Is there a security/javascript thing I am missing? A few things that may be relevant, but really should make no difference: The script is on a different domain than the page. The script is only available on my local network. The domain is DNS'd locally for staging, from outside the network it points somewhere else. Does Opera have a setting to secretly use an external DNS server? The script works on every other browser I have. The problem isn't in the script content. I've reduced it to a single line with an alert and it simply won't work in Opera. Update: OK, the problem seems to be how Opera treats the domain. I have moved the script to several other domains, and it DOES work just fine. I've moved it to several paths on the locally DNS'd domain, and it won't work from anywhere on that domain. This leads me to believe that the problem is that Opera can't, or won't, load the script from this domain for some reason. Strangely, there seems to be no problem loading pages and other resources from the domain, the problem lies in .js files only. The domain is registered, but parked. We DNS'd it locally so we can use it for staging/testing, and that may be messing with Opera somehow with JS security. I could be wrong though - I really have no idea. If anyone else has one, I'd love to hear it. Update 2: Regarding Dragonfly and the error console/developer tools, they don't say anything about the script at all. There are plenty of Undefined Variable errors for variables and functions that should be present from the script, but other than that, no errors. Oddly, the script tag does show up in the DOMM, but if I click on the Scripts tab, it says "No Scripts Found". Update 3: There is no blocked content, so we can at least rule out that setting.
