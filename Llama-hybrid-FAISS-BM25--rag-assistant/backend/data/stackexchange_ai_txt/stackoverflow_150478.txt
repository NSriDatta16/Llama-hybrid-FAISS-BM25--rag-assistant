Have you heard of kohonen networks ? Its a self organing learning algorithm that clusters similar variables into similar slots. Although most sites like the one I link you to displays the net as bidimensional there is little involved in extending the algorithm into a multiple dimension hypercube. With such a data structure finding and storing neighbours with similar tastes is trivial as similar users should be stores into similar locations (almost like a reverse hash code). This reduces your problem into one of finding the variables that will define similarity and establishing distances between possible enumerate values ,like for example classical and acoustic are close toghether while death metal and reggae are quite distant (at least in my oppinion) By the way in order to find good dividing variables the best algorithm is a decision tree . The nodes closer to the root will be the most important variables to establish 'closeness'.
