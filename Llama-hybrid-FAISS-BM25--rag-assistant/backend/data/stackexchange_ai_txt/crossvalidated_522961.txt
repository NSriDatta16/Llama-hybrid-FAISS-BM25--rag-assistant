Suppose that have a machine which cuts wooden planks. The goal is to have each plank be 4 meters long. Suppose that a machine cuts at least a dozen such wooden planks. You now measure the lengths of the wooden boards. BIAS "The machine has a " high degree of bias " means that the boards are always too long or always too short. If the wood cutting machine has " low degree of bias " means that boards are cut too long half of the time and cut too long half of the time. VARIANCE A wood cutting machine has " high variance " if the wooden planks are almost never the same length. One of the boards was 3.2 meters long, and another board is 5.14 meters long. A wood cutting machine has a " low degree of variance " if the the wooden planks are usually the same length as the other boards. COMBINATIONS OF VARIANCE AND BIAS LOW VARIANCE HIGH VARIANCE LOW BIAS the boards are almost perfect the boards are all different sizes, but the average board length is correct HIGH BIAS all of the boards are exactly 6 meters long instead of the desired 4 meters the boards are all difference sizes and the average length is nowhere near 4 meters either
