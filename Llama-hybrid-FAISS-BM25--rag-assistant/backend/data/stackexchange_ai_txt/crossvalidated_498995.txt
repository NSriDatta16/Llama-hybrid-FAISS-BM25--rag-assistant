Attention is all you need: During run/test time, when output is not available, how is the decoder used?

In the famous paper "Attention is all you need" we see that in the Decoder we input the supposedly 'Output' sentence embeddings. During inference/test time, this output would not be available. E.g. in English to German training, Encoder will be input with English and Decoder will be input with German embeddings. However, we would not have the German translation during run/test time. Hence, how the decoder shall work since it requires the output (German) embeddings ?
