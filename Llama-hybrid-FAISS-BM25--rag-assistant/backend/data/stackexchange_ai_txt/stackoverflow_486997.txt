One way to reduce the preasure on the server on repeated requests is to use the page cacheability. Add this before Response.Write in the HttpHandler: // Set for how long you want the image to be cached. context.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddDays(1)); context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); context.Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(true); context.Response.Cache.VaryByParams["ImageId"] = true; This will make the server to cache the result (depending on the ImageId param) but this will of course only help on repeated requests for the same image, not the first one, so it depends on where the actually problem is. Without knowing very much about your application it sounds like you have to change several things to find a better solution...
