What to make parallel? What will make me better? (.net Web Business Application, MVC+SL)

I'm working on a web application framework, which uses MSSQL for data storage, mostly just does CRUD operations (but on arbitrarly complex structures), provides a WCF interface for rich Silverlight admin and has an MVC3 display (and some basic forms like user settings, etc). It's getting quite good at being able to load, display, edit and save any (reasonably) complex data structure, in a user-friendly way. But, I'm looking towards the future, and want to expand my capabilities (and it would be fun to learn new things along the way as well...) - so I've decided (in the light of what's coming for C#5...) to try to get some parallel/async optimalization... Now, I haven't even learned TPL and PLinq yet, so I'm happy for any advice there as well. So my question is , what are possible areas where parallel processing maybe of help, and where does TPL and PLinq help me on that? My guts tell me, I could try saving branches of a data structure in a parallel way to the database (this is where I'd expect the biggest peformance optimalization), I could perform some complex operations (file upload, mail sending maybe?) in a multithreaded enviroment, etc. Can I build complex SL UI views in parallel on the client? (Creating 60 data-bound fields on a view can cause "blinking"...) Can I create partial views (menus, category trees, search forms, etc) in MVC at once? ps: If this turns into "Tell me everything about parallel stuffs" thread, I'm happy to make it community-wiki...
