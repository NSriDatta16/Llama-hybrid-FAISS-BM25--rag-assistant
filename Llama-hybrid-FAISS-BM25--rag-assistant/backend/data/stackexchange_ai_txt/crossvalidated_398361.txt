How to test whether changes in x track changes in y over multiple time points for multiple individuals

So I'm wondering how to analyse this data: I have 30 people. for each person I have 2 normally distributed variables, x and y. I want to see whether x and y are linearly related, but 30 data points isn't that powerful. What might help is that I have x and y for each person over 5 consecutive weeks. So all in all 150 data points. I want to investigate whether changes in x track changes in y over the 5 weeks. I feel like some sort of multilevel analysis/time series type model would work best, but searching for examples has not been fruitful. Any advice on how to do this would be greatly appreciated.
