Okay, so first off let me start by saying that omnifarious appears to be correct. What can we do with math. I would agree with him when he says that there are indeed only 3 cases to be concerned with. 1,2 and 5. The OP wants some sort of elegant counting formula, which I'm doubtful exists for a problem like this. When you use all 9 dots you're finding Hamiltonian paths, which if this was a complete graph would be very easy to count (it's not). Because each of the three cases is unique, you're going to enumerate through all of them in order to find the total number of paths. Let's take a look at the first case, beginning in a corner. You have four choices for a corner, then you have 5 choices for your next square. Now you'll quickly see that our formula expands rather quickly, because we have 5 choices and we have to split those 5 choices into 2 sets. Moving to an middle side square, will have the same choices regardless of which one you move to. As opposed to moving to 5 which will give us many more options, already our formula is: 4*(4*(6)+1*(7)) Then we have to break the 6 and 7 options into further groups. If we move to a side square, then we can now move to two side squares, three corners and one middle square. Our formula then becomes: 4*(4*(2*(5)+3*(3)+1*(7))+1*(7)) Then we have to start solving for if we had moved to the middle square and I'm going to stop here. Finding Hamiltonian paths is NP-complete, albeit we're just counting them. But there aren't any properties here that we can take advantage of for an elegant solution. It's a graph theory problem and it's one that involves brute forcing the solution, as has been previously done by Omnifarious. I'll try to explain why you're intuition is wrong, you say that: "I know for a fact the solution to this lies in Discrete Math, specifically Permutations Without Repetition, If your answer doesn't use permutations or combinations you are incorrect." Unfortunately you don't know this for a fact, because you don't know of a formula (unless you can show me a rigorous non-constructive proof). The fact is that a permutation or a combination means that when you have n items, you can pick any item at any iteration. Now you can put restrictions on the number of items you can pick and at what items you can pick at certain iterations. But what you can't do and expect an elegant solution is make picking certain items affect which items you can pick next. Which is exactly what this question is doing and why there isn't some nice formula using combinations and permutations. In short the formula you're looking for doesn't exist, but Omnifarious did find the correct answer.
