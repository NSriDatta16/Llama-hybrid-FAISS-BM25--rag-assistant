You can also do a running average using convolution . Thus, you don't need to worry about filtfilt. For example, you could use D = [1:0.2:4]; windowSize = 3; F = ones(1,windowSize)/windowSize; Df = conv(D,F); %# if you didn't use 'valid', Df is larger than D. To correct: halfSize = floor(windowSize/2); Df = Df(halfSize+1:end-halfSize); Of course, you'd still have to deal with the edge, so you should pad D first, or run conv with the 'valid' argument. For example, you could use PADARRAY if you have the image processing toolbox. The simplest way to pad would be to replicate the first and last values. If you know more about your data, other approaches can turn out to be more suited.
