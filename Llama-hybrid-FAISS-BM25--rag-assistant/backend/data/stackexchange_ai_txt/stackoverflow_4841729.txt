This question borders on the edge of belonging on Code Review instead of Stack Overflow, but I'll help you with your templating issue. Are you running PHP 5 on your server? It looks like Ocular is using "public" and "private" words for functions and variables. You are running an older version of Codeigniter by the looks of it because I don't see a folder called "core" in your application folder. There's a community version of CI called Reactor here or you can get the standard CI 2.0 from EllisLab here . I would upgrade to one of those, personally I would use Reactor. Ocular is great but Phil Sturgeon has a lighter template library simply called template you might be interested in looking at as well, here . Like I said in the first paragraph of this answer, go to Code Review if you would like to have your code critiqued and reviewed. PS. Welcome to Codeigniter, it's an awesome PHP framework.
