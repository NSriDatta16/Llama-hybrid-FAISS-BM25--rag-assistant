An UPDATE operation does not return a resultset. Therefore, if executed with a Recordset object, it results in an empty and closed recordset. It cannot be closed anyway because it has never been opened. A rule of thumb is: if rst.State <> adStateClosed then rst.Close But, because you are executing a command that's not going to return data anyway, the preferred way is: dim cm as ADODB.Command set cm = new adodb.command set cm.activeconnection = cnn cm.commandtype = adCmdText cm.commandtext = "UPDATE ..." cm.execute ,, adExecuteNoRecords Or, if your SQL is a fixed string that doesn't have parameters, cnn.execute "UPDATE ...",, adExecuteNoRecords Also, please change rst.ActiveConnection = cnn to Set rst.ActiveConnection = cnn .
