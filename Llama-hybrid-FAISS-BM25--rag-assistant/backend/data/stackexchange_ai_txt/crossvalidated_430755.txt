First, Cramér's V is itself based on the $\chi^2$ test for the corresponding contingency table and its p -value calculation is the same. (Note that such p values will always depend on sample size.) Its advantage is that it gives a value limited to [0,1] regardless of number of rows, columns, or observations. Second, in a 2 x 2 table there is no difference between Cramér's V and the Phi coefficient , $\frac{\chi^2}{n}$ . This page shows two ways to proceed. One is to examine 2 x 2 tables encompassing each pair of categories of interest. A quick calculation suggests that would require 588 tests to cover your entire 8 x 7 array. The other way is similar to what you are proposing, to construct contingency tables for a chosen category against the corresponding sums of members of all other categories. The underlying tests are then $\chi^2$ tests, but as you are doing multiple tests you need to control for the multiple comparisons problem . This control for multiple comparisons could be quite major if you are contemplating all 56 2 x 2 tables outlined in your diagram; the Bonferroni correction for example would mean that you would need a p value of less than (0.05/56) or about 0.0009 for standard "statistical significance." So except for the representation of the association as a value in [0,1], all that you wish to do can be done with $\chi^2$ tests provided that your data meet the requirements for that test . If your data are shown in your table, however, you have many cells with 0 entries. In particular categories #5 and #6 of Var_1 seem to have average cell values of 0.5 or less. At the least that will require some form of correction to the tests; you might consider merging some categories to reduce this problem. See this page for further discussion.
