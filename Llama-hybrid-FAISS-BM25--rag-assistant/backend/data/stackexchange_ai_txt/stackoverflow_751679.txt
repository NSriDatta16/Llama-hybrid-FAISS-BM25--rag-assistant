I was able to get it to work by using a proxy, via the instructions on this article: http://raghuonflex.wordpress.com/2007/10/11/jsp-proxy-code-for-sourcing-cross-domain-images/?referer=sphere_related_content/ I think the images load slower and its probably not the ideal solution but at least it works now and thats better than nothing.
