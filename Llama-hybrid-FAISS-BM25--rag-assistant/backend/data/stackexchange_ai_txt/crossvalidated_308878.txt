How often to subsample for classification?

It is often recommended to subsample randomly if class sizes are unbalanced in classification - especially when classification accuracy is used. My question however: How often should the subsampling be done? For instance, if I subsample 10 times and then average classification accuracy over these 10 repeated classifications, the accuracy is quite variable comparing results from different instances of this 10-times repeated classification, whereas when subsampling is done say 1000 times, it seems to stabilize. Hence the reduced variability seems to be a useful criteria - is there any more precise benchmark?
