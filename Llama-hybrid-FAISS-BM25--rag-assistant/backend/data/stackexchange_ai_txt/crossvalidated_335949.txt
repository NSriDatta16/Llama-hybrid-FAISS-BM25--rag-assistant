Hidden Markov model MS GARCH

I am currently working on the MS GARCH model proposed by Haas paper given below $\epsilon_n=Z_n \sigma_{\Delta_n,n}$ where $\epsilon_n$ is a time-series of residuals, $\left\{Z_n ,n\in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$ is a sequence of normal independent and identically distributed random variables with mean zero and unit variance, and $\left\{ \Delta_n,n\in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$ is a Markov chain. The $k \times 1$ vector $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_n^2=[\sigma_{1n}^2,\sigma_{2n}^2,\ldots,\sigma_{kn}^2]'$ of regime variances follows the multivariate GARCH(1,1) equation \begin{equation} \label{2.2} \boldsymbol{\sigma}_n^2=\boldsymbol{\alpha_0}+\boldsymbol{\alpha_1}\epsilon_{n-1}^2+\boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{n-1}^2\,, \end{equation} where $\boldsymbol{\alpha_i}=[\alpha_{i1},\alpha_{i2},\ldots,\alpha_{ik}]'$, $i=0,1$; $\boldsymbol{\beta}=diag(\beta_1,\beta_2,\ldots,\beta_k)$. Now I am trying to link the underlying latent Markov chain to the theory of hiddem markov models. In the theory of HMM I am finding that the observations sequence should be independent. In my case the observation sequence is the residuals $\epsilon_n$ which even though they are uncorrelated, they are not independent. Can this assumption of independence be eliminated in some way? Or am I making some mistake by joining HMM and MS GARCH?
