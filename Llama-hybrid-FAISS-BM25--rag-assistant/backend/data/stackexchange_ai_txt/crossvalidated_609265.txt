I differenced the data seasonally and non-seasonally. and This seems like quite a lot of parameters, and the non-seasonal differencing adds more characterizes a typical mistake known as overdifferencing . You would normally difference your time series if has a unit root. Simple differencing is for a simple unit root, and a seasonal differencing is for a seasonal unit root. Eyeballing your series, I do not see any of the two. But what happens if you difference a series that does not have a unit root? You introduce a unit-root moving-average component. With both simple and seasonal differencing, you may have introduced two of them. They produce certain autocorrelations that were not in the original series, and so you end up trying to fit these using high-order ARMA terms. What I would do instead is think twice before differencing and see e.g. what auto.arima suggests in two cases: allowing for arbitrary orders of differencing and forcing the orders of differencing to zero.
