Dirty read problem, how to solve in sql server 2005

How can i resolve the below dirty read problem in sql server. There is a customer invoice report, which runs on 1:00 AM in afternoon and after that all invoices are sent to the respective customer for payments. Let us say one of the customer has 1000$ to be paid. Customer pays 1000$ at 1:00 AM and at the same time report is run. Actually, customer has no money pending but is still issued an invoice. also how to resolve this prblem too, for non repeatable read For instance, a customer wants to book flight, so the travel agent checks for the flights availability. Travel agent finds a seat and goes ahead to book the seat. While the travel agent is booking the seat, some other travel agent books the seat. When this travel agent goes to update the record, he gets error saying that “Seat is already booked”. In short, the travel agent gets different status at different times for the sea also this problem also trouble me .....Lost Updates Suppose that a customer has due of 2000$ to be paid. He pays 1000$ and again buys a product of 500$. Lets say that these two transactions are now been entered from two different counters of the company. Now both the counter user starts making entry at the same time 10:00 AM. Actually speaking at 10:01 AM the customer should have 2000$-1000$+500 = 1500$ pending to be paid. But as said in lost updates the first transaction is not considered and the second transaction overrides it. So the final pending is 2000$+500$ = 2500$.....I hope the company does not loose the customer.
