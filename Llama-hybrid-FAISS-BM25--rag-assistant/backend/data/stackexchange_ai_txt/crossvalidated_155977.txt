Creating heterogeneous risk score groups (risk based groups on the score)

I just built a credit risk score model (using logistic regression). Now that I have all estimates and resulting score per observation I would like to create risk groups, e.g.: 10 risk groups where 1 is very low or now risk and 10 is very high risk. I am looking for an algorithm in R (or SAS) that helps me split the resulting model score into 10 (or similar number) of heterogeneous (based on regression model target odds). A simple example is to split population into groups where the average odds are doubled by the next group : Risk Group Odds %Population 1(score 1-80) 0.8 10% 2(score 80-120) 1.6 5% 3(score 12-220) 3.2 20% 4(score 220-400) 6.4 8% .... All ideas are much appreciated!
