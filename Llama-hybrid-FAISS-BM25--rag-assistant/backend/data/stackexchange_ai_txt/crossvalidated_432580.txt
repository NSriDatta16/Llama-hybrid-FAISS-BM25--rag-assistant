Running PCA on cointegrated variables

I know that there are a lot of questions about the topic but I would like some extra explanation. What is the effect of running PCA on cointegrated variables? I'm doing PCA on financial data trough eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix of returns. For sure, I think the first factor will explain a large share of the variance. But what about the other factors? Thank you
