Java beans refers to classes with only fields and their getter-setter methods. With little or preferably no business logic at all. They are also known as POJO (Plain Old Java Object). EJB's are part of J2EE specification that can be used to leverage full functionality of J2EE compliant servers, such as transactions, session management, security etc. (That does not mean that you cannot use these without using EJBs)
