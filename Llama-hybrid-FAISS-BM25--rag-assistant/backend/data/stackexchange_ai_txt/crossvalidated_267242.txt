From Hal Daume's article [1]: The standard classification setting is a input distribution p(X) and a label distribution p(Y|X). Domain adaptation: when p(X) changes between training and test. Transfer learning: when p(Y|X) changes between training and test. In other words, in DA the input distribution changes but the labels remain the same; in TL, the input distributions stays the same, but the labels change. https://nlpers.blogspot.com/2007/11/domain-adaptation-vs-transfer-learning.html ( mirror )
