Assert css locator is equal to it's expected value

I'm doing some drag and drop js testing with selenium-client. It works (taking screengrabs before and after clearly show the elements to switch places), but I'm having trouble programatically asserting the change happened. Am I mental, or can I not do something like: selenium.assert_equal("css locator", "expected id of element") which, in this case, would look something like: selenium.assert_equal("css=li:nth-child(1)", "li#list_item_2") Any tips on how to implement this would be great. Thanks, Adam Edit: if I had selenium.get_element that would take a selector and return what it was, I could then perform the assertion in the next step. i.e. element = selenium.get_element("css=li:nth-child(1)") assert_equal(element, "li#list_item_2") (I think).
