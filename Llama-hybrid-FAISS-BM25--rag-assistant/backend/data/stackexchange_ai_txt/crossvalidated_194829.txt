You need to make three decisions about what you are trying to accomplish. One is whether you want to look at this from the perspective of the institution or of the individual students. Second is whether percentages are really the best way to present the data. Third is whether the average alone provides enough information. Your first way of doing the average represents the situation from the perspective of the institution. If you wanted to go to a donor you could say: "We only have enough resources to meet 24% of our students' needs. Please give us more money." The second way you did the average looks at it from the students' perspectives: what is the average percentage of need that an individual student can expect to receive? That is nearly 40% in your data. The difference in these values is because you are working in percentages. That might not be a good way to proceed, the second decision you have to make. When I was the father of a college student receiving financial aid, I didn't care much about the percentage of need that would be met. I cared about the number of dollars we would have to come up with on our own. For example, say that a student had only \$500 need and received no aid. That would only be 0% need met. But is that student really worse off than the first student in your table, who received 2.3% of need but still had to come up with \$21,000? That's a good example of how misleading percentage values can be. Third, your examples show a wide range of need met among the students. If that is the case in practice, then you need to include some measure of the differences among students, not just the average. If your institution advertised that they met 40% of need for the average student, the student receiving 60% might not complain, but the one receiving 2.3% would. And the differences among the students might be something the institution would want to deal with even without increased financial resources.
