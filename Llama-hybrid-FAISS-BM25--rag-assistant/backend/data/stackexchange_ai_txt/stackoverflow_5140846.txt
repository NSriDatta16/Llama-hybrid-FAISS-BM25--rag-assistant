SQL Compact Edition 4.0 is definitely suitable for ASP.NET projects! Read Scott Gu's blog post on VS 2010 SP1 and SQL CE 4 including some walkthroughs. SQL Server Express and SQL Server Compact are quite different beasts: SQL Server Express is really a server - you can install it locally and all, but in the end, it's a server that handles the database for you; SQL Server Compact Edition is a file-based data storage and doesn't require any installation - the data access code libraries are linked into your app SQL Server CE has some limitations: no stored procedures, no views, no triggers, no blob columns ( NVARCHAR(MAX), NVARBINARY(MAX) ). If you can live with that - fine, great! But it's definitely quite scaled down.... On the other hand, it does support Entity Framework, and you can password-protect your .sdf files...
