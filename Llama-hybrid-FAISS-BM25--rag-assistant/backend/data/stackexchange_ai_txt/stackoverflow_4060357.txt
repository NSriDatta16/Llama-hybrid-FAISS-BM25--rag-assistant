Server setup for basic forum-style app on iPhone?

I'm not really a server-side person â€“ I generally do iPhone apps, though I've hacked together a few Wordpress sites. I'm curious as to what web technologies people would use for the back-end of an iPhone app whose front end presents as a basic forum. In other words, people can create new threads, and respond to them - with plain text only. The forum would not exist as a website.. the only way to access it would be on the phone. What technology would people recommend I use? Ruby-on-Rails with Amazon S3 storage? Could I even use existing forum software and pass and receive data to and from it? Perhaps even a forum Wordpress plug-in? Or is there a better way?
