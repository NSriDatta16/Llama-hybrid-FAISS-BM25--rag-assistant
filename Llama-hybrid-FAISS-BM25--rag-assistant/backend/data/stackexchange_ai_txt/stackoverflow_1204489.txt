I honestly think that any specific criteria as a hard requirement is absolutely worthless. If you've ever seen a website which requires a minimum number of characters in a review/comment (dealextreme, and even this site come to mind) you will quickly realize that the effect just isn't what you want. Instead of people insuring that reviews and comments are longer, they'll just find more filler to make sure they hit the known and hardcoded minimums. Ultimately the problem has to be dealt with as a social rather than a technical problem. Each instance of an inappropriately uninformative comment needs to be brought to the attention of the person doing it and explained to them. This still won't solve the problem 100%, but its the closest approach to working that I've found. Having said all of that, I'd be really surprised if someone can write consistently good cvs comments in fewer than about 40 characters. :)
