Remove Seasonality before applying SARIMA model on weekly data?

I am trying to predict average weekly stock prices for time series data. Steps I followed: I tested the data to check whether it was stationary or not using ADF and KPSS tests. Next, to make the data stationary - I normalized the data using StandardScaler , Removed the trend by taking the first difference, removed the increasing volatility, removed seasonality I then plotted ACF and PACF graphs to identify the MA and AR lags. I modelled the values for ARIMA model and it seems to give an awful performance I was thinking to apply SARIMA model next, but I am not sure if I should have removed seasonality before since SARIMA takes seasonality into account. I would really appreciate your thoughts on this.
