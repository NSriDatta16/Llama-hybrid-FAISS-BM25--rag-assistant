Yes, but it is not a problem. Encapsulation is not about security or secrets, just about organizing things. Reflection is not part of 'normal' programming. If you want to use it to break encapsulation, you accept the risks (versioning problems etc) Reflection should only be used when there are no better (less invasive) ways to accomplish something. Reflection is for system-level 'tooling' like persistence mapping and should be tucked away in well tested libraries. I would find any use of reflection in normal application code suspect. I started with "it is not a problem". I meant: as long as you use reflection as intended. And careful.
