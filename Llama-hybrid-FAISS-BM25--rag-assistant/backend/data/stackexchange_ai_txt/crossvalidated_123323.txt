Given the sequence-like format, the Hidden Markov Model seems appealing.However, since the states are predefined you can't use it directly on data. Not sure how you've used the HMM but you can train an Hidden Markov Model for each class , like you do for speech recognition. Also , I guess you could try other supervised learning classification algorithms such as support vector machines(they usually work very well) ,k-nn , logistic regression(maybe?) or naive bayes( I know it is used for spam finding issues).
