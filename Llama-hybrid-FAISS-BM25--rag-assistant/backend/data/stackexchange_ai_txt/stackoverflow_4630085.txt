Linq-To-SQL Association with Multiple Foreign Keys Problem

I'm using Visual Studio 2008, C#, LINQ to SQL, and using the datbase dbml GUI editor to create a database. I want to create a 1 to many relationship, but in my case the 1 object has 2 primary keys. Using the GUI edtior I created the association, but when the program runs and the database is created, I get the error: "The referenced table must have a primary or candidate key. [ FK Name = Screen_Pixel ]" The XML created in the dbml looks like: The generated associations in C# code are: [Association(Name=@"Screen_Pixel", Storage=@"_Screen", ThisKey=@"PKA1,PKA2", OtherKey=@"PKB1,PKB2", IsForeignKey=true)] [Association(Name=@"Screen_Pixel", Storage=@"_Pixels", ThisKey=@"PKB1,PKB2", OtherKey=@"PKA1,PKA2")] Any ideas?
