Can you configure the sample length for mod_status requests per second?

The Apache Module mod_status allows you to view the current average requests per second being served. It measures this average over a fairly long period of time however (I don't know exactly how long). Is it possible to modify this length to something shorter so that I can get a more accurate idea of the current load on the server?
