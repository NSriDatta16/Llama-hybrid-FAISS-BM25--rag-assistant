Ignore Files in Subversion on Per-Project Basis

I recently began working on a large project that contains a huge number of files. For some reason (which I don't understand), the team decided not to use svn:ignore and, as such, each developer needs to provide his or her own set of ignore parameters. I'm using the TortoiseSVN client, and there is a way to do this (using the global ignore property), except it would then apply across ALL other projects that I have checked out which I don't want. Is there any way to ignore files on a per-project basis without using the svn:ignore parameter? Thanks for any help. Edit : I wanted to specify that svn:ignore is not an option. The solution would have to be something locally.
