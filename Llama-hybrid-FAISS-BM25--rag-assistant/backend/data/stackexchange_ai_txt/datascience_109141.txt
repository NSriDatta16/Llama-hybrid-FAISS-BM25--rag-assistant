Organization method on sharing research within a company

Currently we are trying to organize a methodology how different teams can share theirs projects with other team. These projects can be papers, code, pptx, views on everything. Is there a known scheme ; data lake or everything than can be useful to our company for this? We recently found that two teams where creating the same projects without knowing it. I am open to papers or exemples that have already worked in real life.
