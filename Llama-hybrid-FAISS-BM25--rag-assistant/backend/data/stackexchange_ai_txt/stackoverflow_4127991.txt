Grouping Shapes and Text in HTML5 Canvas

So I have just started working with HTML5 and the Canvas element. I'm working on a project where I will be creating mind maps, and I plan to do this using the Canvas element alongside java script. My questions is, How do I group shapes together in a canvas? I have no issues drawing shapes and text onto the canvas, and no issues dragging them around the canvas. What I would like to do is lock say a shape and text element together so that if I drag the shape, the text comes along with it. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
