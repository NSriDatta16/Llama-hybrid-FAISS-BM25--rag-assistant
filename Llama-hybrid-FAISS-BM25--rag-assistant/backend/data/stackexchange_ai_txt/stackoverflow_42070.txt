Why does the Bourne shell printf iterate over a %s argument?

What's going on here? printf.sh: #! /bin/sh NAME="George W. Bush" printf "Hello, %s\n" $NAME Command line session: $ ./printf.sh Hello, George Hello, W. Hello, Bush UPDATE: printf "Hello, %s\n" "$NAME" works. For why I'm not using echo , consider echo.sh: #! /bin/sh FILE="C:\tmp" echo "Filename: $FILE" Command-line: $ ./echo.sh Filename: C: mp The POSIX spec for echo says, "New applications are encouraged to use printf instead of echo " (for this and other reasons).
