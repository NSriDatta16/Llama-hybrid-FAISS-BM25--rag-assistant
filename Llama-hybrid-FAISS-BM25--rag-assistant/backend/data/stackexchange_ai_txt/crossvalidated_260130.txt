You could simply use a chisquare test to see if independence is a possible model, or, to get more information, use logistic regression with the "Stage of skin cancer" as covariable. First I show the chisquare test done in R, in two ways, the second simulates the p-value conditional on the margins in the table ("Fisher exact test"): rbind(dncb.pos, dncb.neg,n) [,1] [,2] [,3] dncb.pos 39 39 26 dncb.neg 13 19 37 n 52 58 63 rpop The null hypothesis of no relationship with the "Stage of skin cancer" is rejected. Then we try a logistic regression, with a linear trend in proportions with the Stage variable: Stage |z|) (Intercept) 2.0107 0.4775 4.211 2.54e-05 *** Stage -0.7562 0.2069 -3.655 0.000257 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 15.4451 on 2 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1.0069 on 1 degrees of freedom AIC: 18.104 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 3 confint(mod) Waiting for profiling to be done... 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 1.106614 2.9869535 Stage -1.174053 -0.3599763 The trend seems to be clearly significant. A serious analysis now must continue with other question, such as Is there overdispersion? some plots, looking at the residuals, .... which I leave for you. (You could get a logistic regression analysis closer to the chisquare test by entering Stage as a factor variable, using as.factor(Stage) ). A third option is just to calculate, for each group, binomial confidence intervals, and maybe plotting them. Could be done as below: library(Hmisc) confint
