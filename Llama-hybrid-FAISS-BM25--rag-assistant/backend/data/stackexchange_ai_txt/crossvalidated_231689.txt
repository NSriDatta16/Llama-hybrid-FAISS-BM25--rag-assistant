So we know that $Y_i=E(Y_i|X_i)+e_i$ where $E(e_i|X_i)=0$ by conditional expectation function decomposition. Basicaly if we have some outcome $Y$, we can split it into the expectation and an error term that conditional on X has zero mean. Now suppose we think there is a linear relationship between Y and X: $Y_i=B_0+B_1X+e_i$ Then from the above we have: $ E(Y_i|X_i)=B_0+B_1X$ and we say that the conditional expectation function (the LHS) is a linear predictor in this case. This is a model that predicts where the expected value is. But we never actually observe that so we create estimates and get sample averages using data.
