which is the most simple registration form?

I think it's a simple question but a little bit complex question too. ;-) What are the required fields for a simple user registration form. I think we don't want to enter all the user details at the first step of the registration, we can set that after the successful registration. sample form First name :_ _ _ _ _ _ Middle Name :_ _ _ _ _ _ Last Name :_ _ _ _ _ _ Organization name :_ _ _ _ _ _ Email id :_ _ _ _ _ _ and finaly captcha: So any other suggestion? please give me your thought about this.
