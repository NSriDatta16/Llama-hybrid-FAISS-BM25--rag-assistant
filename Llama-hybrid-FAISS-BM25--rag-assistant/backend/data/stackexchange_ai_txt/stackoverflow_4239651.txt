How do I detect what version of HTTP a user-agent supports, using PHP?

Sorry if this question seems a little basic for some of you, but my programming knowledge leaves a lot to be desired, to say the least! What I would like to know is this: When a request is made to my web server, how do I detect the version of HTTP that the requesting user-agent supports (i.e. HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1)? The server-side scripting language that my server uses is PHP version 5.2. Basically, I would like to use PHP to do something like this: if(/* user agent is currently using HTTP/1.1 */) { // do this... } else { // do something else... } I would be very grateful if somebody could point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance!
