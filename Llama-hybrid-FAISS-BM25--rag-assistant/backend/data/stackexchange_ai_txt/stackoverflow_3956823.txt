As Robert mentioned, the Perlgeek blog has some great articles. I've written a couple articles myself, but they mostly cover specific things of Perl 6 ( classes , methods , etc). You can look at the Using Perl 6 book, which is freely available as a pdf here . It has lots of code examples for the concepts and features it covers. The book is also available in the docs directory of the latest Rakudo * release. Also, I'd recommend looking through the spec tests. If you have Rakudo * installed they should be in rakudo/t/spec. They are organized by the synopsis , which can be a little confusing. However, the benefit from looking through them is great, you'll get a chance to see multiple examples of how to use concepts in Perl 6 that you know work in your current build because you can run the test.
