Assesing the explanatory power of predictors, interactions and combination of terms

I have a model with 5 basic predictors and all interactions between the predictors themselves. Something like (I'm simplifying here, in reality I have many more variables): lm(Y ~ poly(X1, 3)*X2*X3*X4*X5) I want to determine which variables and/or interactions have the largest impact on the model $R^2$ and one way to do this is to extract the principal components. However, I don't think PCA can tell me if there are some linear combinations of predictors and interactions that significantly contribute to the model $R^2$, especially in presence of polynomial terms and interactions, where the basic predictors can not be interpreted in isolation. For example, poly(X1, 3) + X2*X3 could have a large explanatory power, but not poly(X1, 3) and X2*X3 in isolation, or X1^2 by itself. See this thread for some background. How can I identify the predictors, interactions and combinations of terms with the largest explanatory power?
