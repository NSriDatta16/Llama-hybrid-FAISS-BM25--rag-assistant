How to interpret significant factors in a GLMM gamma model that appears to be good but predicts poorly the observations?

I have a data set of reaction times ( resp.lat ) of 120 subjects ( su ) and 36 observations per subject, which I am fitting with a GLMM model with gamma distribution and identity link as recommended by Lo & Andrew (2015) (the identity link can create problems with gamma but it does not appear to be the case here). The model is resp.lat ~ stake.i.c + dir.c + win.prob.c + (stake.i.c + dir.c + win.prob.c || su) The predictors are continuous variables taking a small number of possible values (two for dir.c , five for win.prob.c and five for stake.i.c ). I am potentially interested in identifying random effects to correlate them with other subject data at a later stage of analysis. Update: The predictors were originally categorical variables but exploratory plots showed that a linear relation was a reasonable. While this coding scheme assumes linear relationships between RTs and predictors, it uses less parameter than categorical variables. On exploratory plots (above), the effect of the variables is dwarfed by the response variability, which makes the significance of the fixed effects all the more surprising (below). I have removed previous information referring to the categorical variables. Update 2 I have added DHARMa Residual plots as suggested by Dimitris Rizopoulos (see below). Looking at the summary, the model appears to fit well the data: > fitRespLat11 summary(fitRespLat11) Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: Gamma ( identity ) Formula: resp.lat ~ stake.i.c + dir.c + win.prob.c + (stake.i.c + dir.c + win.prob.c || su) Data: tmp Control: glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa") AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 58026.3 58083.4 -29004.2 58008.3 4160 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7918 -0.6890 -0.2162 0.4502 4.8900 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. su (Intercept) 5.413e+03 73.576 su.1 stake.i.c 2.008e+03 44.806 su.2 dir.c 2.944e+03 54.260 su.3 win.prob.c 7.514e+04 274.108 Residual 2.172e-01 0.466 Number of obs: 4169, groups: su, 120 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.

In summary, the model converged without warnings, it is not singular and all random effects are statistically significant (LRTs). The residual errors appears to be small (SD=0.466) and all fixed effects are statistically significant (t values > 4, Wald test The plot of the predicted values against the observations shows a lot of unexplained variability. plot(fitRespLat11,resp.lat ~ fitted(.)) The DHARMa diagnostic plot (residuals were simulated with use.u=TRUE to avoid negative values with gamma identity link) also shows a bad fit, which I interpret as showing strong underdispersion simOut I have several (slightly updated) questions: Why are the results statistically significant ? Dimitris Rizopoulos mentioned in the comment that it might be possible when the fit is bad but I don't understand what is happening intuitively in this case. How should I change the model so that I get expected results ? Why is gamma not working. When I look at the estimated dispersion, using a gamma disribution does not seem a bad choice a priori. I am surprised by the fact that the residual variance in the model is very low (SD=0.466; see below), which could explain why factors are statistically significant. If the SD is on a different scale than the random effects as it seems, how do I transform it? I would expect something like sd(tmp$resp.lat - fitted(fitRespLat11)) 286.0733 Histogram of reaction times fitted GLM with and gamma distribution fit.glm $dispersion hist(dat$ resp.lat,n=100,xlim=c(0,2000),freq=FALSE,main="",xlab="RT ms") lines(density(dat $resp.lat)) x resp.lat),length=100) y Underdispersion suggest that I have less variability than I should. Indeed, the density plot (black line) is less wide than the fitted gamma distribution (red line).
