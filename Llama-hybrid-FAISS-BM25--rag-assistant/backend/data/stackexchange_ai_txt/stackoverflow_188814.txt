I think you are looking at a highly complicated solution. It is a major effort to simply design and build out the Schema's that you will be using. If your on a project that involves more than 5-6 people total you likely need to have an organized schema design effort. I think this is a point you are aware of. I question and possibly take issue of the selection of PHP on the front end. I also think you are deciding on XML in a large sense mistakenly. Here is what I do: Build a service layer using Grails.org Keep every resource that can be RESTFUL in rest Use the X-fire plugin in Grails to build out any SOAP services that need to be built Take advantage of GORM and RAD functionality of Grails to reduce development time. Construct clients in X or Y language or platform to consume these services. I definetly would want the speed of pure Java doing all of my XML translation/processing. If you have large documents then it will take considerable time processing these. You understand the forces of your environment better than anyone, but I would caution you to do the simplest thing that works first and not over-architect.
