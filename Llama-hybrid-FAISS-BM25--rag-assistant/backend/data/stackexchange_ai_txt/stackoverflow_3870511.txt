Creating a DataTable or DataView with Distinct entries

I have the following XML file HR 8.2 3 Marketing 8.8 3 HR 7.2 4 Admin 8.9 4 I am able to read the XML into a DataTable and create a DataView out of it. But I want to do the following: Wherever Category is repeated (like HR is repeated twice), consider only one record and average the performance points. So the record should be like HR 7.7 Marketing 8.8 Admin 8.9 Here since HR was repeated twice, I averaged it out. I want to specify this condition while creating a DataTable or DataView out of the XML file. How to do?
