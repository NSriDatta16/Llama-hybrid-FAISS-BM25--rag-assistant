A Vector Autoregressive (VAR) analysis might be suitable for this problem. If you are familiar with univariate autoregressive models, this is pretty much straight forward. If your dependent variable is the Turnover $T$, the VAR model regress on the lagged values of the Turnover and the Max Temp $M$. Your model would look like, $T_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 T_{t-1}+\gamma_1 M_{t-1}+\cdots+\beta_p T_{t-p}+\gamma_p M_{t-p}+\epsilon_t$ From here you can interpret the coefficients of the lagged values of both your variables like OLS variables. For the termperature intervals you can add dummy variables, for example, turnover between $10-15$ the dummy is $1$ otherwise $0$, etc. Or you could just fit a linear model, $T=\beta_0+\beta_1M+\epsilon$. Either way, check the time series for unit root, otherwise you might end up with a spurious regression.
