What I do: Use firebug, it will tell you the exact file and then you can browse the system for that style. You'll want to turn off CSS caching for this temporarily. Generally, there aren't too many (or shouldn't be any) CSS rules being defined in the .module files anyway. If all else fails, you can use something like Agent Ransack or, for a more command line unixy feel, the king of command line search: grep .
