How to access to product and attributes when writing a cron in Magento?

I need to write a cron which will check for some product attribute/states. I'm new to Magento, and I guess the best way to do it is to use the provided Magento method. So how does Cron works within magento? As far I know, there are module the same as used everywhere, which are then run by the Cron. Do you have any exemple on how to write a cron for Magento and use the Magento methods to iterate through products/attributes?
