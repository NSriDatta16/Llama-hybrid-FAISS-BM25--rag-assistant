How does statistical control work in logistic regression?

I want to make sure that I can generally interpret model findings accurately. Is it fair to say that each log-odds associated with a predictor assumes that the others are held constant at 0? Making it similar to standard linear regression. And would this change based on continuous vs. binary predictors?
