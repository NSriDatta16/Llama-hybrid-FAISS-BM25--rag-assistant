I worked on the periphery of a cool framework that implements several Music Information Retrieval techniques. I'm hardly an expert (edit: actually i'm nowhere close to an expert, just to clarify), but I can tell that that the Fast Fourier Transform is used all over the place with this stuff. Fourier analysis is wacky but its application is pretty straight-forward. Basically you can get a lot of information about audio when you analyze it in the frequency domain rather than the time domain. This is what Fourier analysis gives you. That may be a bit off topic from what you want to do. In any case, there are some cool tools in the project to play with, as well as viewing the sourcecode for the core library itself: http://marsyas.sness.net
