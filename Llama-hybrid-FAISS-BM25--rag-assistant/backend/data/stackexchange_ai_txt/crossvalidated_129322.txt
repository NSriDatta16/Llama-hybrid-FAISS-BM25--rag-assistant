Monte carlo simulation in R

I am trying to solve the following exercise but I actually have no clue on how to start doing this. I've found some code in my book that looks like it but it's a completely different exercise and I don't know how to relate them to eachother. How can I start simulating arrivals and how do I know when they are finished? I know how to store them and calculate a,b,c,d according to that. But I don't know how I actually need to simulate the monte carlo simulation. Could someone please help me get started? I know this isn't a place where your questions get answered for you but only solved instead. But the problem is I don't know how to start. An IT support help desk represents a queuing system with five assistants taking calls from customers. The calls occur according to a Poisson process with the average rate of one call every 45 seconds. The service times for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th assistants are all Exponential random variables with parameters λ1 = 0.1, λ2 = 0.2, λ3 = 0.3, λ4 = 0.4, and λ5 = 0.5 min−1, respectively (the jth help desk assistant has λk = k/10 min−1). Besides the customers who are being assisted, up to ten other customers can be placed on hold. At times when this capacity is reached, the new callers receive a busy signal. Use the Monte Carlo methods to estimate the following performance characteristics, (a) the fraction of customers who receive a busy signal; (b) the expected response time; (c) the average waiting time; (d) the portion of customers served by each help desk assistant; EDIT : what I have so far is (not much) : pa = 1/45sec-1 jobs = rep(1,5); onHold = rep(1,10); jobsIndex = 0; onHoldIndex = 0; u = runif(1) for (i in 1:1000) { if(u
