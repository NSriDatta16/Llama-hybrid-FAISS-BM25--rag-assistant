What is the probability that a parameter is greater than other parameters given we know the posterior distribution

Suppose that we have have some form of compositional data $x_i, i\in[1, n]$ which we propose comes from a Dirichlet distribution such that $$ x_i \sim \mbox{Dir}(\lambda \alpha),$$ where $x_i=(x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}, x_3^{(i)})$ , $\lambda>0$ , and that $\alpha=(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3)$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^3\alpha_i=1$ . Due to the constraint on $\alpha$ , we do not have an identifiability between $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ . Therefore using MCMC we can get posterior distribution for all parameters involved. My question is, given the posterior distributions that we have for $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$ , how can we determine the probability that say $\alpha_1$ is greater than $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ ?
