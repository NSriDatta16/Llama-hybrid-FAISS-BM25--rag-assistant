If you have started with one of the template project in XCode find the .xib file for your view and launch InterfaceBuilder by double clicking the .xib file. You can manipulate the view directly by dragging and dropping components as well as adding components from a palette. I would walk through one of Apples tutorials and get a feel for working with InterfaceBuilder - this tutorial shows adding a view controller .
