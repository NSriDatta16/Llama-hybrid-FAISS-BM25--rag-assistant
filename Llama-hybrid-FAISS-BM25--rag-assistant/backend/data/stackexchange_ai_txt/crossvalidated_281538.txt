I guess its late for answering the question. nevertheless I will still leave my answer so that the future viewers can seek help from it. 1) Bayesian Networks are designed to reason about static process. and the observations has to be discretised (in case of continuous Node variables.) It is to be noted that it is a best practice that the continuous nodes are discritised in regular intervals. Also, if you want to work with continuous nodes you can check the concept introduced in this paper . This helps in both continuous variable and Temporal dimension problem. 2) To get Node ordering for method "learn_struct_K2" you can use either of the following methods. Based on dataset, you can for the node ordering using Hierarchy, domain Knowledge and Previous literature work (e.g. For a Bayesian Network with disease progression one can easily attain some hierarchy of node from literature or expert practitioner) For unsupervised Node ordering based on data methods like sampling Gibbs Sampling , Greedy Tree structure learning methods can be used. and based on the tree structure a topological sorting can give you a proper node ordering. Hope this helps!
