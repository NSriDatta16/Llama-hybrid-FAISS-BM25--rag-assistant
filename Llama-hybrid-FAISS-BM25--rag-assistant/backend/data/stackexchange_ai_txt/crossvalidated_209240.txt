What model to use for predicting future expenses of an individual?

I am currently working on a Personal Finance application, which tracks expenses of a person. When entering an expense entry, the user selects the category of the transaction (e.g. 'Bills', 'Food', 'Clothing', 'Entertainment', etc). Using the existing expense data, I want to be predict how much a person will spend in the future (i.e. next month). In order to achieve this, I inted to use BigML , because of it's easy to use API. My question is, what is the best way to model the data source provided to BigML I am thinking about grouping the expenses by Year , Month and Expense_Category , such that the data source will contain the following columns ( amount is the column I intend to predict, obviously): expense-year expense-month expense-category amount However, I am certain my approach can be improved. Please take into consideration that I am pretty new to the field of Machine Learning, this is why I chose to use an API for generating my predictions.
