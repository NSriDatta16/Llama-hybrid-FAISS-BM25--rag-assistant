What is the scope of xsl apply-imports?

My original idea about apply-imports was that if there are two templates which matches the same node, then using apply-imports in a template with higher priority runs the template with the lower priority. But I recently find out that it's important how are imports organized. Two cases interests me particularly. Will apply imports work on a template which is imported in imported file (nested import)? How about a "sibling import" (master file imports two files with templates matching the same nodes) It seems to me that this is not clearly described in specification . Could someone provide authoritative guidelines? EDIT: I can try those cases on my own, but there is always a danger that it will be implementation specific behavior.
