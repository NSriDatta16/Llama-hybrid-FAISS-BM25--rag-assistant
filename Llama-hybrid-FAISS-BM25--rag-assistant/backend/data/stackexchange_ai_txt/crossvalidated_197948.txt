The primary goal of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data where the effect can be a reduction in computation, reduced sparsity, and in general easier to handle. PCA does not necessarily improve the model as, @usÎµr11852 pointed out, and since PCA doesn't take into account the modeling objective it could summarize irrelevant information. Each principle component added will in general increase the $R^2$ score. As more and more variance will be explained. The first knee of the scree plot is a rule of thumb for capturing a significant amount of the variance. Eyeballing your scree plot I'd say it is close to 5-6. I see from your first plot that five PCs seem to be the threshold where a lot of variance is lost. Results with seven or more components are about the same. In summary it is possible that PCA will do no better than the entire set of original features.
