How do I query an organizational unit for its groups with LDAP?

I have tried many queries, but this gets me my OU: (&(objectCategory=organizationalUnit)(Name=MyOU)) (I just get the ou here) I tried to use (&(objectCategory=organizationalUnit)(objectClass=group)(Name=MyOU)) but failed. Also, (&(objectCategory=Group)(cn=MyOU,dc=mytop,dc=mysuffix)) and failed. I am trying to get the groups within the OU. I have searched a lot but cannot come up with it. How do I find the groups within the OU? I have a routine that will print out the groups. I just can't get the query right. Thank you for any help.
