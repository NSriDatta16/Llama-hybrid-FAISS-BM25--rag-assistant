Probability of filled cell given marginal sums

Let $\mathcal{M}(R,C)$ be the set of all $r \times c$ binary matrices $M$ with row sums $R$ and column sums $C$ . In what fraction of matrices in $\mathcal{M}$ is $M_{11} = 1$ ? One possibility is to sample matrices from $\mathcal{M}$ , computing $mean(M_{11})$ over the sample. I've used this approach in the simple case where $R = 1,2,1$ and $C = 1,2,1$ . Because $\mathcal{M}$ contains only 5 matrices in this case, I can confirm that with sufficient sampling this approach gives 0.2, which is correct. But, this approach would take impractically long to converge on stable fractions if $M$ (and therefore $\mathcal{M}$ ) is large. I've also tried generating one $M$ , then fitting a logistic regression modeling $M_{ij}$ as a function of the row and column sums, then using the predicted probability of $M_{11} = 1$ . This is fast, and in many cases the fractions are close to correct, but not always.
