The terms you used are misleading. your "Noise" - is called sampling error, and basically any statistical method addresses sampling error. There is no "Bias", but dependence on multiple independent variables. So you would look at (multiple) logistic regression for your problem. People talk of "controlling" for other variables ( How exactly does one “control for other variables”? ) Think of studies of effect of smoking on chance of heart attack * controlling* for eg age/gender etc. ... This is just a standard logistic regression problem with weather and player as factors. So you would look at confidence intervals around the coefficient for player. (see eg https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/bs/bs704_multivariable/bs704_multivariable8.html ) That's the basic "mechanics". as others have said, quite what you mean by aggregate will change the details.
