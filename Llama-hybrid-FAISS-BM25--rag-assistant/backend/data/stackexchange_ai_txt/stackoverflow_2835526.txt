Organizing a lot of models that use STI in rails

I have a scenario where I am going to be creating a large number of models that use STI and I'm wondering what the best way to organize this is. I already have other models using STI and I really do not want to add any more files to my models folder. Is there any way to create a folder and add the models using STI there (there could be upwards of 40 b/c each uses its own methods to scrape a different site, but they all save the same data)? This seems like it would be best, or I could add them all to one file but I would rather separate them.
