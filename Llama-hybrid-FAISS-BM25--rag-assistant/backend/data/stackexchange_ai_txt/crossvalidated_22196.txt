On testing for heteroskedascity, some questions on the White test & Breusch-Pagan test

Isn't the test statistic for both tests identical? The only difference I see is that the alternative hypothesis is different. Since you don't need to know the function h in the Breusch-Pagan test, what exactly is the difference between the two tests? When would you use the White test, and when would you use the Breusch-Pagan test instead? What's the most important criteria to consider here when deciding which test to use?
