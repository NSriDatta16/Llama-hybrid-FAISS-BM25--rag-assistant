The easiest approach would be to give an extra generic classname to all of the elements you are trying to slide up/down, then connect the actual anchors to the elements, using the href attribute on the anchor. The below bit of javascript (with the changes to the HTML) will perform the same functions as your current javascript, as well as make it easy to add more sliders: # the html toggle the about section toggle the info section toggle the contact section this is the about section this is the info section this is the contact section # the javascript $('a.slide-control').click(function() { $('div.slider').slideUp(); var target = $(this).attr('href'); $(target).slideDown('slow'); }); You can add a new slider simply by adding the proper HTML: Tell me more about this new section! This is a great paragraph about the new section on our website! Alternatively, you can use your existing classes and just add the .slideUp method call for your other elements before your .slideDown : $('a.about').click(function() { $("#info").slideUp('slow'); $("#contact").slideUp('slow'); $("#about").slideDown('slow'); }); // repeat for each click handler
