In the git svn docs, there is a note for the dcommit --commit-url option (emphasis mine): This is intended to allow existing git svn repositories created with one transport method (e.g. svn:// or http:// for anonymous read) to be reused if a user is later given access to an alternate transport method (e.g. svn+ssh:// or https:// ) for commit. Using this option for any other purpose (don't ask) is very strongly discouraged. It's possible that you've discovered what the "don't ask" part of this is referring to.
