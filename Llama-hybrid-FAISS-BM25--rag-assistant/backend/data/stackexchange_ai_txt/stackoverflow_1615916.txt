Most natural blinking visualization?

What is the ideal method for blinking information on a display to draw attention to an error condition in some data in a natural fashion. Should the blink be all on / all off, or should there be an aspect of fast ramp up and down of brightness instead of instant on / off transitions? Should the blink be equally on and off, or should it be something like 60% time on alternating with 40% time off? What is the most natural frequency? How many blinks per second? The goal is to draw attention to the error in some data, but to look natural and ascetically pleasing. Hopefully, the solution is not to hard to implement using Qt and C++.
