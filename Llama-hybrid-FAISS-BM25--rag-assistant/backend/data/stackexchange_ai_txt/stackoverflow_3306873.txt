You have to install the module Error that can be found on CPAN. But be aware of this warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage people from doing so. See the "SEE ALSO" section below for better recommendations.
