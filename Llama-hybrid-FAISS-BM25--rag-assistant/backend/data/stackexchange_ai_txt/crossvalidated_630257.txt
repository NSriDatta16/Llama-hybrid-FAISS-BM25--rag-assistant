Applying filter (e.g., moving average) on Binomial distributed random values

I start with Binomial distributed random values with known $N$ and success probability $p$ . I can easily estimate PMF and CDF of such distribution. Now assume these Binomial distributed random values go through a filter, for example moving average. Is the PDF of the new distribution well defined? Context: my goal is to find a signal / peak hidden in the noise described by Binomial distribution, however the data is correlated with some wavelet first (so not quite moving average, but close)
