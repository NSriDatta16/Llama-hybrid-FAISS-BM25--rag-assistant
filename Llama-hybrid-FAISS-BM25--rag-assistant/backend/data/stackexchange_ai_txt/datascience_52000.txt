Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers in R

Can anybody suggest to me, where I can find example code for R language for BERT neural network for text mining tasks. All I can see are python examples, and I need R. https://github.com/google-research/bert https://github.com/facebookresearch/XNLI https://github.com/tensorlayer/seq2seq-chatbot https://www.depends-on-the-definition.com/named-entity-recognition-with-bert/ https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT и чат ботов https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/ https://github.com/nyu-dl/bert-gen
