I usually refer to it as "inline documentation." To me that's what it's about â€” the fact that your documentation is in your source code, so there's more of a chance the docs will stay in sync with the code. (This is no guarantee, of course, but it does encourage programmers to eat their vegetables. It means the developer can change the documentation at the same time and in the same place the behavior changes, rather than after the fact and in another place.)
