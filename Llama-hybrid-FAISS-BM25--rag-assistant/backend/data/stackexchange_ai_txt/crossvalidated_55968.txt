As a Bayesian, I would say Borel's paradox has nothing (or very little) to do with Bayesian statistics. Except that Bayesian statistics uses conditional distributions, of course. The fact that there is no paradox in defining a posterior distribution as conditional on a set of measure zero $\{X=x\}$ is that $x$ is not chosen in advance, but as the result of the observation. Thus, if we want to use exotic definitions for the conditional distributions on sets of measure zero, there is zero chance that those sets will contain the $x$ that we will observe in the end. The conditional distribution is defined uniquely almost everywhere and hence almost surely wrt our observation. This is also the meaning of the (great) quote of A. Kolmogorov in the wikipedia entry. A spot in Bayesian analysis where measure-theoretic subtleties may turn into a paradox is the Savage-Dickey representation of the Bayes factor, since it depends on a specific version of the prior density (as discussed in our paper on the topic...)
