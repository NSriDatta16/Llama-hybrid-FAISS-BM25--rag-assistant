How can we use average total time if a job to determine time of components?

Imagine a scenario where there are tasks (called jobs) made of many smaller tasks (called assemblies). Each assembly has an average time to completion, and the job time to completion is a sum of the time to completion of its assemblies. Each assembly is independent of the others in terms of time to completion (more on this later). Assemblies are of seven types (a,b,c,d,e,f,g) with their own average time to completion. Assuming that I have a sheet that contains a list of jobs, their time to completion and how many assemblies were used on each, how would I estimate the average time to complete each assembly? Assume that each job may be made of a many assembly types, for example job one may be composed of assembly a,d,e and job 2 composed of assembly d,b,c, and so forth, and we don't have data on the amount of time it took to complete each assembly. Here is an example: Now I should be able to simply take the average time for a job, divide by its number of assemblies and get an average time to complete each task. Then, as I accumulate a large number of jobs, I can divide the number of each assembly used with the sum of the average assembly completion time in jobs they appear in, like so: But this doesn't work where some assemblies are often completed together and have significantly different average time to completion. For example, you can see from my initial data that D,F and G are often (but not always) completed together; but I know from experience that task F should take more than 3 times longer than D. The question is: how do I correctly weight a huge sample (
