Best path through the matrix in dynamic time wrapping: interpreting and implementation

I read several papers and blog to understand how dynamic time wrapping (DTW) can be used to compare two time series data. I understand how to generate matrix and also understand how to choose best path. Now my question is what does this best path tells me or how can I tell these two time series are similar or not similar? I understand how to implement DTW but could not understand how to interpret it.
