Which other parts of the callstack are operating here? You could stop anything else in the event chain from happening by calling event.stopImmediatePropergation(); on the first line of your dragDropHandler (assuming that the listener has a higher priority than others in the chain). You would then need to manually replicate the drag and drop operations on confirm, which I'm not sure but you could achieve using the doDrag() method of the DragManager.
