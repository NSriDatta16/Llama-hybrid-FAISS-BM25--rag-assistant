Along the lines of Samuel's suggestion, Oracle provides facilities in JDBC to do database change notification so that your application can subscribe to changes in the underlying data rather than re-running the query every few seconds. If the data is changing less frequently than you're running the query, this can be a major performance benefit. Another option would be to use Oracle TimesTen as an in memory cache of the data on the middle tier machine(s). That will reduce the network round-trips and it will go through a very optimized retrieval path. Finally, I'd take a look at using the query result cache to have Oracle cache the results.
