Basically, you want to find a balance between two variables: the number of clusters ( k ) and the average variance of the clusters. You want to minimize the former while also minimizing the latter. Of course, as the number of clusters increases, the average variance decreases (up to the trivial case of k = n and variance=0). As always in data analysis, there is no one true approach that works better than all others in all cases. In the end, you have to use your own best judgement. For that, it helps to plot the number of clusters against the average variance (which assumes that you have already run the algorithm for several values of k ). Then you can use the number of clusters at the knee of the curve.
