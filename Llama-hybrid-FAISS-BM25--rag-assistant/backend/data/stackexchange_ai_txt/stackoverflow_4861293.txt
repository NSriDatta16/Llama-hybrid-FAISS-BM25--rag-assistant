This is a pretty serious warning, don't ignore it. The scenario is that you created a COM object on a thread and that thread exited. But you keep using that object. COM takes care of objects that announced themselves to be not thread-safe (aka apartment threaded), it automatically marshals any calls on that object to the thread that created it. That can't work when that thread is no longer around. Ignoring the warning can produce occasional and very hard to troubleshoot threading race errors. Stuff that goes subtly wrong only once a week. Review your code, pay attention to how the object that it complains about got created.
