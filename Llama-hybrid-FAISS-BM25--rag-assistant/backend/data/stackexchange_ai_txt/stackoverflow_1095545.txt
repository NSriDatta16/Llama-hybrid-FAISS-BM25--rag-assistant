String length with given font to fit UITextView 2 - The Return

In this question I asked for a good way to truncate a string to fit a given UITextView. Since there was no way provided by the SDK directly, I've ended up writing the recursive method below (only called by the following public method). However, this doesn't work unless I subtract a fudge factor of 15 (kFudgeFactor) from the field width when calculating the string's height. If I don't do that, the string returned is actually too long for the field, and displays in an extra line below it. Anyone any idea why, and what I should really use instead of this fudge factor? #pragma mark Size string to fit the new view #define kFudgeFactor 15.0 #define kMaxFieldHeight 9999.0 // recursive method called by the main API -(NSString*) sizeStringToFit:(NSString*)aString min:(int)aMin max:(int)aMax { if ((aMax-aMin)
