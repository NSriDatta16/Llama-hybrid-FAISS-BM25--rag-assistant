If zipcode is a factor in R, i.e., is.factor(zipcode) returns TRUE , then it's enough to enter it as a variable once, i.e., B2(zipcode) will automatically figure out a separate "effect" (coefficient) for each level (value) that zipcode can take. For example, you could fit that model as a logistic regression as glm(won ~ bid + zipcode, mydata) . glm() will automatically add an intercept b0 . Once you fit the model, you'll find the coefficients that you can plug into your probability equation.
