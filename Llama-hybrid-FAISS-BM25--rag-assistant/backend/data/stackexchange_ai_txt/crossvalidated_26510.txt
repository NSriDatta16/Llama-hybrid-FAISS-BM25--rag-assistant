How to implement a customized Random Forest classifier

I am trying to replicate an extension of Random Forests introduced in a recent research publication for my project. For instance, for the binary split of data at each node, instead of randomly assigning all example from each class a binary label, they suggest using an SVM to learn a binary split of data. Furthermore, features at a node are augmented with the decision value of its parent node. I wanted to know, if there exists an implementation of Random Forest which can be built on?
