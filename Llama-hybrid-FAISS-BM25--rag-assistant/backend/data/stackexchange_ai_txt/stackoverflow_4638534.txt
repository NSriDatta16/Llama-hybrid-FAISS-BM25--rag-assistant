I don't expect anyone to do the whole work for you, but here's something to get you started. First of all, you need to get the actual source, you can use file_get_contents or curl for this. There's plenty on information about how around here. Then you need to scrape CNN for all H1-tags. A simple way to do this is to use DOMDocument . Here is a simple function to get all headings from a HTML source: function get_h1($html) { $dom = new DOMDocument(); @$dom->loadHTML($html); // Supress warnings if our html is not well formed $headings = $dom->getElementsByTagName("h1"); $retval = array(); foreach($headings as $header) { $retval[] = $header->nodeValue; } return $retval; } Note that this does not account for different encodings etc. Another option for parsing is to use the excellent PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser . You then need to save it into your database, you can use the mysqli or PDO libraries for this. Lastly, you need to run this hourly. Do this using a cron-jobs. You can find information about how to set up your cron jobs here . This should help to get you started. You probably want to add some more features to this, like ensuring your not adding duplicate headings etc.
