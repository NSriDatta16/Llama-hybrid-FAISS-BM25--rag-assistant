param0 disappearing in Soap request in PHP using SoapClient class

I am trying to call a web service from PHP code using SoapClient . $service = new SoapClient($wsdl); $service->myFunction('something', 'anotherthing', 'onemore'); If I turn on trace and get the last request, I can see that the first parameter is always missing from the Soap message, i.e. param0 is never there. It's the same in functions with less or more parameters. The Soap request: anotherthing onemore What I expect it to be (and what my web service accepts when using soapUI): something anotherthing onemore It's the same with __soapCall('myFunction', array($something, $anotherthing, $onemore)); I am using xampplite on Windows XP. Update: http://programming.itags.org/php/236781/ is a link to someone with the same problem (posted in 2008 with no answers :( ). Update 2: I also noticed that it doesn't put the xml elements representing the parameters as child elements of the element representing the function. This can't be right?!!? I've done a horrible fix where I overload the __doRequest function and edit the $request variable. It works, but it sucks. I might as well compile the entire request myself...... Update 3: To me it feels like PHP is just malfunctioning. But if it was a bug in the soap implementation, I'd think there would be more info on it on the web. aaaargh. Next attempt is to try NuSoap and PEAR. Update 4: To round it off, I didn't try NuSoap and PEAR. I just went with my 'hack' because it worked and there were other activities that needed doing. Furthermore, the demo has been given and for the next phase PHP will not be used anymore. So the whole thing will be re-implemented anyway.
