Comparison of Models for Margin and Win Prediction

I recently created two models for predicting the outcomes of matches for a particular sport, one is a linear regression model that predicts the margin of the match, and the other is a logistic regression model for predicting the probability of the outcome of the match. I noticed that occasionally the logistic model will predict team A to win (e.g. 57% chance), and the linear model will predict a margin in favour of the opposing team (say, team B wins by 1 goal) for the same match. Both models are trained on the same data and features. I'm curious to know why, and how, this difference between the two models arises. Thanks!
