PCA using prcomp and princomp in R

I have been trying to do Principal Component Analysis (PCA) via R. The data set is available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3jstl8pu1e1xcp/Cars.csv?dl=0 I tried to do PCA via 2 different methods - prcomp princomp I have used correlation matrix as all the variables are on different scales. Whilst, I can understand a slight difference, there appears to be a major difference between the two. I have illustrated the same below - car car pc pca summary(pca); summary(pc) The result of the above is - We can see the summary of the prcomp method above and the princomp method below. As visible, both are extremely different : in the sdev as well as the proportion of variance. Further, their respective components are also vastly different, as is visible below - prcomp is above and princomp is below in the pic, once again. Can somebody please explain as to why there is such a huge difference between the two ? Also, are these two methods the correct ones to perform PCA or should I go ahead with a different method (e.g. PCA() ) Thanks in advance :)
