What would be a reason to use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to combine data?

In this machine learning tutorial by Google they use the Root Mean Square to create a similarity measure between two shoes. They first calculate the difference between the size of two shoes and then do the same for their price. Finally with those two values they compute Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) however they don't explain why it's appropriate to do so. Could someone explain why would you use RMSE or in what case does it apply?
