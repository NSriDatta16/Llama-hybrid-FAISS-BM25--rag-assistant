Which is a better estimator, averaged functions vs. A function of an average?

Problem: Assume that we want to estimate $f(\theta)$ with a pre-specified strictly increasing function $f$ and a parameter $\theta$ . Let $\hat{\theta}_1$ and $\hat{\theta}_2$ be unbiased estimators for $\theta$ . My question is to compare which estimator is better for $f(\theta)$ : $f\left(\frac{\hat{\theta}_1 + \hat{\theta}_2}{2}\right)$ , or $\frac{f(\hat{\theta}_1) + f(\hat{\theta}_2)}{2}$ . My approach: My approach is taking an expectation on both based on Taylor's expansion of $f$ , provided that they are well-defined. $$\mathbb{E}f\left(\frac{\hat{\theta}_1 + \hat{\theta}_2}{2}\right) = f(\theta) + \frac{f''(\theta)}{2}\text{Var}\left(\frac{\hat{\theta}_1 + \hat{\theta}_2}{2}\right) + \ldots $$ $$\mathbb{E} \left[\frac{f(\hat{\theta}_1) + f(\hat{\theta}_2)}{2} \right] = f(\theta) + \frac{f''(\theta)}{2}\left(\frac{\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_1) + \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_2)}{2}\right) + \ldots $$ Here, the first-order disappears in each expectation because $\hat{\theta}_1$ and $\hat{\theta}_2$ are unbiased. Let's further assume $f''(\theta)>0$ . Then, since $$\label{varineq} (0 \le) \text{Var}\left(\frac{\hat{\theta}_1 + \hat{\theta}_2}{2}\right) \le \frac{\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_1) + \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_2)}{2}, $$ the first estimator (i.e. a function of averages) seems less distant from $f(\theta)$ , as long as the remaining terms (order $\ge 3$ ) are ignored. The last inequality comes from a simple observation: $$ \frac{\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_1) + \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_2)}{2} - \text{Var}\left(\frac{\hat{\theta}_1 + \hat{\theta}_2}{2}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}\left( \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_1) + \text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_2) - 2\text{Cov}\left(\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2\right) \right) = \dfrac{\text{Var}(\hat{\theta}_1 - \hat{\theta}_2)}{4} \ge 0. $$ Question: I wonder if this is logical and there is another way to justify a better estimator. Edit: Let's restrict the class of $f$ by the strictly increasing ones.
