How to learn a classifier from a dataset with high imbalance

What are the most useful techniques for learning a binary classifier from a dataset with a high degree of imbalance (i.e., a dataset with the "target" class being much rarer than the "background" class)? For example, Should one first down-sample the majority/background class to reduce its frequency and then readjust the probabilities reported by the learning algorithm? How should one do the readjustment? Should one use different approaches for different learning algorithms, i.e., are there different techniques for dealing with imbalance in SVM, random forests, logistic regression, etc.?
