If you don't have a fixed reason to use either of those, take a look at Objectify . It's a much better and more usable library for storage. The Datastore services from the SDK are low level services that let you talk directly with Bigtable RPC. You'll be writing code that translates into Bigtable's data formats and API, and calling Bigtable's RPC methods. The JDO specification and its persistence manager are a Java standard that deals with creating data classes and their storage and retrieval. It's one level of abstraction higher than the direct datastore services. Google has implemented the JDO spec to run on GAE, so you can use it if you want to. Objectify is an alternative to the JDO that isn't an enterprise Java standard, but is a lot more easy and fun to use. It follows the Python API quite closely, which makes it quite nice and concise.
