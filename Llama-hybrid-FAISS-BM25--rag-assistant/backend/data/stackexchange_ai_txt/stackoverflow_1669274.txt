Passing a shortcut to a batch script

My bat script accepts a filepath as a parameter, which allows me to drag-and-drop a file onto it from Explorer. Unfortunately when I drop a shortcut onto it, I simply get the filepath of the .lnk file itself, rather than the file that it refers to. Is there any way to derive the underlying filepath? I am looking for a native capability in Windows XP that is directly available to bat/cmd without installing or configuring additional software.
