How to test the proportional odds assumption for ordinal regression?

I am trying to test the assumption of proportional odds in order to carry out ordinal logistic regression. I am using R, but can't seem to find an efficient way to do this. I have looked into the graphical method described here: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/ , but I have 21 independent variables so am anticipating that the graphical method would take a long time. I understand that another potential method is to use the VGAM package to examine a model with equal slopes and then without equal slopes (and compare the results). Is there a specific advantage to a particular method? Is it advisable to test the assumption in R using either of the above methods, rather use different statistical software that has ready-made tests for this, e.g. SPSS? Also - would you test this assumption with every candidate model, or just with your first or final model? Any advice would be much appreciated.
