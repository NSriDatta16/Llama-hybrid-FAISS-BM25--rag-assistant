The added complexity of having to ensure your type bits didn't pass through to any calculations probably would far outstrip any storage savings. You could always allocate a type field adjacent to any primitive field which contains any needed metadata/flags. Then you know that any value always has a storage size of n+1 words, assuming you could get away with a single word for storing your desired type and status info.
