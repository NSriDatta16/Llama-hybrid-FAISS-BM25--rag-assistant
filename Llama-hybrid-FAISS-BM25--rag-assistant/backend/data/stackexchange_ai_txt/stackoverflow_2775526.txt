XmlSerializer's functionality in PowerShell?

Is there a way to leverage the functionality of .NET's XmlSerializer class in PowerShell? More specifically, the ability to easily de/serialize .NET types into Xml e.g. XmlSerializer s = new XmlSerializer(typeof(MyType)); TextReader r = new StreamReader("sample.xml"); MyType myType = (MyType)s.Deserialize(r); r.Close(); I know I can call above from PowerShell, but is there a way to avoid defining MyType in a separate assembly? Thanks [Edit] Since seems to be that .NET-like types cannot be added from PowerShell, allow me to re-target my question: is there an easy way, like XmlSerializer, to serialize types in PowerShell? I have to read/write some .xml's from PS, and would rather leverage such functionality before manually doing it.
