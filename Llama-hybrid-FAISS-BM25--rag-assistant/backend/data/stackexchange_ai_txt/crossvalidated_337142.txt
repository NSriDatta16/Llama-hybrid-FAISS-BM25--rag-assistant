It is incorrect that the logistic regression can only be used to model binary outcome data. The logistic regression model is appropriate for any data where 1) the expected value of outcome follows a logistic curve as a function of the predictors 2) the variance of the outcome is the expected outcome times one minus the expected outcome (or some proportion thereof) 3) (consequence of 2) the data ranges between 0 and 1. These properties certainly hold for Bernoulli data. But one should undertake some exploratory statistics and plots before immediately discrediting the logistic model as a viable (and easy to implement/explain) means to answer a scientific question. A logistic regression model is a special case of the generalized linear model (GLM), that means that consistent parameter estimates and inference are given by the model. Logistic models are used to model proportions, ordinal variables, rates, exam scores, ranks, and all manner of non-binary outcomes in several places in the literature. Sorry that this response doesn't direct your question later down, but stating the prior reasoning brings up a misconception that's worth addressing. Many R users have suggested that the "warning" that comes from fitting a continuous response with logistic models should be suppressed. A "middle of the road" way is to change family=binomial to family=quasibinomial . An example of simulating these data, fitting a model, and obtaining correct inference is shown here: set.seed(123) ## logistic non-binary response x ci[1,1] & b0 ci[2,1] & b1 Gives accurate 90% coverage of the CIs
