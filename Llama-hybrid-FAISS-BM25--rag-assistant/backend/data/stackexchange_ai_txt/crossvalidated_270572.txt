you can try multiple models and cross validate the results. A simple approach would be to use ARIMA with exogenous variables. As you need daily prediction so if data is hourly, aggregate them. For Arima , daily consumption would be univariate time series with other 3 variables as exogenious variables. Before this do EDA on data and see if there is trend, seasonality etc. Check if external variables have any impact on consumption as consumption would be independent of temp, ph etc. Be careful using KNN for imputing missing values as it might give 0s where it is not able to impute values.
