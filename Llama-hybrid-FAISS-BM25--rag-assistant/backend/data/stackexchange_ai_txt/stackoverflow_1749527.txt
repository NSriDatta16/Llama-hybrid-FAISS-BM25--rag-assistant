The first step , in taking this game to the next level, is ... ...to have a very clear view of prior art! (and pardon me to say, the question doesn't suggest that you have such an extensive insight into the matter [and you're not alone, count me in ;-)]) Even, and maybe in particular, if your intention is to apply completely novel techniques and models, it seems important to review the literature on current and past practices . Aside from possibly identifying elements that may be adapted or reused in a new implementation, a survey of the domain will provide an keen understanding of the nature of the problem[s]. I've personally tried -on various and multiple occasions!- either the naive approach or the sophomoric approach to tackling broadly-defined problems. With the naive approach, one has but a very slight idea of the true nature and scope of the problem. The sophomoric sees us better equipped with domain knowledge and also with related tools, but this can also be misleading because without a deeper understanding, we tend to mis-read/mis-understand new material offered to us and also misuse some of the tools (a bit like the the fellow who's "good with a hammer" for whom many things look like a nail...) It is particularly easy to make these mistakes in the field of NLP. That's because Common sense seems to be all is required: after all a child, who's native tongue is English understands subtleties like "He's not really an expert" "He's really not an expert" (small wink at the OP's reference to the ordering of word in the English language) We live in such exciting times, technology and knowledge wise: Processing power, programming language and tools, mathematical techniques, availability of affordable corpora... to name a few of these things that make this moment in time so special. Far from me the idea of discouraging you in your chat-bot endeavor, I just hope that this long and generic expos√© will encourage to look-before-you-leap, as this will truly save you time in the long run, I think in two ways: provide you some frames of references (again, even if your intention is to "think outside these boxes") maybe entice you to redefine the problem, for example by limiting it to particular domains of conversation (sports, or health, or life at a particular university campus...) or by focusing on a particular aspect of the problem (semantic awareness, smooth, natural sounding grammar, use of colloquial forms...) Good luck ;-)
