How to interpret asymmetric error bars?

I got this data from an unknown source and I was trying to understand why the error bars (which I think represent the standard error) are asymmetrical. Is it because the y-axis is on a log scale? The data represents a time series (x-axis is time), and the number of replicates per time is probably 2 or 3.
