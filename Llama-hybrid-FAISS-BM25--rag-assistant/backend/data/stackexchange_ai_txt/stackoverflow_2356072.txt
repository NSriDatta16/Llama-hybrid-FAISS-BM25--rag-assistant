There's no simple answer to this. Microsoft's strategy is for WPF to be the platform going forwards, and WinForms will eventually start to get less and less attention. Nonetheless, WinForms is still a very big development platform; you'll find more third-party components for WinForms than you will for WPF (though this chasm is obviously closing) and more examples online. You'll also find more WinForms developers in the job market. The difference really comes down to what you're doing. What sort of project is this?
