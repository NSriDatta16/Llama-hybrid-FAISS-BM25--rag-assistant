How to get the date and time values in a C program?

I have something like this: char *current_day, *current_time; system("date +%F"); system("date +%T"); It prints the current day and time in the stdout, but I want to get this output or assign them to the current_day and current_time variables, so that I can do some processing with those values later on. current_day ==> current day current_time ==> current time The only solution that I can think of now is to direct the output to some file, and then read the file and then assign the values of date and time to current_day and current_time . But I think this is not a good way. Is there any other short and elegant way?
