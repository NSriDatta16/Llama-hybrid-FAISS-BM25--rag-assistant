Yes, your case is classical survival analysis. The point is that you're taking a snapshot over a period of time and not all subjects that you're aware of experienced a particular outcome during that time. That tells you something: some of those subjects may never experience the event, some of them will drop off of your radar even before the end of your data, and others will take more time than your data covers. The last case, for example, would make your average longer if you were able to look at a longer period of time -- possibly into the future -- or if you use survival analysis. Basic survival analysis covers a beginning time and an event. The name "survival" coming from the idea that the event is a failure or death. As evolecogen says, a more advanced form ("recurrent event") allows for events to occur multiple times. Other techniques cover "competing risks", where one of several mutually-exclusive events may occur. "Multi-state" analysis is more general still, and there are also discrete and continuous versions. If you happen to be using R, I can highly recommend the survival package, and in particular its vignettes. The author is experienced, pithy, and entertaining. For example: “We are left with an unreliable estimate of an uninteresting quantity. Mislabeling any true state as censoring is always a mistake, one that will not be repeated here.” “In this hypothetical world it is indeed true that many more subjects would progress to PCM, but it is also not a world that any of us will ever inhabit.” “If nothing else, draw [the State diagram] on a scrap of paper and tape it to the side of the terminal when creating a data set and plots.” “Very few subjects acquire PCM more than 15 years after a MGUS diagnosis at age 80 for the obvious reason: very few of them will still be alive.”
