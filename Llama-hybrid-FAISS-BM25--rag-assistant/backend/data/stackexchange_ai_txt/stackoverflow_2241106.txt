There are many browsers out there, and each one uses a different mechanism for storing the user's preferences ... including the preferences that determine whether the user has disabled cookies. You could conceivably implement a Java application that knew how to unpick the settings information for some popular browsers. But this would contain a lot of browser specific and operating system specific code. And in the case of Windows, it would entail grovelling around in the registry; e.g. using some third party library. And of course, this would all be rather fragile because: the next version/release of the user's browser could use a different settings representation, the user could use some new browser you've never heard of, different Linux distros, etc could be configured to use different default locations for settings files, and/or the preference file that says what the user's default browser is, and the user could override the default locations anyway, in ways that a generic desktop application could not fathom. EDIT - on the other hand, if your desktop application (acting in the server role of the HTTP protocol) simply needs to figure out if the browser it is currently talking to will allow it to set cookies, the simple solution is to try to do it and see if it works. Finally, you need to bear in mind that the user may not be using the default browser for whatever it is he is trying to do. I frequently have multiple browsers installed on a machine, and may use the non-default one for certain things.
