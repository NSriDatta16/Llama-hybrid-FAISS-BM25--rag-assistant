Simplest model would be linear regression. You can plot your data using ggplot: #for reproducing set.seed(200) #simple example. Assume your data is simple binomial variable with probability 0.3 data This is the simplest model, there are other non-linear models, that might fit your data better. Also, bear in mind that you might have to use log of date, to get better fit. On non-linear regressions such as polynomial regression you can read a lot here Now, it would require additional analysis, but it is essential to establish whether your events are independent. It is possible, that there is some sort of confounding variable that you might not account for. You might want to look into Bayesian linear regression (given you obtain more dimensions than just time and yes/no values) here
