Is there an output difference between php 4 and 5?

I noticed the other day that a new script I wrote for php 5 began outputting html that was viewable before the php script had actually finished. Did this happen with 4? For instance, I have a long loop that echos something out with each iteration. The output was small in terms of kb, so I dont think it was lag due to the download speed. Can someone explain the difference in output?
