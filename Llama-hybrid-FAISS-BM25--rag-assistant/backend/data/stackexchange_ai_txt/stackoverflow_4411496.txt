Even for a single collection, you should be looking towards introducing an abstraction for it. No surprise that as you OO grow software you need new abstractions. Against introducing abstractions, it adds extra code. At least in the short term. A few respectable people take the extreme view that you should go straight for the abstraction, and never return a collection. Average corporate programmers avoid anything object oriented.
