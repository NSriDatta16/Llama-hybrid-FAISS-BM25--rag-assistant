How can I categorize the content types on the Drupal "Create content" page (/node/add)

How can I categorize/organize the content types on my "Create content" page? I'm running Drupal 6.x with CCK. I have a lot of custom content types, and my "Create content" page has become a bit unwieldy, as it lists them all alphabetically. I'd like to organize them by category, so users would see something like: Create Content Reports Report Type A Report Type B Events Event Type A Event Type B I don't want to mess with Core, but anything else (custom module, theming, existing module functionality) is fair game. I'm hoping I'm missing something easy, because this seems like an obvious requirement, but all I could find on the Drupal site were these unanswered questions: Organize Create Content Page (node/add) Core: Split create content page into categories?
