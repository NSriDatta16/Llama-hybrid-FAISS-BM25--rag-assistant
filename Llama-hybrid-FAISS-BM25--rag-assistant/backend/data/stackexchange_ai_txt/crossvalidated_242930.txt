In a random forest, the building of individual trees is actually based on randomness. So in each run, different variables get chosen in each tree and decision point. If I'm not mistaken, setting your seed before running random forest could lead to repeatable outputs. And as @Tobi pointed out, the ratio of observations to features in your dataset is cause for concern with respect to overfitting.
