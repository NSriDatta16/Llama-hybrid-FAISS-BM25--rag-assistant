Responding to the edit regarding wanting to re-step through a subroutine. This is not entirely the most elegant way of doing this, but I don't have another method off the top of my head and am interested in other people's answers to this question : my $stop_foo = 0; while(not $stop_foo) { foo(); } sub foo { my $a = 1 + 1; } The debugger will continually execute foo, but you can stop the next loop by executing '$stop_foo++' in the debugger. Again, I don't really feel like that's the best way but it does get the job done with only minor additions to the debugged code.
