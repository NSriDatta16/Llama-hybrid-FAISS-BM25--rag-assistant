How to implement Drag & Drop from outlook mail or thunderbird to a delphi form?

Does anyone already implemented Drag & Drop of email messages from Outlook and/or Thunderbird ( from now on "OT" ) to a Delphi form. I need to give the user a way to store important emails in my application database without writing OT plugins. Currently they use this technique: from OT they click on an email, save as... save on desktop or temp folder, drag and drop the saved file on the Delphi form. While after the modification I want to do: from OT they click on an email, drag and drop the saved file on the Delphi form. So basically I implemented drag & drop from explorer. I need an extra layer that allows my application to see the email originally on OT as a normal file, so I can drag from OT as if it was a normal windows explorer window. Note: I don't need to support all OT versions. I can accept not to support Outlook 2003 (for example) but not 2010. So in case the technique will not work automatically for all OT versions I will prefer the one that works with the latest. Final note: It is obvious anyway I am interested only in dragging & dropping emails (and not Outlook Calendar items, for example). An idea would be dragging and Dropping attachments too. But this could be an extra improvement for the future.
