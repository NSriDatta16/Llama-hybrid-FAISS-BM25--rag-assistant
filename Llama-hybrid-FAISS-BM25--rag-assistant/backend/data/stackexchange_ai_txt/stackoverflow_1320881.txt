EXIF key names explanations

Does anyone know of a good explanation of EXIF key names? I am writing a photo organizer and want to get as much information as possible out of the photo as I can. However, the EXIF key names are not very helpful. For example, from what I can tell (by exporting images from iPhoto) album or set name is stored as 'fixture_identifier' tags or keywords are stored as either 'keywords' or 'subject' And so on. Anyone have some valuable insight in this area?
