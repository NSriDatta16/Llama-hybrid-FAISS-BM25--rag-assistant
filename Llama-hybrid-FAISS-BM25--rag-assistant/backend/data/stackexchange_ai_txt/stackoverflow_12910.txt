Ok, it looks like there are a couple of issues here. As far as I can tell, there is no such thing as a "droppable" in mootools. This means your events like 'enter', 'leave' and 'drop' won't work. (These are events on the drag object) If you change those names to events that elements in mootools have (as in, DOM events) your code works perfectly. For instance, if you change 'enter' and 'leave' to 'mouseover' and 'mouseout', your events fire with no problem. (Opera 9.51 on Windows Vista) This appears to be the revelant line in the documentation for this, which stats to use DOM events. http://docs.mootools.net/Element/Element.Event#Element:addEvents Also, on that page, is a link to the events that regular elements can have http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_eventattributes.asp However, the advice "TG in SD" gave you in the nabble forums is probably best. If you can, don't bother using these events. Put whatever it is you need to do in the draggable object, and save yourself all this hassle.
