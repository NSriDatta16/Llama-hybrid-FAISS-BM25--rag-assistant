If ( and only if ) your intention is to stop showing the username+password to people who have access to the source, it could be done. It's not too convenient however, and consists of these steps: One-off: put your username and password into a strongly-encrypted file (e.g. AES with a long,strong key) and set its permissions accordingly On every boot: on server start, decrypt the file, manually entering the file's password, and use some long-running process as a temporary storage now that you have the username+password stored in memory, erase the decrypted version of the file. In your scripts: request the username+password from your temp storage connect to database remove the username+pw from your script's variables Note: all this means that the password cannot be recovered by looking at the source code. Those who can modify and run scripts on your server are in the same position as before - "request password, print it out", instead of just "print it out". Another disadvantage is that you now have to enter the decryption password on every server restart.
