You can generate a link(href) that goes to secondpage.aspx?firstname=Samuel and in the code for the second page you can retrieve this value via Request.Querystring("firstname"). But with webforms and postbacks there are other ways of doing this. After getting the selected firstname (preferably in a variable) you can use it for whatever data retrieval methods you want. Also, I really would recommend against using the name as a key in your database. If this is an experiment to learn, I guess it doesn't matter, but the second you want to enter two people named "John" into your database you have run into trouble.
