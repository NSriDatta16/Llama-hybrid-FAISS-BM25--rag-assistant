This question presents a very important problem faced by a great many analysts. I take it you want to use a multivariate model to control for a set of predictors, in order to isolate the role each one plays in affecting the purchase decision. In this way you would identify the amount of leverage each predictor gives you over the outcome. Before you examine the various types of models you might use -- logistic regression, random forest, neural network, etc. -- think carefully, and perhaps ask colleagues to work with you, to consider how the causal pathways might work. Draw a diagram if it helps. Then think about what will happen if you use a model that employs statistical control. Suppose your customers from Region X disproportionately tend to consider Item Z in their purchase decision. Then, if you control for Region, you might be misleadingly deflating the coefficient describing the role of Item. Or vice versa. Similarly, suppose men below a certain age disproportionately tend to buy your products. If you control for age, you might misleadingly deflate the coefficient for gender. Or vice versa. No statistical model or software can take care of such dynamics for you. And there may not be a clear, correct answer to any question that comes up; you may need to try multiple avenues of analysis to yield the best information. Kudos for recognizing (I believe) that good explanatory analysis requires more than simply using an applicable statistical model. Also, kudos for planning to cross-validate, though I'll caution you that a single iteration of analysis via training set and test set is not nearly enough to provide reliable results in most circumstances.
