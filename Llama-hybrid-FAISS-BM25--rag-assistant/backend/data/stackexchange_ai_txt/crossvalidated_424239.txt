Understand neural network in a 'mathematical' way

This is a soft question. But as I read papers/reports about neural network used for pictures. Often there are comments like 'the first layer of the neural network captures the edge/shape information' etc. I am just wondering what exactly the 'edge/shape' is if we just view an image as a matrix. Meanwhile, is there any intuition that a neural network could capture the 'edge/shape' if we just view a neural network as a composition of linear and non-linear functions? Thanks so much!
