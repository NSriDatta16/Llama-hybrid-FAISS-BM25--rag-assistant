You're answering the question yourself. Using A* or Dijkstra's algorithm, all you need to do is decide on a good cost per part of each route. For the bus route, you're implying that you don't want the shortest, but the fastest route. The cost of each part of the route must therefore include the average travel speed of a bus in that part, and any waits at bus stops. The algorithm for finding the most suitable route is then still the same as before. With A*, all the magic happens in the cost function...
