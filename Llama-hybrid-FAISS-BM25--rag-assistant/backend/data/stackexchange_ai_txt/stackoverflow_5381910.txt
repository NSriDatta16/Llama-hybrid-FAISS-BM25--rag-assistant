Well, the direct answer to your question is to use the indexer by name on the Controls property (a ControlCollection ) on the parent-control of the picture-boxes. Assuming that your code is running in an instance method of the parent (possibly the form), you can do: // Cast to PictureBox if you need to set a picture-box-specific property. Controls["pictureBox" + i].BackColor = Color.LawnGreen; More generally, you can do: parentControl.Controls["pictureBox" + i].BackColor = Color.LawnGreen; But how did you get into the strange situation where you have an array of bools with each member associated with a specific picture-box through some naming-convention , in the first place? If you 'manually' dragged a 100 picture-boxes onto the form through the designer, you've probably given yourself an unnecessary headache. It's possible that this could be designed better; with more information we might be able to provide you with a cleaner solution.
