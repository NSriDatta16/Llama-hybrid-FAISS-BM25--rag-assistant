Sorry, a bit new here so please excuse me if this doesn't help too much. The US Social Security Administration keeps records of births and deaths and has their information available for purchase (apparently for a hefty price): Here However I found a source that claims to have bought it and is offering it for free (as well as offering the data sorted by date on the site): Here I'm assuming you can just use that as your sample and go through all the data with a script and find how many people actually die on their birthday. I would do that myself but I have 20 min left to download (they're about 1.5GB) so I'll try to get back to you on the statistics myself if I find the time to write up a script. Of course the United States can't represent the entire world's population but it is a good start. I'm assuming you will see a higher rate in deaths on birthdays because of "first world problems" because we're using the United States and I think the effect would be less visible across the world... Update - Numbers :D I've ran through the Social Security Death Master File from the free source, so there's no way knowing if the information is valid. However, given the size that they're ~3 Gigabytes each and that there's no reason for anyone to spoof these kind of files... I'll assume they are valid. You can see the code that I used to run through it here: http://pastebin.com/9wUFuvpN It's written in C#, it reads through the lines of the death index one by one and then parses the date using regex. I assumed that the file was basically this format: `(Social Security Number)(First Name) (LastName) (Middle Name) (Some Letter)(MM-DD-YYYY of Death)(MM-DD-YYYY Of Birth)` I had regex just pick out the last part for the dates of birth/death, check if any of the fields are just 0 (which I'm assuming it means that Social Security couldn't get a valid month/date for the record), and discard the 0's. Then it'll check if the day of birth and month of birth match the day of death/month of death and add that to the died on birthday count. It'll add all records that aren't 0's to the death count. It outputs the results in this format: Deaths On Birthday/Total Deaths Lines Looked Through - People With a 0 in any of their record It's be great if someone could double check that code, as I've found quite a few errors I've made before and could only tell because my results made no statistical sense. Here is the console output: Doing some math... File 1 had 44665 Deaths on a Birthday out of 14879058 Deaths in Total File 2 had 47060 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15278724 Deaths in Total File 3 had 49289 Deaths on a Birthday out of 15374049 Deaths in Total Total we have 141014 Deaths on a Birthday out of 45531831. So we have ~0.3097% chance of dying on a birthday while statistically (1/365) would lead us to believe there is only ~0.27397% chance of dying on a birthday. That is indeed a 13% increase in chance of death on a birthday from 1/365. Of course this sample is only for Americans and only has 45 million records, I'm sure organizations who originally published their paper had access to much more reliable and larger death indexes. However, I think that it is indeed valid that deaths on a birthday is more likely than death on any other day. Here's a Time article citing jumps in reasons for death on birthdays: Article Edit 2: @cbeleites pointed out that I forgot to account for same day deaths, which would be a huge factor in increasing deaths on birthdays. Strictly speaking my data is still valid but I did not throw out if a person died on the same day they were born. It's interesting that my results were not affected too heavily by this error so it seems that these records don't include death on first day. I'll look into it later. I'm thinking there would be very interesting statistics I can look for such as death on days of the month and make a heatmap of some sort. I'll probably try to do that sometime...
