Rather than simply writing a WCF service, I would look into writing a WCF binding for Telnet that internally handles pooling. Writing a binding to handle your transport and channel level stuff, such as connection pooling, is the appropriate way to solve the problem with WCF. You will gain much greater flexibility this way, in particular, the ability to write multiple services that reuse your telnet binding. I could go into a lot of detail, but it would likely make for a very large answer. Instead, I'll provide the following links, and offer any additional assistance you need through email. WCF can be hairy and complicated when it is misused, but when it is properly used, it can be an extremely elegant and powerful communications tool.
