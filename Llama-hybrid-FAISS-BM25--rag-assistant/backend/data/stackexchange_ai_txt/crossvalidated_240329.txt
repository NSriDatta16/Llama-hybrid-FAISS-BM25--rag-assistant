Probably not appropriate unless I misunderstood what your analysis meant. A 2x2 interaction cannot be examined just by looking at 2 of the 4 categories. Let's cast this into an ANOVA looking at mean rather than odds. Let's say the mean of $X_{11}$ is 10 and $X_{10}$ is 5. These alone cannot prove interaction, because $X_{01}$ can be 17 and $X_{00}$ can be 12. In that case there is no interaction. Having the first subscript as 1 lowers the mean by 7, having the second subscript as 1 increases the mean by 5. A better way is to model the four odds in logistic regression: $logit(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X1 + \beta_2 X2 + \beta_3 (X1\times X2)$ Four means can be retrieved here: $\beta_0$: when both are 0 $\beta_0 + \beta_1$: when X1 = 1 and X2 = 0 $\beta_0 + \beta_2$: when X1 = 0 and X2 = 1 $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$: when both are 1 $\beta_3$ captures the extra adjustment due to interaction. If there is no interaction it should be 0. Hence, the p-value of $\beta_3$ tests the interaction.
