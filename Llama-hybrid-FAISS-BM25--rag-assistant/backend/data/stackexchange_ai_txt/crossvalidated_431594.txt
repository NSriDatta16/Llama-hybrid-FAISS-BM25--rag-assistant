From Bayesian Network To Correlation Matrix

I have a Bayesian network where the edges are likelihood estimations from features {x1,...,xn}. How can I estimate the covariance matrix for x from this Bayesian net? I understand that we normally use a correlation matrix to create the Bayesian network, but I need to do vice versa: I have a Bayesian network and I want to calculate the corresponding correlation matrix. Is conditional probability (likelihood estimate) the same as correlation?
