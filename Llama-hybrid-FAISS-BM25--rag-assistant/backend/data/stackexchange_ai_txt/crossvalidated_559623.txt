How to compare regression coefficients for logistic regression

I have two logistic regression models that are exactly the same (same IVs and same sample) but a different DV. Is there a simple way to compare the regression coefficients between these two models? No nesting involved, though there is multiple imputation (if that matters) We are trying to see if an IV is a better predictor for DV A vs. DV B. Trying to see where there is a stronger relation
