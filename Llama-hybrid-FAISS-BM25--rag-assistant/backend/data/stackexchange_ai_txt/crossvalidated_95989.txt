What is the confidence interval if I compute the total number of bits based on the average number of bits in sampled bins?

Let's say I want to estimate the total number N marbles among M sacks of marbles. The marbles are assumed to be normally distributed. I can't count them all, so I decide to sample S sacks. I get the mean # of marbles from the S sacks, then assume it to be the mean for the M sacks, and multiply. How far off am I from N, as a function of the size of S? How confident can I be?
