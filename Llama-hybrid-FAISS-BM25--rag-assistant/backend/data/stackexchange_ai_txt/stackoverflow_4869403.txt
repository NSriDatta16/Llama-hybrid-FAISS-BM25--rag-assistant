Beginner To Programming

I am in my second semester at my local college. My major is computer science and this is the second part of the Java course. The thing is, even though I passed with a C,(highest grade in the class) I want to do better and get where I need to be. Just like most people it was a up hill battle to learn because it was an online class and the teacher took an average of about a week to respond to anything. I am asking for techniques and tools that helped you be successful. We are learning JAVA and it's hard learning it on your own because there is no one to really look at your code. At the same time I am trying to learn C and C++ with what I've read from at Joel on Software. Any help is nice. Thanks, Orlando
