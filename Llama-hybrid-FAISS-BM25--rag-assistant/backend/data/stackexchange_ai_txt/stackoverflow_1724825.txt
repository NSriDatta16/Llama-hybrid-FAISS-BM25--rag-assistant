MATLAB: Getting an array of cells from MATLAB to Java

I have an array created in MATLAB that contains a number of cell type objects which contain arrays of doubles. It's basically a array and each cell is an array of doubles. What I want to do is to somehow export these so that I can then insert the data into Java as a ragged array of arrays of type int. Any thought on how to best do this?
