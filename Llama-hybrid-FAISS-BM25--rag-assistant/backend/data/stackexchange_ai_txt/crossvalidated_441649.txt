Keras--variational auto-encoder in R studio, which part is defined as Encoder?

This is the example given on VAE, the circle part is something I do not understand. It defined the encoder part as from (X to Z_mean), but my understanding is from(x to Z). Or it just simply does not matter in this case? May I define the encoder part to be(X to Sigma) since it mean and sigma are generated in the same step? Thank you for your help in advance! The link for the example below
