Breusch-Pagan Test using R

I'm currently working on the Breusch-Pagan Test using RStudio through the command ncvTest . I've used the dataset pipeline.txt in the alr3 package; the model I've fit is: mod1 I've also done the residual plot to look at the shape of residuals to have information about the variance and I've obtained that there should be some trace of non constant variance. To sustain this assumption, I've performed the ncvTest and these are my results: ncvTest(mod1) Non-constant Variance Score Test Variance formula: ~ fitted.values Chisquare = 29.58568 Df = 1 p = 5.349868e-08 My question is: how do I read these results?
