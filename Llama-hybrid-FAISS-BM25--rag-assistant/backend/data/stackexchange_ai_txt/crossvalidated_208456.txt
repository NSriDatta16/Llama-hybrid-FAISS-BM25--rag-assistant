Bayesian Time Series model in R

Similar to the scenario described in this paper , I need to forecast a seasonal time series with only a few periods. I am working with about 2 years of daily revenue data, and I want to forecast the rest of the year. I need to be accurate on the monthly level. I have tried methods like fitting ARIMA models and TBATS models recommended by Hyndman, but I have not been impressed by their accuracy so far. Has anyone tackled a problem like this before? I would like to try a Bayesian model, but I don't have a lot of experience fitting non-frequentist models, and would need an explanation of how to do so for a time series.
