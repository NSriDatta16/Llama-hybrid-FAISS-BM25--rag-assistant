I assume you are doing a meta analysis. The simplest way of doing this is: Go back to all log(odds ratios) and their standard errors: $lor = ln(or)$ and $se_{lor} = \frac{se_{or}}{or}$ compute weights for each observation/study: $w=\frac{1}{se_{lor}^2}$ The average effect size is the weighted average: $\overline{lor} = \frac{\sum_i w_i lor_i}{\sum_i w_i}$ The standard error is $se_{\overline{lor}}= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_i w_i}}$ Compute the confidence interval using : $\overline{lor}\pm1.96 se_{\overline{lor}}$ transform those back to the odds ratio metric by exponentiating the effect size and the confidence interval boundaries.
