With regard to your point concerning performance variation between embedding your code in .NET source or within SQL Server stored procedures, you should actually see no difference between the two methods! This is because the same execution plan will be generated by SQL server, provided the data access T-SQL within the two different sources is the same. You can see this in action by running a SQL Server Profiler trace and comparing the execution plans that are generated by the two different T-SQL query sources. In light of this and back to the main point of your question then, your choice of implementation should be determined by ease of development and your future extensibility requirements. As you appear to be the sole individual who shall be working on the project then go with what you prefer, which I suspect being to keep the code centralised i.e. within a visual studio Data Access Layer (DAL). Stored Procedures can come into their own however when you have separate development functions within your organisation/team. For example, you may have database developers on your team who can create your data access code for you and do so independently of the application, freeing you to work on other code modules.
