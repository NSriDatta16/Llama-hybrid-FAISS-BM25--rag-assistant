(Summarized from discussion in the comments.) PCA finds the largest variance among combinations of the input variables, so I'm having a hard time imagining the benefit of this approach. Since your variable for body weight is on a different scale (about an order of magnitude greater than the other variables), you should instead consider scaling your variables, such that their variance is the same. You mention that body weight affects each of the other variables, but this doesn't have to be a problem: The first principal component will then likely be some combination of bodyweight and the other variables, explaining the larger part of the total variance (you can confirm this by inspecting the size of the loadings for body weight in each PC). If you are not interested in body weight per se, you can look at the remaining principal components.
