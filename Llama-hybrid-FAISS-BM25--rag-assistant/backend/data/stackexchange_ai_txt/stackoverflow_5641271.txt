Ad First) You could argue that you are not really providing any functionality if you are only doing setting statements. But if you have a boss who into the code coverage thing, not testing such a method would get you in trouble. And yes, you should only assert on one thing, but IMHO asserting on each property is set correctly by a method, then it only counts as one assert -- regardless of how many assert statements is in your test method. Sometimes I even extract all assertments into a private method to illustrate this Ad Second) If you have the need to test private methods, that an indication that you'd probably be better off extracting those. Ad Third) I have avoided this issue by wrapping all webservice call in a gateway class. The interface of this gateway can be mocked and injected. I try to do this with all external communication if possible. Updated: Oops... messed up with the numbering. Fixed it now
