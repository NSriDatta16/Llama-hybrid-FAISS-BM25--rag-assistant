Using c#,c/c++ or java to improve BBN with GA

I have a little problem in my little project , I wish that someone here could help me! I am planning to use a bayesian network as a decision factor in my game AI and I want to improve the decision making every step of the way , anyone knows how to do that ? Any tutorials / existing implementations will be very good,I hope some of you could help me. I heard that a programmer in this community did a good implementation of this put together for poker game AI.I am planning to use it like him ,but in another poker(Texas) or maybe Rentz. Looking for C/c++ or c# or java code. Thanks , Mike
