$(this).parents('td').children('span:last'); should do the trick. Edit I didn't notice your desire to not only deal with immediate children. If you want all decendants, then you would use $(this).parents('td').find('span:last') I had assumed the span would always be a child of the td . Final Edit For posterity's sake (and to make it easier for people to find this answer in the future), since this was already accepted as the answer, Ben came up with a more elegant solution in his answer that I'm going to put here: $(this).closest('td').find('div,span').filter(':last') As Ben said, you must be using JQuery 1.3 for closest() to work. Good work! :-)
