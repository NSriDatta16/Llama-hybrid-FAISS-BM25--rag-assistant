Since you mentioned API, try the exec family of commands for C. You can use them to execute these binaries that other people have mentioned. To create a robust/flexible solution you will probably also have to leverage the Unix fork() commands. You will also have to develop a mechanism for capturing the output spewed by these utilities. Look into Unix pipes for that.
