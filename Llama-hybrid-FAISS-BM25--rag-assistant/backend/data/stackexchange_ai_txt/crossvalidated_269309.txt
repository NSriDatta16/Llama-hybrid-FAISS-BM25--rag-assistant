Time series: how to determine the interval of a relatively stable time?

I have time series data, it's about the wind speed and direction at each time (minute, or hour). If I plot the histogram of the data by grouping in years, the histograms would look like this It can be seen that the distribution is not stable across the years. And recent year is a little bit more smoother and more stable. Question: How can I determine the interval? For example, maybe year 2005 - 2013 is more stable. My thoughts: The wind data has a 1-year period. So for each year, I can define a metrics for the wind speed, direction and their correlation, for their stablity (maybe simply mean and std). Then I can plot the year-stability , and by defining a proper limit, I can get the time in which the data are more stable. Question: Are there standard approaches for this kind analysis? I don't want to re-invent the wheel.
