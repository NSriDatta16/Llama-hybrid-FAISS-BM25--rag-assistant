I'm not an expert in the field, but I want to draw your attention to reinforcement learning (which is also mentioned in the Wikipedia article on AlphaZero). The book " Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction " (Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto) is a good starting point. Seems to be kind of "the bible" for starting with reinforcement learning. There are simple implementations of games like " TicTacToe " (a lot of examples online), where you can get a good idea how to start. There also is an R package on TicTacToe . I also noticed that there are chess projects on github (e.g. Python) which you might find interesting.
