I'm not 100% sure this would work for you, but for the core task of getting the log file data into the database I would bypass the step where ColdFusion parses the data altogether. Have a look at doing it directly from SQL. First copy your file locally, perhaps using Then, treat your log file like a CSV file and write a SP you can execute via CF that just reads your log data into a temp table. This should be quick and avoid any timeouts. You can then have a seperate step (in SQL again, perhaps) to reorganise your data once it is in the temp table. Hope that helps.
