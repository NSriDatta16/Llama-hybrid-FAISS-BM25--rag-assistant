Their are pros and cons of both approaches. Separating classes into separate files allows you to instantly know which file to modify if you need to update a class and keeps all logic related to that class in the same place. It is also beneficial from a source code repository standpoint to separate files. It increases the amount of load to include a ton of files, however this is most likely negligible. Another disadvantage is having to open numerous files to in the course of coding and it can be a pain to navigate if you decide to use folders in the structure as well. Having related classes in the same file is more convenient than anything and can be confusing to figure out which file holds the class you need to modify. If your project won't be terribly large it will most likely be up to you on how you want to organize it. But think about it in terms of "If I don't touch the code in 6 months, will I remember where to go to edit this class?"
