Using realloc when you don't want to preserve the existing contents of the memory block is a very very bad idea . If nothing else, you'll waste lots of time duplicating data you're about to overwrite. In practice, the way you're using it, the resized blocks will not fit in the old space, so they get located at progressively higher and higher addresses on the heap, causing the heap to grow ridiculously. Memory management is not easy. Bad allocation strategies lead to fragmentation, atrocious performance, etc. The best you can do is avoid introducing any more constraints than you absolutely have to (like using realloc when it's not needed), free as much memory as possible when you're done with it, and allocate large blocks of associated data together in a single allocation rather than in small pieces.
