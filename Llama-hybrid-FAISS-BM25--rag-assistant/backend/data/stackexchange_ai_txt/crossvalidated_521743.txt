Time series forecasting - Residuals not white noise

This is my first message on CrossValidated to get some insights on an issue I am facing while trying to model properly a time series. I am relatively new to this science so please brace with me. My time series is related to energy consumption with a daily seasonality (96 values per day). Here a description: For the model definition, I used an auto.arima as a start but the model returned (SARIMA (1,0,0)(0,1,0)[96]) has residuals that are not white noise, this means that the stochastic part of my series is not entirely modeled. Below a summary of residuals checking: Ljung-Box test data: Residuals from ARIMA(5,1,1)(0,1,1)[96] Q* = 248.44, df = 185, p-value = 0.001282 Model df: 7. Total lags used: 192 I tried to create my own model using differentiation but still end up with residuals that are not white noise which is frustrating. I differentiated twice to remove seasonal and trend patterns, this is what I obtained : After first differentiation: After second differentiation: I chose a SARIMA(0,1,4)(0,1,1)[96] because: we can see a very significant spike on lag 96 on acf with an exponential decay on pacf seasonal lags which suggests a seasonal MA1. And we observe another significant spike on lag 4 on acf for which I chose a non-seasonal MA4. At the end, I obtained these residuals: Do you think it is reasonable to choose such models in regard to the significance of residuals correlations ? Do you have any advice on how should I carry on from here ? Thank you in advance for your help ?
