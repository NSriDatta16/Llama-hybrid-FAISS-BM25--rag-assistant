As I already said in my comment, you can find answer to your question in the Combining probabilities/information from different sources thread. There is no single "right" answer, because there are multiple ways that you can employ to combine different forecasts, and in different cases different methods may work better, then the others. There is no single answer, because, as noticed by @Carsten in the comment, the forecasts are usually correlated and the amount of the correlation is unknown. Same is true about using Bayes theorem in here. Bayes theorem is $$ P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} $$ so to use it, you would need to know the conditional probability $$ P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A, B)}{P(A)} $$ This is something you usually don't know (if you do, then you just need to plug-in the numbers into the formula). What you know almost surely, is that the forecasts are not independent: they are predicting the same thing, likely they are deterministic functions of the same, or similar, data, and if the forecasts are better then random, you would assume they give similar answers. Moreover, even if you made a completely unreasonable assumption that the forecasts are independent, the terms in Bayes theorem would cancel out for the independent events $$ \require{cancel} P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{\cancel{P(A)} P(B)}{\cancel{P(A)}} P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\cancel{P(B)}P(A)}{\cancel{P(B)}} = P(A) $$ by the definition of independence . Moreover, you don't have conditional probabilities, but rather the predictions and their accuracies, so what you can do, is you can take some form of average weighted by the accuracies, as described in the linked thread.
