Help with the following error: Variable already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope?

I am not sure how to handle this error. This is from an RNN tutorial found here . I vaguely understand that the variables need to be able to be reused, but I don't know how to implement this fix. Train.py ran for several hours and finished successfully; this particular error comes when running sample.py Given the long training time, I would very much like to get this working, rather than starting over. ValueError: Variable rnnlm/softmax_w already exists, disallowed. Did you mean to set reuse=True in VarScope?
