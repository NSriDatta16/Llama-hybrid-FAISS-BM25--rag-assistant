Split string into array by regular expression. This function has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged. I reccommend 'explode' function instead 'split': $s = "Split this sentence by spaces"; $words = explode(" ", $s); print_r($words); Output: array(5) { [0]=> string(5) "Split" [1]=> string(4) "this" [2]=> string(8) "sentence" [3]=> string(2) "by" [4]=> string(6) "spaces" }
