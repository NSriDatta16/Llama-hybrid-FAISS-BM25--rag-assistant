multivariate seasonal time series in dlm in r

I am trying to build a dynamic linear model in R for my bivariate seasonal (monthly ) time series. I found the following resources which help me to model bivariate cases but there is no seasonality component included(with my understanding ). https://kevinkotze.github.io/ts-4-tut/ (Section 9) https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dlm/dlm.pdf (page 17) I am so please if you can help me to write the function with seasonality in dlm modeling. Here is the code I used library(dlm) data(NelPlo) # Build the function buildSu I am so please if you can help me to write the function with seasonality in dlm modeling and any valuable R examples are welcome.
