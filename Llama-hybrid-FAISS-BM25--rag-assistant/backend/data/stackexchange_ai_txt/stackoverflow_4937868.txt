I found a solution: I rotate the map using the available heading-information with [mapView setTransform:CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(heading.magneticHeading * M_PI / -180.0)]; Therefore the "beam" always points to the top of the device. I now just display an ImageView on top of the map and change it's position in locationManager:didUpdateToLocation:fromLocation: - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation { // scroll to new location MKCoordinateRegion region = MKCoordinateRegionMakeWithDistance(newLocation.coordinate, 2000, 2000); [self.mapView setRegion:region animated:YES]; // set position of "beam" to position of blue dot self.headingAngleView.center = [self.mapView convertCoordinate:newLocation.coordinate toPointToView:self.view]; // slightly adjust position of beam self.headingAngleView.frameTop -= self.headingAngleView.frameHeight/2 + 8; } Whereby frameTop and frameHeight are shortcuts for frame.origin.y and frame.size.height. It is not ideal and sometimes lacks a little bit when the dot changes it's position, but I'm happy with the solution b/c it works. Have a look at my OpenSource framework MTLocation which does this all (and a lot of other cool Map-related stuff for you): MTLocation
