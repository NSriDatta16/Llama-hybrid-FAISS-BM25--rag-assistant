How to tune hyperparameters in a random forest

I don't know how I should tune the hyperparameters: "max depth" and "number of tree" of my model (a random forest). I use Python and I just discovered grid search, but I don't know which range I should use at first. Since my computer power is limited I can't just put a linear range from 0 to 100000 with a step of 10 for my two parameters. Is there any empirical recommendation/strategy to start with?
