C pointers and the physical address

I'm just starting C. I have read about pointers in various books/tutorials and I understand the basics. But one thing I haven't seen explained is what are the numbers. For example: int main(){ int anumber = 10; int *apointer; apointer = &anumber; printf("%i", &apointer); } may return a number like 4231168. What does this number represent? Is it some storage designation in the RAM?
