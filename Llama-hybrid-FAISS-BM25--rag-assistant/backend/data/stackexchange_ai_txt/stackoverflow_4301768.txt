Other than compiler options like pragma pack, you cannot, padding is in the C Standard. You can always attempt to reduce padding by declaring the smallest types last in the structure as in: struct _foo { int a; /* No padding between a & b */ short b; } foo; struct _bar { short b; /* 2 bytes of padding between a & b */ int a; } bar; Note for implementations which have 4 byte boundaries
