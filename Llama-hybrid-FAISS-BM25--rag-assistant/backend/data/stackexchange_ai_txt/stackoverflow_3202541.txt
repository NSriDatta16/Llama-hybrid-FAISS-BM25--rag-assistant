Performance is sometimes a complex topic , in a way that it might involve a number of tasks whose net/mean performance will determine your application's overall performance. For example, if you break a large task into smaller ones, then the performance of the small tasks will affect the overall performance. Small tasks running in a separate thread of execution are not possible with PHP, so you cannot GET better performance this way. PHP without the use of external libraries, will not allow you to optimize performance. From personal experience, and after some research it was clear that PHP could not meet the requirements for a high performance application, I had to develop. In a similar case, i found people having switched to java or .net for this. In other words, PHP has it's pros and cons when it comes to specific topics such as performance. Be sure to understand the limitations of the language and runtime (if any) you are using before making any conclusions on it's ability to provide performance optimization. Compiled code will be faster, but for this particular case PHP extensions can leverage the performance loss. As said before me, other ways exists on boosting performance but some involve the compilation of your PHP code. Would you trust HipHop PHP for a large scale PHP application without looking out for stability, compatibility and other issues with the LAMP stack?
