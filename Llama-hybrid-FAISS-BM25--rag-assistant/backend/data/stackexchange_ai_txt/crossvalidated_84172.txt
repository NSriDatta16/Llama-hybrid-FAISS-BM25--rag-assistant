There isn't anything domain-specific in Weka. If it implements an algorithm that you're interested in, then it's a very good place to start. However: Putting your data into excel seemsâ€¦unusual. If you're adding this on to an existing workflow, it might be tolerable, but if you're building this from scratch, almost any other solution would be less painless. Weka supports a CSV-like format called ARFF if you want flat text files. It also can also be coaxed into talking to databases. It's not hard to find machine learning software that you can run over your data. The real trick is finding appropriate features that let that software distinguish between its classes. There has been a fair amount of work on this problem already. This paper is eight years old, but may be a good start ( Kolter and Maloof, 2006 ). Note that they use WEKA!
