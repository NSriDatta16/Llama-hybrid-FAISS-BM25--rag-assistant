Difference between bayesian linear regression and regular linear regression independently fitting to mean and standard deviation

As I understand, bayesian linear regression produces a posterior predictive distribution containing both the mean and standard deviation. I've seen several blog posts showing the predicted mean is almost identical to the that of regular linear regression. Could we not use linear regression to predict the standard deviation of the target to achieve the same effect as the posterior predictive from bayesian linear regression? I'm wondering what is the difference between the two approaches, and perhaps when one might be favoured over the other.
