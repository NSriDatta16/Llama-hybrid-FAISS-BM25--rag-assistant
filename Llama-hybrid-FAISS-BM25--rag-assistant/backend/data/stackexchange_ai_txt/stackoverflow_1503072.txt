How to check if permutations have same parity?

I am looking for a way to check if 2 permutations (represented by lists) are of the same parity . Note that I am not interested if they are even or odd parity, just the equality. I am new to Python and my naive solution is given below as a reply. I am looking forward to Python gurus showing me some cool tricks to achieve the same in lesser, more elegant Python code.
