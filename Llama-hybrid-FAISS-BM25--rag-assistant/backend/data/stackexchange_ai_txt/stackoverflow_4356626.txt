I think your problem stems from a basic misunderstanding of how OpenID and/or OAuth work. It looks like you just want authentication, so let's stick to OpenID for now. You are correct to look at existing libraries. python-openid is the one to use if you only need OpenID and not OAuth, and you are not using Django's built-in auth framework. The full documentation for Federated Login with OpenID and OAuth is here: http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OpenID.html . In particular, look at the diagram under "Interaction sequence". First, here is a very good working example from Facebook's Tornado web server's auth module: https://github.com/facebook/tornado/blob/master/tornado/auth.py (grep that for "GoogleHandler". I've used it with great success.) This is independent of Django and Django auth, and should give you a good example of how to implement what you want. If that's still not enough, read on... You said django-openid is irrelevant, but in fact it demonstrates an implementation of exactly what you want, but for Django's auth system instead of yours. Actually, you should look at the similar plugin, Django-SocialAuth , which implements OpenID + OAuth for a few different providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). In particular, look at: https://github.com/agiliq/Django-Socialauth/blob/master/socialauth/lib/oauthgoogle.py and https://github.com/agiliq/Django-Socialauth/tree/master/openid_consumer and https://github.com/agiliq/Django-Socialauth/tree/master/example_project ...for a full working example using django's auth framework, and can be adapted to your custom auth framework. Best of luck. I encourage you to document whatever ends up working for you and build a step-by-step guide for others like you.
