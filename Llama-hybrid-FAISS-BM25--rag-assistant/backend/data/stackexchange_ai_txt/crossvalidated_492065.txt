Another option for quick experimentation with GAM models is the package https://github.com/malmgrek/gammy . The emphasis is on Bayesian modeling of the GAM coefficients as well as easy extensibility on custom basis functions. Currently e.g. Gaussian processes, B-splines, as well as different trivial constructs.
