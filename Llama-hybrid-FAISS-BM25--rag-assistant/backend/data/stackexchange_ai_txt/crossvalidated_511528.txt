Autocorrelation in Poisson model's residuals - Is my model not specified correctly?

I am fitting a poisson regression model in R to count time series data to perform an Interrupted Time Series Analysis, the aim of my analysis is to see if an intervention affected the counts. I am basing my analysis on this tutorial: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407170/ My dependent variable is counts. I have used harmonic terms specifiying sine & cosine pairs to adjust for seasonality. Having fit a poisson model, I observed overdispersion: Residual deviance: 2205.4 on 57 degrees of freedom And so instead I fit a quasipoisson model. model2 When modelling checking using the below code for the deviance goodness of fit test: pchisq(model$deviance, df=model$df.residual, lower.tail=FALSE) All of my models were showing p I have tried fitting a negative binomial model including harmonic terms specifiying sine & cosine pairs to adjust for seasonality model3 Using the same code as above for the deviance goodness of fit test my p value was 0.242 (P>0.05 meaning we accept null hypothesis, model is correctly specified.) However when checking for autocorrelation using acf & pacf plots this model's residuals also showed autocorrelation. Does this autocorrelation mean that my models are specified wrong? Even though my deviance goodness of fit test is suggesting the model is specified correctly? How can I rectify this autocorrelation? I do not have any prior statistics knowledge, I have seen a lot of literature suggesting an ARIMA model, but not sure I have the experience for this.
