This is actually a very hard task in NLP (Natural Language Processing). Regular expressions on there own won't be enough. Take, for example, the word "training" - it can be used as either a verb or a noun ("I'm going to the training session"). Obviously, a regular expression won't be able to tell the difference between the two. There are problems as well, the "-ed" is a common way to end past tense verbs, but will fail you in the case of "disgusted". There are some techniques that can provide you with good (not perfect, but good) indication of whether or not a given word is a verb or not - they can also be quite expensive computationally. So the first question you should ask yourself (in my opinion), is what quality of answer vs. how much processing time are you interested in.
