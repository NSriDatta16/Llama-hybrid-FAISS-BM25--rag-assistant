Is anyone using Kanban (or scrumban) for the agile management practices? Yes, I'm using :-) How does it work in large complex environments with dependencies on waterfall projects? In our environment we have >500 developers, so it is quite large. My team was the first, which used Kanban, mainly for maintenance work, and now for development. Our daily work was very hard, because the other depending teams were following classic development and management techniques, and they liked (they still do) to push the work and Kanban is about pull . Our approach was to communicate as much as possible make our work transparent, but due to the reluctance of the environment we were focusing on our internal work. The WIP limit helped us stay focused, and with the visualize workflow we knew who is doing what at the moment. Our throughput before Kanban was 90% (in other words, when 10 items came in, we delivered only 9), and after Kanban we had 100.4% and it was increasing. As an additional result, other teams started to came by and ask about Kanban, because they liked our results, and wanted to implement their own Kanban system. At the moment I know about 5 teams, which started Kanban in our organization. HTH, Zsolt
