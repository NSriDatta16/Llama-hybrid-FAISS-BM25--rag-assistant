Ensemble of different kinds of regressors using scikit-learn (or any other python framework)

I am trying to solve the regression task. I found out that 3 models are working nicely for different subsets of data: LassoLARS, SVR and Gradient Tree Boosting. I noticed that when I make predictions using all these 3 models and then make a table of 'true output' and outputs of my 3 models I see that each time at least one of the models is really close to the true output, though 2 others could be relatively far away. When I compute minimal possible error (if I take prediction from 'best' predictor for each test example) I get a error which is much smaller than error of any model alone. So I thought about trying to combine predictions from these 3 diffent models into some kind of ensemble. Question is, how to do this properly? All my 3 models are build and tuned using scikit-learn, does it provide some kind of a method which could be used to pack models into ensemble? The problem here is that I don't want to just average predictions from all three models, I want to do this with weighting, where weighting should be determined based on properties of specific example. Even if scikit-learn not provides such functionality, it would be nice if someone knows how to property address this task - of figuring out the weighting of each model for each example in data. I think that it might be done by a separate regressor built on top of all these 3 models, which will try output optimal weights for each of 3 models, but I am not sure if this is the best way of doing this.
