If you're stuck with having to check the .classpath fies into source control, then I'd encourage you to go with your idea of having all the devs install their JDKs in the same location (or use a common env variable name pointing to the locations). I think it's much easier for devs on the same team to have very similar environment setups, and if that common env setup is well documented. That way, as new devs come on board, you can point them to your documentation for env setup and have them up and running quickly - there should be no need to waste time debugging issues around where their JDKs are installed. If that's not an option, though, and you're already using Maven, then you could consider removing the .classpath files from source control. We've recently done this, and we just have all the devs run the Maven eclipse plugin to generate (or update) their own .classpath files based on what's in the pom.xml file. (i.e. mvn eclipse:eclipse to run that plugin).
