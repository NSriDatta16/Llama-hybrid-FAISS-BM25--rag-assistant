How to drag, toss, animate a view along a curved path

I have an view-based iPhone app. Currently there is a small image in the top left hand corner of the screen. When the user taps the screen the image is animated using a CAKeyframeAnimation along a curvy path to the lower right hand corner of the screen. Now I want to change the app so instead of animating on the tap event, the user can drag the image along the animation path. Basically when the user drags downward of rightward the animation steps forward, when the user drags upward or leftward the animation steps backward. On the touch ended event I want the image to continue to animate along the path in the direction of the drag. I know how to read the drag event, but I don't know to start/stop/resume the animation or skip to a specific stage in the animation. It seems like I need to start over and use something other than CAKeyframeAnimation. If that is so, how should I start over? Thanks so much!
