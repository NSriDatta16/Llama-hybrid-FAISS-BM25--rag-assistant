Index as sum of random variables: Reduction of dimension

I have a multivariate time series X, that is, T observations of Dimensions K. These K different factors are summed up to form an index (equally-weighted for simplicity): $ I_t = X_t^1 + X_t^2 + .. + X_t^K$ where $X_t^i$ is the i-th factor of the observation at $t$. My question would be how to choose a smaller number of factors $\hat{K} My approach would have been to run step-wise regressions / calculate variance-inflation factors to determine which factors to add and which not, similarly as for a standard regression in which you have a large amount of potential predictors that are highly correlated and you need to decide which to include in your analysis. Does this approach make sense? PCA also came to mind, but does not seem to fit the problem. Thanks a lot for any help & best regards noclue
