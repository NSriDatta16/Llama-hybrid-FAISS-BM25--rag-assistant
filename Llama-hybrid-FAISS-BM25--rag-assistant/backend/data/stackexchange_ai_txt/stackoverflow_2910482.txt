(supplemental to Andrew Johnson's response) The linked Apple.com post includes 3 or 4 different solutions, most of which only "half" work. I think the most elegant/effective of them is this one: @implementation UINavigationBar (CustomImage) - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed: @"NavigationBar.png"]; [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.frame.size.width, self.frame.size.height)]; } @end HOWEVER ... it's not good-practice ObjC to od that as a category (should be an override), and it has some problems of its own. So, a more general and powerful solution is here: http://samsoff.es/posts/customize-uikit-with-method-swizzling
