In Asp.Net webforms, you cannot escape the fact that framework's entry into your code comes from aspx pages. I agree that your business layer should not touch the asp.net specific components directly but you have to have a model's storage container and session in asp.net is a good area. Thus, one possible approach is to create ISessionManager for purpose of interacting inside your business layer. Then, implement the concrete type by using HttpSessionState ... btw, a good trick is to use HttpContext.Current.Session to implement accessors/getters out of the HttpSessionState. Your next challenge would be how to wire it all together.
