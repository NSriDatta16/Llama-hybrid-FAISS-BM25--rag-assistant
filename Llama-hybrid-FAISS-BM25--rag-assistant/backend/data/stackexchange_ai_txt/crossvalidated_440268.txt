There are some great answers here already, but I wanted to add another way of thinking about the problem that may be more intuitive than reviewing the math (to address the feelings described in the question). This reasoning holds for any particular arbitrary number of trials, but does not address the situation of arbitrarily more trials towards infinity. Those are handled elegantly and well in the already-posted, math-based answers. Each flip is completely independent, and so preceding flips don't have any influence on subsequent flips. But you aren't describing individual flips, because you are imposing information about previous trials. In this scenario, you are using 500 previous trials to inform your thinking about the result of the next flip. This doesn't work, as each flip is independent from all others. If you are imposing information about 500 previous flips on the problem, then you are interpreting the process as a collection of flips. In that case it may be more intuitive to consider trials not as individual flips but as sets of flips. As a simpler example, if we're flipping the coin three times we have eight possible outcomes: HHH HHT HTH THH HTT THT TTH TTT Summarized, those results are: Three Heads: 1 combination Two Heads, One Tails: 3 combinations One Heads, Two Tails: 3 combinations Three Tails: 1 combination So from the summary descriptions (where flip ordering doesn't matter) it is more likely that we'll see a 2:1 outcome, simply because there are six individual combinations that produce that result compared with the 3:0 possibilities, of which there are only two possible combinations. But each specific combination of three flips appears in the list once, and is just as likely as the others. The same logic holds for more trials, though the combinations become tedious to list. Luckily for us, if we're asserting a string of 500 flips with results of heads that takes most of the combinations out of the picture-- we need to start with 500/501 flips showing heads. From that starting point we now look at how many outcomes are possible for the remaining flip, and for that we have the base probability of a single coin flip offering two outcomes: 500 heads flips, and then another heads flip 500 heads flips, and then a tails flip Every possible combination of flips in a set with a given number of individual trials is equally likely, but the summary of each set produces lots of overlapping results (there are a lot of combinations that produce 250 heads and 250 tails, since the order doesn't matter for the summary, but exactly one combination which would produce all heads across all individual trials). There are only two combinations which can describe the situation in the question: every single one of the first 500 flips must show heads (assumed in the problem, so the probability of that outcome is not important), and then after those initial 500 flips, you can get your 1st tails result or your 501st heads result. So that's my suggestion to help internalize the intuition behind this scenario: Each individual flip of a fair coin is memoryless and totally independent, and so each result is equally likely on any particular flip The number of possible combinations of flip results across 500 trials is large, but each specific combination only appears on that list once. Each possible combination of 500 flips is exactly as likely as any other (each has a single entry in the possible outcome list) There are only two possible combinations of 501 flips which begin with 500 flips that show a heads result: one in which another heads result occurs, and one in which a tails result occurs. Each of those results is equally likely (being decided by the 501st flip alone)
