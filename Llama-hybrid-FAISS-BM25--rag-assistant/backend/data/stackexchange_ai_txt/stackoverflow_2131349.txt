Recursive search method in c#

I decided not to keep the reports in the application as embedded resources anymore, and move them to the server locally. The advantages are obvious, but considering that I want to organize the directories (common reports, letterheads, etc.) in a legible way. I need a way to load reports only by name, calling a recursive search method. My plan is to use a cache that can be built at start of the application and then search in a list OR use a method that seeks report name each time I need... Any ideas and an example eventually with code(c#) are very welcomed! Folder Structure can be like: \\webserver\Reports(report files with unique names) \\webserver\Reports\Common(report files with unique names) \\webserver\Reports\Manager1(report files with unique names) \\webserver\Reports\Manager1\Invoices(report files with unique names) \\webserver\Reports\ManagerN(report files with unique names) Hope to be useful this exemplification! Thank you!
