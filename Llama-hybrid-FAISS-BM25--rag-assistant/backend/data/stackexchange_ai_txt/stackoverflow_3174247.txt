I was wondering the same thing. I seem to be able to trigger a successful update by just calling "window.applicationCache.update()". If the manifest file has been modified, the 'download' event is triggered, then eventually the "update ready". When I reload it, it appears to have been applied. I don't seem to need to call swapCache(). I have provision for calling it from the app, but so far have not noticed any effect on the update process. Calling update() basically eliminates one reload, AFAICS.
