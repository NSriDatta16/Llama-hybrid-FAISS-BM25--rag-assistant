How often do we use m-ary decision trees?

If I come across decision trees, it is a binary tree with predicates internal nodes. How often do we use m-ary decision trees? Is there any combination of m-ary and binary decision tree, e.g. first level of the tree is binary and second level of the tree consists of m-ary? Same question arises for Random Forest.
