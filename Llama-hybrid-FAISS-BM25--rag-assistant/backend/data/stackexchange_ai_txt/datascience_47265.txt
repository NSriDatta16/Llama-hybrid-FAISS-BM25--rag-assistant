Cross validation splits your data into K folds. Each fold contains a set of training data and test data. You are correct that you get K different error rates that you then take the mean of. These error rates come from the test set of each of your K folds. If you want to get the training error rate, you would calculate the error rate on the training part of each of these K folds and then take the average.
