Is matlab/octave widely used for prototyping in ML/data science industry?

In the second lesson on Machine Learning ( https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/olRZo/unsupervised-learning ), Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng ) mentions that Matlab/Octave is widely used in the Machine learning industry to prototype. I did quite a bit of research before settling on learning Python, as it seemed to be more applicable for real-life problems. I have used Matlab ~ 2 years back, and I am wondering if I should really go back to Matlab, because of his statement here. However, I have also heard other arguments, that the reason why Matlab/Octave is still used in this course is because this course started in 2011, when python was not as popular or widely used in ML, as a result most of the algorithms was hard to get, or had to be handcoded in Python. I know a lot of you work in the ML/data science industry, so I was wondering: Is Matlab/Octave that widely used in ML/data science industry? Why so, especially since numpy/pandas have a lot of matrix algaebra capabilities?
