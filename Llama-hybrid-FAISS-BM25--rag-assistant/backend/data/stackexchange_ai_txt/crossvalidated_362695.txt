How to forecast integer time series in R?

For a while now I used to forecast integer/count time series as I would do for any other continuous time series, meaning : I use models like ARIMA, ETS, THETA, TBATS ... And then I simply round the results. So I wonder is there some models designed specifically for count time series ? Are they more efficient than the previous models ?
