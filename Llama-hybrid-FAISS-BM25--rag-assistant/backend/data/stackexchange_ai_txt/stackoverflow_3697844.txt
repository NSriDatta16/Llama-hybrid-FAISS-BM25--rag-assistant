Any library that you might use to detect whether the site is being accessed by a mobile device would ultimately, in most probability pick up the User Agent string and then compare it with a device data store ( like WURFL or .Mobi ). There are several open source libraries like Tera_WURFL but I am not sure what is available for .Net applications. One thing that we did in one of the projects that I worked with was instead of checking for all the mobile User Agents and defaulting to desktop if not found, we did the other way around. We check for all the desktop user agents and defaulted to mobile if not found. I feel this improves the performance as there are reduced number of comparisons.
