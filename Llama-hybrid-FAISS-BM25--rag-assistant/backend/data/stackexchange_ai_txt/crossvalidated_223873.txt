SVM: giving probabilities by sigmoid

For example, as for a binary classification problem, SVM usually gives a classifier rather than Probs. In other words, the SVM may gives us hyper-parameter, e.g., $W = [w0, w1, w2]$ for our data $X_{train} = [1, x1, x2]$, and we can use $W$ to get a "delimiting line" to do classification. Now the question is: Ever since we used hinge-cost to train a SVM, we already had $W$. Could we use sigmoid to give probabilities of prediction = 1/0 , such as $sigmoid(W \times X_{validation})$ or $sigmoid(W \times X_{train})$ ?
