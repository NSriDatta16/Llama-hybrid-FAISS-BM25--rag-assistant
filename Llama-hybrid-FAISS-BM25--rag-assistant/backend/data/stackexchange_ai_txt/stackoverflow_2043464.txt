I'm having this problem as well. When I try to request the same PDF without SSL on Internet Explorer (7 or 8) it works, but if I request it with SSL, it doesn't work... We think we may have tracked this down to headers that IE is expecting when downloading a PDF. I haven't checked the prawnto source code to see what headers it set, but we are likely going to use some Rack Middleware to inject the headers we need: # add headers for PDF downloads in IE # PDFs not downloading correctly via SSL in IE # solution: add some headers for PDF downloads # http://marc.info/?l=php-general&m=124301243808544&w=2 class RackAddPdfHeadersForIe def initialize( app ) @app = app end def call( env ) @status, @headers, @body = @app.call env add_headers if is_pdf? and is_internet_explorer? [@status, @headers, @body] end def is_pdf? @headers['Content-Type'] =~ /pdf/ end def is_internet_explorer? @headers['User-Agent'] =~ /MSIE ([0-9]{1,}[\.0-9]{0,})/ end def add_headers @headers['Content-Description'] = 'File Transfer' @headers['Content-Transfer-Encoding'] = 'binary' @headers['Expires'] = '0' @headers['Pragma'] = 'public' end end So I tried this, thought it would work, then found that indeed it still didn't work. So I ended up doing this, for whatever reason, this worked for me: class ReportsController
