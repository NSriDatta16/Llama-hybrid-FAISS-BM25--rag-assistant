Embedding non-edit widgets in a DataGridView

Is there any way to embed a widget in a data-bound DataGridViewCell when it is not in editing mode? For example, we are wanting to display an existing calendar widget in a cell. That cell contains a comma separated list of dates. We want to show the calendar instead of the text. We could create a custom cell and override the Draw method so that it draws the calendar in the cell, but that would not handle the mouse-over tool-tip that we already have in the existing calendar widget. [Update] I tried TcKs's suggestion, but was not able to create a working solution. See the comments on that answer.
