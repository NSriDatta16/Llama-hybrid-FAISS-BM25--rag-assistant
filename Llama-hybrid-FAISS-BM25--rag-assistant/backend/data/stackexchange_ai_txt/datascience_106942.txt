Generate new distribution from auto-encoder /variational autoencoder

I know that autoencoders can be used to generate new data. From what I could understand.. The autoencoder uses the original distribution X to learn a random gaussian distribution described by mean and sigma. Then the decoder will use the mean and sigma parameters to randomly sample a new parameter which will be close to X. My question is that let's say I have information about two features X and Y.Then can I use the variational auto encoder to generate new random samples related to Y using X.
