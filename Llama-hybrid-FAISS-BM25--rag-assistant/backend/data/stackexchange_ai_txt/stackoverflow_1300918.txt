accessing hash inside of an array with ruby on rails

I am getting the average of all of the calls that belong to a user. A user can have many phones. So I search all the phones that belong to that user and average that phones calls and add it to an array. Now I need to average all of the calls together. This is what comes back: [{["2009-08-14", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-15", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-17", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-18", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-19", # ]=>nil}, {["2009-08-14", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-15", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-17", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-18", # ]=>nil, ["2009-08-19", # ]=>nil}] Each hash is a different phone. What is the best/fastest way of averaging these together?
