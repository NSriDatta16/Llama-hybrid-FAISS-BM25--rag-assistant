If there is too much space between the footer and the body, have you looked at what the margins and paddings are on the affected divs? Does something have a height or a min-height that is making some of the content within the body taller than the natural end of the content? Firebug is a great tool for this. Div is a block element. Other block elements are paragraphs, headings, lists, etc. Span is an inline element. Other inline elements are strong, image, anchor, etc. You still need the body to be contained in a block-level element.
