You can model each individual pixel $x_i$ as a random variable with distribution $p(x_i)$ . You could also consider the whole image as a random variable $x$ with distribution $p(x)$ . Their distributions are related by $$p(x_i) = \int p(x)\ d x_{j \neq i}$$ Pixel values are usually treated as continuous for GANs, but for other classes of generative models (for example, autoregressive models), they are typically treated as discrete, ranging from 0 to 255. Almost all real numbers are uncomputable, so no, you can't "limit storage of pixel values to a finite number of bits". $p_{\text{data}}(x)$ is typically continuous when pixel values are treated as continuous, and vice versa. although strictly speaking computers do not have infinite resolution and are therefore only approximating pdfs with pmfs. Not necessarily -- "infinite" objects can be precisely represented with finite space. For example, I can represent a standard normal distribution with just two integers, $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$ .
