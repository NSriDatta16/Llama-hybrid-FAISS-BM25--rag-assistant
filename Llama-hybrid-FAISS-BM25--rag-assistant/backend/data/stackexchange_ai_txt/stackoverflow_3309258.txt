Silverlight ToolKit DragDrop problem

I have pane with two grid and there is a listbox in both grid. I'd like to add Drag & Drop feature to the pane, so the user can drag a list element in the left listbox and drop it in the right listbox. I found many great tutorials and I could add the appropriate code to my pane but when the application is running and I click on the menu item of my pane it does not load. If I delete the drag & drop code everything works fine, so the problem is definitely the Drag & Drop feature. Thanks for any help!
