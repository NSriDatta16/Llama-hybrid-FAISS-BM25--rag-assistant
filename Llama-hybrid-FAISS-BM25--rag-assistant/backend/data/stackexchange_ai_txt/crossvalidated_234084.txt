Prediction values using Multinomial Logistic Regression in R only showing 2 of 4 predictions

I am new to multinomial logit regression, though I have done work with simple logistic regression. I am attempting to build a model looking like the following: $$ \log(P_i/(1-P_i)) ~ X_1 + X_2 + X_3 $$ Where my dependent variable I am attempting to model for is in 4 levels: -2, 0, 3, or 7. I am running the model using the nnet package in R . While my model works, it doesn't show any prediction values of -2 or 3. I would expect this for the -2 because very little of the data resulted in -2 but a fair amount did show a 3 as the result. The model yielded a misclassification error of 34%. Would the reason for a binary response when I hoped for a 4-way response be something within my R code or is there an understanding of multinomial regression I am not understanding? I know this question is very general as I would like to understand not only the math behind what is happening but also I am working in R properly. Below is my R code. Drive$Points.2
