These posts all focus on the difference between two values as a proportion of the the first: $\frac{y-x}{x}$ or $\frac{y}{x} - 1$ . They explain why $$\frac{y}{x} - 1 \approx \ln(\frac{y}{x}) = \ln(y) - \ln(x).$$ You might be interested in the difference as a proportion of the average rather than as a proportion of the first value, $\frac{y-x}{\frac{y+x}{2}}$ rather than $\frac{y-x}{x}$ . The difference as a proportion of the average is relevant when comparing methods of measurement, e.g. when doing a Bland-Altman plot with differences proportional to the mean. In this case, approximating the proportionate difference with the difference in the logarithms is even better: $$\frac{y-x}{\frac{y+x}{2}} \approx \ln(\frac{y}{x}) .$$ Here is why: Let $z = \frac{y}{x}$ . $$\frac{y-x}{\frac{y+x}{2}} = \frac{2(z-1)}{z+1}$$ Compare the Taylor series about $z =1$ for $\frac{2(z-1)}{z+1}$ and $\ln(z)$ . $$\frac{2(z-1)}{z+1} = (z-1) - \frac{1}{2}(z-1)^2 + \frac{1}{4}(z-1)^3 + ... + (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}(z-1)^k + ....$$ $$\ln(z) = (z-1) - \frac{1}{2}(z-1)^2 + \frac{1}{3}(z-1)^3 + ... + (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k}(z-1)^k + ....$$ The series are the same out to the $(z-1)^2$ term. The approximation works quite well from $z=0.5$ to $z=2$ , i.e., when one of the values is up to twice as large as the other, as shown by this figure. A value of $z=0.5$ or $z=2$ corresponds to a difference that is 2/3 of the average. $$\frac{y-x}{\frac{y+x}{2}} = \frac{2x-x}{\frac{2x+x}{2}} = \frac{x}{\frac{3x}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}$$
