There are several problems here. First of all, you need a reset CSS to remove the margin and padding added by the browser's User Agent stylesheet. Something like Eric Meyer's will do. Secondly, after adding in the reset CSS there still will be some overlapping. This is caused by the borders, the widths of which are not part of width . outline is not affected by this, so I'm using that in the demo below to show that the elements are not actually overlapping, but I won't recommend using that in place of border. Instead, you should take into account the width of the border when doing your calculations. See: http://jsbin.com/ofusa3/edit
