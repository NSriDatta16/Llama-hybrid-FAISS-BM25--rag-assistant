Calculate sample mean confidence interval of noisy logistical distribution

I have $n$ samples which follow a logistic distribution with unknown $u$ and $s$; it is affected by a Gaussian noise with 0 mean. I would like to estimate its average $u$ with a confidence interval (let's say 95%). I did compute the data set average $x$, and the data-set variance $v$. As Wikipedia says, I should do this ... I am confused on how to get the correct parameters in $t$, if $t$ is a t-student distribution. I found a shady example which is supposed to have a 95% confidence interval x qt generates a t-student distribution in R Will it work on my data? Should I calculate the Phi over the Gaussian tables? because I do not recognize that shady 0.975 (95%) or 0.995 (99%) of the example, is it $1-((1-0.99)/2)$ ?
