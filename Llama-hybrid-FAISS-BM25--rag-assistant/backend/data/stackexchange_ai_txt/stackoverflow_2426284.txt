You can keep track of which documents you have already compared, e.g. (with numbers ;)) compared = set() for i in [1,2,3]: for j in [1,2,3]: pair = frozenset((i,j)) if i != k and pair not in compared: compare.add(pair) compare(i,j) Another idea would be to create the combination of documents first and iterate over them. But in order to generate this, you have to iterate over both lists and the you iterate over the result list again so I don't think that it has any advantage. Update : If you have the documents already in a list, then Hogan's answer is indeed better. But I think it needs a better example: docs = [1,2,3] l = len(docs) for i in range(l): for j in range(i+1,l): compare(l[i],l[j])
