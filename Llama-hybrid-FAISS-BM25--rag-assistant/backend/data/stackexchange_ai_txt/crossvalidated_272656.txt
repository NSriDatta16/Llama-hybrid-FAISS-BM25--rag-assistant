Adding some input nodes in the middle of a DNN

In this bioinformatics paper: paper link is used the following DNN (Deep Neural Network): where some input nodes were added (concatenated) to the first hidden layer. Does anybody know the name of this technique? I would like to know more but I can not find any information about it.
