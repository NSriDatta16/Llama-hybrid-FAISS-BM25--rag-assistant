The Rendering article on Wikipedia covers various techniques . Intro paragraph: Many rendering algorithms have been researched, and software used for rendering may employ a number of different techniques to obtain a final image. Tracing every ray of light in a scene is impractical and would take an enormous amount of time. Even tracing a portion large enough to produce an image takes an inordinate amount of time if the sampling is not intelligently restricted. Therefore, four loose families of more-efficient light transport modelling techniques have emerged: rasterisation , including scanline rendering, geometrically projects objects in the scene to an image plane, without advanced optical effects; ray casting considers the scene as observed from a specific point-of-view, calculating the observed image based only on geometry and very basic optical laws of reflection intensity, and perhaps using Monte Carlo techniques to reduce artifacts; radiosity uses finite element mathematics to simulate diffuse spreading of light from surfaces; and ray tracing is similar to ray casting, but employs more advanced optical simulation, and usually uses Monte Carlo techniques to obtain more realistic results at a speed that is often orders of magnitude slower. Most advanced software combines two or more of the techniques to obtain good-enough results at reasonable cost. Another distinction is between image order algorithms, which iterate over pixels of the image plane, and object order algorithms, which iterate over objects in the scene. Generally object order is more efficient, as there are usually fewer objects in a scene than pixels. From those descriptions, only radiosity seems different in concept to me.
