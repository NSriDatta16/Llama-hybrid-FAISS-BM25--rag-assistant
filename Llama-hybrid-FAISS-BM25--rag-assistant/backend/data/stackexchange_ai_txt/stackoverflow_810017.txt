jQuery ScrollTo Disabling nchors on animation

I am using Ariel Flesler's ScrollTo jQuery plugin. Everything is great except when scrolling, the animation drags the cursor over some links which, having :hover triggers, cause a momentary hang up in the animation. Any chance anyone knows how to disable elements :hover functions while the animation is happening?
