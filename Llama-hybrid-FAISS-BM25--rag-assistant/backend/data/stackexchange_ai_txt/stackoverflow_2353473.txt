Can PHP tell if the server os is 64-bit?

I am dealing with Windows here. I know you can use the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] variable to detect the OS of the browser viewing the page, but is the any way that PHP can detect the server's OS? For my program's UI I am using a PHP webpage. I need to read a key in the registry that is in a different location on a 64-bit OS (It is under the Wow6432Node Key). Can PHP tell what OS it is running on? Can PHP tell if the OS is 64-bit or 32-bit?
