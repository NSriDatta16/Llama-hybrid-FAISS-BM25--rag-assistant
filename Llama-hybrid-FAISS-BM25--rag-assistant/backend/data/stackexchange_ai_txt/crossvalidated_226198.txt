You can pass weights to SGDRegressor's fit method , although it is suggested for big training samples, n > 10000. I have not used/tested this myself and I do not know the reasoning behind this suggestion, perhaps would be worth looking into for you. One possible reason I can think of comes from using SGDClassifier for implementing logistic regression with elasticnet penalty, as suggested in Scikit documentation . As discussed here SGDClassifier may have slower convergence compared to better optimized solvers. I have experienced a similar issue with a multinomial logistic model.
