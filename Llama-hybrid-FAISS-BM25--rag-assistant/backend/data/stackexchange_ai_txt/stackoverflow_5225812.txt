I had a similar issue with my iPhone app. Most likely JavaScript is crashing your application. I worked around this issue by accessing Facebook login site directly via URL: http://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&redirect_uri=http://YOUR_SITE_URL&scope=publish_stream,offline_access&type=user_agent&display=touch If you open that link in your iPhone app, it'll display a login screen if user is not logged in, or ask for permission to Publish Stream & Offline Access (as directed in scope) and then it'll come back to YOUR_SITE_URL with access_token, which you can later use to communicate with Facebook via Graph API.
