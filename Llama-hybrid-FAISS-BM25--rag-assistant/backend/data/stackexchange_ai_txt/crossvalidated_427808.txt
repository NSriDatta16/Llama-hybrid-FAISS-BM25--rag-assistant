A frequentist p-value and a Bayesian posterior tell you different things. P-value: $P(\text{data} | \text{hypothesis})$ or the probability of data given a hypothesis being true (more precisely a test statistic which is a function of data but that detail doesn't really matter here). Posterior: $P(\text{hypothesis} | \text{data})$ or the probability of an hypothesis being true given data you've observed. Whichever is better for your situation depends on what question you're answering! My guess is that most of the time people care about the probability of some hypothesis being true given the data they've seen and so they should look at a Bayesian posterior. This guess is because it's my own experience on what I care about when I do analysis and the fact that when people misinterpret the p-value they usually misinterpret it as a Bayesian posterior (see Am I taking crazy pills here or this A/B testing tool's documentation dead wrong? ).
