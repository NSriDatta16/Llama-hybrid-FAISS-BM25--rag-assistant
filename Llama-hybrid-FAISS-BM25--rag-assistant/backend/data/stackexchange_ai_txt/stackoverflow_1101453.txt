Best Practices for Software Organization

Background: I'm a windows developer at MegaCorp(tm) and I am getting new hardware soon. Question: Are there best practices around setting up my developer software installs? Details: I've got my main IDE (Visual Studio/SQL Management Studio), but there are also tools that I'm testing out, additional tools I can't live without, and future accomodations. All my code is stored on a remote server in SourceSafe so I don't need to really accommodate for that, but I'll regularly jump into perl/python/php for separate/side tasks.
