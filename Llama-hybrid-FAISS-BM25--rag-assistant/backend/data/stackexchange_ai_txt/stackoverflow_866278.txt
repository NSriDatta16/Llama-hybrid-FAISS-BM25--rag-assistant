Lost FK relationship with LINQ-SQL designer

I have three tables in my DB (actually a few more than that) these are: Users ----------- ID (PK) Name Sites ----------- ID (PK) SiteName Users_Sites ----------- ID (PK) UserID (FK to Users.ID) SiteID (FK to Sites.ID) and I have a unique constraint on UserID and SiteID in the Users_Sites table. All very standard stuff. My problem is that when dragging these tables into the LINQ-SQL designer I can see the relationship between the Sites and the Users_Sites tables, but not the relationship between the Users and Users_Sites tables. I tried creating an equivalent diagram in SQL Enterprise Manager, which verified that the relationships were actually there. Is there a known issue with the LINQ-SQL designer, or is there something special I should be doing?
