A random forest would not be expected to perform well on time series data for a variety of reasons. In my view the greatest pitfalls are unrelated to the bootstrapping, however, and are not unique to random forests: Time series have an interdependence between observations, which the model will ignore. The underlying learner is typically a tree based algorithm, which does not extrapolate trends. If there are genuine time trends in the data these will not be projected forward.
