Roadmap to learn CNN in tensorflow from scratch

I'm working in the medical field and I'd like to learn applications of CNN for image recognition and classification. All the (few) things I learned come from self-learning on the web or sparse books. I'm studying now Tensorflow for CNN implementation but I'm having trouble finding clear documentation for my actual level, so I think I'm missing the basic knowledge in order to understand this. I'm at a basic level of python programming, I have better understanding of classical machine learning algorithms, which resources should I learn in order to get a good grasp of the argument? Is there such an ideal pathway to this?
