fine tune BERT in a small GPU

I want to to fine tune the BERT base model but the only accelerated HW I have access to is a couple of Quadro 600 GPUs which only pack 1GB RAM and 96 CUDA cores each. My question: is it even possible to fine tune BERT over this HW? If so, would it be worth with so few CUDA cores available? How can I know whether GPU memory will fit all the data and parameters?
