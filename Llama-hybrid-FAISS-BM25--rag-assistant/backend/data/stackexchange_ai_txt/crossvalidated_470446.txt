Minimum number of specimens for a medical experiment

Could someone validate the following - for the minimum number of specimens required. A pathogen has 8 different forms. Laboratory specimens (small organisms) are infected with the pathogen. For each different form of the pathogen: 2 organisms are to be dissected on day 3, another 2 organisms are to be dissected on day 7, and another 2 on day 14. The dissection determines whether "Y - organism still infected" or "N - no longer infected". What is the minimum sample size of the organisms required so that there is adequate power in the signal (80% confidence level)? Is it 8 * 8 *3?
