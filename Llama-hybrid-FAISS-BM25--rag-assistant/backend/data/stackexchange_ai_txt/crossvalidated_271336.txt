What's the similarity and the difference between time series regression and "regular" linear regression?

Time series regression function looks very similar to the "regular" linear regression. But they're different. TS regression has auto correlation issues, but regular linear regression assume no auto correlation. My question is, what's the relationship between these two regressions? What's the similarity and the difference?
