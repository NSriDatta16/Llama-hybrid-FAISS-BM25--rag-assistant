Missing type for XML Fact in JDeveloper 11g BPEL rule manager

I'm currently working on a composite for the Oracle SOA Suite 11g R1. In short, I have the following BPEL process (some activities not mentioned): File Adapter waiting for XML files (format defined in input.xsd ) to start an instance. For the example, the input file contains a list of simplistic shopping orders (the XSD type is Order_Type ). Transform (format defined in output.xsd ) File Adapter to write output. Both XSD's use a third common.xsd for common types. I'd like to insert a rule right after reading my input file. From the JDeveloper (11g R1 PS2) BPEL editor, I drag a Business Rule activity below my Receive activity and use the wizard to create a new Dictionary: I let JDeveloper generate XML Facts from my input.xsd . Order_Type gets marshalled to the class mypackage.OrderType with selector //xs:complexType[@name='Order_Type'] I create a new Ruleset, and a new rule taking an order as input. I create a Decision Function to call that rule. The function has one input parameter of type OrderType If I close the function dialog now, I have no error but cannot select the rule in my BPEL process. On the other hand, if I select Will Be Invoked As A Webservice then close, I have the following error message: Element not found in XML-Schema file. The element for fact type mypackage.OrderType could not be found in XML Schema file file:/C:/Jdeveloper/[...]/xsd/input.xsd [...] aka BPM-36355 error, although that error code is not explicitly mentioned. Of course, the type is present in the file (as I said, I let JDev generate the JAXB classes for me), so I'm at a loss as to why this error happens, or how to correct it. I tried various combinations for the generation of XML facts, of the decision function, and I restarted JDev (don't laugh, that actually fixed a weird issue yesterday), but to no avail. The XPath expression selecting the type is correct. Any suggestion would be appreciated. Except dropping Oracle or downgrading to pre-11g, of course. Thanks
