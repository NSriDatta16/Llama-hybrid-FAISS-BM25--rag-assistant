JavaScript allows one to write HTML to the document while it is being loaded using document.write("string here") . However, it is much better to use the window.location object, which contains the various parts of the URL. In your case, you want to set window.location.href (the entire URL) to the redirect destination. You can attempt to check for a mobile browser using a regular expression, also known as a regexp. Without the ten second delay: (The regexp is the one Wikipedia uses for the redirect to its mobile site.) if(/(Android|iPhone|iPod|webOS|NetFront|Opera Mini|SEMC-Browser|PlayStation Portable|Nintendo Wii|BlackBerry)/.test(navigator.userAgent)) { window.location.href = "page_you_want_to_redirect_to"; } In JavaScript, a regexp is an object. Its .test method returns a Boolean value (true/false) indicating whether the regexp matches the string argument. With the ten second delay: if(/(Android|iPhone|iPod|webOS|NetFront|Opera Mini|SEMC-Browser|PlayStation Portable|Nintendo Wii|BlackBerry)/.test(navigator.userAgent)) { setTimeout(function() { window.location.href = "page_you_want_to_redirect_to"; }, 10000); } What is setTimeout? setTimeout is the JavaScript function to run code after a time delay in milliseconds [10000 ms = 10 s]. The code to be run is contained within function() { ... } , which creates a closure (an essential feature of JavaScript).
