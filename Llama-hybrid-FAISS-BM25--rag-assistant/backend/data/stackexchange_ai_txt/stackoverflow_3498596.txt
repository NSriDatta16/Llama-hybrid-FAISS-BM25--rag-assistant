What makes you think Ternary search should be faster? Average number of comparisons: in ternary search = ((1/3)*1 + (2/3)*2) * ln(n)/ln(3) ~ 1.517*ln(n) in binary search = 1 * ln(n)/ln(2) ~ 1.443*ln(n). Worst number of comparisons: in ternary search = 2 * ln(n)/ln(3) ~ 1.820*ln(n) in binary search = 1 * ln(n)/ln(2) ~ 1.443*ln(n). So it looks like ternary search is worse.
