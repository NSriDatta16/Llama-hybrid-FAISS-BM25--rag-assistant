Link prediction on network embeddings

A picture is worth a thousand words, so I decided to illustrate how I imagine the procedure of link prediction on network embeddings. In the figure below the LR model stands for the "Logistic regression model". Train and test networks are composed of an equal number of positive and negative edges (training examples). My question is: should I learn embeddings on a network defined by positive edges only or should I also consider negative edges in the network embedding process? Any idea is appreciated.
