Side effects of scripts run from dynamically added content are not removed. (It would probably be impossible for the library to do that even if it wanted to.) As to "best practices", there's not really any management work to be done. If you pull in page fragments via ajax, then you either want scripts to be run or you don't; it all depends on how your site works.
