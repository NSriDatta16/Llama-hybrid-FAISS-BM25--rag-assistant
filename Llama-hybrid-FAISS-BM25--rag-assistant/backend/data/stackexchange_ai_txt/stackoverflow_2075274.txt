I wound up just building on my original method and doing as Robert suggested in his comment on my question. After I get my list of rectangles, I then run through and calculate the average color over each rectangle. I check to see if the red, green, and blue components of the average color are each within 10% of the gray and blue rectangle colors, and if they are I save the rectangle, if they aren't I discard it. This process gives me something like this: From this, it's trivial to get the information I need (orientation, starting point, and length of each rectangle, considering the game window as a 6x6 grid).
