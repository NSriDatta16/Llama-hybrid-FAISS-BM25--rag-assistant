I don't think LDA is an appropriate method for your problem. You are trying to find $k$ clusters in the space of user $preferences$. A simpler, and probably effective approach, would be to represent each user's preferences (i.e., which pages they liked), as vectors with binary components and then cluster them according to their vectors using k-means. Now, if you are really trying to correlate a linkage between document content and user preference vectors, then I'd suggest fitting a logistic model, with the document's term frequency vector as input and the preference of user $i$ for that document as the binary output. If you think that the preferences themselves are correlated, then you could perform PCA on your preference matrix (or SVD) and then fit logistic models to the orthogonal components (which are defined to be independent).
