VS2005 How to Search for breakpoints

How can I search for breakpoints in VS2005 or go to next breakpoint? I need this feature when I add a bunch of breakpoints to unfamiliar code, say on all bits of dodgy code connected with some some feature and I want to make sure I have broken on all of them. Kind of limited code coverage test.
