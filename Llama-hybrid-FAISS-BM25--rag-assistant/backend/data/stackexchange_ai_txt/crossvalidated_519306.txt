Why important features does not correlated with target variable?

I'm testing if there is a relation between top important features and correlation between those features and target. I'm working on the titanic dataset. I plot the feature importance (using xgboost ): I checked if there is a relation (correlation) between the top 2 important features ( Fare , Age ) and target ( Survived ). Moreover I checked the least important feature ( sex ) and target ( Survived ). I used 3 different types of correlation methods. Results: Type: pearson, fare cor: 0.2573065223849625 Type: pearson, Age cor: -0.06980851528714314 Type: pearson, Sex cor: -0.5433513806577555 Type: spearman, fare cor: 0.32373613944480834 Type: spearman, Age cor: -0.03910946205127973 Type: spearman, Sex cor: -0.5433513806577551 Type: kendall, fare cor: 0.2662286416742869 Type: kendall, Age cor: -0.03268974393136027 Type: kendall, Sex cor: -0.5433513806577552 As the data shows, it seems that there is no relation at all between important or less important features and the target. Am I right ? If so, when it will be good idea to use correlation ? (Because we can see in this example that correlated or uncorrelated features doesn't affect the target results)
