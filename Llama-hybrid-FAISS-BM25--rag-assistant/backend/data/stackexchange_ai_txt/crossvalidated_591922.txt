Alternatives to the Silhouette score in cluster analysis?

The silhouette score in my case gives quite misleading results, any alternatives? My data is a result of embedding words, which belong to one of the 20+ classes. I want to measure the "clusteredness" of words belonging to the same label. Often times words of the same label cluster into a 2-3 well defined blobs, which is good, other times words spread out evenly on the entire plot, like background noise, which is bad. Any measurement to quantify this?
