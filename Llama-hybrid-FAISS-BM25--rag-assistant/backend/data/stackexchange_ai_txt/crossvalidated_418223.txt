Yes, it's completely possible to get large coefficients and small $R^2$ values. Consider that the coefficient values depend on units, while $R^2$ does not. So if a model with length as a predictor switches from using kilometres to millimetres, the coefficients will increase by a factor of $10^6$ without changing the $R^2$ . Yes, your interpretation is correct. If your coefficient is 0.6, the interpretation would be that an increase in the predictor of 1 unit is associated with an increase in the target/dependent variable of 0.6 units on average . This is true whatever the $R^2$ value is. But the 'on average' of course is important and it would be reasonable for the $R^2$ to affect how you interpret the coefficients, especially if you intend to use the model for prediction. So if the model $R^2$ is low, you might reduce your expectations of the predictive power of the predictor. But it would be better if you paid attention to the standard error of the coefficient , which measures the uncertainty in the parameter. This uncertainty is likely to be high if the model $R^2$ is low, but it's a more direct estimate of uncertainty in that specific parameter than the model $R^2$ , which is a measure of the whole model.
