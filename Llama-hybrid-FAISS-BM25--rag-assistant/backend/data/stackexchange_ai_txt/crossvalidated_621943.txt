How to interpret GLM without intercept?

I have a question about the output of my glm model WITHOUT an intercept. I am comparing the number of infected leaves on plants in different months. In the case of a model WITH an intercept (using the default log link of the Poisson model), the (Intercept) should represent the log of the mean number of infected leaves in the reference month. The regression coefficients for the non-reference months are the differences in the log of the mean counts of each month from the reference month. I don't want to include a reference group because the output doesn't make much sense. So I removed the intercept from the model using -1 . Here is the model dat_lambsburg $month month, levels = c("May", "November", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October")) mod_9 |t|) monthMay -13.3026 4304.2345 -0.003 0.99755 monthNovember -13.3026 3043.5534 -0.004 0.99654 monthJune 0.9163 2.0507 0.447 0.65802 monthJuly 2.5649 0.8993 2.852 0.00755 ** monthAugust 4.5512 0.4711 9.661 5.23e-11 *** monthSeptember 3.9195 0.4568 8.579 8.36e-10 *** monthOctober 4.0797 0.4217 9.675 5.06e-11 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for quasipoisson family taken to be 84.10988) Null deviance: 10704.9 on 39 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 2346.4 on 32 degrees of freedom AIC: NA Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 11 My question is how to interpret the models without intercept/reference group? The results overall makes sense. That is, significantly more disease from July to October. What does the estimate for May (-13.3026) and November refer to in my case (-13.3026 )? If estimate represents count, how can count be negative? To provide some context, no infected leaves were recorded in May and November and the highest were recorded in October. I have attached raw data figure. Details about the experiment: I collected positive count data, specifically the number of infected leaves per plant, as part of my experiment. To treat the plants, I placed them in the field for a week using four different treatments. Afterward, I brought them back to a controlled environment, counted the number of infected leaves, and DISCARDED the plants. I repeated this process with fresh plants in the following week. This is not a time series data. Treatments were applied for a week at both locations, so the duration of each treatment was the same. Plot size, treatment duration and sample material were identical.
