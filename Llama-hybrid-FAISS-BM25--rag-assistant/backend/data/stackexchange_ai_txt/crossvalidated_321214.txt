Estimate , predict , and model are three verbs that can often be used instead of "regression" in most sentences. Assess , measure , or infer are applications which may pertain to statistical testing based on such models. This solves a different problem of scientific writing being too obtuse. We cannot defenestrate "regression" for its historical context without throwing out the entire English language. However, in modern science it is given that the point of statistical tests and models is to separate signal from noise in data. This is the essential meaning that was abstracted by the term "regression". Examples include: "We estimated a generalized least squares model to describe mean differences in income earnings for various household structures in urban East Asian settings." "Ordinary least squares was used to predict lower body functioning two years following transplantation." "Hemoglobin A1c was modeled as a linear combination of age, sex, race, family history of diabetes from self-report questionnaires as well as triglycerides, blood pressure, creatinine, and serum cholesterol at follow-up." "The association between traumatic exposure and development of PTSD was assessed with logistic regression controlling for age, military service, housing instability, and educational setting." "We measured change in knowledge following the preparatory exam course using the T-test." "We inferred vallium's superiority to oxycodone for pain management of cystic fibrosis using the log-rank test for time until readmission for symptoms of unmanaged pain."
