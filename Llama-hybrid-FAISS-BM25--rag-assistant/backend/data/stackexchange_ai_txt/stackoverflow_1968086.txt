I'm pretty uncomfortable with you defining variables in the app class so that they are globally available and I absolutely can't (frankly) see using the disk as an intermediary. I explore one way to solve this in this tutorial In SL4 a cleaner way may be to use the Frame to hold a reference to a business object that can be passed among pages. I'll explore that a bit and comment soon. Thanks - Jesse Liberty
