If you are using a GNU compiler, the compiler can assemble a list of dependencies for you. Makefile fragment: depend: .depend .depend: $(SRCS) rm -f "$@" $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -MM $^ -MF "$@" include .depend or depend: .depend .depend: $(SRCS) rm -f "$@" $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -MM $^ > "$@" include .depend where SRCS is a variable pointing to your entire list of source files. There is also the tool makedepend , but I never liked it as much as gcc -MM
