Posting a table via hidden input runs into varchar2 and htp.p size limit

I have tables which can be sorted and filtered on the browser side, via jquery plugins. There is also a download button which copies the modified content of the table to a hidden input and submits it to oracle which then prints the value of the input using htp.p with a excel header. This works fine for tables of a certain size, I am prompted to open the file in excel. On larger tables though I get this. mod_plsql: /pls/braganza/play.download_filtered HTTP-400 Value param too long. Length is 53169. Upper limit is 32512 Any ways of circumventing this limitation?
