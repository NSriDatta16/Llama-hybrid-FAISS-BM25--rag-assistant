How to output contents of raw files

I'm just working through a chapter on Managing Application Resources and am having a bit of trouble with the following: "Add a raw text file resource to the Droid1 project. Use the openRawResourse() method to create an InputStream object and read the file. Output the contents of the file by using Log.v() method. Rerun the application and view the result." So firstly, I right clicked on the res folder, created a new raw folder and dragged a txt file from my desktop into this (think this was ok and couldn't find another way of importing the file). Then I wrote these two lines: InputStream iFile = getResources().openRawResource(R.raw.textfile); Log.v(TAG, iFile); However I get the error: "The method v(String, String) in the type Log is not applicable for the arguments (String, InputStream)" Not sure what to do... any suggestions. Thanks.
