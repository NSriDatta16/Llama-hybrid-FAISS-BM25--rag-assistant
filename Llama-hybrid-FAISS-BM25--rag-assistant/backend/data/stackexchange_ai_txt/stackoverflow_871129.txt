I've been using AppJet ( http://appjet.com ) for this lately. It's client-server, where both the client and the server are scripted with simple Javascript. The system is extremely simple but powerful enough to create some simple toys. It also supports a small space of persistent storage that is table-based (i.e. not MySQL, but straightforward enough). The only downsides to using it are (a) you're very much restricted to Javascript and what you can do in it and (b) your source code (client and server) can be viewed by other people. If you want to try getting into Python, Google App Engine ( http://code.google.com/appengine/ ) is also convenient. It's more complicated, but you don't have to show people your source code.
