Cannot drag and drop crystal report viewer onto web form in visual studio 2010 !

I've installed crystal report in visual studio 2010. I can design reports. But when I created a web page and tried to drag and drop the Crystal Report Viewer, nothing happened! No viewer was added, no warning either. Please let me know how to fix this??? Thanks!
