I've tried to animate a div in the way you described, and I'm getting the same behaviour. Instead of trying to fix this problem, I suggest working around it. f.e., leave the original div alone, and let another div that is positioned on top of the flash animate. note: remember to use the wmode:"transparent" when embedding your SWF, so you can correctly use z-index to position anything above the SWF.
