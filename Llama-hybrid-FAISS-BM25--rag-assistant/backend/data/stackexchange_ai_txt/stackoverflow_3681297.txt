If you're wanting to query on those attributes, then you're unfortunately probably stuck with first-class fields, if performance is a consideration. Bitfields and flag strings are an easy way to solve the problem, but they don't scale well against production data sets. If you aren't going to worry about performance, then I'd use an implementation where each property is represented by a character ("a" = "garage", "b" = "fireplace", etc), and you just build a string that represents all the flags a record has. The primary advantage this has over a bitfield is that a) it's easier for a human to debug, and b) you don't need to worry about the size of your data types. If performance is a concern, then you will likely need to promote them to first-class fields.
