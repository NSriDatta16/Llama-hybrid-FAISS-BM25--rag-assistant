Measuring Accuracy of the SVM based model

I have developed a model which evaluates a user based on how important he is for the organization. For that purpose I have generated 1000 records for 1000 users. Here I have one dependent variable "Value" and there are other independent features which contributes to the "Value" of the user. The "Value" can have any value between 1-1000. I have rationed training data as 90:10 and when i ran SVM algo I see that the testing data predictions are well matched. Now I am looking for some function in R language which will compare predicted "Value" and actual "Value" of testing data and tell me how accurate the prediction of "Value" was. I have come across confusionMatrix but seems it works it will work when dependent data can have only 2 class like 0/1 or true/false. In my case the "Value" can have any integer between 0-1000. Please suggests what can be the best approach to evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of the model. Adding answer to user20160 as I dont have enough point to add comments. I am using below logic to run svn on my training and testing data. ## separate feature and class variables test.feature.vars formula.init formula.init svm.model summary(svm.model) svm.predictions And now I need to compare data=svm.predictions and reference=test.class.var Update 2: Based on what geekoverdose has answered. Thanks I have tried fitting the model suggested by you and evaluate RMSE metric. userValue,User_Salary_Rating,USer_Exp_years,Low_Critical_App,isThirdPartyUser,isSuperUser,isSysAdm 100,18,6,2,0,0,12 10,0,0,0,0,0,0 30,0,3,0,0,0,7 26,0,3,0,0,0,3 52,0,3,0,1,0,10 71,9,0,0,0,1,10 46,0,6,0,0,0,10 29,0,0,0,0,0,15 62,9,3,0,0,0,15 57,0,3,0,1,0,15 And when I run the train command I am getting below error. Please suggest what might be going wrong here. > model PS: I have already requested merge of accounts so that I can add comments.
