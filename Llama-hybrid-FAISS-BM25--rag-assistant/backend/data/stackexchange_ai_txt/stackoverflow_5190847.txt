Django South: How to use with multiple installs of codebase and one central database?

I am converting an existing codebase (with several apps) to use South. My codebase is currently installed on 1 development server and 3 production servers. The development has its own database and the 3 production servers are all connected to one central database. I read the info at http://south.aeracode.org/docs/convertinganapp.html but I am still a bit confused as to how to proceed. This is the steps I plan to follow: Dev Server: ./manage.py syncdb (To create South tables in dev db) Dev Server: ./manage.py convert_to_south myapp (To create South files & records in the dev db) Dev Server: push to VCS Server 1: pull from VCS (To get South files) Server 1: ./manage.py syncdb (To create South tables in production db) Server 1: ./manage.py migrate myapp 0001 --fake (To create South records in the production db) Server 2: pull from VCS (To get South files) Server 2: ./manage.py migrate myapp 0001 --fake Server 3: pull from VCS (To get South files) Server 3: ./manage.py migrate myapp 0001 --fake Repeat these steps for all apps. Question 1: Is the ./manage.py migrate myapp 0001 --fake step required on Servers 2 and 3? Since I will be running the migrations on Server 1 and all three servers are using the same database, it seems like it should not be required but I am not 100% sure. Question 2: If ./manage.py migrate myapp 0001 --fake is required on Servers 2 and 3, will I need to run the command on Servers 2 and 3 every time I do a database migration? As always, thanks so much for your help.
