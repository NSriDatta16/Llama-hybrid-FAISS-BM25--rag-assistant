Fluent Nhibernate many-to-many where table has multiple columns

I am trying to to map a many to many relationship using Fluent NHibernate. I have a table User and a second table Organization. The association table is UserOrganization which contains the UserId and OrganizationId. The UserOrganization table also contains a few other fields (YearBegan, YearEnd). How would I go ahead and map those using fluent mapping. Thanks
