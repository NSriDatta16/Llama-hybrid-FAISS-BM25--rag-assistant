Nested ANOVAs in R vs Averaging Data Points

I am working on a problem involving subject workload in different conditions. During my experiment each subject only experiences 1 condition (out of 3 possible conditions). They complete 7 trials and each trial has a workload measure assosiated with it. I have 10 subjects per condition (30 subjects total, 210 trials total). I originally was planning on doing a nested ANOVA, where condition is fixed and subject ID is nested within condition. When doing this in R I get the following result: The values on condition are very significant. However, if I take each subject and average their workload score (so that I now have 10 data points per condition, 1 per subject) and run a 1 factor ANOVA I get the following result: This is not significant. It seems weird that there is this big of a difference in the p-values. I dug into the R code and it seems like the nested anova is calculating the F value for condition as condition MSE/ residual MSE , when it should be condition MSE/ subject in Condition MSE [based on https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/ppc/section2/ppc233.htm]. If I do the latter, it gives me the exact same result as the subject average ANOVA results. I have two questions from this. If the subject average and nesting give the same ANOVA results, what is the benefit of nesting? Which is the correct method to calculate the nested ANOVA F value, the one in R or the one from NIST?
