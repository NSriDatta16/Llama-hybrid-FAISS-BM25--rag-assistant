This was a part of my master thesis. I have researched and mentioned previous publications on the use of sine function as activation and as the basis function. In addition, I have designed several different versions of the sine function and used them as the basis function in the artificial neural networks as a replacement for the linear function. It was last year. You can find the paper that represents the "use of sine" part of my thesis in the link: CSIMQ I mentioned in the paper, but you can also search for Fourier Neural Networks for this subject. The artificial neural networks that use sine function as a basis are named like that mostly. In addition, I have shared several articles in Medium regarding this subject that can help you.
