I agree with Dikran's answer and I would like to add a couple of observations to it that might be constructive/relevant. From an engineering perspective, Active learning within machine learning has an analog within engineering, which is "sequential design of experiments". Both fields strive to sequentially suggest additional training locations that will best maximize information gain about the statistical model's parameters. In fact, Mackay's work in 1992 was inspired by ideas from optimal experimental design. So, basically one should have a basic understanding about the theory of optimal experimental design to address such problem. A nice and broader presentation on how to project ideas from experimental design to machine learning, in order to suggest the "optimal" training examples, can be found in a later paper by David Cohn in 1996, that extended the earlier work of Mackay: David A. Cohn, Zoubin Ghahramani and Michael Jordan, "Active Learning with Statistical Models," Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 4, 1996, 129-145.
