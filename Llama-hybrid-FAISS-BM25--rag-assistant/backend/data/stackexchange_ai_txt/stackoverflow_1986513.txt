How to export a project in Visual Studio Team System

How can I export an entire Visual Studio project? I want to get a non-source-controlled copy on my local hard drive. I come from a SVN background and I'm just getting into TFS... In Tortoise SVN, I would use the export all command for this -- I would right-click the project directory and drag it to another directory and choose "Export all".
