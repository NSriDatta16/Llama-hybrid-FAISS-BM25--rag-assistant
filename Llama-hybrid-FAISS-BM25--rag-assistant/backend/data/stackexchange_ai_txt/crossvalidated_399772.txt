AIC, BIC values keep changing with lag.max in VAR model

I'm using a VARselect function from vars package in R to select order for my model. My data set has 2 time series with 21 data points. When I give lag.max = 10 , the function select lag 5 model for AIC HQ FPE criteria. When I give lag.max =15 , the function suggests lag 3 models. $criteria method shows that the AIC, FPE, HQ values keep changing for different lag.max with many values reaching -infinity for lag.max = 15 . Aren't AIC, HQ, FPE values supposed to be constant with respect to lag.max for smaller orders like 2? Is this something related to degrees of freedom? How to select a model in this scenario?
