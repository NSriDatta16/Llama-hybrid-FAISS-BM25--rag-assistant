Here is a solution inspired by Ch. 11.3, the section on "Texas Housing Data", in Hadley Wickham's Book on ggplot2 . Here I fit a linear model to each time series , take the residuals (which are centered around mean 0), and draw a summary line in a different color. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) #works with dplyr version 0.4.3.9000 from Github (hadley/dplyr@4f2d7f8), or higher df1 % group_by(Var) %>% do(mutate(.,resid = resid(lm(Val ~ Year, data=., na.action = na.exclude)))) %>% ggplot(aes(Year, resid)) + labs(y=paste0("Val "), x="Year") + geom_line(aes(group = Var), alpha = 1/5) + geom_line(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean", colour = "red")
