Is there a way to tell jquery to copy part of the dom tree and use it as fragment to insert? Yes: clone . (You don't even really need jQuery for it; cloneNode is part of the DOM API.) If you have any id values in what you clone, you'll need to iterate over the result changing them, of course, since id s have to be unique. But it's perfect for things like table rows and the like. On page load, you can grab one of the real ones, clone it (without attaching it to the document), cleanse it of anything you don't need, and then just keep cloning that model. Helps keep your JavaScript somewhat decoupled from your markup. Example: HTML: I'm a row in the table JavaScript: jQuery(function($) { var counter = 10, rowModel; // Get the row model, clone it, remove the // content we'll replace anyway. rowModel = $("tr:first").clone(); rowModel.find("td:first").empty(); // Do our first tick tick(); // Use the model to append to the table function tick() { var clone = rowModel.clone(); clone.find("td:first").html("Added at " + new Date()); $("tbody:first").append(clone); // Again? if (--counter > 0) { setTimeout(tick, 500); } } }); Live copy Obviously that's a quick-and-dirty, but you get the idea. If you use data-xyz attributes (allowed in HTML5), name s, class es, etc., you can avoid tying your code too closely to your structure.
