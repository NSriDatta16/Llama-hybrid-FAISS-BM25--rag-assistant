What test to use to determine if someone is actually answering on a questionnaire vs. responding randomly

I am new at using statistical tests and here is a very easy question but I cannot find the answer online. I am going to send out a survey and my professor told me that I should ask the same question three times but then rewrite it somewhat differently in order to test whether people filled in the survey with attention instead of just clicking the dots as fast as possible. There is a test which you can use in order to see if the three answers regarding the same variable are somewhat the same. What is the name of this test?
