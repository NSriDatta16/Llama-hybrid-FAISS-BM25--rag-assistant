When to use deep learning for java as opposed to python

I have been asked to explore options to build deep learning based applications using java, so i happend to browse a website called dl4j ( https://deeplearning4j.org ) which has got implemantations of different neural networks starting from MLP to RNN/LSTM. But I couldn't understand the rationale of using dl4j over python based implemenation. So, could someone please clarify on following items please. ETL Data pre-processing Making use of pre-trained models / transfer learning Distributed computing Processing large voulme of data (images,time series data,sensor data..etc) Production implementation (batch or real time / online) Post production training (bacth or real time / online) Mobile app development IoT edge device computing
