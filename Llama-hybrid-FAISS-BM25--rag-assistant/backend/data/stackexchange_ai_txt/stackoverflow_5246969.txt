string literal uniqueness requirements

I've always understood that the storage of string literals is implementation defined, so the compiler is free to roll up multiple literals such that, given static const char* foo = "blah"; static const char* bar = "blah"; foo and bar can point to the same memory. However, I can't figure out if thats also true when: static const char foo[] = "blah"; static const char bar[] = "blah";
