How do you use an attr_accessor in a select form?

I am trying to capture the identity of a gallery so that I can create a form based around that particular gallery. So I put together a select form, and threw an attr_accessor in my controller. But its failing from all sorts of directions, and I figure its a problem with my syntax. Any whiz's know this? model attr_accessor :existing_gal controller def new @gallery = Gallery.new @galleries = @organization.galleries end view - form_for @gallery do |f| = select @gallery, @existing_gal, options_for_select(@galleries.collect { |g| g.name }), {}, :class => "gallery_title" = link_to 'add photos', new_photos_organization_media_gallery_url(@organization.id, @existing_gal.id), :class => 'button add_photos_btn'
