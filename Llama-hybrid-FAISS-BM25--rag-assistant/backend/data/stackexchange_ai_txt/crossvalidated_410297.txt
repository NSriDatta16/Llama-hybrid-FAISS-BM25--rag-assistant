Multi-arm extension to Simon's single-arm two-stage design?

For adaptive phase II clinical trials with binary endpoint, the Simon's two stage design is well-known (Simon 1989) and easy to implement. However, I was wondering, whether there are multi-arm two-stage extensions to this design and if there exist any implementations in statistical software packages (preferably in R)? I have found the paper by Logan (2005 , link ) on optimal two-stage randomized phase II clinical trials, which sounds promising but is a bit too concise to be honest. Does anyone happen to know additional literature or software packages? Many thanks!
