I did similar thing with cobertura and jboss. You should just 'instrument' all necessary classes, after that it doesn't matter how many modules you have deployed. Datafile will be somewhere around the server, perhaps in the 'bin' directory. edit Here they have section about web applications. Can't help you with emma, though. http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/faq.html
