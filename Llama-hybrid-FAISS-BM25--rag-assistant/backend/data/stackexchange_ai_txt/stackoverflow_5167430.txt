The cache can be used directly as a key/value store, https://web.archive.org/web/20040328220156/http://www.nicksays.co.uk/2010/07/developers-guide-magento-cache/ (Thanks to B00MER for pointing this out ) Blocks already have some caching functionality built in, you just need to provide the key . Collections don't have the same trick but MySQL does have it's own query cache and may already be active. Block caching is preferred since your collection will often end up as rendered HTML anyway. Edit: Collections can be cached and like blocks need a cache key. I've not done it before but presumably it works exactly the same. (It has been asked before but not answered)
