Not only is there nothing for side-effect verification - there's nothing even to verify that a type is immutable, which is a smaller step along the same route IMO. I don't believe there's anything coming down the pipe in C# 4.0 (although I could easily be wrong). I really hope that immutability makes an impact in C# 5.0; certainly Eric Lippert has blogged quite a bit about it, and folks at MS have been thinking about parallelism a fair amount. Sorry it's not a more encouraging picture. Edit: Judah's answer is considerably brighter... would framework support be good enough for you? :) (I wouldn't be entirely surprised if some aspects of Code Contracts weren't ready for .NET 4.0, mind you - if perhaps they kept the initial release relatively small and boosted it later.)
