It is perfectly possible for Oracle to sort a query by a column which is not included in the selection: SQL> select ename from emp 2 order by empno 3 / ENAME ---------- CLARKE VAN WIJK PADFIELD ROBERTSON BILLINGTON SPENCER BOEHMER RIGBY SCHNEIDER CAVE KULASH HALL GASPAROTTO KISHORE 14 rows selected. SQL> But as your ORDER BY clause looks a bit peculiar - order by ref.foo.name - perhaps I am missing some subtlety? Edit Vincent pointed out the subtlety I was missing - the use of DISTINCT . SQL> select distinct ename from emp 2 order by empno 3 / order by empno * ERROR at line 2: ORA-01791: not a SELECTed expression SQL> The need to use DISTINCT is often indicative of a design flaw, either a missing element in the WHERE clause or an insufficiently normalised data model. Although this does not help the questioner who probably just needs to get a workaround.
