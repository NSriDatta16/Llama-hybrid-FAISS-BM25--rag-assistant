Rails help creating a delayed_job from a rake file

How do I create a delayed job from a rake file. How should I move it into a controller and create a delayed_job that runs the task every 15 minutes. Here is an example how my rake file: namespace :reklamer do task :runall => [:iqmedier, :euroads, :mikkelsen] do # This will run after all those tasks have run end task :iqmedier => :environment do require 'Mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new agent.get("http://www.iqmedier.dk") end task :euroads => :environment do require 'Mechanize' require 'pp' agent = Mechanize.new { |agent| end task :mikkelsen => :environment do require 'Mechanize' agent = Mechanize.new agent.get("http://affilate.mikkelsenmedia.dk/partnersystem/mylogins.php") end end What should I change to be a delayed job (https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job)?
