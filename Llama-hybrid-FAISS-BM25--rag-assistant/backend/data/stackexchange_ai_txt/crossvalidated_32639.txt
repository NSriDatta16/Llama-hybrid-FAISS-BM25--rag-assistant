There is no reason to use any particular prior in a Bayesian analysis. Conjugate priors are chosen out of convenience so that it is easy to express the posterior distribution in a simple form as a member of the same family as the prior. With the introduction of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods investigators use whatever priors they find to be realistic for the model parameters. Now for an introductory course it may be simpler to get the concepts across when it is easy to compute the posterior distribution. Simple priors will not always lead to nice posterior distributions but with conjugate priors you are safe. That is probably why it was done that way.
