How to put a DevExpress extended component (RibbonPageGroup) on the toolbox for WinForms

I have extended a DevExpress component (not a control), a RibbonPageGroup, to be used around my application. I like to see it in the toolbox in the VS2010 designer but "it won't appear" here. I assume it has to do with the inheritance hierarchy of the extended component. It doesn't derive from control. Am I going the wrong way by extending a Type that itself extends Component. Or can I make it possible to appear on the toolbox and drag and drop it on RibbonControls. Any answer would be appreciated. Tia, Joep.
