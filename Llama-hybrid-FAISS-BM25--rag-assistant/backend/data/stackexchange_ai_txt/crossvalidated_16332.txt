Logistic regression linear hyperplane

I'm performing logistic regression for binary classification in SAS and it outputs all of the coefficients to the logit model. I was wondering how you would take those coefficients and use them to convert the model into a linear hyperplane in the original space (i.e., hyperplane that splits the space into two classes, positive and negative).
