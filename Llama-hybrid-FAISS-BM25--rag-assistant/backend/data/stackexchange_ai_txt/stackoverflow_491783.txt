You have to define average more accurately. For the specific case of two angles, I can think of two different scenarios: The "true" average, i.e. (a + b) / 2 % 360. The angle that points "between" the two others while staying in the same semicircle, e.g. for 355 and 5, this would be 0, not 180. To do this, you need to check if the difference between the two angles is larger than 180 or not. If so, increment the smaller angle by 360 before using the above formula. I don't see how the second alternative can be generalized for the case of more than two angles, though.
