Isn't it just your webbrowser or proxy which is aggressively caching the webpages? Create a Filter which does the following in doFilter() method to instruct the client to not cache the HTTP response: HttpServletResponse hsr = (HttpServletResponse) response; hsr.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. hsr.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. hsr.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. chain.doFilter(request, response); and map it in web.xml like follows: cacheFilter com.example.CacheFilter cacheFilter facesServlet assuming that you've mapped the FacesServlet instance on of facesServlet .
