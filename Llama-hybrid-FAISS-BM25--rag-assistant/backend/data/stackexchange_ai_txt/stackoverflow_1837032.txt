This is a classification problem, not really data mining. The general approach is to extract features from each data instance and let the classification algorithm learn a model from the features and the outcome (which for you is 0 or 1). Presumably each of your 30 questions would be its own feature. There are many classification techniques you can use. Support vector machines is popular as is maximum entropy. I haven't used the Java Machine Learning library, but at a glance I don't see either of these. The OpenNLP project has a maximum entropy implementation. LibSVM has a support vector machine implementation. You'll almost certainly have to modify your data to something that the library can understand. Good luck! Update: I agree with the other commenter that Russel and Norvig is a great AI book which discusses some of this. Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" discusses classification issues in depth if you're interested in the down and dirty details.
