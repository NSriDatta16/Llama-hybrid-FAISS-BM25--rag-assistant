Your dataProvider should have objects of some sort. In theory they could be instance of a Canvas, but that would be highly unusual to use a visual component as the dataProvider. What you want to do is read up on itemRenderers. an itemRenderer is a component that will be used to renderer each instance of your dataProvider. Try something like this: In short I Defined the dataProvider in script with generic objects. And I defined an itemRenderer in-line. Something like this should at least have something show up. I'm not sure if a Canvas can be draggable, as it doesn't usually have anything to click on to start the drag. You may want to consider a TitleWindow. I wrote the code in browser, so standard disclaimers apply.
