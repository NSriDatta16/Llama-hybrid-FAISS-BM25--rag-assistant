Should forecasts from a neural network regression model be constant?

Quick question - I have built an LSTM RNN model for some data I am trying to forecast. I've noticed that if I feed my model the same data (after training in order to get a forecast) over and over it generates a different prediction each time. In my head, it SEEMS reasonable that this would happen - I'm not training the model so every time I feed it the data point it hasn't "seen" the data before, and will generate a new (and likely different) prediction each time. However, I am wondering why. Intuition usually isn't enough for me, and it also seems that if you're traing an LSTM RNN for regression, given a y the regression equation should give you the SAME result, not a different one each time. Is there a reason I am noticing this behavior? Could someone link me to some articles or show me why I would be noticing this - perhaps mathematically? For reference, I am using Tensorflow to generate the model. Since I am still pretty new to the Tensorflow API, I have some doubt due to the different predictions given the same data, and this would go a long way in clearing up my confusion. Thank you!
