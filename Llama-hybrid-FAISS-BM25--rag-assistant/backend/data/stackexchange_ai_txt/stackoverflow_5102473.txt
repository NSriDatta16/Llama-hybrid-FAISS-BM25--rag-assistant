Including datanodes in html by hiding : good idea?

I would like to add data to an html page that will only be showed dynamically (by means of jquery). The data is xml (so in fact a part of the html dom). Now I do it by hiding it by css ( .data { display:none; } ) with html like : Section 1 A visible paragraph some data more data The data is not shown and can be easily reached by jquery. While this seems to work fine, I want to know now, early in the process, if this way of working has some drawbacks I'm not thinking of now... UPDATE : Of course it's about non-html tags also. But I could use just as easily : but even then, the question remains. Thanks for all input!
