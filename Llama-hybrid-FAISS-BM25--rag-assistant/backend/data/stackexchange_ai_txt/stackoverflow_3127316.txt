To get you started, you should read the official documentation about History . It describes the mechanism that allows passing parameters via the url fragment identifier (www.example.com/index.html #test=true ) and how it's handled in GWT. The documentation contains examples how to capture and trigger the changes to the url fragment. You might also be interested with MVP - the Model-View-Presenter pattern that is highly recommended for complex GWT apps. You'll find many questions on SO about it, the official docs also have to parts about it ( part 1 , part 2 ). For a quick (ok, the video is hour long, but very informative) introduction you should watch the presentation by Ray Ryan from Google IO 2009 that started the whole MVP + GWT love ;)
