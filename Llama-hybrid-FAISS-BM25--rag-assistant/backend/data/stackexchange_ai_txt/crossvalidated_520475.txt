How do I go about estimating the interaction coefficient in logistic regression for an a priori power analysis?

I am running an a priori power analysis for a mixed effect logistic regression using simulation. In order to do this I need to have an estimate of the effect size I expect. I have a few control variables, and two binary variables of interest along with their interaction. I can come up with estimates for everything using previous literature except for the interaction. That is the novelty of the study. How would I go about making a reasonable guess for that interaction coefficient? I know the pattern I expect (for there to be a larger effect of A in B1 vs B2). But I have no intuitive sense for how to come up with the interaction coefficient. For the main effects I can at least de log the odds ratio to have some intuition. But I'm totally lost for interaction. Any suggestions?
