From developper to data scientist

I code a lot for web, games and some basic ML scripts. Now I would like to learn about data science. This post is a good starting point but I would like some readings. I would like advices on books for a beginner (maths, tools, whatever). I've found these ones from O'Reilly : Machine Learning for Hackers, By Drew Conway, John Myles White Agile Data Science, By Russell Jurney R Cookbook, By Paul Teetor (Sorry, my reputation is too low to let me post more than 1 link haha) Do you recommand these readings ? Are there other must-reading books ? Thanks.
