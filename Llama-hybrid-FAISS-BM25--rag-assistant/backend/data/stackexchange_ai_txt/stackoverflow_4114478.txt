the proper way is to create a library. in iOS, you're restricted to static libraries, but dynamic libraries and frameworks are other common possibilities (for example, if you're targeting OS X). to configure this (using libStatic as a name for the static library, and App as the app in this example): 1) create the libStatic project, and configure it to compile the files you choose 2) add libStatic.xcodeproj to the App.xcodeproj. this adds the project symbols, indexes and references to the App project. (the remaining steps all take place in App.xcodeproj) 3) double click the target which depends on liStatic 4) navigate to General tab 5) click '+' under the dependencies list, and add the libStatic target to the dependencies. it is important that you create this association/dependency so the libStatic target will be kept up to date as you develop in App (it will be built before App). 6) navigate to the libStatic project reference in the groups & files tree. if necessary, click (expand) the disclosure triangle to view the products of libStatic. 7) drag the appropriate product from the libStatic project reference into the App target's link stage. 8) clean, build, run
