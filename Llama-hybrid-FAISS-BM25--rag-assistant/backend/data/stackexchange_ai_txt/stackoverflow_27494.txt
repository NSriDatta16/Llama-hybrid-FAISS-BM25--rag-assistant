Rules: Wherever possible, use a smart pointer . Boost has some good ones . If you can't use a smart pointer, null out your pointer after deleting it . Never work anywhere that won't let you use rule 1. If someone disallows rule 1, remember that if you grab someone else's code, change the variable names and delete the copyright notices, no-one will ever notice. Unless it's a school project, where they actually check for that kind of shenanigans with quite sophisticated tools. See also, this question .
