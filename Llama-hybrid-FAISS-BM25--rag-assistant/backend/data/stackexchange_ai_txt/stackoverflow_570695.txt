Make any and all DDL changes to the DB schema script based and store then in your source code control. Especially changes your DBA makes - I would suggest getting your base schema and stored procs examined by a db developer and the DBA prior to checking them into your source code control (props to HLGEM for saying it). Moves into prod should be scripted and approved prior to application (ie, if the DBA finds stuff that needs to be changed, have the DBA open a defect and handle via that process). Lock all such DDL changes away from your developers. The smart guys writing Java and C# should be communicating with your team db "specialist" on how to best accomplish the design goals and needs on the db side. Limit production tweaks to those highly situation dependent cases, for example, many IT shops have a DBA who will define the physical storage setup based on db deployment scripts your app supplies and this is usually Ok. A wizard with your app to help less experienced people along with a top 10 list of recommendations for setup and basic tuning will go a long way.
