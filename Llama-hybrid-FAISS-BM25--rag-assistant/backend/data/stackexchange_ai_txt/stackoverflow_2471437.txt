There are large amounts of books written to cover this topic ... so this won't be an exhaustive answer, but this will give you the necessary information needed to begin. And it is very much simplified. ADO.NET is a framework that allows you to manage, in memory, the data retrieved from the database (permanent storage) and connect it to display objects (textboxes, etc). Access databases have all the "layers" contained in it (the form, query, tables) and you don't have to mess too much with the activities to retrieve the information and display them. However, now that you have graduated to a Visual Studio project, you need to manage each of the layers. Create your database Populate it with data Create stored procedures (in the database), or write SQL statements (in the application) to retrieve, insert, delete, update data by using Command objects Install a data provider (for SQLite, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle) Build the User Interface In the interface Events, create an instance of the a ADO.NET provider Connection, Adapter, and Command/Table objects. Using the Command objects (and DataReaders), retrieve data using SELECT statements; and subsequently using Update, Insert, Delete statements to put data back. Update the interface text boxes by referencing the Reader fields. In parts 3-7 you will do most of your work (the stuff you are asking about); you will be using ADO.net to connect to the data source, using a data provider (SQLite) + connection string (with Catalog name, Username, Password, Connection type). Then, use the objects, like Connections (to connect), Adapters (to build holding areas), and DataTables (tables in memory) to do the data retrieval and actions that get and push the data to/from the database (static permanent data).
