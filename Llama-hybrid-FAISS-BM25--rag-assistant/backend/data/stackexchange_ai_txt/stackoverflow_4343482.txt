Uploading to iTunesConnect with Organiser crashes

I've been trying to re-upload a previously uploaded app (it originally failed submission), but both the 'Validate' and the 'Submit' button in Organiser crash Organiser itself before finishing. This has been happening for about three days now, and I haven't heard a word back from the iTunesConnect helpdesk. I am running the lastest Xcode 3.2.5 with iOS 4.2.1, and downloaded and installed the latest Application Tools as instructed. Everything installed fine. I'm getting a: with: Process: Xcode [32144] Path: /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode Identifier: com.apple.Xcode Version: 3.2.5 (1760) Build Info: DevToolsIDE-17600000~5 Code Type: X86-64 (Native) Parent Process: launchd [348] Date/Time: 2010-12-03 17:29:50.499 +1000 OS Version: Mac OS X 10.6.5 (10H574) Report Version: 6 Interval Since Last Report: 4332 sec Crashes Since Last Report: 2 Per-App Interval Since Last Report: 1215 sec Per-App Crashes Since Last Report: 2 Exception Type: EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT) Exception Codes: 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000 Crashed Thread: 7 Dispatch queue: com.apple.root.default-priority Application Specific Information: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[ITunesSoftwareApplicationDescription applicationType]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x200c57ae0' *** Call stack at first throw: ( 0 CoreFoundation 0x00007fff840087b4 __exceptionPreprocess + 180 1 libobjc.A.dylib 0x00007fff886ea0f3 objc_exception_throw + 45 2 CoreFoundation 0x00007fff84062110 +[NSObject(NSObject) doesNotRecognizeSelector:] + 0 3 CoreFoundation 0x00007fff83fda91f ___forwarding___ + 751 I know that this isn't the place to debug Apple apps - but someone must have had this happen and figured out how to get past it? I'm getting no joy from apple :( thanks
