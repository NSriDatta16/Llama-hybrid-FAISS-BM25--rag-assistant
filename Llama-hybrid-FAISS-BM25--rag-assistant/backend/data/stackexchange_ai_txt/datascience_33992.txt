I have already dealt with RNN and LSTM codes and finally I found tow solutons to achieve better result for accuracy measure which are as follows: at first I change the activation function, optimizers and learning rate but it is worth noting that activation function has the most impact and the second trick which I have used is to removing stop words, now the code works fine. I hope it is useful.
