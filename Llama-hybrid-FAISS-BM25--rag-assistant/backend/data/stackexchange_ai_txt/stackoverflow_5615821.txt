Joe, With OAuth 1.0, it's important to keep in mind which pieces are happening "server-to-server" and which pieces involve the browser ("user agent"). The "point" of OAuth, if you like, is to get a server-side access token and secret to the consumer's back-end server, without ever having the secret pass through the browser. With this in mind: when a user authorizes a request token, the "callback" happens through the user-agent, via HTTP redirection. In other words, any data (i.e. a verifier code and the request token but NOT the request token SECRET ) in the callback is "seen" by the browser. This is why an access token (and secret) can't be parameters of the callback step: these need to be communicated directly from server-to-server, not via the browser.
