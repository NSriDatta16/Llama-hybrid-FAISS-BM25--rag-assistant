Failure Rate of Contraception over n years

According to multiple sources , the probability that, after one year of typical use, a woman who uses male condoms will get pregnant is $18\%$. Presumably, this assumes that the woman will have sex at an average frequency, but I found it hard to find information about this. What's surprising is that I calculated the probability of unintended pregnancy over four years using male condoms to be very close to $55\%$. I calculated this by noting that, in order not to be pregnant after four years, contraception has to be successful $4$ times. In other words, the probability of successful contraception over four years is $(1 - .18)^4 = .4521$. Therefore, the probability of contraception failing and producing a pregnancy sometime during those four years is $54.79\%$. Is this technique sound?
