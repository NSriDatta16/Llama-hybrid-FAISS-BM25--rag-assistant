Java-accessible web service for translation?

I now have a running Java program which only lacks of the final step,that is: suppose I have a String1 ="Obama" is there any online translation API that I could use to get the corresponding Chinese word back,and put it in another String2="奥巴马“. I've tried BabelFish,but that doesn't seem to provide any service for Java program. Thanks guys,really need your help here to find some translation API for me that I could use in my Java program.
