As you have correctly observed, both in meta-analysis and beyond, a frequentist mixed model does something similar to a Bayesian approach. Namely, it assumes a parameter not to have a fixed value, but rather to have been randomly drawn from some probability distribution (in practice: almost always a normal distribution with mean $0$ and unknown variance). However, this is not the same as a Bayesian approach, which has no 'fixed effects'. In a fully Bayesian approach, every parameter has some underlying probability distribution. The Bayesian equivalent of a frequentist mixed model would be a Bayesian hierarchical model .
