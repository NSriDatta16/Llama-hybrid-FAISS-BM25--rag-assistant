My boss still speaks of the times when they wrote modular code (C language), and complains about how crappy the code is nowadays! It is said that programmers can write assembly in any framework. There is always a strategy to overcome code organisation. The basic problem is with guys who treat java script as a toy and never try to learn it. In my case, I write js files on a UI theme or application screen basis, with a proper init_screen(). Using proper id naming convention, I make sure that there are no name space conflicts at the root element level. In the unobstrusive window.load(), I tie the things up based on the top level id. I strictly use java script closures and patterns to hide all private methods. After doing this, never faced a problem of conflicting properties/function definitions/variable definitions. However, when working with a team it is often difficult to enforce the same rigour.
