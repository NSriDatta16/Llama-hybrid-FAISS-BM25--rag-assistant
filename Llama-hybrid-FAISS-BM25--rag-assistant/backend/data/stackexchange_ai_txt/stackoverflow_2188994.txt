Are there code coverage tools that can tell me about just the code that I wrote during my last sprint?

I'm looking for a tool that can give me more meaningful metrics about code coverage for my team. For instance, two things I'd like to see: How much code coverage did we have as a team for the code written during our last sprint? How much code coverage did new code get broken down by developer? Has anyone done anything like this before? What tools are available? Specifically, I'm working in Java and am interested in either free or commercial solutions.
