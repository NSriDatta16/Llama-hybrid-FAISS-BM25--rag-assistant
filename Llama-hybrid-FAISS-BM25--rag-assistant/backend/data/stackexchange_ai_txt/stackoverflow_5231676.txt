The most common issue with storing an object as a serialized stream is that it is difficult to search the properties of the object once it is stored, whereas if each property of the object is explicitly stored in its own strongly typed column, it can be indexed for searches, and you get the integrity benefit of strongly typed storage. However, At least if the object is XmlSerialized into an XML column in SQL, you can use technologies such as xquery and OPENXML to ease your searches.
