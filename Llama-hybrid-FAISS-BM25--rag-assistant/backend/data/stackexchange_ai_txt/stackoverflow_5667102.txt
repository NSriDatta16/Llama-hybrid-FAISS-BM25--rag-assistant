I work for a company in the license management business (Agilis Software), where these issues have already been met and dealt with in the Orion License Manager (products from other companies such as Flexera or Safenet may also do so). Your requirements can readily be met by a software-only system (no dongles required), but for it to be effective and transparent to your legitimate users you do need to pay some attention to the details and think about the possible deployment scenarios. First of all, while it is widely used I don't recommend the MAC address as the locking parameter. Many OSs allow the administrator to specify the MAC address, making this an insecure approach. It is better to use other hardware and software parameters, but the ones available will depend on the operating system and hardware platform. Obviously using more than just one parameter increases security, but then you probably want to provide some resiliency when people make minor changes to their system. Virtual systems do preclude the use of these hardware parameters for locking, but each virtual session does still have invariant parameters you can use. For further security you can require each such session to periodically revalidate its license against the server (we call this a 'leased license'). Another issue you would need to think about is how users can reclaim and relocate a license if one of the workstations crashes. If your customers are like many of the end-users Agilis's ISV customers sell to, you should also consider how the company can obtain their license if they don't have an Internet connection (perhaps they have an isolated internal network, or you can't get past their firewall). How will your on-site server obtain its license, and how can you be sure the customer doesn't replicate your server, so doubling their license entitlement? (Needless to say, Agilis's systems do of course include solutions to these and other challenges). Hope this helps, Dominic
