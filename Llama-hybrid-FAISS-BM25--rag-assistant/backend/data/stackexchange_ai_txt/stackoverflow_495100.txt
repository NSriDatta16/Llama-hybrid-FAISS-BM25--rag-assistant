Moodle / Joomla / JFusion - best development platform for e-learning, communication and information portal?

I've been asked to develop an information and e-learning website with an emphasis on community aspects that will also encompass a lot of other areas. There is a tight budget to this project, so I'm looking to use off the shelf products where possible - but I need to make sure I pick the best possible platform to begin with. I am a php developer with extensive database knowledge, so I'm envisioning a degree of active development. The main requirements are: User Contribution / Community Building General Content E-learning Forums Blogs Articles eCommerce Listings Directory Wikis Future areas that have been discussed by the organisation include social networking, so there is a definite emphasis on the community and user contributory aspects. I know that Moodle is regarded as a leader when it comes to developing e-learning solutions, but I'm fearful it will fall short in the many other areas that the site requires (I'm aware there are plugins / modules available for Moodle, but I'm not sure if generally there is enough development in these areas). A solution which looks promising to me is JFusion , which is an open-source bridge to combine several different systems (in terms of structure and user authentication) - this is built around Joomla, but supports Moodle and several forum software products, along with Magento eCommerce. This would also open up the massive world of Joomla extensions, which I think would cover all the requirements above. So, to summarise, my question is - should I try to stick within the confines of Moodle, or should I look to other solutions to cover all angles? I'd be very interested to hear from developers who've used both platforms - or perhaps know of more suitable platforms on which to base things.
