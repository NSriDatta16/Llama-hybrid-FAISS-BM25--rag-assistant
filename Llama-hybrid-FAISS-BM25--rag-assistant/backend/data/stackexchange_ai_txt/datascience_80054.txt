Is it possible to forecast the evolution of cars?

Let's say for example that I have a dataset about the cars that a company (e.g. Toyota) produced, over the course of the years 1990 - 2016. Considering that I have already completed the feature engineering step, is there an algorithm that can output predictions on what attributes future Toyota cars will have? What I mean is, can we produce output that will have the same features/attributes as the input data-points? simple example: For input X0-Xn = [EngineType, #OfWheels, #OfDoors, hasRadio, hasGPS, ProductionYear] --> Produce output Y = [EngineType, #OfWheels, #OfDoors, hasRadio, hasGPS, ProductionYear]
