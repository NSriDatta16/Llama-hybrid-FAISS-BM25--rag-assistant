How can I add a VS 2010 .Net 4.0 build agent to TFS 2008

My company has two development teams using TFS 2008. My team would like to migrate our .Net 3.5 app to the .Net 4.0 framework, but the company is not ready to upgrade TFS to TFS 2010. Can we still use TFS 2008's team build system but with a Visual Studio 2010 solution/project structure that targets the .Net 4.0 framework? I am thinking we would need to add a new build agent to TFS 2008 that would have VS 2010 installed. But I am not finding any information on how to do this. Is this possible? Are there any articles explaining how to do this?
