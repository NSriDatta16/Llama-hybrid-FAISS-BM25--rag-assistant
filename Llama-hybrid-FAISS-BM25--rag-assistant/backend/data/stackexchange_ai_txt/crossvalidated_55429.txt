There are couple of problems with your code: dshw() works on time series with multiple seasonal periods. You have a non-seasonal time series. Unlike Arima() , dshw() returns forecasts. You don't need to call the forecast function to obtain the forecasts. You can do what you want by specifying the parameters in each subsequent call to dshw() : # Fit the model to the training data assuming periods 3 and 12 fit I can make this easier by adding a model argument to dshw() as with Arima() and ets() . Something for the next version of the forecast package.
