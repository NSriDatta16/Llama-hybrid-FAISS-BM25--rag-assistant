There are at least 2 ways of checking browser version. One is to use User-Agent header from HTTP request: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:8765 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) ... But such request can be changed by some proxy, or by user (this way Opera can easily imitate MS IE etc). Other way is to use JavaScript navigator properties. It is described in: Using the navigator object to detect client's browser . I don't know which way was used to detect browser version. If it was from HTTP header then it is easy to change -- you probably have to change browser version detection to JavaScript. If JavaScript failed then probably this install of browser was broken. You can check HTTP headers on the server side (Apache is often configured to show this in logs) or via tunnel like tcpmon . For JavaScript use the code from JavaScript Kit page.
