Rule of Thumb for minimum length of time series for Autocorrection estimation

I had a related question answered here: Rule of Thumb for minimum length of time series for AR(1) estimation However the answer gives rise to a new question. I want to be able to estimate the Auto correlation at lag 1 for different step sizes. While I agree that in theory if the lag 1 auto correlation for step size one is $\phi$ then the lag 1 auto correlation for a step size h should be $\phi^h$. However I want to test this empirically to see if it is in fact the case. From the testing I have done it seems that for smaller step sizes the theoretical relationship holds in the empirical data set, but as the step size gets larger it starts to deviate (and also to oscillate) so I think at least partly what I am seeing is the noise associated with estimating the lag 1 auto correlation on a small time series. Is there a formula or even a rule of thumb that I can use to decide what is an acceptable time series length for a lag 1 auto correlation estimation?
