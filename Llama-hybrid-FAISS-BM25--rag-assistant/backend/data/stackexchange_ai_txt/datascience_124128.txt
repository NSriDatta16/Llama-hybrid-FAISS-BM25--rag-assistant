Bayesian Linear regression for non-gaussian distribution

Which distribution should be considered for non-gaussian distribution while building Bayesian Linear regression. I am trying to build this model using Pymc3 library but since I have just started to learn Bayesian modeling and Pymc3 library so it would be really helpful for me if someone can help and guide me regarding this. Thank you.
