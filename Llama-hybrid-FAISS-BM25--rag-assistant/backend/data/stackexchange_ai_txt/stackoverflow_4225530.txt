Well, in practice it's practically impossible to get 100% coverage for an entire code base. Where you really want 100% is in the core of the application (The libraries and reused components). The rest is very good to test, but if you'll find there are situations that make it quite difficult to test, so don't stress yourself over a few lines of code that are untestable. As far as your specific problem, I wouldn't even be writing unit tests for that sort of thing. What I would write are UI tests using Selenium HQ . It's still fully automated, and runs from within PHPUnit, but it uses one or more browsers. It's really more of an integration or acceptance test than a Unit test, but it works quite well...
