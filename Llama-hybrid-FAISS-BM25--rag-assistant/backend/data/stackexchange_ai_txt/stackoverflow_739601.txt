"Database Management Systems" by Ramakrishnan and Gehrke. http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/ The first part is an intro to data modeling, SQL, etc, but it goes very deep into the design of internals in the second half (including transaction control, locking, logging, storage management, ACID guarantees, and so on). In terms of studying internals, there is educational software called MiniBase, also from Wisconsin, but I'd just start looking at Postgres internals instead. Very clean, does a lot, does a lot right.
