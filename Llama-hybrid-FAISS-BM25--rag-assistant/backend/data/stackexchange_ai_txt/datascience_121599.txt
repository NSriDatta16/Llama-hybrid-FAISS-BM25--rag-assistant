Best classifier for ordinal categorical variables

I'm getting different results between R and Python for a classification problem using ordinal categorical features. I would like to ask you what do you think is the best classification algorithm in Python to use for ordinal categorical data? In R this seems to be some Machine Learning algorithm based on "ctree". In Python, TreeDecisionClassifier, for example, is based on "CART". I didn't find any "ctree" based Machine Learning Algorithm reference for Python. My dataset is survey results. All my features have values from 1 to 5 (bad to good), and the target variable is the NPS which takes values from 1, 2 and 3 (detractor, neutral and promoter). Thank you.
