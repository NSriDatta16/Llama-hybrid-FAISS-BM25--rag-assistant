How can I assign the 'Close on Escape-key press' behavior to all WPF windows within a project?

Is there any straightforward way of telling the whole WPF application to react to Escape key presses by attempting to close the currently focused widow? It is not a great bother to manually setup the command- and input bindings but I wonder if repeating this XAML in all windows is the most elegant approach? Any constructive suggestions welcome!
