Since you listed the stock market as an example, the price of a stock is bounded from below by zero and could be considered to follow a non-normal distribution. You could model the price of a stock as an ARIMA time series and use the central limit theorem to construct a confidence interval for the mean of the process. You could also use the central limit theorem to construct a prediction interval for future observed prices. Pharmaceutical companies use the central limit theorem to construct confidence intervals around a treatment effect and use this inference to obtain approval from regulators so they can sell the treatment for a profit. The central limit theorem is useful in non-normal settings for constructing tolerance limits for population percentiles. Such tolerance limits are needed in manufacturing and quality control settings to ensure the vast majority of products produced meet minimum quality and safety standards. These products can then be sold at a profit.
