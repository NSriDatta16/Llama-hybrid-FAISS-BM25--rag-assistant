I assume you're using structured data (numerical, categorical, nominal, ordinal..): - It's probably due to class imbalance. - If you use Scikit-Learn, you can add class_weight = "balanced" which will automatically weigh classes inversely proportional to their frequency. - Testing this should confirm if it's a class imbalance problem. PS: Francois Chollet (create of Keras) states that traditional algorithms are superior to Deep Learning for structured data. Personally, with structured data, I've never been able to match the performance of XGBoost with Deep Learning.
