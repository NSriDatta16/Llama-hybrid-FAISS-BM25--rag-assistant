Time series analysis of hybrid data with RNN?

I have a time series $x_t\in\mathbb{R}^n$ where $t=1,\dots T$ . For some $t$ , I have also a message which is a piece of text, i.e. sequence of characters of unspecified length. I assume that the messages provide some information about the time series. My goal is to obtain a precise model of $x$ , taking advantage of both past $x$ values and messages. How to do it? What is the best model? I am considering recurrent neural networks in tensorflow. How would you model and train this problem? My thoughts so far (brute force a little bit): to define a RNN with $n$ inputs, primarily for $x$ . I intend to use it for "reading" all the history. That means when a message is received at time $t$ , I split it into $n$ -tuples of characters and I use them as input to the network. All inputs normalized, last $n$ -tuple may be prolonged by blank characters if needed.
