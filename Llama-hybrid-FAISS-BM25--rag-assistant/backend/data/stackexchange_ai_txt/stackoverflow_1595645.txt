jQuery iframeFix on a Sortable

On my CMS I have a list of thumbnails (Sortable). The thumbnails work great and now I'm writing a plug-in to drag-them to a tinyMCE window. As the tinyMCE window has an iFrame it doesn't work that well. jQuery has an option for Draggables called iframeFix that works exactly as I need. However that list must be a Sortables. I've looked quite extensively on Google and found no-one with my requirements. Has anyone here on StackOverflow done it? Apply the iframeFix to a Sortables? If not... I'm on my way to a jQuery plug-in. Thank you in advance!
