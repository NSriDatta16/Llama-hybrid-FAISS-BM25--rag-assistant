if somebody refreshes the page returns back to the main page can anybody give me any solutions This is a feature, not a bug in the browser. You need to change the URL for different pages. Nothing is worse then websites that use any kind of magic either on the client side or the server side which causes a bunch of completely different pages to use the same URL. Why? How the heck am I gonna link to a specific page? What if I like something and want to copy & paste the URL into an IM window? In other words, consider the use cases. What constitutes a "page"? For example, if you have a website for stock quotes--should each stock have a unique URL? Yes. Should you have a unique URL for every variation you can make to the graph (i.e. logarithmic vs linear, etc)? Depends--if you dont, at least provide a "share this" like google maps does so you can have some kind of URL that you can share. That all said, I agree with the suggestion to mess with the #anchor and parse it out. Probably the most elegant solution.
