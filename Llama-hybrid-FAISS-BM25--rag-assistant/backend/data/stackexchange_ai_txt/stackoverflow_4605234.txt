Is there a way to break NSXMLParser on a condition?

I have a simple question about nsxmlparser . This is my snippet - (void) parser: (NSXMLParser *) parser foundCharacters: (NSString *) string{ [...] if ([currentElement isEqualToString:@"openpos"]) { if ([string isEqualToString:@"0"]) { // I WOULD EXIT FROM LOOP HERE! return; } } [...] } why this return doesn't work ? I need to exit from parser method and return back to my class with an error! I need to force an exception? or there is a better way to break parser loop? thanks, alberto
