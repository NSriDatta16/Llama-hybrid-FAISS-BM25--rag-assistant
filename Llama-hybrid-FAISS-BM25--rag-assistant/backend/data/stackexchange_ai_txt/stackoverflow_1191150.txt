Silverlight is a non-standard extension to the web which has historically been about cross-platform effort. AFAIK you will have to use the MS runtime and can't write your own as you can with HTML, CSS and JS (I know there is Moonlight, but that's just reverse-engineered really). Them being cross-platform is the reason that every mobile device and netbook can do HTML, CSS and JS but the coverage for Sliverlight and Flash is very sketchy in this sector.
