@IrishStat's suggestion to use SMAPE is probably the most correct. A log(x+1) transform could also work. It would be useful to know your application. What is the proportion of 0's? I am curious if you have an intermittent time series. Intermittent time series are often modeled with Crostons method or the Poisson distribution, the benchmark forecast being an all-zero forecast. If you are dealing with intermittent time series then it is common to use a distributional error metric. Continuous rank probability score or pinball loss.
