drag and drop programmatically generated UIButtons

I created many uibuttons dynamically via a for loop and added them to the scene. Now I want to add drag and drop capability to each uibutton. How can I accomplish this? Say a game like breaker, you have a paddle. It is the only object which will be dragged and dropped by player so all we need to do is add a uibutton object for the paddle and update its center in touchesBegan and touchesMoved. In my problem, I don't know which button will be clicked. If I attached an action to all the buttons to track which button being click then I won't be able to perform DRAG the first time player click on a button. Maybe there is a better way.
