Not a complete answer, but: highly downscaled images can and usually do look just as bad as upscaled images (but in a different way), because graphics libraries almost exclusively use interpolation methods for resizing, and interpolation methods are limited in terms of how much they can shrink an image before serious information loss (to about 50% for linear methods and down to about 25% for bicubic methods). This is why most platforms have evolved conventions (like hdpi, mdpi etc.) that let you embed images that are best for each screen size.
