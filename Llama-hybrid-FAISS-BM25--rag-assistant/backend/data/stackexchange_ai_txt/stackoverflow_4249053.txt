Bugs: Bugzilla IDE: QtCreator but many people will hate you if you enforce the use of one ide over the other, specially if you have opensource developers. Code Coverage: In order to use gcov for code coverage, your ci environment needs to build the software with appropriate set of flags and execute the code. Also do note that gcov itself does not do any reporting, you need something like lcov to then actually generate the statistics from gcov generated files. NightlyBuilds: TeamCity, but if you have time to invest and you do want flexbility: BuildBot. CodeReview: Review board is quite good.
