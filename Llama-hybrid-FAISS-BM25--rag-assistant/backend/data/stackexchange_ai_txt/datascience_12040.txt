On the lines of what @Simon has already said: Deep learning approaches have been particularly useful in solving problems in vision, speech and language modeling where feature engineering is tricky and takes a lot of effort. For your application that does not seem to be the case since you have well defined features and only feature interactions etc. are required. Given that deep learning models currently need a lot of computing resources and scientist time in coding stuff up I'd suggest opting for a non-deep learning approach. For your problem the effort vs benefit tradeoff does not seem to be in deep learning's favour. DL would be an overkill
