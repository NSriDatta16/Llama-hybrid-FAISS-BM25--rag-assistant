The usual starting place with a categorical dependent variable is logistic regression. Note that ANOVA is the same model as linear regression. But they (as you note) are for continuous dependent variables. There are a huge variety of regression models for other kinds of dependent variables; logistic regression is for dichotomous DVs, multinomial logistic for DVs with more than two unordered categories, ordinal logistic for more than two ordered categories and a lot more.
