A possible approach: Using the CDF of the student- $t$ distribution: $$F(t)=1-\frac{1}{2}I_x(\nu/2,1/2),\quad x \equiv \frac{\nu}{\nu+t^2}$$ The $p$ -value for the hypothesis $H_0:|\mu_1-\mu_2|>y$ assuming equal sample sizes and average standard deviation $\sigma$ is: $$t=\frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma\sqrt{2/N}} $$ $$P(H_0)=2-2F\left(\sqrt{\frac{N}{2}}\frac{y}{\sigma}\right)$$ If one is given a priori values of $y$ and $\sigma$ in terms of percentages of the expected value, one can then calculate $N$ for a given $p$ -value. This answer is incomplete as it does not give $N$ explicitly nor does it give the dependence of $N$ on the power.
