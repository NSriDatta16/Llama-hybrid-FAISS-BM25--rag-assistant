Can you explain the average value column in the DTVehicleValueRange table? Isn't this a calculated value (i.e. no need to persist it)? It looks like you have a many-to-many relationship between Vehicle and DTValueRange , which of course would not be mapped with a join, rather with a HasManyToMany call.
