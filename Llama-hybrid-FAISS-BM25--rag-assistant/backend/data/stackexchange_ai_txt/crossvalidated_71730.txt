You seem a bit confused about the differences between type I and type II errors. First off, a critical value of +/- 2 stdevs means that (for normal data), you will be sending false positive alerts with a 1/20 chance. Isn't that going to be annoying considering that, over a year, you'd expect to get an average of 2.6 incorrect weekly warnings per year when the data are perfectly regular? I'd consider specifying a more conservative false positive error rate. When you take too few observations, your estimate of the variance is not "too high", it's just unstable (unless, you mean to say that you're using the standard error of the mean of the data and not the standard deviation ). "Unstable" means it [the SD estimate] could be too high, it could be too low. Even if the estimated standard deviation (or standard error) were too large, you would fire alerts not often enough (conservative) and not too often (anticonservative). The real question here is whether or not "unusual" in this circumstance means "data are consistent with what the data usually are" or "data are consistent with some pre-identified target value". The latter warrants use of a control chart which is an effective graphical tool for displaying temporal variability and trends in a controlled data process. The former is a time when one can use an ARMA (autoregressive moving average) model to roll forward previously observed data and infer whether present values either are or are not consistent with the historical values. The asymptotic theory of these models easily extend a decision rule about sending alerts based on the normal distributions of model parameters. If certain days are heterogeneous, you will want to turn off your alert system because it makes sense to do so. With small sample sizes, you should consider parametric probability models for website hits. Instead of estimating an independent mean/variance process, you should consider some counting process models like poisson or negative binomial for the mean/variance process. That way, you would need fewer observations to infer whether a specific day was abnormally high/low in hit rate. These, of course, have a lot more assumptions embedded in them.
