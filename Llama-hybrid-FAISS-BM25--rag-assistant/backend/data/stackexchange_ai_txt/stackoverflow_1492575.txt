NHibernate - load sql query to entity

Basically, I need to set a property to the results of a query that uses data from the parent object. With the domain model below, I need to set the C property of EntityB using data from both EntityA and EntityB. Also, I need to set the A property of EntityB to be the actual instance of EntityA that is its parent. Query: Set EntityB.C = (select * from EntityC where SomeProperty = EntityB.SomeProperty and AnotherProperty = EntityB.A.AnotherProperty); SomeProperty and AnotherProperty are not just keys. class EntityA { public IList B { get; set; } } class EntityB { public EntityA A { get; set; } public EntityC C { get; set; } } class EntityC { ... } I need a way to execute code (to run the query and assign to property) for each entity returned. I came close using the onload method of an interceptor, but I am looking for another way. Perhaps using a Result Transformer or a Projection?
