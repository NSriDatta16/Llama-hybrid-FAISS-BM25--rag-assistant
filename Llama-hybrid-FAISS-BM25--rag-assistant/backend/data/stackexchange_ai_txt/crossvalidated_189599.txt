The spacing between the last two extreme values of a tail of a distribution is robust and has been used to measure tail heaviness here . Edit: In other words, yes, two widely spaced adjacent extreme values in either tail are enough to yield a low probability of normality. However, a distribution can be non-normal, as the Q-Q plot below shows The same data plotted on a Student's-t Q-Q plot looks a lot better So, we ask, what is an outlier? One property of outliers is that they tend not to be reducible on any Q-Q plot. For example, the extreme version of the Student's t distribution with one degree of freedom is also called the Cauchy distribution. The Cauchy distribution has "explained" outliers so severe that the mean value is undefined, but the median value is not. To get an average value from a Cauchy distribution one can indeed trim outliers and then calculate a stable "trimmed" mean value which value then better agrees with the median value. What then is an outlier given that extreme values can be produced by a heavy-tailed distributions? Here is a partial answer. If extreme values are trimmed and the resulting distribution only after trimming is a normal distribution and if we have very good reason to expect a normal distribution from other evidence, then the trimmed values were indeed erratic outliers.
