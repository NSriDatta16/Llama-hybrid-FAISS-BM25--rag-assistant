Embedded Views in Drupal

I'm trying to straighten out the front page of my drupal-based website. I want to display a static bit of content at the top (no link the way a sticky node would be) and then a list of the most recent posts underneath. Doing a view of all content with the 'static' node stick is pretty close, although I don't want it to summarize the top node and I don't want the title linked. Embedding a view within the home node is also very close, although it indents all the content and puts a double bottom line at the bottom (one for the bottom of the view, one for the bottom of the page) and the RSS icon shows up at the bottom of the view instead of the bottom/top of the page the way it would if it was a view page.
