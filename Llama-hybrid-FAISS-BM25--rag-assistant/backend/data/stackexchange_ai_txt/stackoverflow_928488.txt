Swing: Problem distinguishing between user-induced and automatic components resizing (Writing a custom LayoutManager)

I'm trying to write an own layout manager . Components must be placed and sized relative to each other. This means: when the user drags or resizes an component, some other components (but not the one altered manually by user) have to be altered. Swing tells the layout manager to layout the components every time when some of them is moved/resized. This is a problem hence the layout manager itself moves/resizes components: It fails, the method layoutContainer(Container parent) is called multiple times. An example of the whole thing (simplified, in fact my layout manager does more complex stuff): [-component1-][-component2-------][-component3-] user resizes component2 to be smaller, my layout manager would adjust other components so that all of them would take same space as before: [-component1-][-component2-][-component3-------] here, the actions should stop , but they go on: now the layout manager is invoked because of resizing component3 How could I achieve my intention (in an elegant way)? Thank you. EDIT: Removed threading-related information after suggestions by answerers.
