Is it possible to calculate the standard deviation of a set that is built from moving averages?

Hope you are all doing fine. I need to calculate the probability of the performance of a X player increasing or decreasing in time. For each ball the X player kicks, he can either score (1) or miss (0). So I'll calculate the performance simply by averaging the set (lets call points-set). If he scores 10 times of 15, I'll give him a 0,66 score, and so on. This creates another set (let's call avg-set), a set of the moving averages of the player. So I was wondering: is it possible for me to calculate the standard deviation of the avg-set? I'm in doubt as, of course, each element of the avg-set can't be called independent of the previous one. At least I think so. And if it is not possible to calculate the standard deviation, how can I estimate the probability of change in the avg-set? Thank you!
