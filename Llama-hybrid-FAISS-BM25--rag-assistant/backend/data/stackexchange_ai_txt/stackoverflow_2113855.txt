substitute, eval, bquote, do.call ... some guidance for substituting expressions

I would like to program a time series class. The idea is that I instantiate an object with an expression and some other time series objects, for instance (two time series) x (a time series, defined to be the sum of x and y) z (get some part of the series) window(z, start=1960, end=1960.75) The problem is, how can I evaluate the expression? I tried the following: #(constructor for class) exprTs I can not get the window method to work. If you could guide me to how to use substitute, eval, do.call appropriately, that would be very helpful.
