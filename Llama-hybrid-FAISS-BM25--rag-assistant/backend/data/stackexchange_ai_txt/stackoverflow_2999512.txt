There's also mx.DateTime which is now free to use and it quite a bit easier to deal with and more flexible than Python's built in datetime module for well just about everything. Works in python 2.3+ No * and [0:6] shenanigans required. Egenix Download >>> import mx.DateTime as dt >>> then = dt.DateTimeFrom(dt.strptime('20040412234551', '%Y%m%d%H%M%S')) >>> delta = dt.now() - then >>> delta >>> delta.hours 53941.156198977762 >>> delta.days 2247.5481749574069
