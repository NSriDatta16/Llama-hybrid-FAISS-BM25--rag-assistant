One problem is here: function sliding(){ // assing event for(var i=0; i In that loop, you're calling the "slideout" and "slidein" functions, though it's obvious that that's not what you want to do. What you want is to assign a function that calls "slideout" or "slidein" the appropriate way. To do that, you'll need another layer of function: function makeHandlers(index) { return { 'out': function() { slideout(tags[index], pics[index]; }, 'in': function() { slidein(tags[index], pics[index]; } }; } function sliding() { for (var i = 0; i As @BiAiB notes, your calls to "setTimeout" and "clearTimeout" need some attention too.
