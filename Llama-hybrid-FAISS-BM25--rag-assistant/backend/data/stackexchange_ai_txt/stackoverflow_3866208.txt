Calculating Months between Factored Time Variables

I have a factored time series that looks like this: df First, I would like to convert this to a format native to R. Second, I would like to calculate the number of months between the two columns. Update: Essentially I'm trying to recreate what I do in SPSS, in R. In SPSS I would: Convert the strings to date format DD-MMM-YYYY COMPUTE. RND((a-b)/60/60/24/30.416) 30.416 is short for 365/12 I don't care so much about month edge cases, hence the rounding operation.
