MATLAB block size and memory management

I'm using a block processing approach to handle a calculation between two large matrices. The code significantly speeds up when using a larger block size. But if I go too large, then I get an Out of Memory error. Currently I hand-tune my code to find the largest working block size for a given input. My question : how can I automate the process of finding the largest possible block size? I've toyed with wrapping everything in a try/catch block and looping with progressively smaller block sizes till it succeeds. I'm hoping there is a more elegant or idiomatic way.
