What you are doing looks like it should work. The problem is likely elsewhere. Hrefs with "Javascript:" prefixes are really rather horrible. Instead, try rewriting that as: Beyond that (which I don't think would actually be causing it), you've committed the cardinal sin of saying "It didn't work". Did you get any Javascript errors in the console? I suspect you would have, unless a valid function really was called. Also, try calling the JS function explicitly from within a block on your page, to see at what point it's failing. Double-check as well that the external file really has been loaded at the time you click on the link - perhaps put a line at the bottom of the external script file to help check this, such as alert('External file loaded.'); EDIT (based on comment): OK, so we've established you can call the method from "normal" JavaScript on your page. This means that the problem lies with the way that you're trying to call the script from your hyperlink. Have you passed your HTML through a validator? If the syntax is invalid, then user agents can interpret it however they want, including ignoring it completely. If the HTML does validate then at this point it might be useful to post a link to your full HTML, so that others can look over it and see where the problem lies. It's possibly something like another function overriding the onclick event for the link, and so your event handler gets lost.
