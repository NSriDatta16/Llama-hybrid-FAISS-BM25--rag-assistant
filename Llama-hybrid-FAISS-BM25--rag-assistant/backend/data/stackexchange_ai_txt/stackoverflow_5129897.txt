HTML 5 offline storage is another option and quite amazing because it works in all major browsers since IE 8 came out. I did a jQuery plugin for saving form state for returning users at http://www.jasonsebring.com/dumbFormState that accomplishes much of what you are talking about and has nothing to do with server-side and even works in HTML pages. There are some more features I could add such as saving the form in its entirety so it would not even need to be rendered on an additional page hit. I'm focusing on saving the actual choices the user made automatically then when the user comes back, the form selections are still where they left off and you can erase them from session or local storage as you want through the form instance. This is a brave new world going into HTML 5 and there will be many old paradigms that will vanish as the newer browsers erase the past problems. Maintaining form state is certainly a huge and old problem that all of use would like to go away. JavaScript is only getting stronger these days so you should get those HTML 5 skills going. I recommend reading, listening and watching everything from Douglas Crockford as your skepticism in taking JavaScript seriously will evaporate and you will find that closures are the best thing ever created in programming besides variables and functions.
