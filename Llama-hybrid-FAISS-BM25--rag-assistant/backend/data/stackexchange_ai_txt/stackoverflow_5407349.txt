You should check out the new book iOS Recipes written by Matt Drance: http://pragprog.com/titles/cdirec/ios-recipes Among the recipes is one to make use of the built-in CoreAnimation CAReplicatorLayer to build an emitter in "Construct a simple Emitter". The book is still in alpha but if you buy it now you get updates as it is finished.
