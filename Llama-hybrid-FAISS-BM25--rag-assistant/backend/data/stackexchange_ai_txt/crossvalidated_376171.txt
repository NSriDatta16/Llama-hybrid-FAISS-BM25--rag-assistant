High proportion of zero values and PCA

My aim is to perform PCA since I have 76 variables in my dataset. Problem is that most of my variables are highly skewed as you can see in the histogram below. These variables are proportions derived from count data. For example: ID count_of_purchases count_of_products Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun Product1 Product2 Product3 1 16 43 7 1 2 3 2 0 1 17 14 12 2 2 11 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 0 5 3 92 112 32 18 2 18 14 3 7 27 47 38 4 31 104 9 1 15 3 3 0 0 41 13 50 5 11 15 2 3 2 4 0 0 0 3 3 5 As you can see, sum of the day counts corresponds to count_of_purchases and the same goes for count_of_products. I transformed this table to proportions. Do I need to perform some other kind of transformation of the variables than just scaling in order to prevent the PCA from skewed results? Or is there any better choice than PCA for this kind of data? Thank you for the answers.
