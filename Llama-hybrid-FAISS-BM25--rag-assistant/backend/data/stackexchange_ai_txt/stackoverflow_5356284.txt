Haven't used so many rows and columns for a wpf datagrid, but I guess doable although with performance and loading issues. Assuming your number of columns as fixed, you can give it a try, provided: 1. you have UI virtualization enabled for datagrid for both rows as well as columns. 2. your datagrid's (if present in a control like stackpanel), has a fixed width and height (i.e. doesn't have them as Auto). Otherwise the virtualization would fail. You may also want to think about data virtualization.
