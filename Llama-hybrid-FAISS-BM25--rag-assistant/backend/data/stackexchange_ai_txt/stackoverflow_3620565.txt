You'll probably want to architect your site to use, at minimum, a master/slave replication system. You don't necessarily need to set up replicating mysql boxes to begin with, but you want design your application so that database reads use a different connection than writes (even if in the beginning both connections connect to the same db server). You'll also want to think very carefully about what your caching strategy is going to be. I'd be looking at memcache, though with Zend_Cache you could use a file-based cache early on, and swap in memcache if/when you need it. In addition to record caching, you also want to think about (partial) page-level caching, and what kind of strategies you want to plan/implement there. You'll also want to plan carefully how you'll handle the storage and retrieval of user-generated media. You'll want to be able to easily move that stuff off the main server onto a dedicated box to serve static content, or some kind of CDN (content distribution network). Also, think about how you're going to handle session management, and make sure you don't do anything that will prevent you from using a non-file-based session storage ((dedicated) database, or memcache) in the future. If you think carefully, and abstract data storage/retrieval, you'll be heading in a good direction.
