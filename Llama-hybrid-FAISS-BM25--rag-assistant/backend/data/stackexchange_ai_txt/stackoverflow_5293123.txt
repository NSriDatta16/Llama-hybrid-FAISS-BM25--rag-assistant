I think it's your lucky day: python dictionaries have an average complexity O(1) (see TimeComplexity on python wiki). You do not have to modify your existing code to improve performance. On a slightly unrelated note, python objects differ quite a lot from C++ in memory usage, because of the dictionary. Therefore, if you have memory issues and lots of objects, you could use __slots__ to improve them; as usual with all optimizations, it is far better to delay them until you see their need, and only if you can measure they actually do something.
