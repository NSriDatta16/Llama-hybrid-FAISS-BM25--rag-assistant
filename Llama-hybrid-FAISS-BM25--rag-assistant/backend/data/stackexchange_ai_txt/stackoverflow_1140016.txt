Do I need to buy a license for a font to use it in an iPhone game?

I am using the Calibri font in a game that I am developing for the iPhone, and I'm unsure if I need to pay for a license for it. I use the font in Adobe Photoshop to generate textures that are then used and displayed at runtime. I will not embed the font binary in the game. Do I need a license for the Calibri font? If I do, does anyone know about how much a font license would cost in a case like this? I wrote Ascender Corporation and asked them about this issue. Here is the e-mail conversation: Ascender Corportation, The game I am making will only be available on the Apple App Store for the iPhone/iPod Touch platform. I am not embedding the font in the game, I am only using it in Adobe Photoshop to generate textures that will be displayed when the game is running. Please, tell me about the license that fits this circumstance. -Andrew Andrew, Thank you for the additional information. We can provide you with a license to distribute the Calibri regular font in a single game title, on just the iPhone/iPod Touch platform in one bitmap size for $750 . Our standard license term for game developers is a perpetual term but for Calibri we can only provide renewable two year terms. We have reduced the license fee to reflect the shorter term. You can renew the license for additional two year terms at your option. There are no unit reporting requirements and the license fee includes warranty and indemnification from Ascender Corporation. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you want to proceed with a license. Best regards, Ascender Corporation This seems a little egregious, $750 for a single size? I am not even confident that the game I am making will make that much! Does this sound right?
