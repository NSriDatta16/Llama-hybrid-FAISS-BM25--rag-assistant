Is it allowed to use averages on a dataset to improve correlation?

I have a dataset with a dependent and an independent variable. Both are not a time series. I have 120 observations. The correlation coefficient is 0.43 After this calculation, I have added a column for both variables with the average for every 12 observations, resulting in 2 new columns with 108 observations (pairs). The correlation coefficient of these columns is 0.77 It seems I improved the correlation in this way. Is this allowed to do? Did I increase the explanation power of the independent variable by using averages?
