The dpi of the PNG isn't relevant in this instance, only the actual pixel size. How are you displaying the images? If you're using an ImageView, try setting android:scaleType="none" . If you're setting its width and height with wrap_content it shouldn't matter, but it's worth a try. Also, if you're accessing them from the drawables folder, try placing them under a new folder called drawable-mdpi. Android should detect that the emulator is set to medium density, and automatically use the resources from the mdpi folder if they exist.
