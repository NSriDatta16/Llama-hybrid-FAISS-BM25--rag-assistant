I think you are right: 0.5 * maximum duration of the timer. Reasoning: The maximum period at all with the given setup would be the maximum duration of the timer. The average duration selected will be ahlf the maximum period of the timer, if they all have an equal probability: Add them up, divide by count and see for yourself: Example: values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Since each have the same probability of being chosen, for N is large: 1 will be chosen N / 6 times, 2 will be chosen N / 6 times etc. We add them all up: N/6 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = N/6 * (21) = N * 21/6 = N * 3.5 ==> the average period for N events firing was 3.5, which is more or less the maximum duration of the timer.
