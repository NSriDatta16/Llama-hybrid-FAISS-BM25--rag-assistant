GNNs can be used for image classification and in future may prove to be a better approach, but as of now, CNNs are state-of-the-art. Steps for image classification using GCN: -> Converting the images to graphs. -> Feeding them to GNN. -> Interpretation or visualization of results. An image can be represented as a graph with each pixel as a node with edges between them capturing similarity between the nodes. There are multiple ways to capture this similarity, one standard or naive approach is to consider that the neighboring pixels/regions have edges between them. Read this article for more efficient ways. You can follow this paper to implement an image classifier using GNN.
