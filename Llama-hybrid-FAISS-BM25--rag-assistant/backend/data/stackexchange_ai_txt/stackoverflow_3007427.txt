In the absence of a good means of accessing a database from the myUser class, I opted for a slightly different path. I installed memcached in a location accessible by both apps and extended PHP's Memcached class to apply a few customizations. The apps can now share information by writing specially formatted keys to the memcached instance. I opted not to overhaul my existing cache storage mechanism (why upset the apple cart?) and am reading from/writing to memcached selectively for information that truly needs to be shared.
