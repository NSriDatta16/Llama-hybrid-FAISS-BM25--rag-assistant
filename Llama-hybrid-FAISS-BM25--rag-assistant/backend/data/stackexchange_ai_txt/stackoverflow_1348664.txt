Actually, I found a way to do that and I succeeded. That you calculate the number of frames per packet of the song, and the average packet's size (in bytes). Use NSHTTPConnection to get the file size and use this formular: totalFrames = (fileSize * framesPerPacket / average packet size) when you have total frames, just divide it by the bitrate, then u get urself the total time!!
