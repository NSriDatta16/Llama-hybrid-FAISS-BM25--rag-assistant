Comparison of Bayesian and Classical estimates

Is it correct to compare Bayesian and Classical estimates using Mean Squared Error (MSE)? MSE is a criterion that is used in the classical paradigm. For example: I am comparing the performance of classical and Bayesian estimators for a distribution, in classical, it is MLE and Bayesian paradigm it is posterior mean (using squared error loss function). Now, is it correct to compare MLE and Posterior mean on the basis of MSE. The confusion here is that MSE is used in classical paradigm. So, can we compare two paradigm based on the criteria of one of them.
