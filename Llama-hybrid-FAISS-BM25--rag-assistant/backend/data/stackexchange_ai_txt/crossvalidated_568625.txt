The proposed answer here assumes that, despite your data being bounded on [0,1], the means (average proportions) for each condition are not too close to either zero or one. In brief, if your sample size is sufficiently large, then use of the Welsh t-test is acceptable. (And if the sample size is truly large enough, you probably won't notice a difference in the P-values between a 2 independent sample t-test and the Welsh t-test.) So, the major concern is that your data (the proportions for varying sample sizes) is being drawn from potentially very non-normal distributions. Here is a small bit of code that helps demonstrate this: grp1 In brief, what you see in this plot is two normal distributions on top of each other. As there is such a distribution for each different sample size, you can see why the "combination" of all of these possible distributions would result in a non-normal distribution. (Though, all the distributions would have the same mean, if not the same variance, and thus you would still have a relatively symmetric distribution.) However, with large enough samples drawn from these non-normal distributions, the mean of the samples will follow a normal distribution (by the CLT). To clarify, the CLT requires the same sample size for the sampling distribution, but it is the population distribution that bears the burden of having different samples for each proportion calculated in this context. The sampling distribution would be based on the number of samples in conditions A and B (not the sample sizes used for the data collection process in each observation in each condition). Thus, assuming you do indeed have sufficiently large enough samples, the Welsh t-test should be robust enough to provide a reasonable estimate for the P-value under a null hypothesis that the population means of the two conditions are the same.
