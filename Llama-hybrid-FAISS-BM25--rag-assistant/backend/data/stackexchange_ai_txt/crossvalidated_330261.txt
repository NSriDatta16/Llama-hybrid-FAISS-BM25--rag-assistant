Stochastic Process: On a chessboard a single random knight performs a simple random walk

On a chessboard a single random knight performs a simple random walk. From any square, the knight chooses from among its permissible moves with equal probability. If the knight starts on a corner, how long, on average, will it take to return to that corner? I understand the question. I know that from the corner the knight has two choices of squares. From the two squares the piece has 5 directions (for each location), etc. The thing is, I want to create a transition matrix for this Markov Chain. But I can't think of how to do this without each square representing a separate state..which would make is 64x64 transition matrix. I'm certain I'm over-complicating this problem but does anyone have some advice on how to move forward? If I can create the transition matrix then I can make the corner an absorbing state and I'll be golden to move forward.
