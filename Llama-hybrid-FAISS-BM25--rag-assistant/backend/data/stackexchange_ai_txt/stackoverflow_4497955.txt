There are a lot of 3rd party vendors out there that provide powerful custom controls (editor, navigation, grids, menus, property grids, ...). It's - in general - cheaper to buy from them than to rewrite your own (when it fits your need of course). Historically, Microsoft has always encouraged a rich "component-based" eco-system around what they provider out-of-the-box features. This has been true from the beginning of component programming (VBX, OCX, ...) with Microsoft technology. This is arguable, but that's the strategy :-)
