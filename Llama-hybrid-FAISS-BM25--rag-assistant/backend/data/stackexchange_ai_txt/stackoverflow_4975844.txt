If I'm reading right, it sounds like PHP's using the local mail delivery agent (sendmail?) to hand off mails, which then in turns sends things to Google. You'd have to use something PHPMailer or SwiftMailer , which have simple methods of directly setting which SMTP server to hand the mail off to. PHP's internal mail() function is simplistic and does a local handoff only. So instead of your code -> local mail agent -> google it'd go your code -> google and the local mail spool should never get touched.
