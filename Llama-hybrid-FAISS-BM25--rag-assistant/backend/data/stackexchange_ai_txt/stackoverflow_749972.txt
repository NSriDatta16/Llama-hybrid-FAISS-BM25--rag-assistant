"When" is one dimensional temporal data, which is well shown by a timeline. At larger timescales, you'd probably lose the details, but most any plot of "when" would have this defect. For "How often", a standard 2d (bar) plot of time vs frequency, divided into buckets for each day/week/month, would be a standard way to go. A moving average might also be informational. You could combine the timeline & bar plot, with the timeline visible when you're zoomed in & the frequency display when zoomed out. How about a bar plot with time on the horizontal axis where the width of each bar is the length of time your computer held a particular IP address and the height of each bar is inversely proportional to the width? That would also give a plot of when vs how often plot. You could also interpret the data as a pulse density modulated signal, like what you get on a SuperAudio CD. You could graph this or even listen to the data. As there's no obvious time length for an IP change event, the length of a pulse would be a tunable parameter. Along similar lines, you could view the data as a square wave (triangular wave, sawtooth &c), where each IP change event is a level transition. Sounds like a fun Pure Data project.
