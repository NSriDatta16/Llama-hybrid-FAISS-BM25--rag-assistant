Problem with position in CSS and html

I'm having a problem with a CSS. I have a little image with the problem: The first part show what happend when in the block "Contenido" it's empty, and the second part when it has something. The problem? The second botton use a break and appear under of the other bootom. I have tried a pair of styls, but i can't get with one that work. What i have in CSS and html? Here we could put some info but it give a problem And in the CSS i have this one: .nav-pad{ padding: 0.2em; postion: relative; } .button_next{ float:right; right:0 } .button_previous{ left:0; } Any clue what i'm doing bad? Thanks a lot! Roberto
