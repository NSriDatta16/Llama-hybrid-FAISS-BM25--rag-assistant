If you consider that (for natural images captured by cameras) the light is an energy, you may call energy the value of the pixel on some channel. However, I think that by energy the books are referring to the spectral density. From wikipedia: The energy spectral density describes how the energy (or variance) of a signal or a time series is distributed with frequency http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density
