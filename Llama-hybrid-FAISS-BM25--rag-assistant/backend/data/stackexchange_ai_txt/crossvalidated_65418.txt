Hierarchical regression with partially nested variables

I would like to do a logistic regression of vaccination coverage of, for example, $HPV$. Let's assume that we have 50 states ($S$). 30 states have an urban part and a country part (urbanity variable $U$). The other 20 have only a country area. 10 of the states have population areas where individuals speaks only Spanish and other areas only English ($L$). The linguistic region correlates only slightly with urbanity. For example: $S$: 1,.., 50; $U$: urban/country; $L$: English/Spanish. S(1)-U(urban)-L(english) S(1)-U(country)-L(english) S(1)-U(urban)-L(spanish) S(1)-U(country)-L(spanish) S(2)-U(urban)-L(english) S(2)-U(urban)-L(spanish) S(3)-U(urban)-L(english) S(3)-U(country)-L(english) S(4)-U(urban)-L(english) S(4)-U(country)-L(spanish) ... where the number indicate a state. The situation is that $U$ is nested in $S$ but not each $S$ has both levels of $U$. This is also the case for the linguistic variable. If $U$ would be nested completely in $S$ and $L$ completely in $S$, the model would look like (in R-terminology for lmer): y ~ (1|S) +(1|S:U) + (1|S:L) where $y$: 0/1 vaccinated Is it possible to estimate odds ratio using this model even if variables $U$ and $L$ are not completely nested? Or Should be used another model, for example: y ~ (1|S) + U + L where (1|S) is random variable and U and L are fixed variables. With fixed levels $U$ and $L$ the nesting character would be lost and the variables would be characterstics of the individuals,that is, the aggregation of individuals would not be considered. Problems which arise using fixed variables: would give significant results or narrow CI due to the high number of individuals. I would be very happy if someone could give me some hints how to cope with partially nested variables.
