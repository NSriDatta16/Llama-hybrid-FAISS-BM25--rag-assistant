You can disable dragging from the inner like this: $("#popup div").bind('mousedown mouseup', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); }); event.stopPrpagation() stops a click on that inner from bubbling up to the outer that has the drag events bound to it. Since the event will never get there, those drag event handlers won't interfere. You can run this code before or after creating the draggable, it'll work either way.
