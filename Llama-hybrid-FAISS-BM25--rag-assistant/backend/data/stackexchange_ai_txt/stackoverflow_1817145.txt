html string not being parsed with JSON.parse

I am using JSON.parse for a list of products. I am running a regex to replace characters that were breaking the parse: [\n|\t|\r] It seems that I am still having issues when the following content is being copied into html. A soul mate for your aluminum group lounge chair. Rest your weary feet on this matching ottoman - same suspension design, same light weight, same elegant scale as the lounge chair. Polished aluminum 4-star base, black pedestal. Glides. Not sure which part is breaking the parser, and what I can do to fix it, short of removing the style and span tags.
