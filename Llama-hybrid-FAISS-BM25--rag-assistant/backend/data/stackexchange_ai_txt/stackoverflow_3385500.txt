reindex Catalog URL Rewrites in magento never ends

I've imported 6K categories and 16K products to magento using a custom import profile. When I'm trying to reindex everything works except for 'Catalog URL Rewrites' that keep showing PROCESSING but never completes. log and exceptions files don't show anything. Is there something I can do to make the index work? Can I just ignore this index and not use it? (I don't know what it does). Thanks
