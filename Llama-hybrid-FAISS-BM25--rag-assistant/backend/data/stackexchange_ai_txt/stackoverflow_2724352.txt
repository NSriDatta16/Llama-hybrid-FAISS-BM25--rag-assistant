Java Lib file errors

I am a brand new Java developer (I have been working in asp.net) and I inherited a project I am trying to get running correctly. I am on Windows 7 and have Tomcat installed and I am using Eclipse I'm trying to figure out how the heck Jar's work in java and I am really confused at the moment. I have been playing around with it and looking up stuff on the web for about a day now and this is where I am: I have a dynamic web project which I inherited and it has what I am going to assume is a fairly standard project layout. There is a lib folder in the project root which contains some jar's. If I don't do anything and go to a particular page in the site I get this error: "The import net.sf cannot be resolved, XLSTransformer cannot be resolved to a type" So I added jxls-core-0.9.8.jar to my build path in Eclipse and that error went away but now I am getting this error "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: net.sf.jxls.transformer.XLSTransformer" I copied that jar from its current location to the tomcat/lib directory and that error went away. Now I am getting essentially the same issue with another file. Mainly I just need to know how should jar's work? Do they need to be in the class path, in web/WEB-INF/lib, in tomcat/lib, in all of them, none of them I just can't figure it out. Also when I was looking around I saw some stuff that indicated the order of my classpath entries matters as well. If that is the case how do you insure you have them in the correct order.
