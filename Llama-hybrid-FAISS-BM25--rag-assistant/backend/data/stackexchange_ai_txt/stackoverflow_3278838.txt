There is no generic "elegant solution" :) I've always wanted to make such thing as well. Anyway how you could do it: Overwrite the Html Helper in your app directory - make a copy from /cake/libs/views/helpers/html.php to /app/views/helpers/html.php and made some changes in the Html::link function. For example you can check if the url contain action edit or delete. The other part is to pass the proper parameters from the controller. In AppController::beforeFilter you can read the rights of the user (it's better to be cached) and to pass it in a special Auth variable to the View. So when you have the rights in your View it's easy to modify the link. :) As I said I haven't did it in real example, but this is the way I would do it. There is 1 bad point in that - if the original Html helper is changed, your one will remain the same. But I believe that Html helper is mature enough so for me is not a big issue.
