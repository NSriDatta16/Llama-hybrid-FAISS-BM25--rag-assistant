If you really want to do that you can try making the array A static, this way the storage for A is not determined by the scope of function and you can actually return the array(in form of pointer of course). But this is not a good way to do accomplish what you are trying to achieve, instead pass the array to function rand_grid . Thats what pass by address is meant for.
