You could always use cygwin and install the subversion package during install which would make it accessible in command prompt (with some $PATH changes) but I understand if this doesn't fit your criteria of 'just binaries'. Edit : I understand why people are downvoting but it was just a last resort suggestion to getting the binaries for subversion. To answer the question 'why install all of cygwin if you just need subversion': I find that originally being a linux app that I'd be more comfortable using subversion in a *nix environment such as cygwin and could consequently leverage GNU utils such as find , grep , bash etc to perform file based operations, which subversion primarily deals with. I suggested it because of this and I thought it would be the easiest and quickest way to get subversion as the OP had expressed dismay about finding legitimate binaries: a few clicks and you're done. It was a suggestion that was asked for and in my original comment I had the caveat of installing cygwin right there.
