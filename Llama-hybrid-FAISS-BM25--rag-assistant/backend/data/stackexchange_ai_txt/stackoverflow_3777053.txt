if you don't use ORDER BY, the order is arbitrary ; however, dependent on phisical storage and memory aspects. so, if you repeat the same query hundreds of times in 10 minutes, you will get almost the same order everytime, because probably nothing changes. Things that could change the "noorder order" are: the executing plan - if is changed(you have pointed that) inserts and deletes on the tables involved in the query. other things like presence in memory of the rows.(other querys on other tables could influence that)
