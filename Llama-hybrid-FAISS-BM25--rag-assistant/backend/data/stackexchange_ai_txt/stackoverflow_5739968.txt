This is based on another answer from a similar question which can be found at Archive does not appear in xcode4 organizer I take no credit for this answer, but this together with the suggestions from Ron fixed the problem for me. For the "Release" configuration do the following: Set "Skip Install" to YES on your project Set "Skip Install" to NO on your application target Set "Skip Install" to YES on all static library targets that are included Choose Product -> Archive from the menu. This also worked for me, and according to the original answer poster, is based on advice from the Apple Dev Forums.
