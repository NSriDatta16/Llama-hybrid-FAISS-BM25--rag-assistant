Can I have a 2 column sortable jquery drag/drop without jqueryUI?

Is it possible to do a basic 2 column wide sortable drag/drop list with jquery, WITHOUT using jqueryUI? I would like to make something more lightweight but still use jquery. All I need is drag/drop capabilities, which sortable function works perfect but I need to be able to have 2 columns act as 1 unit, so a serialized list will show the order for both columns together Here is somewhat of an example of what I need but this version is using jqueryUI http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/empty-lists.html
