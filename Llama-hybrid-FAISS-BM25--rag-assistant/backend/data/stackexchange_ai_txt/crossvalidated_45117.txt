Edit: I'm no longer convinced that I wrote below is not actually correct, as I missed the line "the items in B cannot be identified precisely using X alone." The diagram makes it look like for some observations you know all of X, Y, Z, but maybe that's not the case? This is a missing data problem (you are missing the variable $Z$ for most observations), and what you are trying to do is called imputation . I don't know exactly what the context of your problem is, but you should be aware that frequentist single-imputation methods tend to underestimate uncertainty, so if you want to do hypothesis tests or confidence intervals then you should look at multiple imputation (imputing each missing value several times, resulting in several data sets) or missing data estimation within a Bayesian framework.
