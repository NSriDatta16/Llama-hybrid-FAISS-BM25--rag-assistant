How to extend models in SS3 like Rails does?

I have a new app that I am starting tomorrow based on SubSonic3 (ActiveRecord) and ASP.NET MVC. In thinking through how to organize the models layer, I know I'd like to extend most if not all of the models and add functionality (like virtual attributes, etc.) in a similar way that I do now with Rails. I've used SS2 in the past but this is my first project with SS3/ActiveRecord. I'm planning to use the tt templates to (auto)generate my models; how do I go about extending those classes? Partials? Many thanks! Chris
