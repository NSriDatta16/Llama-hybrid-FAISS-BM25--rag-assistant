Auto tuning of models? For ARIMA models, there is Pyramid which duplicates R's auto.arima function, but it is still not mature. Statsmodels has a pretty decent implementation of Holt-Winters . For the other methods, auto-tuning the models is still an open question. Cross validation of different tuned models Scikit-learn comes with a time series split method that can be used for times series cross validation. However it doesn't do much besides that, it doesn't do model evaluation or model selection. If PyAF doesn't meet your criteria, I doubt you will find anything better than that, unfortunately there's still a lot of work to be done for time series in Python (compared to what's available in R).
