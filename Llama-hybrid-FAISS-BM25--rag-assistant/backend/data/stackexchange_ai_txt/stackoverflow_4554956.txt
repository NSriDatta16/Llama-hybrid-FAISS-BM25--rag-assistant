That depends on the forum software - most of them keep the discussions in a database, so there would be no new files generated by this activity. A possible exception: user-uploaded attachments might be stored on-disk, but this could be overcome by using external image hosting services (e.g. Imgur). Some forums have built-in caching mechanisms with file storage, but this could be a) limited to a given size/file count, or b) turned off altogether. In general, the number of actual files is independent of the content - and doesn't change much; in fact, it would be possible (albeit impractical) to have all the code stored in a single file, and generate all your pages from there.
