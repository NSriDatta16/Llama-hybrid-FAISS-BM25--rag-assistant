A really nice overview, put in layman's terms, of rotation in any sort of Exploratory Factor Analysis can be found here: What is Rotating in Exploratory Factors Analysis? The short answer to your question is that both orthogonal and oblique rotations both produce (virtually) identical results in the highly unlikely case that factors are perfectly uncorrelated. Historically, researchers using EFA have been drawn to orthogonal rotations because uncorrelated factors are easier to interpret. However, if factors are correlated (such as in human psychology, where identifiable factor groupings are likely going to have some correlations), then we likely want our model to reflect that. In using PCR, instead of EFA, you do not need clearly defined or interpret-able factors, as you are using the method as a predictive technique. If the world of covariates indicates that there is some correlation between your factors, you likely want to model that. However, PCA is not the preferred method for modelling, though it is great for data compression and representation. Try PLS if you are interested in the modeling ability of your covariates.
