Yes, there are mathematical methods for solving a type of problem which this problem can be shoehorned into . It is the natural consequence of thinking of developers as "resources", like machine parts, largely interchangeable, their individuality easily reduced to simple numerical parameters. You can make up rules such as The fitness value is equal to the subject skill parameter multiplied by the square root of the reliability index. and never worry about them again. The same rules can be applied to different developers, different subjects, different scales of projects (with a SLOC scaling factor of, say, 1.5). No insight or real leadership is needed, the equations make everything precise and "assured". The best thing about this approach is that when the resources fail to perform the way your equations say they should, you can just reduce their performance scores to make them fit. And if someone has already written the tool, then you don't even have to worry about the math. (It is interesting to note that Resource Management people always seem to impose such metrics on others in an organization -- thereby making their own jobs easier-- and never on themselves...)
