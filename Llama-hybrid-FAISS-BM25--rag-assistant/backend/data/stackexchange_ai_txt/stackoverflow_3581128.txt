Assuming you're talking about static html site (lack of tags), I would say just use javascript . handle the onsubmit event. The question is also why would you want to have these fields, for validation? against what?? For storage? where are you gonna store it. If for validation than simply redirect the page to the download location (view location.assign() ). But again, if you provide more details it would be easier to know where your question belongs. UPDATE If you want to send emails please read this , if this doesn't answer your question (you don't have an external js tool that sends emails), then you probably have no choice but to enable server-side script such as ASP.NET or php .
