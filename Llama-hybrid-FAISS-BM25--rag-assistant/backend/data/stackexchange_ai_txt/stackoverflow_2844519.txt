Short answer : is yes, you can do WPF with code only. Longer answer : The part about a designer being able to work on the UI and a developer on functionality is really just a side-effect of decoupling functionality from presentation. What WPF brings to the table in a powerful way is data-binding which enables you to use wider range of design patterns. MVVM has been discussed quite a bit recently . The various MVVM framework encourage convention over configuration allowing you to write less code to accomplish the same goals. This decoupling also has the nice side effect of making your application more testable (you don't have to write tests if you don't want to, but at least the option is there). Moving to WPF from WinForms will most likely be worth it for you for new development. You could in theory keep doing what you've been doing with WinForms (just with new libraries), but it gives you the option to incorporate newer tools into your development as you become more comfortable with technology. If you haven't seen it already, the BabySmash series by Scott Hanselman is pretty interesting.
