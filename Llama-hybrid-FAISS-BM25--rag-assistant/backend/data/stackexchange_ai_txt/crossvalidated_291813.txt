how to qualitatively evaluate word embeddings?

I have a bunch of word embedding models trained on a corpus. I want to do qualitative analysis of the words for a research paper. I have the following in mind: 1. sample 5-10 words 2. get "most similar" five words for these sample words. 3. Ask some reviewers to rate each word from these "most similar" as similar from a scale of 1-10 (1 being least similar and 10 being most similar) 4. Take average of ratings provided by these reviewers. The highest average ratings means best model. I want to know if there are any other more sophisticated metrics than taking average of ratings. (Also, NDCG can't be applied as this not a classification or IR problem.) I would also appreciate if there someone can point to other qualitative evaluation techniques based on word similarity, other than plotting word vectors or semantic tasks as in Word2Vec paper.
