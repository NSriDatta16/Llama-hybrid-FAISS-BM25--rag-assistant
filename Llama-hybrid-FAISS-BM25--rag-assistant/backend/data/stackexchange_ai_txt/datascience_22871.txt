Should boolean features be normalized and should false be -1 or 0

I am attempting to train an SVM from a set of features which are both numeric and categorical, for example: Distance X (Numeric) Distance Y (Numeric) Font Size Difference (Numeric) Word 1 Bold (Boolean) Word 2 Bold (Boolean) Word 1 Font Size (Numeric) ... For mapping the features to a feature array I am treating true as 1 and false as 0 and then normalizing the entire feature array using Z-Scores. Should I instead encode false as -1 so it has a numerical impact on the generation of the support vectors, with a value of 0 it does not modify the chosen vector (I assume)? Should boolean features be normalized in the same way as numerics or should they be left with their encoded values?
