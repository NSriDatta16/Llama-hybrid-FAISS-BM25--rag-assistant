Algorithm to produce rounded edges and corners in a 3D mesh

Starting with a 3D mesh, how would you give a rounded appearance to the edges and corners between the polygons of that mesh? Without wishing to discourage other approaches, here's how I'm currently approaching the problem: Given the mesh for a regular polyhedron, I can give the mesh's edges a rounded appearance by scaling each polygon along its plane and connecting the edges using cylinder segments such that each cylinder is tangent to each polygon where it meets that polygon. Here's an example involving a cube: Here's the cube after scaling its polygons: Here's the cube after connecting the polygons' edges using cylinders: What I'm having trouble with is figuring out how to deal with the corners between polygons, especially in cases where more than three edges meet at each corner. I'd also like an algorithm that works for all closed polyhedra instead of just those that are regular.
