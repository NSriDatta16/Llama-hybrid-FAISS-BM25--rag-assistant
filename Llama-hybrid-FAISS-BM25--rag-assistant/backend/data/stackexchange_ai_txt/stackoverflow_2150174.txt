A good, short, practical one is here: http://blogs.msdn.com/kirillosenkov/archive/2009/03/12/kirill-s-whitespace-guidelines-for-c.aspx In short, have the amount of whitespace that is easy on eye. In C#, you'll have less whitespace than in some other languages because many lines consist only of curly braces. Leaving no blank lines can still result in plenty of white space. I also like to keep very related lines of code right up next to each other, making paragraphs in a sense. There one reason for taking out blank lines that's not okay: to fit more code on your screen. If you're doing that, your code is probably not organized well, with functions too long.
