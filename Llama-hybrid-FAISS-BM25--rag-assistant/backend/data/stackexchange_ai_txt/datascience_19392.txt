Using time series data from a sensor for ML

I have the following data for a little side project. It's from an accelerometer sitting on top of a washer/dryer and I'd like it to tell me when the machine has finished. x is the input data (x/y/z movement as one value), y is the label on/off Because the x values overlap for y=1 and y=0, I was thinking of using x and a rolling 3 minute window as inputs for a SVM: xyz60=res.xyz.resample("60S").max() X["x"]=xyz60 X["max3"]=xyz60.rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).max() Is this a good approach for this kind of problem? Are there alternatives that might produce better results?
