Almost any time that you ask "How can I do X in Perl?", the answer is to look at CPAN Search to find the module that does it. To download from the web, the LWP family of modules can help you. To parse the documents, try something with Feed , RSS , or Atom in the name. Four years later, though, I now recommend Mojolicious , which has its own user agent module and very strong support for DOM parsing and the various ways to pull out parts of a document. Depending on what you want, you probably don't need a special feed module anymore.
