Android - layout-large folder is been ignored

I have different layout files for different screens size like Folder Structure: layout layout-large layout-small For emulators like HVGA and QVGA there is no problem, the respective layout.xml file being refereed. But the layout-large folder is ignored when I run the emulator of WVGA(480x854) , here it is referring the "layout" folder of the application. Please point me to the right direction which is right way to handle this situation. I tried using layout-large-hdpi layout-large-mdpi layout-large-ldpi layout-normal-hdpi layout-normal-mdpi layout-normal-ldpi And in the AndroidManifest.xml I specified but no success
