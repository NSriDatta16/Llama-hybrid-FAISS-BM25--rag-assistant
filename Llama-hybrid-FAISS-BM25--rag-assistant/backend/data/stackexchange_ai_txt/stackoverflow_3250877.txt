you could create your path CGMutablePathRef thePath = CGPathCreateMutable(); and then in the touchesBegan and touchesMoved add to your path - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if(touch){ CGPoint tapPoint = [touch locationInView: self.view]; CGPathMoveToPoint(thePath, NULL,tapPoint.x,tapPoint.y); } } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if(touch){ CGPoint tapPoint = [touch locationInView: self.view]; CGPathAddLineToPoint(thePath, NULL,tapPoint.x,tapPoint.y); } } and on touchedEnded, as Joshua said, create a CAKeyframeAnimation and set its path to thePath and set the other properties of your animation (duration, etc) and apply it to your object
