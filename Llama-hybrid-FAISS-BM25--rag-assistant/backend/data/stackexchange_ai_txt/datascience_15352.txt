Pecularities of classification of Hidden Markov Models?

Assume that we have set of Hidden Markov Models (Bayesian networks) Set{(n, m, P, A, B)} (n - number of hidden states, m - number of observable states, P - initial probabilities, A - transition matrix, B - emission matrix). Are the peculiar algorithms or approaches how to classify those HMMs into different subsets of HMMs? If n and m are equal for all the HMMs in the set then classification can be build from the ranges of elements in A and B. If n and m are different for different HMMs then one classify hidden and observable states first... Are there some research or trends for this? Google is not helping here because it returns results for classification methods using HMMs, but we want to classify (or find clusters) of HMMs themselves.
