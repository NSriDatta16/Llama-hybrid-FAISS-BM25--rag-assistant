Background Intelligent Transfer Service and Amazon S3

I'm using SharpBITS to download file from AmazonS3. > // Create new download job. BitsJob > job = this._bitsManager.CreateJob(jobName, JobType.Download); > // Add file to job. > job.AddFile(downloadFile.RemoteUrl, downloadFile.LocalDestination); > // Resume > job.Resume(); It works for files which do no need authentication. However as soon as I add authentication query string for AmazonS3 file request the response from server is http state 403 -unauthorized. Url works file in browser. Here is the HTTP request from BIT service: HEAD /mybucket/6a66aeba-0acf-11df-aff6-7d44dc82f95a-000001/5809b987-0f65-11df-9942-f2c504c2c389/v10/summary.doc?AWSAccessKeyId=AAAAZ5SQ76RPQQAAAAA&Expires=1265489615&Signature=VboaRsOCMWWO7VparK3Z0SWE%2FiQ%3D HTTP/1.1 Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: identity User-Agent: Microsoft BITS/7.5 Connection: Keep-Alive Host: s3.amazonaws.com The only difference between the one from a web browser is the request type. Firefox makes a GET request and BITS makes a HEAD request. Are there any issues with Amazon S3 HEAD requests and query string authentication? Regards, Blaz
