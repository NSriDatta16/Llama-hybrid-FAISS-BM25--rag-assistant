Can one use different samples in pre and post tests?

Generally I have seen that pre and post intervention tests are applied on the same sample from a population undergoing an intervention. e.g. same set of students may be tested in an educational intervention in both pre and post tests. Would it be valid to test different random samples in both the pre and post test (using the same sampling methods)? If this is statistically valid, this would have an advantage that the agency responsible for intervention cannot pay special attention to the individuals who are part of the pre-test sample.
