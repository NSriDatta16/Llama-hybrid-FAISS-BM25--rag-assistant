Since you are looking for new AJAX methods for the web, you can leverage your Java programming skills with Google Web Toolkit (GWT) , it makes the integration between the client and the server sides quite seamless. You can use Java on both the client and the server side. (The GWT Compiler generates JavaScript from Java for the client side) I recommend you have a look at the GWT Remote Procedure Call (RPC) tutorial to see how easy it is to communicate between the client and the server in an asynchronous way. It might be a good fit for your project since you are not prone to some of its cons like SEO, as I do not think that an accounting system would care about SEO. Keywords: Java, Interactive, AJAX Calls.
