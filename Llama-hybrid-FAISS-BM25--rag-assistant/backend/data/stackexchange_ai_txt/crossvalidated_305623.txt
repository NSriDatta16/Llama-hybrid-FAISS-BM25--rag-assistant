Multiple linear regression on time series data, is there autocorrelation of residuals?

I am applying a multiple linear regression model on time series data (independent and all dependent variables are time series). I am wondering if I have concerns of autocorrelation of residuals, by looking at the below plots, in order to evaluate other approaches such as AR. Should I be doing any other checks?
