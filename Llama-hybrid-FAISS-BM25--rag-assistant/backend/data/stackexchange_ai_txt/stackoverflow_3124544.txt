I think the space between the paragraphs can be configured with the package: \usepackage{parskip} Documentation in CTAN is here . I haven't really tested it though. For the margins you could do it manually with , the esaiest way is to do it the following package: \usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry} You can check documentation here .
