How to understand clearly the feature importance computing in random forest model

I want to know the details of feature importance computing of random forest with gini index. I refer to this Chinese blog: https://www.jianshu.com/p/7a876bb876b9 . But I don't understand clearly these mathematical forms in blog. for example As the node m after twos branches(Il, Ir) splitting, the gini index is computing as following And feature Xj in the decision ith tree ,and be in nodel of M set, and the feature importance of Xj in the ith tree is computing as following: And I confusing about M set, what's the meaning of M set? I think that the feature Xj in ith tree just one node not a M set? If you guys have detailed computing method, please tell me!
