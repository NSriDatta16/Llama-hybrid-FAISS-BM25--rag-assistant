What is the most solid option for BLOB storage?

I have to develope something to hold blob's. I have a various options but have a hard time choosing. What is needed is for the user to upload documents in the form of images mostly. I need to make it secure. I would like some speed though it's not a prerequisite. The size of the uploaded images/documents will "probably" not be too much of an issue. The options I have found so far are: SQL FileStream Azure Storage HDD Other cloud services like Amazon etc. I am not too fond of the cloud since it will be somewhat sensitive data and I am not liking the price model. Not saying it's bad it's just a personal preference. When it comes to FileStream I have no idea, I have been recommended both for and against it. Does it really work? HDD, well yeah it's meant to store things but now I need to code for both Database and HDD. I am not overly fond of that tight coupling. Are there any other suggestions on how to store stuff? Can I get some comments on the options I mentioned?
