Time Series Analysis

I have attended a lecture about introduction to machine learning at my university (SVM, regression, kernels etc.). Now I'm planning to do a project where machine learning knowledge is needed. In fact I would have to use time series analysis. A reference to the book "Time Series Analysis" written by Hamilton, James Douglas (Princeton University Press) is given. The book is not online and I'm currently not close to a library so I cannot look into the book. I've never heard about time series analysis before. Is it similar to basic machine learning topics I've heard about or is it very difficult?
