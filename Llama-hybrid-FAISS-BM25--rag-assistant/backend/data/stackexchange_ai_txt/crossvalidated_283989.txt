Demeaning independent variables

I was reading a research paper in a reputable journal. They mention the following: The balance sheet ratios are demeaned within quarter and normalized within quarter by dividing them by one standard deviation. First of all, why would someone do that? Second, if i want to replicate the output this standard deviation is what? standard deviation of the ratio across all companies in the sample for that quarter ? (cross sectional). Or time series of the ratio?
