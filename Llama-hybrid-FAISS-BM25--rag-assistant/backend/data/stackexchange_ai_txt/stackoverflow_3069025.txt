Code coverage in-place instrumentation: Cannot fully backup the binary error

Can anybody help with this error in the log of my Team Build 2010 build? It only seems to occur when I have two build agents running on the same machine at the same time. Run has the following issue(s): Code coverage in-place instrumentation: Cannot fully backup the binary 'C:\Builds\3\MyProject\Binaries\MyProject.UserManager.DataModel.dll'. Cannot find the back up file, created by instrumentation utility: 'C:\Builds\3\MyProject\Binaries\MyProject.UserManager.DataModel.dll.orig'.
