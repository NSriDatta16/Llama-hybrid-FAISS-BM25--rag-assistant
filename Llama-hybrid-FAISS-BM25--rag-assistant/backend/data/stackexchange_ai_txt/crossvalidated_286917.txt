You are perfectly right, probability is the measure of uncertainty. Coin flip is a nice example, as discussed in another thread . Tossing a coin is a physical, deterministic process. In fact there are people who have learned to flip the coin in such way to get the outcome they want and are machines that produce deterministic, predictable coin flips. Let me, once again, quote E. Borel (after Bruno de Finetti, Probabilism: A Critical Essay on the Theory of Probability and on the Value of Science ): "One can bet, in heads or tails, after the coin, already tossed, is in the air, so that its movement is determined. One can also bet after the coin has landed, on the sole condition that one does not see on what side it has landed. Probability does not lie in the fact that the event is undetermined (in the more or less philosophical sense of the term) but only in our inability to predict what possibility will take place, or to know what possibility has taken place." To make things even more complicated, there are Bayesians who interpret probability as degree of belief . In fact, there are many different interpretations of probability . When something is impossible, or very, very unlikely we assign zero probability to it (check here , here and here ), when it is certain, the probability is equal to unity. When talking only about impossible and unlikely events, probability reduces to logic. When considering uncertain events, it may be seen as an extension of logic . But probability is not a substitute for "unknown", it is a measure of how much "likely" the unknown is. It may be interpreted in different ways, and so measure slightly different things, but in the end it lets us to quantify the unknown. Probability lets us say much more about the reality, then that something is "unknown", or "uncertain". But it is not only about measuring, probability lets us to make predictions, precisely estimate the expectations and risks , or apply Bayes theorem to combine probabilities , to give only few examples. In fact, as shown by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky , people are poor in reasoning about uncertainties and risks, while using formal, probabilistic reasoning guards us from our biases.
