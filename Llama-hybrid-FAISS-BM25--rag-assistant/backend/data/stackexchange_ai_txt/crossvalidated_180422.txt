How much resources does preprocessing generally take?

I'm learning about CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and the wiki page says, Convolutional networks [...] are variations of multilayer perceptrons which are designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing." So could one say that a characteristic of the variations of multilayer perceptrons leads to minimal amounts of preprocessing? If so, how much resources does preprocessing usually take up? Does using this technique of data mining introduce a new model for minimizing preprocessing?
