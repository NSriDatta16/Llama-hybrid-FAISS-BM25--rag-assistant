How to show images on an RDLC report

I have an RDLC report and would like one of the columns in a table on this report to display images. The datasource for my report is a class that has a property called Image of type System.Drawing.Image . On my report I dragged an image control onto the column and I set the following properties: MIMEType: image/png Source: Database Value: =Fields!Image.Value When I run my report, I get a broken image. I'd really appreciate any suggestions! Thanks in advance :o)
