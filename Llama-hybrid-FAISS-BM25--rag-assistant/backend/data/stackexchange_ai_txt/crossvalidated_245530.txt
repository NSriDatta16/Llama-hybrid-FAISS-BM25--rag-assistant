Logistic regression is often taught to undergrads as a transformed response: Take a number between 0 and 1, make log-odds out of that, and then fit OLS to it. That is also what is done for logistic regression in some social sciences. Given that Nate did his undergrad in economics, it would not be unusual if he had been taught this non-GLM approach.
