I agree w/ the poster who said you need to focus your efforts. First question: are you trying to learn this for developing for the web, or for desktop? If Web, learn ASP.NET, if not, not. Under ASP.NET, are you planning on just trying it out to get something up quickly, or do you want something more long-term, possibly leveraging your PHP/MySQL/JS skills? If the former, go for "regular" ASP.Net (aka Webforms), otherwise, go MVC (which will probably seem more familiar coming from PHP). As far as languages, that comes down to preference, they're pretty interchangeable. I prefer C#, and if you're good at Java that may be true for you as well. Tools, if you have an MSDN subscription, then Visual Studio 2008 Pro (or Team) is the way to go, get the latest SP's and you're up and running. Paul
