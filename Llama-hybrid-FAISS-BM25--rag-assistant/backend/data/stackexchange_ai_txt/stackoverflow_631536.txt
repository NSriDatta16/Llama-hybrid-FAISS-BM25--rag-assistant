Problems with ASP.NET recaptcha and JQuery

I want to have a Recaptcha on a JQuery Dialog. Though the line $("#newsletterDialog").dialog({ autoOpen: true, modal: false, resizable: false, draggable: false, width: 400 }) Will break jquery, so that validator.Challenge = Context.Request.Form[RECAPTCHA_CHALLENGE_FIELD]; fails (I.e. some operation with a hidden field foes wrong). In addition Firefox is hanging, so I cant debug the way I am used to (I think that's not just because of that line). Any clues?
