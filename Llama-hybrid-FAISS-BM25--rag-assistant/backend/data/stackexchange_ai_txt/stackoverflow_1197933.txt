I screen scrape a lot. Some advice: Emulate a User-Agent string for some browser you want to use. Different websites frequently return very different results depending on what your user agent is. If they don't recognize the User-Agent they will often revert to lowest common denominator, so it's usually best to start with some recent browser. (For example the World of Warcraft Armory returns beautiful, easy to parse XML if it thinks you're a recent Firefox. If it doesn't know what you are it sends terrible HTML). Be polite to the site you're scraping; don't hit it too hard. Your scraper will go faster if you multi-thread it, making many requests at once, but that will annoy the site owner. Be smart about error handling. Do not write code like while (1) { makeRequest(); }. If your code or the server throws an error a loop like this will immediately fetch another request, generating another error. It can get ugly quickly. Handle errors well and consider putting in sleeps or exits if you see a lot of errors. When developing your parsing code, test against a cached version rather than hitting the server every time. Will make your development go faster and is the basis of a simple test suite.
