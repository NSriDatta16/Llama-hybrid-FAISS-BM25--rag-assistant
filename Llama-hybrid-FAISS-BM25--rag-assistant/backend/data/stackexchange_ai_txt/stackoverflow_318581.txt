[RFC 2396][1] section 4.1: When a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch ("#") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed . As such, it is not part of a URI, but is often used in conjunction with a URI. (emphasis added) [1]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396#section-4
