Boost::Python, as in wheaties answer, is a very mature solution. Lua has a reputation for being easy to embed but I have not tried this myself. As a user of R , I am more interested in embedding R which is possible using the RInside package. A simple example is #include // for the embedded R via RInside int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { RInside R(argc, argv); // create an embedded R instance R["txt"] = "Hello, world!\n"; // assign a char* (string) to 'txt' R.parseEvalQ("cat(txt)"); // eval the init string, ignoring any returns exit(0); } and there are a couple more examples in the package. RInside essentially provides you a nice wrapper around the R engine using some of the Rcpp interface package.
