What overall measure/analysis to use for a collection of correlation coefficients?

in my research I am looking at concordance of epileptic attacks using the EEG-signal from the attacks. For every patient (25) a x number of attacks (ranging between 5 and 50) is recorded. For every recording lead, for every frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta etc.) an excitation score is calculated. Using these scores, correlation coefficients (Spearman rho) are calculated for every pair of epileptic attacks, resulting in a matrix of correlation coefficients for each subject. Now my question is, what would be a suitable and statistically correct way to get one number for the 'overall' correlation between the attacks of a patient, based on the matrix of correlation coefficients (rho's) of the attacks that I have? I have read about Fisher Z transformations to 'average' the coefficients (which I understood to be less suitable for Spearman rho's compared with Pearson r's). However, if this is indeed a suitable approach for the problem above, what would be the correct approach for statistical inference/calculating confidence intervals?
