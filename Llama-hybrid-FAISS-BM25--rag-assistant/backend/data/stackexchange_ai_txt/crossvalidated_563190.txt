Can we assume latent vectors are Euclidean?

I want to understand the mathematical nature of latent vectors, which I am pointing to general latent vectors which we can sample from an intermediate layer from a neural network. Can we assume they are Euclidean? Can we apply Euclidean geometry (e.g. distance/ area/ volume calculations) on latent vectors?
