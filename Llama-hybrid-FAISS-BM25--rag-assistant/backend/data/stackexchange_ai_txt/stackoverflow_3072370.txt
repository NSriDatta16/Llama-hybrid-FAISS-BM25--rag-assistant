Thinking_sphinx sorting through associations

I am trying to sort the search results of a thinking_sphinx search. The columns I want to sort are in associated tables: class Membership :first_name indexes user.last_name, :as => :last_name has :organization_id, :active set_property :delta => true end # begin sphinx_scope(:by_organization) do |org| {:with => {:organization_id => org.id, :active => true}} end sphinx_scope(:sort_by_name) do {:order => 'last_name, first_name'} end end Then I call the code like this: search_results = Membership.by_organization(Organization.current).sort_by_name.search((search_value || ""), :page => (page || 1), :per_page => 10) If I don't use the sort_by_name, then I get the correct number of returned values. Once I add the sort method, I get no rows. I have also tried to pass it into the search method, with the same results.
