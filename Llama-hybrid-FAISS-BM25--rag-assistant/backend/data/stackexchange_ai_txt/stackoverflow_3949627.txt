I have seen as many cases as large companies I have worked in. In some places, there is a strictly standardized technology stack, while in others tools and platforms are selected ad hoc by each dev team and project. And of course anything is possible between these two extremes. I don't think there is any "typical" case. My current employer has small developer teams in several countries, who have been working separately from each other up to now - so much so that some projects have been duplicated over several countries with close to the same business goals and content. We have just started the first steps toward standardization and selecting common dev tools. The solutions will be built pragmatically, based on the current choices, unifying gradually over a longer period of time. In another place several years ago, we had a strictly standardized dev environment and an extensive proprietary GUI framework to build everything upon. All has been decided and designed in advance, top-down. Even for refactoring ideas, we had to get permission from the boss of the boss of our boss - who then in the end said "no" :-/
