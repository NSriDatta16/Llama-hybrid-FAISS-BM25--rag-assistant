I think, that more complex the solution is, more user and search engine unfriendly becomes the situation. Try to find simpler and more elegant technique. I know some websites using this "form-technique" to spy the outbound hits and traffic from different links on their pages without loosing the direct link "SEO-power". They return false onclick of the link, submit a form at the same time to preserve the get variables and finally make header() location or 301 redirect to the link url. I suggest you to store the variable id into a session variable and check for it before the generation of every page.
