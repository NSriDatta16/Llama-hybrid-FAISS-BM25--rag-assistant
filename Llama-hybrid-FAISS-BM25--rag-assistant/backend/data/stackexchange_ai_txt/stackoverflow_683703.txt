You can't have a single sendto() generate a packet on every interface - in general (fragmentation notwithstanding) it's one packet transmitted for each sendto() . You'll need to transmit the packet once for each interface and either: use low-level ( setsockopt() ?) calls to select the outbound interface send to the specific broadcast address for each known interface the latter is however not suitable if you're trying to do some sort of discovery mechanism, such that the devices you're expecting to respond aren't actually correctly configured with an IP address in the same subnet as the interface they're connected to.
