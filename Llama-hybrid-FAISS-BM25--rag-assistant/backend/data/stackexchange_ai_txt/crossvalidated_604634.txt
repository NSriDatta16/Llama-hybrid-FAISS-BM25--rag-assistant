There's a lot of information on the site about multicollinearity, it may benefit you to click on the multicollinearity tag, sort by votes or frequently cited, and start reading to learn about the topic. In general, multicollinearity means that some of your variables 'point' in the same direction / aren't distinct from each other. As a result, it's hard for the model to know which is associated with the response. That doesn't necessarily impair the estimates of the coefficients, but it makes the estimates much less certain. That is, the standard errors, CIs, etc., will be much wider. It means you'll have less power than you otherwise would have, although you still might get significant results (see my answer to: What is the effect of having correlated predictors in a multiple regression model? ). Regarding how to detect collinearity, the VIF is superior to looking at marginal correlations. By convention, collinearity is problematic if the VIF is greater than 10. Your largest VIF is lower than that, so by this convention, it isn't a problem. If there were a problem, it would only mean that you might get a non-significant result even though there was a real association. A way to deal with that would be to drop all three strongly related variables and perform a nested model test. The multicollinearity wouldn't affect that test. If it were significant, then you might be confident that at least one of those variables was related, but without more information, it would be difficult to know which. None of that is really your problem, though. The biggest issue here is that there is very little information in binary data (i.e., presence/absence). A basic rule of thumb is that you need at least 15 of the less commonly occurring category (here, absent) for each variable you want to include. You might have enough information for a single variable, but not four. As an exploratory analysis, you could run four different univariate logistic regressions, but it's sort of cheating. It might provide some information about where to look further, but you wouldn't want to draw any firm conclusions.
