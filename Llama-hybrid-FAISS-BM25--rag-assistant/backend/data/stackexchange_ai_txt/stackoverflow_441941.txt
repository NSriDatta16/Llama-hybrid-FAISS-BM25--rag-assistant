I am having trouble making connections between code and Interface Builder

I am having a peculiar problem with the iPhone SDK. I have tried to run several tutorials from different sources on my development machine. The problem always seems to be in connecting the code to a view in Interface Builder. If I have a button or data field (or some other library function) and I declare some properties in the viewcontroller.h file, I launch Interface Builder by clicking on the .xib file and attempt to make a connection by dragging from the referencing outlet in the connection viewer and the only possible connection presented (present in the pop-up box is view ). No other options are available regardless of what code is available. Has anybody experienced this or am I missing something obvious?
