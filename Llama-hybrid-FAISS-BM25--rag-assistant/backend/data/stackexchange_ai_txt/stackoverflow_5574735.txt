jQuery: child elements of appended object

Is there a more elegant way of working with multiple objects within an object. For example: Instead of doing: $("table.thisTable tr.thisRow td.row1").text("Hi") $("table.thisTable tr.thisRow td.row2").text("Mom") $("table.thisTable tr.thisRow td.row3").text("Dad") is there a method that allows: $("table.thisTable tr.thisRow").function() { $(this).children("td.row1").text("Hi"); $(this).children("td.row2").text("Mom"); $(this).children("td.row3").text("Dad"); } I know you don't gain anything functionally, but I have a lot of long selectors that start to get difficult to track and maintain in code. I've been scouring the jQuery documentation, but the concept isn't jumping out at me and my Google search terms just aren't getting me in the right direction.
