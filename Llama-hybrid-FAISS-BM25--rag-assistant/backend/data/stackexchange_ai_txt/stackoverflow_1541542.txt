Problems with Programmatically Adding UIImageView on iPhone

I'm trying to programmatically add dots to a radar screen. The code runs without complaint, but I can't seem to get the dots to show up on screen. I do have a background UIImageView that covers the entire screen, but based on the documentation I expect my new UIImageView to be added to the front (not to mention I've tried bringSubViewToFront:). Since I'm not sure how to go about debugging this, if someone could show me where I went wrong that would be great. UIImage *dot; CGRect dotFrame; UIImageView *dotView; // loop through enemies, dropping pins dot = [UIImage imageNamed:@"enemyDot.png"]; dotFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, dot.size.width, dot.size.height); for(location in enemyAgents){ // add the dot dotView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:dotFrame]; dotView.center = CGPointMake(100, 100); [self.view addSubview:dotView]; [dotView release]; dotView = nil; }
