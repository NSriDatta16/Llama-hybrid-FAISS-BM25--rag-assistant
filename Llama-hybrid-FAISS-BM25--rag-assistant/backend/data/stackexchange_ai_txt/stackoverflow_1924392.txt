This is such a frustrating part of working with JPA, I think and something that I've struggled with in a number of applications. The practice that we've established is to actually just clear the session entirely and re-run the query that got us our resultset to begin with. One of the issues of refresh() is cascades. If you have lazily loaded collections or other references that have been fetched into memory, each of those items will get refreshed as well which can make the entire process take a long time. But I have to say that the pragmatic side of me says that you're so unlikely to change your persistence provider that if you have something that works with TopLink, then just go forward with it. Learn how to make the best use of the tools you have and don't worry about the "someday maybe" chance that you'll need to switch to Hibernate or something else.
