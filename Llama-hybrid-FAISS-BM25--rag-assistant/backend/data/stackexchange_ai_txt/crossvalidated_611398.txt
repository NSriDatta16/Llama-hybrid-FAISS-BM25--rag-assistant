Linearity of expectation has everything to do with algebra. The concept is quite intuitive though because we often think in linear categories and we solve many linear equations in school. I am not sure if it is possible to answer your question without equations, but I'll try to make it intuitive though. First of all, let's start with linearity . By "linear" we mean here the $f(x) = a + b x$ functions. To understand the following equations you only need to remember that the multiplication is distributive , so $cx + cy = c(x+y)$ and definitions of things like expected value, and joint distribution, etc. Multiplication by a constant For a random variable $X$ and a constant $c$ , the following holds $$ E[cX] = cE[X] $$ Example: According to some random source on the internet, the average height of women worldwide is 163 cm, this is the same as saying that the average height is 1.63 m, as 1 meter = 100 centimeters. Intuitively this is what we would expect, but to answer why does it hold, a little bit of algebra is needed. First, recall that for a discrete † random variable, the expected value is $$ E[X] = \sum_x x\, p(x) $$ then we have $$ \begin{align} E[cX] &= \sum_x c \, x \,p(x) \\ &= c \sum_x x \,p(x) \\ &= cE[X] \end{align} $$ Adding a constant $$ E[X + c] = E[X] + c $$ Example: according to another random internet source, the average annual salary in the US is \$53,490. Now imagine that the US decides to introduce universal basic income and will give every citizen \$2,000 every month. How would the average income change? It would be \$53,490 + \$24,000 (12 months). It's also quite intuitive: every person would get \$24,000 extra money, so the total amount of money earned by US citizens would be their salaries + \$24,000 times the number of citizens. To get an average from it, divide the total by the number of citizens. Everyone got the same extra amount, so on average also everyone got that more money, hence by this amount the average income has changed. $$ \begin{align} E[X + c] &= \sum_x (x + c) \, p(x) \\ &= \sum_x x \,p(x) + \sum_x c \, p(x) \\ &= \sum_x x \,p(x) + c \sum_x p(x) & \text{move } c \text{ outside of the summation}\\ &= \sum_x x \,p(x) + c & \text{because by definition } \sum_x p(x) = 1\\ &= E[X] + c \end{align} $$ In the universal basic income example, $\sum_x c$ would be equal to \$24,000 times the number of citizens, and $p(x) = 1/N$ where $N$ is the number of citizens. But as the math above shows, it would be the same if $p(x)$ would differ for every $x$ ‡ . Sum of two random variables If $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables, then $$ E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y] $$ Example: Let's say that you are interested what is your average consumption of salt and sugar (daily total in grams). You could calculate this by looking at your diet every day, for every meal checking how much sugar it contained, adding it to the amount of salt it contained, summing up to daily totals, and then looking at the average of those daily totals. Alternatively, you could create an Excel sheet where in one column you collect the amount of salt per meal, in another the amount of sugar, then calculate separate daily totals for consumed sugar and salt, calculate averages of those, and sum the two averages. They would be the same. The order of how you sum them should not matter. $$ \begin{align} E[X + Y] &= \sum_x \sum_y (x + y) \, p(x, y) \\ &= \sum_x \sum_y x \, p(x, y) + \sum_x \sum_y y \, p(x, y) \\ &= \sum_x x \sum_y p(x, y) + \sum_y y \sum_x p(x, y) \\ &= \sum_x x \, p(x) + \sum_y y \, p(y) & \text{by the law of total probability} \\ &= E[X] + E[Y] \end{align} $$ where $p(x, y)$ is the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ . This is possible by the law of total probability , which tells us that summing over all possible values gives us the marginal distribution $\sum_x p(x,y) = p(y)$ . Finally, keep in mind that the expected value is linear, but this is not the case for every statistic. For example, the median isn't . † The same results would hold for continuous variables if you replace things like $\sum_x x \, p(x)$ with $\int_x x \, p(x) \, dx$ , because integrals follow similar rules in this case. ‡ If the "every person" and "everyday" examples don't appeal to you because the $p(x)$ probabilities they use are uniform, consider that you could group the people (or days) in the examples into some groups and calculate things per group. In such a case, $p(x)$ would not be $1/N$ anymore, but rather $n_i/N$ , where $n_i$ is the number of people in each group. Calculating things with such groups would be the same as with raw data if all the people within the group are the same.
