Xcode won't let go a resource file

My question today is about how Xcode deals with resource files in the app bundle which it creates. I know that it may be trivial, but I can't find an easy way out. Basically my problem is that Xcode seems to keep on including a resource file (eg a text file) in the app bundle even if the file has been removed from the project. Here it is in detail what is happening here. ⁃ Added a file to the project (both by choosing file - new file or dragging a file to the Xcode groups and files left column checking add to project folder if needed checkbox) ⁃ Compiled and launched the project in simulator ⁃ Verified that the file is present in myApp.app bundle, located in User/Library/Application/Support/iPhone Simulator/3.2/Applications/ /myApp.app and even in /myApp/build/debugiPhonesimulator/myApp.app ⁃ Deleted the file from groups and files column in Xcode ⁃ Deleted the actual file with Finder in /myApp/myFile ⁃ Deleted User/Library/Application/Support/iPhone Simulator/3.2/Applications/ /myApp.app and even /myApp/build/debugiPhonesimulator/myApp.app ⁃ Emptied the trash ⁃ Verified that there is no reference to the file with Finder spotlight ⁃ Verified that there is no reference to the file with Xcode search ⁃ Rebuilt and relaunched the app in simulator ⁃ Verified that a brand new /Library/Application/Support/iPhone Simulator/3.2/Applications/ /myApp.app has been just created ⁃ Verified the content of /Library/Application/Support/iPhone Simulator/3.2/Applications/ /myApp.app bundle: the file is still there. Where the h. did Xcode take it from? I am surely missing something really obvious. Any help?
