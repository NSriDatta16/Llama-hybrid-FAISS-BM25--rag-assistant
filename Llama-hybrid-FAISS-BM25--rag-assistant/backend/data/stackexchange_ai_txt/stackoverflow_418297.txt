WANdisco have just launched a Subversion Appliance: http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/appliance/ They have a free webinar at: http://www.wandisco.com/webinar/subversion Some of the marketing blurb: Download, Turn on, Use WANdisco's Subversion MultiSite Software Appliance provides immediate, real and tangible benefits to organizations by minimizing ongoing maintenance and administration costs and dramatically reducing deployment time. A globally distributed IT organization can literally be up and running in minutes. Just download it, turn it on, and it works. Features: Includes Subversion, Apache, a fully supported version of Linux and WANdisco's unique multi-site replication technology that allows distributed developers to collaborate at LAN-speed over a WAN, instead of working in silos. Combines the zero-latency deployment offered by hosted Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions for Subversion, with all of the flexibility, control and security of traditional behind the firewall implementations. Eliminates environmental dependencies, making installation, deployment and ongoing maintenance a snap. Fully supported Just Enough Operating System (JeOS) based on Linux provides everything needed for deployment under a VM, or on industry standard hardware. Available for any target virtualization environment including VMware ESX, Citrix XenServer, and Windows with Hyper-V. Ongoing maintenance and support are also dramatically simplified with automatic updates for all appliance components, including Subversion, Apache, Linux and WANdisco. There's no more one-off manual upgrades and patches. An entire multi-site implementation can be monitored and administered from a single location. Sites can be brought online, or taken offline for maintenance without disrupting user access. Built-in continuous hot backup and automated recovery features virtually eliminate downtime, making third party disk mirroring solutions unnecessary. Transparent implementation approach doesn't change Subversion's functionality, so no user retraining is required. Supported Supported: VMware (R) Virtual Appliance VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance Microsoft (R) VHD Virtual Appliance Citrix XenServer (TM) Appliance Virtual Iron Virtual Appliance Installable ISO/CD/DVD (directly on the server)
