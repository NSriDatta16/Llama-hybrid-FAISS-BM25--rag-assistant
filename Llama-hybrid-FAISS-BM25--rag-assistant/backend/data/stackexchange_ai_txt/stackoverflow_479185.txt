The anti-aliasing is just a feature of Silverlight; wouldn't say it looks blurry though, I quite like it. Reference wise, I don't think there's a fully blown app sample I've seen, but if you look into Model-View-ViewModel with IPropertyNotifyChanged / ObservableCollection and have a browse through the blogs of Jesse Liberty and Shawn Wildermuth they have plenty of information on data transfer and multiple page applications - both of which you'll need to do a "business app"
