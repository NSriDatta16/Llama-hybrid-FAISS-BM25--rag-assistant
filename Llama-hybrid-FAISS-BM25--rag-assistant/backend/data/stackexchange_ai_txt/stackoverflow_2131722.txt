CoreData (for iphone) storing images

i wonder if its a wise choice to store images with core data into binary property say i have a collection of movies and i want to save the image dvd cover into a property the avg size of a cover is 20/30kb (320x480px) the reason i want to do this is for storage management, once i delete the movie i know the image is also deleted i'm just not quite sure if it's a good idea, data load, speed? anyone has experience with this ?
