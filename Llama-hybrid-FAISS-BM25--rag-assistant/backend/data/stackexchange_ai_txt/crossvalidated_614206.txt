Your time series does not show any intra-week seasonality (see the seasonplot at the right below). Exponential Smoothing (as per ets() in the forecast package for R) chooses a model with no seasonality, additive errors and an additive trend with strong dampening, so the forecasts are almost flat. Since there is very little time series structure in your data, the prediction intervals are very wide (and actually go below zero, which probably does not make a lot of sense for your data). Your series does show a number of prolonged periods of low sales. It may be worthwhile figuring out what happened during these times. I believe this has a better chance of improving your forecasts than tweaking the models: How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? . In any case, you have far too little data for a ML method like LSTM to make much of a difference compared to standard time series methods.
