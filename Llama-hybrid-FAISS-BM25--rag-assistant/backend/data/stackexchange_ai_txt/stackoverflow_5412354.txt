Many of these static_cast s are unnecessary, because of automatic numeric promotion. The ones that are extremely necessary are the ones used on constructing the number 1/2, although in this case there's no obvious reason not to just say 0.5 instead. In any case a compiler that's paying attention will remove all of these and replace them with compile-time constants.
