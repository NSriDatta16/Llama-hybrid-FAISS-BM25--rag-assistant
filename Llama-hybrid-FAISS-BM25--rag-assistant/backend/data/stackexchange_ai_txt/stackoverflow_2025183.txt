Lean is more about discipline and avoiding waste - it's not really a process. It sounds to me like the issue might be more a communication one. In other words - you don't value the decisions handed to you enough to consider them valid. Your reaction probably breeds a bit of hostility in your "client" and it turns into an ego challenge. First thing that jumps to mind is that your "clients" aren't dumb. It may seem confounding to you, but keep in mind that unless you blow this door down you need to find a new job at a new company where the client can put things in terms you respect. Believe it or not - I'm not trying to be harsh here, I'm just suggesting that the communication isn't flowing, and it sounds to me like you're saying "I'm not getting what I need". It's great that you're trying to improve your process, but no process will change this: "I feel like I'm beating my head against a brick wall sometimes." and "he need to encourage our [company's internal] client to put thought into their requirements up front and make a bigger effort to ensure that they're fixed before providing them to my development team to start on." ... says to me that 1) You're frustrated and 2) you don't respect what they're doing. I've worked their before - I hate it. And I moved on - it was my only solution. However if you like the job and the people you work with, process won't fix anything - personal skills will. This is where you break from a "dev" to something more - a pro (which you already are - I just mean a bigger one). Get to know the business side more. Try out DDD practices and the ubiq. lang thing so you know more about what might be coming, and what might change. In this economic climate you can't have a long straight road - you'll need to adapt and change as your business does. Good luck!
