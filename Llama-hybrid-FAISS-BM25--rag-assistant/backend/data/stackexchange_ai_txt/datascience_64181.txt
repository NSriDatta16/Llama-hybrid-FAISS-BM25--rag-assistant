Training machine learning models from log files

Im starting to learn about ml and most of examples show very simple examples on how to train your ml modell. For me this looks more like statistic calculations than actual ml. These kind of examples could very easily been written in sql server etc. What Im looking for is the ml to find pattern within data that i dont know about. For example supose i have a lot of devices which is logging temperature, humidity, hours used and much more. At some point these devices fails for some unknown reason and Will be marked as "failed" So what om looking for is if there is a way to use ml to analyze all the log files and find common patterns to why these devices failed, without me have to "tell it what to look for first" in this way I Will be able to predict feature failures based on log files. Would this be something I can use ml for and would Azure be a good starting point for this?
