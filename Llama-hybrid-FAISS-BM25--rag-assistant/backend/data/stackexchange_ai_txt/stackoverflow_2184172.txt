When cin is used to read in strings, it automatically breaks at whitespace unless you specify otherwise. std::string s; std::cin >> noskipws >> s; Alternatively, if you want to get a whole line then use: std::getline(cin, s); You'll also want to allocate storage for a raw char array, but with C++ you should use std::string or std::wstring anyway.
