Your understanding is correct: in a Bayesian network, each node represents a random variable, which can have a multivariate probability distribution. The main reason to use a Bayesian network is that you have information (or other reasons) that helps you formulate conditional independence between certain variables, given others. You could definitely represent any number of random variables as a one-node Bayesian network, where the one node describes the full joint probability distribution over all the variables. In practice, you obviously wouldn't do this because it would generally be computationally intractable to work with a full joint distribution over many variables. Hope this helps! P.S. not really an answer to your question, but I personally found the Coursera specialization on Probabilistic Graphical Models to be quite informative.
