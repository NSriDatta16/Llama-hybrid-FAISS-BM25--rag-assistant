Data Synthesis based on Deep Learning

Is there any open source tool available to synthetically generate a new dataset with the same statistics than the original one? The objective is to create a new tabular dataset that is private but with the same distribution of the parent one. Unfortunately, I could only find Generative Adversarial Networks for images.
