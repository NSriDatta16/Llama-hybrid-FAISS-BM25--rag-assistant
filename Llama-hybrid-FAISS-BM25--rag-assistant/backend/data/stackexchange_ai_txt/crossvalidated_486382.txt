Comparing salaries of people doing the same job

How do you compare salaries of two groups (male and female) of workers doing the same job, in order to see if there is a statistically significant difference between their pay? I've been reading around about this a lot, but lots of the information out there only looks at very broad groups ie across a whole company or economy. But what if you are interested in looking for a difference between male and female workers who are doing the same job (or have jobs placed within the same grade ie within the same smaller range of pay)? Any statistical difference could then be used to raise inferences of potential discrimination, but only is significant. EDIT: the data that I have relate to a large group of employees. They are all on grade 7. This grade includes lots of different sorts of jobs, but for these purposes difference in jobs is irrelevant. Within this pay grade, there are different pay scales, so people are paid according to a range ie pay point 1-5. Where someone is placed within the pay point is determined by length of service but also human decision making. Jobs that have been graded the same should be paid the same, so my aim is to see if there is any difference between the average grade 7 man and average grade 7 woman. If there is, discrimination could be inferred. My starting point for a test of these two groups was ANOVA, but the normality assumption might not apply to salary data. (It might, but might not; at the broad level, salary data is often lognormal, but that might not be the case at this closer level). You also need groups to be the same size (or at least, close to the same size as the test's power is lost when sizes become more uneven). I've then looked at Mann Whiney U test since this is distribution agnostic and doesn't matter about differently sized groups. This isn't a test I'm familiar with but I understand you are only really looking here at the median not mean. Is this right? Does anyone have any suggestions for appropriate tests (ideally using the mean)? Am I right that ANOVA might not be suitable for the reasons outlined?
