I will like to stress a few points already mentioned and give a few references. 1) STICK TO THE 1989 ANSI C STANDARD WITH NO OPTIMIZATION. 2) Don't worry, with proper guidance, good organization and a fair amount of hard work this is doable. 3) Read the The C Programming Language cover to cover. 4) Understand important concepts of compiler development from the Dragon Book . 5) Take a look at lcc both the code as well as the book . 6) Take a look at Lex and Yacc (or Flex and Bison) 7) Writing a C compiler (up to the point it can self compile) is a rite of passage ritual among programmers. Enjoy it.
