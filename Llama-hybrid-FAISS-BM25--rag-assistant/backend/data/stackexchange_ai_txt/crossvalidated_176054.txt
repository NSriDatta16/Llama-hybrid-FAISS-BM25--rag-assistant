How to monitor and alert on sparse event data?

To give you an idea of what I'm dealing with, I calculated the average time between events for each of our customers. The lowest is 24 seconds and the highest is 689,014 seconds. Yes, 7 days. I'm building a single dashboard that monitors all these events and will eventually alert when a feed is "down". This poses an obvious problem. Right now what I'm doing is getting the last 50 events and using the difference between the oldest one and now to establish a "threshold" of sorts. I'm then saying "how many messages sent during threshold". If this hits zero, I consider it an alarm. I'm sure there's a better way to do this. What is it? Maybe use the average-time-between-events above + 50% or something? I doubt there's some magic number, but any advice would be appreciated.
