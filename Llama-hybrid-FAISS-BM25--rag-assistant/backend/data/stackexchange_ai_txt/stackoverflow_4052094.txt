Posting data to a service

I have created a SampleItem just to test: public class SampleItem { public string Name { get; set; } } and the method that I calling from th service looks like this: public void send(SampleItem s) { String siteName = s.Name; } And I am debugging this method, What I can notice is that the "s (sampleitem is null)" This is the data I am sending trough fiddler: { "SampleItem" : { "Name": "MyComp"} } I don't know what I am doing wrong, Request headers: User-Agent: Fiddler Content-type: application/json Host: localhost:30677 Content-Length: 54
