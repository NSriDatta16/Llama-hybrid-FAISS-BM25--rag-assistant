BMI at baseline & followup with exposure at baseline; model change or BMI at FUP? Control for BMI baseline?

For a prospective occupational cohort where everyone is exposed to one or more chemical agents, examining BMI at follow-up compared to a specific chemical exposure at baseline, is it necessary to control for baseline BMI? Is it better to model change in BMI or BMI at followup? There is no unexposed group -- just cohort members unexposed to some agents versus others. All analyses are within-cohort.
