Well..i see no problem is merging them together...Having all the info in a single document will improve performance..And that is one of the reasons Document oriented databases are liked these days.. Nesting information is encouraged. You don't have fixed schema.. And you can nest information within information. This is something you can't do easily using mysql. So go ahead, join them all up in a single collection. p.s. do pass me the db dump if you don't mind :)
