From Wiki : Protocol Weaknesses - No mutual authentication; client does not verify server. - Offline dictionary attack to recover password feasible after capturing a successful CRAM-MD5 protocol exchange. - Use of MD5 insufficient. - Carries server requirement for storage of reversibly encrypted passwords. I'd be scared to use md5 hashing algorithm, as getting back the original password from hash can be done in few seconds, if password wasn't long enough (actually, you can google for md5 rainbow table, there are sites that will decode such hash in few seconds and give back the result ;) ).
