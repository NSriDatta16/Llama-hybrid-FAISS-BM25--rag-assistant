Estimate the average length of a line in the log - call it N bytes. Seek backwards from the end of the file by 1000 * 1.10 * N (10% margin for error in the factor 1.10). Read forward from there, keeping just the most recent 1000 lines. The question was asked - which function or module? Built-in function seek looks to me like the tool to use?
