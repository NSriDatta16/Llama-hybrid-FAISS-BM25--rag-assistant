JSON Asynchronous Application server?

First let me explain the data flow I need Client connects and registers with server Server sends initialization JSON to client Client listens for JSON messages sent from the server Now all of this is easy and straightforward to do manually, but I would like to leverage a server of some sort to handle all of the connection stuff, keep-alive, dead clients, etc. etc. Is there some precedent set on doing this kind of thing? Where a client connects and receives JSON messages asynchronously from a server? Without using doing manual socket programming?
