Font embedding through CSS, using @font-face . Webkit/Safari has been supporting it since version 3.1, Microsoft since IE4, Mozilla since Firefox 3.5 ( browser support overview ). Also, the varied implementations of the Selectors API , which provides a browser-native CSS selector engine for use in DOM scripting. For other examples, When Can I Use... seems to be a very good reference.
