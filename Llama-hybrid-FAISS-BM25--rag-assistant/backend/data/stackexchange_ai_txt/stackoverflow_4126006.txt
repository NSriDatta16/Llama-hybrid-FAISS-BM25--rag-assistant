If you want to do it using code, SPWebConfigModification will be a good choice because that will take care of web.config modifications across all front end web servers in your farm. Doing it via PowerShell is almost like modifying it manually which is discouraged practice for SharePoint enviornment. If you are using FEATURES, you may want to put your code in Feature Receivers. If declarative modifications serves your need, you may prefer that (over code approach) as well. Entries like SafeControl are natively supported by Feature framework which should be the first choice for such entries. Another variation of declarative modifications is via supplemental .config file as described below: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms460914.aspx
