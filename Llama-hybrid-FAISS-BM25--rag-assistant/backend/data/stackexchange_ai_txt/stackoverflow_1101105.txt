Generally this problem is solved by installing a Windows service which runs as SYSTEM or an administrator account. Then your application can request the privileged action from this service. Obviously to not pose a security threat ensure that your service can't run arbitrary code or something which might leave the all users vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. WinPcap and most of the other sniffing applications use a similar design to give sniffing access to unprivileged users. Install your service during the first run (or in the installer, which will require an UAC prompt). I will have to read up on this but I don't have access to my source so this would be a problem.
