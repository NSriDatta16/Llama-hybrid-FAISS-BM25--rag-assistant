Php 5.2 vulnerablilities

I currently have a web server running PHP 5.2.13 and have recently been told: Synopsis : The remote web server uses a version of PHP that is affected by multiple flaws. Description : According to its banner, the version of PHP 5.2 installed on the remote host is older than 5.2.15. Such versions may be affected by several security issues : A crash in the zip extract method. A possible double free exists in the imap extension. (CVE-2010-4150) An unspecified flaw exists in 'open_basedir'. (CVE-2010-3436) A possible crash could occur in 'mssql_fetch_batch()'. A NULL pointer dereference exists in 'ZipArchive::getArchiveComment'. (CVE-2010-3709) A crash exists if anti-aliasing steps are invalid. (Bug #53492) A crash exists in pdo_firebird getAttribute(). (Bug 53323) A user-after-free vulnerability in the Zend engine when a '_ set()', ' _get()', '_ isset()' or ' _unset()' method is called can allow for a denial of service attack. (Bug #52879 / CVE-2010-4697) A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the 'imagepstext()' function in the GD extension. (Bug 53492 / CVE-2010-4698) An error exists when processing invalid XML-RPC requests that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. (bug #51288) (CVE-2010-0397) An error exists in the function 'fnmatch' that can lead to stack exhaustion. An error exists in the sqlite extension that could allow arbitrary memory access. A memory corruption error exists in the function 'substr_replace'. The following functions are not properly protected against function interruptions : addcslashes, chunk_split, html_entity_decode, iconv_mime_decode, iconv_substr, iconv_mime_encode, htmlentities, htmlspecialchars, str_getcsv, http_build_query, strpbrk, strstr, str_pad, str_word_count, wordwrap, strtok, setcookie, strip_tags, trim, ltrim, rtrim, parse_str, pack, unpack, uasort, preg_match, strrchr, strchr, substr, str_repeat (CVE-2010-1860, CVE-2010-1862, CVE-2010-1864, CVE-2010-2097, CVE-2010-2100, CVE-2010-2101, CVE-2010-2190, CVE-2010-2191, CVE-2010-2484) The following opcodes are not properly protected against function interruptions : ZEND_CONCAT, ZEND_ASSIGN_CONCAT, ZEND_FETCH_RW (CVE-2010-2191) The default session serializer contains an error that can be exploited when assigning session variables having user defined names. Arbitrary serialized values can be injected into sessions by including the PS_UNDEF_MARKER, '!', character in variable names. A use-after-free error exists in the function 'spl_object_storage_attach'. (CVE-2010-2225) I'm not using a lot of these e.g. mssql_fetch_batch(), pdo_firebird getAttribute... Basically I curious to know if this is all a major concern? Thanks,
