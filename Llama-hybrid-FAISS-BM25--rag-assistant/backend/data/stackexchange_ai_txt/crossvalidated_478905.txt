I know this is an old question but I've recently found this to be problematic with my work. This issue has occurred for me when trying to overfit in regression analysis. If I purposefully try to overfit a regression line, my function crashes and responds: Error in solve.default(t(X) %*% X) : system is computationally singular:reciprocal condition number = 2.47244e-21 If I add the constraint toll = NULL in the solve() command within my function it allows me to overfit the line and to obtain any parameters of interest. To answer the first question, for me this was an academic exercise and could be useful if you're analysing new control algorithms in engineering, or creating your own algorithms for the purpose of machine learning. For the second question; it's useful in some cases to modify the constraint, but I'd recommend doing so on a case by case basis
