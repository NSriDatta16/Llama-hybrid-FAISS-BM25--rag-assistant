How to improve performance for Android/iOS/etc to consume web service?

We are planning a a project. Basically we have tons of restful services sitting on our server. These restful services will return XML as data type. We will build apps on various mobile platforms, like Adroid/iOS/possible others. The app potentially need to call those restful services quite frequently. Since we are in the planning stage, I am wondering whether anyone here has insights about performance regarding different mobile platforms. For example, on the mobile platforms we assume that weâ€™ll need to return data in a very efficient manner. We can compress data differently for particular mobile platform. Or any other possible differences we need to pay attention to those mobile platforms when consuming restful service?
