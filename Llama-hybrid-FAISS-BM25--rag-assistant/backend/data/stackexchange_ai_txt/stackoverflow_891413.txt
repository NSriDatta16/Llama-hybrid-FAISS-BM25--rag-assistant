Well there is a much more elegant way to do it. Unfortunately, it's not a Core Java/Swing approach. You can use SwingBuilder in Groovy to achieve the same result, using slightly more terse syntax, e.g. psuedo code: button(text: '' + counter, actionPerformed: {counter--; text = '' + counter + ''}, constraints:BL.SOUTH) [ http://groovy.codehaus.org/Swing+Builder][1] I wouldn't use this in your assignment though, I've seen students really deviate from the norm and get marked down for it, but at least you can include it as a possible avenue to investigate further. I think what you have at present is absolutely fine though.
