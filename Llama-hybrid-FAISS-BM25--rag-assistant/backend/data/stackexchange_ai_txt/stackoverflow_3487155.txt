jQueryUI sortable,draggable revert event

I have a problem with jQuqeryUI. I would like to run some code whenever an element is dragged and dropped on an invalid target. As far as I can see, there is no predefined event for this, but I have thought about combining information from following events: over, out, remove and stop, to achieve this. However that might sound like it's going to be a mess, is there a cleaner way yo do it?
