Your second paragraph is like a softball pitch for the git crowd. Git is definitely my suggested choice. Honestly, any Distributed Revision Control System (ex. Mercurial) would be fine too, but git is just my (and many other developers') hammer in the toolbox. You don't need to go through the headaches of managing a separate subversion repository for each developer; a DRCS has that feature baked right in. Each developer clones the master repository, performs work and commits/branches/etc as much as they'd like on their local machine. Then when they are ready to promote code for others to view, they push all their revisions/branches back to your internal repository. I've honestly only been using git for a few months, but I'll never go back to subversion now. You can get plenty of great information from the Pro Git Book -- Free viewing online, but please buy it for reference if you find it helpful!
