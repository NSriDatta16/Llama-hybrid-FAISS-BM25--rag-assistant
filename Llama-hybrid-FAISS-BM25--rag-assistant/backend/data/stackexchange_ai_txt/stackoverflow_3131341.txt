local folder files not taking, taking only core files (magento)

i wanted to change the catalogsearch result file so i created a catalogsearch folder in the "code\local\mage" folder but the changes made here are not being seen at all the program directly checks into the "code\core\mage" folder, i am very confused why it is only taking the files of the core files only and not taking the files on the local folder , any help could be very much appreciated , :)
