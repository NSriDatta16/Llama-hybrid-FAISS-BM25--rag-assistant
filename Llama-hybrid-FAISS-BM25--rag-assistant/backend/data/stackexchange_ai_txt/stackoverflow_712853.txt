Modifying values with XSLT

I have XML file with values expressed in SI unit (m, N). I use an XSLT document to transform it into HTML page where I would like to display values with other units (um, mN). Is there a way to modify values I extract from my XML document using XSLT without modifying XML content before XSLT processing ? Thanks in advance for your help Bertrand Just to notice to others interesting in. I'm developing in Python, and lxml library allow you to call extensions in XSLT. http://lxml.de/extensions.html
