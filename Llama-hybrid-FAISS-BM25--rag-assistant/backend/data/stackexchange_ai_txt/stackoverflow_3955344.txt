Redefining :all

I have users in my system that can elect to 'hibernate', at which point they can remove themselves and all of their associated records entirely from the system. I have queries all over my site that search within the User table and its associated tables (separated by as many as 5 intermediate tables), and none explicitly test whether the user is hibernating or not. Is there a way to redefine the User set to non-hibernating users only, so all my current queries will work without being changed individually? How can I most elegantly accomplish what I'm trying to do?
