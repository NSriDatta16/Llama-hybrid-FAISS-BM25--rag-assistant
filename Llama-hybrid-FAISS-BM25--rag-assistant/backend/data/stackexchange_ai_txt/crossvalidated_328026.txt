Your interpretation of what a moderator analysis would do may be correct if you have set up the contrasts appropriately. If you are using the defaults it is not what they do. Bear in mind that if you have $k$ levels of a factor then there are only $k-1$ independent comparisons so doing all pair-wise needs careful thought and interpretation. You analyses seem to reveal that you have a high degree of heterogeneity as far as I can tell although your plots are barely readable at least on my screen. You might like to investigate that heterogeneity first as the random effects model does not estimate a single overall effect size but rather the mean and variance of the distribution of effect sizes. Your suggestion of computing a summary proportion would be averaging things which your data-set suggests are different.
