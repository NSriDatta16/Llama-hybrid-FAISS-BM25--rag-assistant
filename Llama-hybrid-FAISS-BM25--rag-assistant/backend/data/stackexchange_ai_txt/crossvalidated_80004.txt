Difficulty to intrepret pvclust results - only many low level tree clusters appear as significant

I'm trying to assess the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. It is a dataset composed of 409 observations and 27 variables (with a value ranging form 0 to 100). The dataset represents immunohistochemical scores in a gastrointestinal cancers. A meaninful clustering of observations and markers is observed with Pearson uncentered distance and average linkage. hc However, when using pvclust to assess their uncertainty, many small low-levels subclusters are highlighted as significant, but not any higher level one. Also, a group of tumours (to the right in the plots) is indeed a control group that should be clearly distinguished at the highest level from the other ones. pvclust shows even there the same kind of pattern. Indeed the clusters of interest are the magenta, green and red in the color bar. Does this pvclust results support their existance (versus a clustering artefact by chance)? How could these pvclust results be interpreted? Maybe I am using the tool in a wrong way? Or the wrong tool for this kind of data? Thank you very much in advance.
