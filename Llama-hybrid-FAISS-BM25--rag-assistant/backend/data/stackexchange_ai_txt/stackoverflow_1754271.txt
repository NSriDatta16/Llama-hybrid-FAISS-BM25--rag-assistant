Which .net architecture should I implement for 10,000 concurrent users for web application

I need to create a web application for tasks delegation, monitor and generate reports for a organization. I am thinking about ASP.Net and MVC should be the architecture to support so many concurrent users. Is there any other better architecture that I should be looking for ? What kind of server configuration will require to hold this application ? How do I test so many users connected before I launch this application, is there any free/economical testing tools available ? Thanks in advance. anil
