The baseline hazard rate $h_0(t)$ is hard to estimate (takes smoothing), but the baseline cumulative hazard $H_0(t)$ is easy. Given $H_0(t)$ you can estimate an individual survival curve by $$\log S(t;z) = H(t;z) = H_0(t)e^{\beta z}$$ Basically any survival analysis software will both let you get individual survival estimates and also compute the Breslow-Aalen estimator of $H_0$ $$\hat{H}_0(t)=\int_0^t\frac{dN(s)}{\sum_i e^{\beta z_i}Y_i(s)}$$ This is like the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard for a group, except that the denominator is not the number at risk but a weighted number at risk using the individual hazard ratios as weights. You do need to check whether your specific software defines $H_0(t)$ as the cumulative hazard when all covariates are zero or (more conveniently) as the cumulative hazard when all covariates are equal to the baseline averages. In R, you want predict.coxph .
