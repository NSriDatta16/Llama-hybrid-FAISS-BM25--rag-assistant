Extract the most important for description of the object real values

I want to implement convolutional neural network for extracting real values of the features from the image. I understand that metric learning network tries to learn the most important things of the objects and then it outputs a vector of the abstract descriptors which should be almost the same for the same objects, but how can I get vector of the most important real-world values(e.g. width, area or color of the some local feature, so changing width of something on the image should change only responsible for it value or values) instead of this abstract vector, using something similar to the ResNet or another architecture? I already tried to search something about this type of metrics or features extraction but it's nothing. Also as I said it's not only metric extraction, net should find(as ResNet do it) and output non-abstract descriptors. I understand that computer sees only pixels and so on, but in the learning process neural net learns the most important for description of the objects metrics, so these metrics should be some real-world values(or could be simply converted into them). Of course any help or hints from you will be very useful!
