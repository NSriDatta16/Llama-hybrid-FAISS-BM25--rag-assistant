Do more object classes increase or decrease the accuracy of object detection

Assume you have an object detection dataset (e.g, MS COCO or Pascal VOC) with N images where k object classes have been labeled. You train a neural network (e.g., Faster-RCNN or YOLO) and measure the accuracy (e.g., IOU@0.5). Now you introduce x additional object classes and add the corresponding labels to your original dataset giving you a dataset with N images where k+x object classes have been labeld. Will the accuracy of the trained network increase or decrease? To be more specific, we have a traffic sign dataset with around 20 object classes. Now we are thinking about adding additional traffic sign classes (labeling the new classes, without adding new images or changing our network architecture) and we are wondering if this will increase of decrease performance. On the one hand I think more object classes will make distinction between classes harder. Additionally, a neural network can only hold a limited amount of information, meaning if the number of classes becomes very large there might just not be enough weights to cope with all classes. On the other side, more object classes means more labels which may help the neural network. Additionally, transfer learning effects between classes might increase the accuracy of the network. In my opinion there should be some kind of sweet-spot for each network architecture but I could not find any literature, research or experiments about this topic.
