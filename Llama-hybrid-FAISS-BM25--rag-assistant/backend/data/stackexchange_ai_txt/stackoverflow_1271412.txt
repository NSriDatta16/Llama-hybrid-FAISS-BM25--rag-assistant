Doctrine queries take over 4 seconds to execute

We're in the last stage of a project and started optimizing it. After a few tests, we realized that most (if not all) of the time spent loading a page, is spent in Doctrine. Out of 5 seconds page load, 3 - 4 seconds are spent only on 2 Doctrine queries. We've enabled query cache on the mysql server and on Doctrine as well as result cache, but this only seems to make the load times worse. As far as I can gather, the mysql query cache is active: [edit] for some reason the rest of my question has vanished so I am posting it again[/edit] Qcache_free_blocks | 57 Qcache_free_memory | 22300072 Qcache_hits | 7117 Qcache_inserts | 3308 Qcache_lowmem_prunes | 0 Qcache_not_cached | 4537 Qcache_queries_in_cache | 1225 Qcache_total_blocks | 2609 The problem is that the cache doesn't seem to be hit, the query that takes most of the time (3 seconds on average) never changes. Does anyone have any tips on why enabling query / result caching wouldn't improve load times?
