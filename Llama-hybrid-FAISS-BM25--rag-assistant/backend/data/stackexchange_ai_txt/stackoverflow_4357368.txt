There is a way to save relatively large files to a users hard drive if you are willing to use Flash. Look into Downloadify: http://www.bitrepository.com/downloadify-client-side-file-generation.html Downloadify allows you to send data to a SWF and have that SWF create a file on the users machine. My recommendation would be to store the data via one of the methods you listed, Webstorage, sqlite database, etc. Put all your assets, including the SWF in the manifest file so everything is cached locally to the browser. You can then pull information from your db or webstorage and use the SWF to create the files you need. I'm not sure if you will be able to read these files back into your web application. Another option to save data is by using link tags with the data URI scheme . However, I'm not sure if it is supported in all the major browsers at the moment.
