I tried loading the xml using .Net HttpWebRequest and also tried setting the userAgent property. But its still giving me the error message: "Unable to connect to the remote server" The xml is however accesible through the browser. Here is the code: HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(URL); request.UserAgent ="Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)"; string result = string.Empty; using (HttpWebResponse response = request.GetResponse() as HttpWebResponse) { // Get the response stream StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()); // Read the whole contents and return as a string result = reader.ReadToEnd(); } Thanks.
