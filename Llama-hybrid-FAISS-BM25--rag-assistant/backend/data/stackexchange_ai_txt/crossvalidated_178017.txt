The AR parameter is an auto regression parameter, which can certainly be outside the unit interval (yielding rather nonstationary time series). If you write ar=-0.5 instead of Ar=-0.5 (R is case sensitive!), you will likely get closer to what you are looking for. Try this a couple of times (to account for randomness): print(acf(arima.sim(model=list(ar=-0.5),n=400)))
