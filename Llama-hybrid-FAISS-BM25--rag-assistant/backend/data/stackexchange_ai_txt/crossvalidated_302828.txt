Stationary series and the moving mean

I have a time series based on 'power', as given by a sensor. The power changes as the thing it is measuring changes, typically with the distance of the thing being measured from the sensor. If I understand correctly, a time series is not stationary if the mean changes over time. Since this thing we are measuring spends time at various distances from the sensor, the mean of the power changes (the thing being measured moves around pretty much randomly). I'm interested in how the power changes, which directly affects how the mean changes. Is it true I cannot treat this series like a stationary series?
