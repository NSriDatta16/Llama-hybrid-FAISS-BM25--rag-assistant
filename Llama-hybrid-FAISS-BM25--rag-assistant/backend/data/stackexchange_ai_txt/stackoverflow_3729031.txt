Read the AppStore Review Guidelines Apple recently published. 2.20 Developers "spamming" the App Store with many versions of similar apps will be removed from the iOS Developer Program Additionally, I think it'd be wise to advise your client against such a move, as it will only cause fragmentation for the app. Apps have keywords, so perhaps you should focus there to increase search results. I think you'd run into some issues submitting the same app to the store under different developer accounts--not to mention that you have to have individual developer accounts to even attempt such submissions. It'd really be a headache.
