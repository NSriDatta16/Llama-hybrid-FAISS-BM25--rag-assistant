Each value from your time series is a sample from a probability distribution. You need to first find what the probability distribution is and then define what the word rare means within that distribution. So calculate the empirical cdf, and calculate the 95% confidence interval. Whenever something outside of that region has occurred, then by definition you know that it must be a rare event.
