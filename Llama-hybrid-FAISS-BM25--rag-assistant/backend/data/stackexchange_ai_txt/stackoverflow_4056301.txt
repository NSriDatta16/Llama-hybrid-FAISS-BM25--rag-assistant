Which one to choose - Android 1.5 or Android 2.2? (I am a beginner)

I want to start programming in Android. I have backgrounds in Java and j2me. As I am new and have budget constraints I was willing to purchase HTC G1 (1.5 cupcake) rather than any 2.2 device. Is that a good idea? (or let me know if there is any lowcost (around $200) 2.2 device) Please give your opinion. Thanks
