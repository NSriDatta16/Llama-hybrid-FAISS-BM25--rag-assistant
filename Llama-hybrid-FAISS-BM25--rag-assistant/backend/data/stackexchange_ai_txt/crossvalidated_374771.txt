A larger sample may lead to a clearer example. The theoretical model for z-scores is the standard normal distribution. Using R, I can generate a sample of size $n = 200$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=0,\, \sigma=1).$ set.seed(1031); z = rnorm(200) mean(z); sd(z) [1] -0.05595964 # aprx E(Z) = 0 [1] 1.014472 # aprx SD(Z) = 1 The sample mean $\bar Z = -0.056$ is nearly the same as the population mean $\mu = 0$ and the sample standard deviation $S = 1.014$ is nearly the same as the population standard deviation $\sigma = 1.$ (I could 'standardize' by taking $\frac{Z_i - (-0.056)}{1.014},$ but that would not make much difference in the values, and is not necessary for our demonstration.) The R code below makes a histogram of the 200 observations. The tick marks below the histogram (made by rug ) show the exact locations of each of the 200 observations. The red curve is the density curve of $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=0,\, \sigma=1).$ (The histogram matches the density curve roughly; the match would be better with an even larger sample.) hist(z, prob=T, col="skyblue2", xlim=c(-3.5,3.5), main="Histogram of sample of 200 from NORM(0,1)") rug(z) curve(dnorm(x), add=T, lwd=2, col="red") From the figure we can see that only one observed value falls outside the interval $(-3,3).$ Specifically, the value -3.161 lies below -3 and no value lies above 3. z[z 3] numeric(0) Generally speaking, 99.7% of standard normal random variates lie inside $(-3,3)$ and 0.3% lie outside this interval. So that's an average of about 0.6 observations out of 200; it is no surprise that we saw only one value outside $(-3,3).$ In a sample of size $n=5$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(0,1),$ it would be rare to see any observation outside $(-3,3).$ diff(pnorm(c(-3,3))) [1] 0.9973002 Note: I'm not sure that your sample $x=(1,2,3,4,5)$ is a sample from a normal distribution, but standardizing with $\bar X$ and $S_x$ I get values between $-1.265$ and $+1.265$ --- certainly nothing close to $\pm 3.$ Normal or not, this sample is not really large enough to illustrate the idea you're exploring. x = 1:5; x [1] 1 2 3 4 5 (x - mean(x))/sd(x) [1] -1.2649111 -0.6324555 0.0000000 0.6324555 1.2649111
