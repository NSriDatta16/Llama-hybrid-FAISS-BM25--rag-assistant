Overlapping 95% confidence limits

I cam across these two old blog posts on displayed error bars and tried to work through the result. I believe I am making a mistake somewhere, but I'm not sure where. Let me describe the scenario first, and lay out my reasoning. First, the scenario: Suppose that we have a plot with the measurements of a particular quantity $x$ for two different populations, $A$ and $B$ . Let us assume that $x$ is Gaussian distributed. We find that the two measurements have means $\bar{x}_1$ , $\bar{x}_2$ . We make a plot of both measurements with their $2\sigma$ confidence limits. For simplicity, let us say that both datasets have the same standard deviation $s$ . The confidence limits overlap to some extent. The posts ask: to what extent do they overlap so that this result significant at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level? My attempt at answering this Let us construct the statistic $z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{2 s}$ . The standard deviation of $z$ is then $\sigma_z = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \bar{x}_1}\right)^2 s_1^2 + \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial \bar{x}_2}\right)^2 s_2^2} \quad = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ , since $s_1 = s_2 = s$ . Now, we can rephrase our problem as the search for a value $z_{\star}$ such that $p(-z_{\star} \leq z \leq z_{\star} )= 0.95$ , given that $z \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_z = 0, \sigma_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})$ -- i.e. the null hypothesis is that $z$ is normally-distributed about a mean of $0$ and standard deviation $1/\sqrt{2}$ . Going to Mathematica, I find that $z_{\star} \approx 1.386$ . To try to interpret what this means, let us now re-write $z = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{2s} = \frac{\Delta \bar{x}}{w}$ , where $w$ is the length of the $2\sigma$ "error bars". Reaching statistical significance when $|z| > 1.386 \; z_{\star}$ implies that we can have $|\Delta \bar{x}| \leq 1.386 \; w$ , so the "error bars" can significantly overlap. This seems at odds with the statement here that the error bars "can overlap by as much as 25% of their total length and still show a significant difference." So: where is the gap in my reasoning? (Is it in the interpretation of the standard deviation/standard error in the $t$ -test?) (Btw, I don't think the definition of 95% CLs in these posts is technically correct, with the usual mixing up of Bayesian and Frequentist interpretations. I've tried to avoid this in my question, but let me know if I can be clearer.)
