I am surprised that you don't consider us authorities. Here is a good reference: Encyclopedia of Biostatistics, Volume 2, page 1526; article titled "Fisher, Ronald Aylmer." Starting at the bottom of the first column on the page and going through most of the second column the authors Joan Fisher Box (R. A. Fisher's daughter) and A. W. F. Edwards write Fisher introduced the the fiducial argument in 1930 [11].... Controversy arose immediately. fisher had proposed the fiducial argument as an alternative to the Bayesian argument of inverse probability, which he condemned when no objective prior probability could be stated. They go on to discuss the debates with Jeffreys and Neyman (particularly Neyman on confidence intervals). The Neyman-Pearson theory of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals came out in the 1930s after Fisher's article. A key sentence followed. Later difficulties with the fiducial argument arose in cases of multivariate estimation because of the nonuniqueness of the pivotals. In the same volume of the Encyclopedia of Biostatistics there is an article pp. 1510-1515 titled "Fiducial Probability" by Teddy Seidenfeld which covers the method in detail and compares fiducial intervals to confidence intervals. To quote from the last paragraph of that article, In a 1963 conference on fiducial probability, Savage wrote 'The aim of fiducial probability ... seems to be what I term making the Bayesian omelet without breaking the Bayesian eggs.' In that sense, fiducial probability is impossible. As with many great intellectual contributions, what is of lasting value is what we learn trying to understand Fisher's insights on fiducial probability. (See Edwards[4] for much more on this theme.) His solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem, for example, was a brilliant treatment of nuisance parameters using Bayes' theorem. In this sense, "...the fiducial argument is 'learning from Fisher' [36, p.926]. Thus interpreted, it certainly remains a valuable addition to staistical lore. I think in these last few sentences Edwards is trying to put a favorable light on Fisher even though his theory was discredited. I am sure that you can find a wealth of information on this by going through these encyclopedia papers and similar ones in other statistics papers as well as biographical articles and books on Fisher.

The cocept is difficult to understand because fisher kept changing it as Seidenfeld said in his article in the Encyclopedia of Biostatistics Following the 1930 publication, during the remaining 32 years of his life, through two books and numerous articles , Fisher steadfastly held to the idea captured in (1), and the reasoning leading to it which we may call'fiducial inverse inference' then there is little wonder that Fisher caused such puzzles with his novel idea Equation (1) that Seidenfeld refers to is the fiducial distribution of the parameter $\theta$ given $x$ as $\text{fid}(\theta|x) \propto \partial F/\partial \theta$ where $F(x,\theta)$ denotes a one-parameter cumulative distribution function for the random variable $X$ at $x$ with parameter $\theta$ . At least this was Fisher's initial definition. Later it got extended to multiple parameters and that is where the trouble began with the nuisance parameter $\sigma$ in the Behrens-Fisher problem. So a fiducial distribution is like a posterior distribution for the parameter $\theta$ given the observed data $x$ . But it is constructed without the inclusion of a prior distribution on $\theta$ . I went to some trouble getting all this but it is not hard to find. We are really not needed to answer questions like this. A Google search with key words "fiducial inference" would likely show everything I found and a whole lot more. I did a Google search and found that a UNC Professor Jan Hannig has generalized fiducial inference in an attempt to improve it. A Google search yields a number of his recent papers and a powerpoint presentation. I am going to copy and paste the last two slides from his presentation below: Concluding Remarks Generalized fiducial distributions lead often to attractive solution with asymptotically correct frequentist coverage. Many simulation studies show that generalized fiducial solutions have very good small sample properties. Current popularity of generalized inference in some applied circles suggests that if computers were available 70 years ago, fiducial inference might not have been rejected. Quotes Zabell (1992) “Fiducial inference stands as R. A. Fisher’s one great failure.” Efron (1998) “Maybe Fisher’s biggest blunder will become a big hit in the 21st century!
