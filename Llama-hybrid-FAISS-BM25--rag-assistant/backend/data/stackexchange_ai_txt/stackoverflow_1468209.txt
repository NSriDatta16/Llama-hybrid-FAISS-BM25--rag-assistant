Modernize Legacy Cobol

I am constantly reading about how much Cobol code is still in production. And the main reason that it hasn't been updated into am more modern language is that it would take too long/cost too much. My question is: If there was a tool that converted Cobol to, say, Java, would any organizations find it useful? Or would they rather continue maintaining what they know already works?
