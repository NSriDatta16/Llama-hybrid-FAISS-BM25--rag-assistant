from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1) scores = cross_val_score(clf, iris.data, iris.target, cv=5) scores They are not using the whole data for cross validation as such ( it's just an illusion) When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default, the latter being used if the estimator derives from ClassifierMixin .. So it's kind of automated inside the call.. Check this kaggle kernel link
