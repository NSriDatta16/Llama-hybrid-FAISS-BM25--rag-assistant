Find the average memory consumption of an Apache Process. Divide the amount of "spare" memory you have by this number. This is your MaxClients number. When I say "Spare" memory - I don't mean "memory not in use" - I mean "Memory not in use when apache isn't running, minus about 20% for system stuff"
