How can I create an organisational chart from the google chart tools / virtualization api using a .NET DataTable?

I would like to create an organisational chart as shown here: http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/gallery/orgchart.html I can create the JSON google.visualization.DataTable string using the .NET Visualization helper library from here: http://code.google.com/p/bortosky-google-visualization/ Unfortunately with this helper library it is not possible to display a custom format message like President or Vice President for each organisational chart member as the f: key is not generated by the helper library.
