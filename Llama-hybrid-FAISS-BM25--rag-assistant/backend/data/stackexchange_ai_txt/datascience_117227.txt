Anomaly Detection for sound has been researched actively in the last years. One of the leading venues is the DCASE community . Since 2019 it has hosted a challenge on the task called Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sounds , which is based on an open dataset. The results are described as technical reports describing the proposed methods, and there have been some 20-30 papers each year: DCASE2022 Task 2 results DCASE2021 Task 2 results DCASE2022 Task 2 results There are also a set of reference implementations. These are a good starting point for building your own solution. DCASE2022 baseline using AutoEncoder DCASE2022 baseline using MobileNet
