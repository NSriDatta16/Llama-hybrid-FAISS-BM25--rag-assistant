sIFR dynamically changing the color of text onhover of parent element

I'm using sIFR to style headings and want to dynamically change the color of text (within the flash movie) onhover of parent element. How would one do this? Any examples? I have never seen it done. Bureau ICE I've tried the following which seems logical... but it doesn't work. It's the span.organisation in the i'm trying to change! sIFR.replace(gothamBook, { wmode: 'transparent', selector: 'span.organisation' ,css: [ '.sIFR-root { color: #d7d9e3; background-color:#61648a; letter-spacing:0.05; }' ,'a span.organisation { text-decoration: none; }' ,'a:link span.organisation { color: #d7d9e3; }' ,'a:hover span.organisation { color: #ffffff; }' ] });
