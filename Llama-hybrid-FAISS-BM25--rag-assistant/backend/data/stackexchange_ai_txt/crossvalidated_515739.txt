Question regarding limiting probability

Does there exist an irreducible discrete time Markov chain such that all limiting probabilities exist, i.e. $\lim\limits_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(X_k = i)$ exists for all states $i$ , and $\sum_{i} \lim\limits_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(X_k = i) = \frac{1}{2}$ ? I'm currently stuck here and not sure how to prove/disprove this. Is there any suggestion on how I should proceed?
