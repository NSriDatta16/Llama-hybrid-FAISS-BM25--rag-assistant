Normality and homoscedasticity are lacking: Is transformation necessary?

I'm a student and I'm very new at this so I wanted to ask what to do. I have a data set and one of the groups didn't pass Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p value = 0.01) but testing with model residuals everything looks alright (p value = 0.49). Another problem is with homoscedasticity because it barely passes Levene's test (p value = 0.047) and studentized Breusch-Pagan test (p value = 0.089). My supervisor told me I'll need to normalize and transform the variable. I can't use log transformation because some of the values are 0 (and it gives me -Inf which I cannot use in further tests) so I did square root transformation. While the p values in homoscedasticity tests improved, the p values normality tests became worse. So my question was do I need a different transformation method? If so, which one? But after reading some more I found out that "...your data don't have to be perfectly normal and homoscedastic; parametric tests aren't extremely sensitive to deviations from their assumptions." ( McDonald, J.H. 2014. Handbook of Biological Statistics (3rd ed.) ). So, are the transformations really necesary in this case? Everything I've done in detail (and in R code): mydata % dplyr::mutate(group = factor(group, ordered = FALSE)) mydata %>% group_by(group) %>% dplyr::summarize( p_value = shapiro.test(y) $p.value, statistic = shapiro.test(y)$ statistic ) model_anova shapiro_test(residuals) rstatix::levene_test(y ~ group, data = mydata) lmtest::bptest(model_anova)
