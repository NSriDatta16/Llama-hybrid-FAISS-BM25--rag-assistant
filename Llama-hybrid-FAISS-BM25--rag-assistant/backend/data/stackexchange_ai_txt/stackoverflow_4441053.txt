Server Error in '/' Application. The resource cannot be found. (ASP.NET mvc 2 + built in web server)

I'm trying to make a MVC 2 web application for a small portal. I started with the template in VS 2010 and made several other .aspx pages (for views) Index.aspx (was a part of the template) opens like he should open, but when I click on a link to acces another aspx page (that I added to the template) he show me this: Server Error in '/' Application. The resource cannot be found. Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly. Requested URL: /Views/AccountPages/Aanvragen.aspx Version Information: Microsoft .NET Framework Version:4.0.30319; ASP.NET Version:4.0.30319.1 When I set Aanvragen.aspx as startup page, he show me the same message. I use a built in server (VS2010). Of course, I checked if the url is correct and it is. So that is certaintly not the problem Anyone that could help me ? Thanks a lot
