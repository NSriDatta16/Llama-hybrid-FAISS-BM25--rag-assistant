Boolean Logic Simplification Issue

I hate this stuff. Just to note. + means OR * means AND ! means NOT. (A+B) * (A+C) * (!B + !C) (A | B) & (A | C) & (!B | !C) // more conventnal The answer is A(!B + !C) I'm trying to get there. So I start off with using Distributive rule which gets me here (A + B) * C * (!B + !C) and that's where I'm stuck. I know I some how have to get rid of B and C but I see no way using any of the rules. I've got Identity, Null, Itempotent, Inverse, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, De Morgan's, and Cancellation to work with. Am I starting off wrong? I really just used the only rule that I could see possible to even use. I was horrible with doing Proofs in Geometry and this stuff just makes me feel like that all over again.
