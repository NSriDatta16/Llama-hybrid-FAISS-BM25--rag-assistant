To answer the other three questions: Didn't find a way to make a numbered list starting with 2 Yes, this is reliable in a multiprocessor environment Yes, there is a performance penalty The "lock" prefix locks down the busses, not only for the processor, but for any external hardware, which may want to access the bus via DMA (mass storage, graphics...). So it is slow, typically ~100 clock cycles, but it may be more costly. But if you have "megabytes" of counters, chances are, you will be facing a cache miss, and in this case you will have to wait about ~100 clocks anyway (the memory access time), in case of a page miss, several hundred, so the overhead from lock might not matter.
