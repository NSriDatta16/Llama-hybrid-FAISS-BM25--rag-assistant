What's the purpose of: "using namespace"?

There are convincing arguments against using namespace std , so why was it introduced into the language at all? Doesn't using namespace defeat the purpose of namespaces? Why would I ever want to write using namespace ? Is there any problem I am not aware of that is solved elegantly by using namespace , maybe in the lines of the using std::swap idiom or something like that?
