JavaDoc plugin for eclipse?

I was looking for a javadoc plugin for eclipse so that I can document for methods etc. I know in eclipse you can do ALT + SHIFT + J but I was wondering if there was a more powerful plugin. I use GhostDoc in VS 2008 which basically when you say document it enters all the parameters and return values and even starts the paragraph for you. I was hoping for something like that in eclipse because with ALT + SHIFT + J the only this it does is install the / ***** /* lines Any help really appreciated GhostDoc isn't available for eclipse, its c# only, I use - its great. Does something exist similar for eclipse?
