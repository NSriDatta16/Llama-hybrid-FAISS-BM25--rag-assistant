R Bayesian prediction of a Gaussian process

I have a Gaussian model with mean zero, variance is arbitrary constant, and correlation function $e^{-\theta(x-x')^2}$ where $\theta$ is again an arbitrary constant. I've plotted some realizations of the above at various different locations, and now I am supposed to use observations at alternate locations to predict the others and then compute the RMSE. I think I have to use the conditional distribution somehow: $$\pmatrix {{Y}\\{Y^n}}\sim N \pmatrix {{\pmatrix {{\bf f^T}\\{\bf F}}\beta,\sigma^2\pmatrix {{1}&{\bf r^T}\\{\bf r}&\bf R}}} $$ But I really don't know how I can apply my data to this, or how I would make predictions from it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I've just read something about MCMC sampling. I think maybe that might be helpful?? I'm having trouble understanding it though.
