Statistical test to find the determinants of being in a particular group?

I have data on a population of people who have had a formal workplace issue e.g. poor performance, bullying, poor attendance etc. I want to find out if their characteristics increase the likelihood of being in this population e.g. their gender, ethnicity, disability etc. I'm wondering what technique to use. My instinct is to do a logistic regression, which I think means that I need to obtain the characteristics of the rest of the workforce who do NOT have a formal issue. But I'm wondering if there are any alternative methods which could be used - perhaps ones which didn't involve collecting data on the 'other' group which do not have a workplace issue. A second step in my analysis may be to investigate the drivers of particular types of workplace issue since some are more serious than others - poor attendance or gross misconduct. And perhaps the outcome - which could range from no formal action to dismissal. Perhaps multinomial regression would be best for that.
