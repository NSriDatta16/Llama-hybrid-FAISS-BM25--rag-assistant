My favourite is ProggyClean at 11px. I've been using it for 2-3 years and it's great for getting lots on screen without being painful to read. It deserves even more attention than the couple of mentions it's had so far: Proggy Clean http://www.proggyfonts.com/download/example_proggy_clean.gif The site has many variations including slashed zeroes, bold for function marks etc: Proggy Square http://www.proggyfonts.com/download/example_proggy_square_bp.gif (As an aside, my most-loved favourite text editor, TextPad , allows you to have different fonts and font sizes for different file types, which is a really great feature.)
