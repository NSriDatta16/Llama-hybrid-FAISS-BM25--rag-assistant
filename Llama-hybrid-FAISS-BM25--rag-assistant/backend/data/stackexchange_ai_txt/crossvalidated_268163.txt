In theory, the more variables in your model (the more complexity) means that you will need more data to train it effectively. If you do not have a lot of data than I suggest to stay clear from any deep technique. Don't just use them because they are 'hot' right now. Use deep learning models only when they are appropriate to the problem you are trying to solve. As a general rule of thumb I tend to follow the following for deep models: Data points needed = (# of features) * (# of classes) * 100 For shallow models Data points needed = (# of features) * (# of classes) * 10 This usually gives pretty reasonable results. However, in many cases, if you are trying to learn a very complex function, then you will need many more examples when you are training your deep model. I would suggest you stick to shallow machine learning techniques. Try SVM, it is one of the most powerful techniques and often fares very well.
