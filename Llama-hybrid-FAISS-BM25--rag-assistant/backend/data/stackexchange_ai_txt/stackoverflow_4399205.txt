Calculating Storage Requirements for SQL-Server CE

I've got data potentially to be pushed to SQL-ce on a 3rd party windows phone application but I don't have anywhere to conduct a test so I need to figure if we'll exceed the 4Gb max database size (many millions of records). I know the sizes of various data types but are there additional requirements for indexes, row id's, etc. Also this data will need to be synchronized/replicated so I assume every row needs a GUID or the like as well? Table1 (first 2 fields are clustered primary key) nvarchar(20) int int datetime Table2 (First field is primary key) int int datetime Table3 (First two fields are clustered primary key) int int int I have access to Sql Server (not CE) but I'm an Oracle guy and don't know my way around there very well. Any help or insight is appreciated.
