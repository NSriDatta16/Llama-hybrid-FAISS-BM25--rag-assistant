NLP: Qualitatively "positive" vs "negative" sentence

I need your help in determining the best approach for analyzing industry-specific sentences (i.e. movie reviews) for "positive" vs "negative". I've seen libraries such as OpenNLP before, but it's too low-level - it just gives me the basic sentence composition; what I need is a higher-level structure: - hopefully with wordlists - hopefully trainable on my set of data Thanks!
