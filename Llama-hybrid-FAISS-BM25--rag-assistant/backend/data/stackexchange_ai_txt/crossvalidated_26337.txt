@Charlie is right. You only have two time periods, so there will inevitably be variation in the $i$-specific sample variances of $x_{it}$. In addition, even if you have programmed the simulation for there to be homogenous effects, due to small number of periods there will inevitably be some sample correlation between $x_{it}$ and, e.g., your error term, and so there will inevitably be some "effect heterogeneity" in the $i$-specific partial relationships between $x_{it}$ and $y_{it}$. The interaction of conditional variance and effect heterogeneity tilts your FE estimates of coefficients on $x_{it}$. The coefficient on $x_{it}$ is a precision-weighted average of the $i$-specific coefficients on $x_{it}$. A different tilting occurs when you fit OLS to the model that you have specified above: now, the coefficient on $x_{it}$ is a precision weighted average of the coefficients on $x_{it}$ for the those with $treatment_i=1$ and those with $treatment_i=0$. These differences propagate to your estimates of $\beta_3$. Think Frisch-Waugh-Lovell. To demonstrate the validity of Charlie's claim, simply generate $x_{it}$'s where the variance is exactly constant for each $i$, but you still have different patterns. E.g, randomly assign $i$'s to have either $(x_{i1}, x_{i2})=(0,1)$ or $(1,0)$. If you do this, you will see that the differences between the FE and OLS estimates disappears.
