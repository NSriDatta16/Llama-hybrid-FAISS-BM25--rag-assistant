SSIS configuration options where test & production are on the same server

I'm new to SSIS, my project is still in the early stages, with only dev & test environments on separate servers. The production environment will be on the same server as test (I don't have a say in that!). I have a number of packages that each have an SQL Agent job to schedule them and I need a way to handle package configurations for dev, test & production. I know I can store 2 versions of the packages in different directories within MSDB on the same server but what is the best way to implement test & production on the same server with the least amount of manual work to deploy to production? I could deploy the packages to 2 different locations in MSDB and create a job for each package (1 for test, 1 for prod) but how do I set up package configuration so the package itself doesn't need to change between environments?
