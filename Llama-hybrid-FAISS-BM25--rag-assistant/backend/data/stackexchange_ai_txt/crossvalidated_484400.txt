So I had an opportunity to recreate the raw dataset and run the logistic regression. It does in fact, run in R and SAS, but you have a problem with what is known as "quasi-complete separation of data points." This happens when a linear combination of predictor variables completely determines or separates the outcome variable, and so the maximum likelihood does estimates do not exist. Here is the output from SAS which indicates the issue: Probability modeled is Y='1'. Model Convergence Status Quasi-complete separation of data points detected. **Warning: The maximum likelihood estimate may not exist.** Warning: The LOGISTIC procedure continues in spite of the above warning. Results shown are based on the last maximum likelihood iteration. Validity of the model fit is questionable.
