New timseries during the time period in VAR

I have six time series that are all within the topic of popular goods. Each of the series is created by different company and I would like to predict market share of the green one. I would like to use VAR model so the behavior of the other series is taken in the effect. Issue is, that red and blue series were launched after 2016, so until this point, their value is 0. It would be NA, but R does not like NAs in time series modeling) While modeling, the R is not able to simply 'skip' the time until the launch and take in account only non-zero values. Of course, zeroes in the dataframe are effecting the prediction. Is there any adaptation or improvement of VAR model, that would take in account the launch of new product during the period of modeling? Or is there any other approach for multivariate time series that is able work in this situation?
