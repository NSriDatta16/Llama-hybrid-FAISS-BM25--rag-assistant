Does this calculation have a name?

In my recurrent neural network I can calculate a confidence score of an output sequence during evaluation (ground-truth not known) using the following: Compute the softmax of each word in the output sequence Take the natural logarithm of the max probability for each word Sum the resulting values together I think this is related to maximum log likelihood, but we aren't performing cross-entropy, so I'm a bit confused at the relationship. Does this calculation that I've outlined have a name?
