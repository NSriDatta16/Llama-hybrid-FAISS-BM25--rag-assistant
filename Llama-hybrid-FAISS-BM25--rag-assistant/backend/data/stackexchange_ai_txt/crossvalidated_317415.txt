To avoid the image resizing/cropping and information retention, there is a very interesting CNN variant called Spacial Pyramid Pooling . Maybe you should give it a try. The gist is, Convolution layers don't have a restriction on image size. The restriction is because of the final Fully Connected layer. The author of the mentioned paper proposes a solution where this restriction is no longer valid. This is done using the concept of bins. One can use pre-trained model's convolution layers in SPP, in place of training model from scratch. This post gives a good description and visualization of how this binning works.
