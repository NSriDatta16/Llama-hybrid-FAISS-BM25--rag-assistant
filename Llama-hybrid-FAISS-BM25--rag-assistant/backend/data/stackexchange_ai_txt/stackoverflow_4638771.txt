This is what I do Eclipse 3.6 and my Java projects. Just a drag and drop from the package explorer to the class or sequence diagram. Really cool. -broken link to image removed- For usecases which are an UML object and not an Java object I drag and drop the usecases from the model explorer. I also sometimes create a class and add Usecase as stereotype. It means that my class diagram can have usecase which are related to a class. It does the job and pretty easy.
