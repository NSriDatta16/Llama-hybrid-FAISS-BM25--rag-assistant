Adding C# web app to a web site with IIS6

I finished my very first C# project in VS 2008 and it is working well now. But now I need to publish this project onto my new website. This project is a web application that interacts with my SQL Server 2008 Adventureworks database on this same computer(XP Professional OS). I am running IIS 6.0 Manager, but I am a newbie to both IIS 6.0 and VS 2008. I began by right-clicking the application in VS and selecting "Publish", but I've just selected File System, cause choosing Local IIS forces me to enter Username and password. The problem is that I can't open this website from IIS without it prompting me for username and password. I have modified machine.config file several times in the processModel section, by setting username="D610-M\ASPNET", password="AutoGenerate". But this makes me enter built-in password when I try to view it. And I don't know what built-in ASPNET password is. When I cancel this password popup, it returns: HTTP 401.1 "You are not authorized to view this page." And I've reset the ASPNET password several times. First I tried setting it to a password I knew, then I ran the aspnet_regiis command to reinitialize it. I also tried substituting other usernames and passwords, but none of them have worked. I even tried entering "SYSTEM" for username and AutoGenerate password, but even this prompts me to enter password. I have added the ASPNET user Read/Write/List permissions to all relevant folders. And I tried to create a new website pointing to http://localhost/[AppName] , but this forces me to enter password. So no getting around that password. I have modified Properties for Default Website in IIS: Home Directory pointing to my application in VS 2008 folder and Application Protection = Low. On Directory Security tab, I set username to D610-M\IUSR_D610-M and I checked "Enable anonymous access." I unchecked the Allow IIS to control password. And I have read alot of MS URL's and other websites to see if I could answer these problems myself, but none of their helps worked either. This should be simple. I'm just trying to add my web application to my website. I know that my website works cause I installed a default website with basic HTML and it works. What else can I try in order to add this web app to my website?
