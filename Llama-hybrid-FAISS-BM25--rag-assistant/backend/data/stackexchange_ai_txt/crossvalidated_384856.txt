The type of model you should use depends on the way the dependent variable (DV) is measured. It appears that your DV is dichotomous (demented/controls) which would indicate "regular" logistic regression. It is not necessarily wrong that the odds ratios (ORs) increase when you control for demographics. The change in the ORs when adding control variables depends on the relationships among the variables. They can go up, go down or stay almost the same.
