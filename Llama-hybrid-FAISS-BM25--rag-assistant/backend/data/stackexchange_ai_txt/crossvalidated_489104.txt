This does not sound like truncation in the traditional/technical sense. Truncation would be based on values of the variables, not on values of the time index. E.g. you would not have data on $x_{2,t}$ whenever $x_{2,t}>C$ for some constant $C$ . Meanwhile, you have data for periods $(1,\dots,T)$ for $x_{1,t}$ and $(k,\dots,T)$ for $x_{2,t}$ where $k>1$ regardless of what values the variables take. You will have to discard the first $kâˆ’1$ data points for $x_{1,t}$ and then analyze the remaining period where both time series are available.
