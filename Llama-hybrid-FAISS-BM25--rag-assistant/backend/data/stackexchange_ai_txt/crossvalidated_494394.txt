According to the authors of "Elements of Statistical Learning" (see proof below): As in bagging, the bias of a random forest is the same as the bias of any of the individual sampled trees. Taken from 2008. Elements of Statistical Learning 2nd Ed, Chapter 9.2.3. Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman : Your answer however seems to make sense, and in the right plot of Fig 15.10 we can see that the green horizontal line, which is the squared bias of a single tree, is way below the bias of a random forest. Seems to be a contradiction which I have not sorted out yet. EDIT: The above is clarified right below the proof (same source): a tree within the random forest has the same bias as a random forest, where the single tree is restricted by bootstrap and no# of regressors randomly selected at each split (m). A fully grown, unpruned tree outside the random forest on the other hand (not bootstrapped and restricted by m) has lower bias. Hence random forests / bagging improve through variance reduction only, not bias reduction. Quote:
