PHP runs only when the browser makes a new request to the server. If you're asking the browser to refresh the page, it will do precisely that. If you want to dynamically change the content of the page after it's loaded, you'll have to use JavaScript and AJAX. The jQuery library, discussed widely on Stack Overflow and used widely around the web, makes AJAX requests particularly easy to execute. With the library installed, you can write something like: $("#element-to-refresh").load("your-page.php #element-to-refresh"); This is a crude approach that generates and transfers a lot of unnecessary content, but it works. For a more elegant approach, consider a script that generates only the relevant data which you can call only when you're refreshing.
