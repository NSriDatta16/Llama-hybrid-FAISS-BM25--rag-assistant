First off, to comment on your last sentence, there aren't any such requirements for making ajax calls between jquery and Rails. They don't know about each other and they don't care. As long as your url is correct and you're sending the correct data through when appropriate all is fine. You just need to make sure that your request header is set properly. jQuery by default makes an "intelligent guess" so I find it's always useful to specify what you want. See the docs here, but in your case that means adding: dataType: 'script' to your ajax call As for correct ways to do things, that looks about right and is pretty standard. In your edit.js.erb you basically want to render out your view and append it to #quickedit. Something like this should suffice: $("#quickedit").html( 'course_offering', :object => @course_offering) %>) Note here that 'course_offering' would have to be a partial defined within the current view folder ie /app/views/course_offerings/_course_offering.html.erb assuming you're in the course_offerings controller. In your case you're using 'edit' but I'm assuming edit isn't an partial (ie. html fragment) but rather a full action. In this case try render :action => 'edit'
