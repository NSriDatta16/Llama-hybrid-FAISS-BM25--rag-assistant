How to properly perform constrained ordination (RDA) when the sums of the rows of the constraining matrix are equal to the same value?

When performing an RDA where the constraining matrix displays equal sums of rows, the last column in the matrix is always considered aliased and therefore dropped. I am asking why this happens and how one can avoid that. Given a matrix of response variables and a constraining matrix of explanatory variables (for instance, in the ecological sciences, one could look at species occurrence data and environnemental data to explain these occurrences), one can perform some form of constrained ordination, like an RDA (redundancy analysis). I am doing exactly this with a matrix of environmental variables whose sum of rows are all equal to the same value (in this case, 1). In this use case, the last column of this matrix is always dropped because considered "aliased" which I understand to mean collinear to the other variables in the matrix. I use the package vegan in R. library(vegan) ## Environmental data: the constraining matrix env Results of the rda mention aliased variables, which we can find with alias() ## Aliases alias(my_rda) Shuffling the column rows confirms that it is always the last column of the matrix that is dropped and considered aliased ## Shuffling the columns env_shuffled How can this be explained and how can I properly run the RDA in order to keep all my variables in the RDA analysis?
