You need to load the files to see what they do. Mostly they are XML serializers for the types you serialized in your code but forgot to generate corresponding XML serializer assemblies. You probably want to use Visual Studio or SGen to generate XML serializer assemblies because .Net generates one assembly for each type and if you have a lot of types, your memory would be wasted and fragmented by these assemblies and their overheads.
