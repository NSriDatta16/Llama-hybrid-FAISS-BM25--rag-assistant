It sounds as though you are interested in formal inference and for that method 4 is best. Add X^2 to a model containing terms you wish to control for and conduct a test to assess the streght of evidence for the quadratic term given the terms in the model. Note however that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" and statistical power will come into play (this is of interest if you fail to reject or the CI contains zero). You willof course also want to perform diagnostics of model assumptions prior to drawing conclusions. Methods 1 and 2 are excellent exploratory tools and I would encourage exploring the relationship in as many meaningful ways as you wish (since you know a priori what formal test you will conduct -- a test of the quadratic term -- this will not lead to data-driven hypothesis testing). Other methods of exploration include plotting a fitted LOESS smoother or spline to the (possibly partial) relationships, fitting smoothers or parametric fits within subsets of the data (eg using conditioning plots), a 3d scatterplot with a fitted surface (particularly if you include continuous interactions), etc. These plots will not only help you understand the data better but can also be used as part of a less formal case for/against the quadratic (keeping in mind that humans are excellent at spotting trends in noise). I'm not sure what model selection methods you refer to in 3, but generally automated model selection and testing do not mix. If you are referring to using information criteria (AICc, BIC, ...) note that the theory behind these is based on prediction rather than testing. So, number 4 is the most rigorous way to test the quadratic. Finally, 2 comments on terminology: 'multivariate' models are those whose response is a matrix, and 'multivariable' models are those with a vector response and multiple terms on the RHS. Partial residual plots differ from partial regression plots..
