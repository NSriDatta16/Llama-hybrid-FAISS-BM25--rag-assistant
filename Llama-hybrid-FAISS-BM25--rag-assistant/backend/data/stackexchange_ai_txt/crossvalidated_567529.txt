It depends on what you mean by "far off" and the nature of your data If subsets of the data are nearly symmetrical and do not have long tails in either direction, then their means and medians will not be much different, and your method will give something like an ordinary weighted average (of means). However, if some subsets are markedly skewed or long-tailed, as in the example below, then your weighted median might be relatively "far" from the median of the whole sample. Fictitious data: set.seed(2022) x1 = rexp(20, 1/5) # right-skewed x2 = rt(10, 4) # long tailed x3 = rnorm(30, 20, 3) x = c(x1, x2, x3) # combined sample median(x) [1] 15.35097 # actual sample median (20*median(x1) + 10*median(x2) + 30*median(x3))/(20+10+30) [1] 11.1669 # weighted sample median boxplot(x1,x2,x3, varwidth=T) abline(h = 11.17, col="red") abline(h = 15.35, col="green2") In the figure below the horizontal green line is the median of the sample, and the red line is your weighted median.
