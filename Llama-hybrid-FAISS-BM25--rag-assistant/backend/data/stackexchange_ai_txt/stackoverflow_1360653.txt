Looks to me like code signing verification. The MS shipped system dlls are all signed and SQL verifies the signatures at load time. Apparently the certificate revocation list is expired and the certificate verification engine times out retrieving a new list. I have blogged about this problem before Fix slow application startup due to code sign validation and the problem is also described in this Technet article: Certificate Revocation and Status Checking . The solution is pretty arcane and involves registry editing of the key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CertDllCreateCertificateChainEngine\Config : ChainUrlRetrievalTimeoutMilliseconds This is each individual CRL check call timeout. If is 0 or not present the default value of 15 seconds is used. Change this timeout to a reasonable value like 200 milliseconds. ChainRevAccumulativeUrlRetrievalTimeoutMilliseconds This is the aggregate CRL retrieval timeout. If set to 0 or not present the default value of 20 seconds is used. Change this timeout to a value like 500 milliseconds. There is also a more specific solution for Microsoft signed assemblies (this is from the Biztalk documentation, but applies to any assembly load): Manually load Microsoft Certificate Revocation lists When starting a .NET application, the .NET Framework will attempt to download the Certificate Revocation list (CRL) for any signed assembly. If your system does not have direct access to the Internet, or is restricted from accessing the Microsoft.com domain, this may delay startup of BizTalk Server. To avoid this delay at application startup, you can use the following steps to manually download and install the code signing Certificate Revocation Lists on your system. Download the latest CRL updates from http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/CodeSignPCA.crl and http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/CodeSignPCA2.crl . Move the CodeSignPCA.crl and CodeSignPCA2.crl files to the isolated system. From a command prompt, enter the following command to use the certutil utility to update the local certificate store with the CRL downloaded in step 1: certutil â€“addstore CA c:\CodeSignPCA.crl The CRL files are updated regularly, so you should consider setting a reoccurring task of downloading and installing the CRL updates. To view the next update time, double-click the .crl file and view the value of the Next Update field.
