Is there any tool that can monitor status of my working copies from SVN repository?

I'm looking for a tool that will alert me (or let me check the status of multiple folders) whenever I have some pending changes in my working copies. I have multiple projects that I work on and I could really use a tool that would grab my attention in such case. I know that TortoiseSVN has icon overlays that would do the job if it worked well, but it doesn't. I tried, and had more issues with TortoiseSVN than before. I don't want to periodically go through 10+ projects and do TortoiseSVN"s "Check for modifications" manually. I'm looking for some other solution. UPDATE: I might actually be fine with a script. The key thing is that upon execution I should get a status of multiple working copies.
