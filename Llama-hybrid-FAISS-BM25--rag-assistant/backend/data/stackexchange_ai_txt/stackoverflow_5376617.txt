Creating mixed components in swing + java

Is there any way to create a custom component in swing. By custom I mean say right now I am able to create a circle and do actions like dragging it etc. But now I also want that along with the circle a text label with its number is also present. Can we combine them into a new type of component where say we can do actions on it collectively? If yes please give me pointers on how to do so.
