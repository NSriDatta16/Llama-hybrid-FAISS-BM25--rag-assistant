It's just a matter of convention of your instructor or a textbook to pick either the columns or rows of a matrix as variables. I've seen this done both ways. In econometrics it's more often to see variables in columns, i.e. $n$ variables in $R^{m\times n}$ matrix. I think ML papers it's often the rows with variables, i.e. $m$ variables with $n$ observations. Pay attention to the introduction of the paper to see which convention they use, that's all you can do
