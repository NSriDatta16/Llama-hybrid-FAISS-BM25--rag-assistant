You could choose the gamma distribution for the parameters $\alpha_i$ of the polya distribution. Since, you are doing a bayesian analysis you could sample the intermediate probabilities $p$ instead of working with the pdf $\text{Pr}(X|\alpha)$. In other words, the multivariate polya is given by: $\text{Pr}(X|\alpha) = \int_p(\ \text{Pr}(X|p) \ \text{Pr}(p|\alpha) \ ) \ dp$ In a bayesian analysis you do not have to actually compute the above integral but actually work with $\text{Pr}(X|p)$ and $\text{Pr}(p|\alpha)$ directly. Thus, your model is: $\text{Pr}(X|p)$ which gives the probability model for the data, $\text{Pr}(p|\alpha)$ which gives the prior for the probability vector $p$ and $f(\alpha|-)$ is the hyperprior for $\alpha$. So my suggestion amounts to selecting a gamma distribution as the hyperprior for the individual components of $\alpha$.
