Just to try to help. Can you check your apache configuration? Something like "apache2 -S" to see which virtualhosts are used (and note especially the first default one). You could test that all your virtualhosts (if you work with virtualhosts) are using the right documentRoot. Don't you have an other copy of the sources on your dev server? I mean are you sure you get the right magento instance running on the url you're using on your browser? In the same way are you sure of the cache directories used on your installation - do you see any change in theses directories since the wipe out?
