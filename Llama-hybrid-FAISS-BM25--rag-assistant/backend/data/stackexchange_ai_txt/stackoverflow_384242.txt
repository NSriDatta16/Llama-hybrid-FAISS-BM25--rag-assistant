You cannot allow SharePoint to create your content databases. The default as you have noted is 1MB default size with a 10% growth. If a database autogrow occurs during use of your database, all web sites inside that site collection will stop while the database allocates more space. Also you will be all but guaranteed to get database fragmentation. It is better to avoid unscheduled autogrowth of the database. To do this you will need to create the database manually and set it to the expected size of the database on creation. A document heavy site should be 50 - 100GB and SharePoint should be limited to not exceed that amount. This number does depend on the hardware and amount of data expected to appear in the site. Smaller site collections therefore do not need such a large database.
