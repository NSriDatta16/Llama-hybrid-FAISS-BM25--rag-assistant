Note: Both Firefox and Chrome will default most plugins to click-to-play soon , with Chrome planning to phase out NPAPI entirely . NPAPI for new projects is discouraged at this point. NPAPI plugins shouldn't be browser specific (at least as far as possible). Seamonkeys npruntime sample can be considered a basic Hello World for NPAPI. If you care about up-to-date Mac support, you need to take a look at WebKits or Apples samples. Reading material to get you started: Building a FireFox plugin - 3 part introduction to NPAPI Gecko Plugin API reference - NPAPI documentation at MDC Mac specific info on MDC There is also the FireBreath project: It is a framework aiming at lowering the entry barrier to browser plugin development and already takes care of most common tasks and issues.
