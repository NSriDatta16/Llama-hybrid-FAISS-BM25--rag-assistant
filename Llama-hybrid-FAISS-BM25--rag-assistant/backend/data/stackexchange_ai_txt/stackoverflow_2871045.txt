Are you sure you should be storing the data as a string? It probably makes more sense to maintain a set or list (or, in your second case, a dictionary) and generate the string when you need to. If the data don't change very often, cache the string. With any solution that uses the string as your primary data storage, you'll probably end up generating a temporary list to make it easier to insert the element -- so it makes more sense just to keep the list.
