You could always try the less pragma: use less 'starttime'; Of course, that is system dependent * . Your best bet is to use mod_perl or one of the FastCGI modules: CGI::Fast , FCGI , etc . If it needs to be fast from the commandline you may want to move to a client/server architecture (which is all FastCGI is). * warning no systems currently implement a starttime option for the less pragma.
