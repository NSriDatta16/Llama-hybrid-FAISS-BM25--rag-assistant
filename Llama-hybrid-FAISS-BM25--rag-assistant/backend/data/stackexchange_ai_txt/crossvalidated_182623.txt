Given the nature of the data shown in your question, it seems that your are looking for a classifier algorithm and not a recommender system . A recommender system would answer the question: "What particular ads to show to this particular user". Your question is really different: "Will a new customer click the ads or not". To build a recommender system, you need to record interactions between users and item s . In your case, it seems that you have only one item. Intuitively it seems clear that you can't build a recommender with one item. With only one item, you are good to use classifier algorithm. Choosing a model for a binary classification problem is a very broad subject. You mentioned two very good examples, svm and logistic regression . I would add a third one that is very often used : boosted decision trees like in adaboost or xgboost.
