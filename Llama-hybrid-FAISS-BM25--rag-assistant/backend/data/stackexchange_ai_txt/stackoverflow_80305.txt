Test Coverage for visual basic project

We are developing a Visual Basic 6.0 project. We have written a library, which we were testing using vbunit and vbmock. But soon found that the tests were not maintainable. So, we decided to write tests using MBunit. Now, we want to know the test coverage. How can we do it? thanks
