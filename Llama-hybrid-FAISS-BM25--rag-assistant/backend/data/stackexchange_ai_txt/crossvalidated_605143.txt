Mathematical steps for solving the Kernel trick for Support Vector Machines (SVM)s

I am trying to understand the math behind the Support Vector Machines (SVM) Kernel Trick but there isn't any real source online for the mathematical steps to I can follow to see how its solved. One example is here , but the answer didn't show how it was actually calculated using the numbers for the data points. Could someone use a simple example with numbers or that example I linked above to show the math for solving it?
