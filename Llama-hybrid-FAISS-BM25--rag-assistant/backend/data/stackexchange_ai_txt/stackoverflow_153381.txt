Javascript String concatenation faster than this example?

I have to concatenate a bunch of Strings in Javascript and am searching for the fastest way to do so. Let's assume that the Javascript has to create a large XML-"file" that, naturally, consists of many small Strings. So I came up with: var sbuffer = []; for (var idx=0; idx Data comes here... bla... ’); } // Now we "send" it to the browser... alert(sbuffer.join(”)); Do not pay any attention to the loop or the other "sophisticated" code which builds the example. My question is: For an unknown number of Strings, do you have a faster algorithm / method / idea to concatenate many small Strings to a huge one?
