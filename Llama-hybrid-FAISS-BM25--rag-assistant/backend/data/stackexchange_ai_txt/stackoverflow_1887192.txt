You could always use alloca() to allocate memory on the stack at runtime, if you wished: void foo (int n) { int *values = (int *)alloca(sizeof(int) * n); } Being allocated on the stack implies that it will automatically be freed when the stack unwinds. Quick note: As mentioned in the Mac OS X man page for alloca(3), "The alloca() function is machine and compiler dependent; its use is dis-couraged." Just so you know.
