Difference Betwen Visual C++ 2008 And g++

I'm learning C++ and when I was testing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express and Eclipse Ganymede , but with the g++ compiler as default, I've noted that a same code in VC++ get some errors and in g++ compile normally, without errors or warnings and execute normally, but I want to know what is the difference between VC++ syntax and g++ syntax? Thanks!
