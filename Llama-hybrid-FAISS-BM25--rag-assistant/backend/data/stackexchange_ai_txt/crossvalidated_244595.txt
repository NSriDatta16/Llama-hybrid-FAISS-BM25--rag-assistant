Regression over weighted datasets

In the context of machine learning, most examples of regression (linear, ridge, elasticnet) tend to split along the 50/50 probability line. In the chart below, suppose that a red event is 10x more costly than a blue event. Because of that it might be desirable to incorrectly classify some more blue events (as red events) in the interest of correctly classifying more red events. Is there an easy way to weight the regression in favor of one dataset over another? One might imagine the regression in that case to be closer to the red line than the dashed line. ... or is that the wrong approach entirely?
