fastest c++ serialization?

I'm searching for a very fast binary serialization technique for c++. I only need to serialize data contained in objects (no pointers etc.). I'd like it to be as fast as possible. If it's specific to x86 hardware that's acceptable. I'm familiar with the C methods of doing this. As a test I've bench marked a couple of techniques. I've found the C method is 40% faster than the best C++ method I implemented. Any suggestions on how to improve the C++ method (or libraries that do this)? Anything good available for memory mapped files? // c style writes { #pragma pack(1) struct item { uint64_t off; uint32_t size; } data; #pragma pack clock_t start = clock(); FILE* fd = fopen( "test.c.dat", "wb" ); for ( long i = 0; i About 1.6 seconds for tests = 10000000 // c++ style ofstream writes // define a DTO class class test { public: test(){} uint64_t off; uint32_t size; friend std::ostream& operator About 2.6 seconds for tests = 10000000
