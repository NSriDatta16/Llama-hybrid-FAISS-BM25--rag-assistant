event.target doesn't work

I've wrote some jquery code with some draggable elements and one droparea. Unfortunately my droparea can't make a difference between various object. Here's my code. $(function() { $("#droparea").droppable({ drop: function(event) { var $target = $(event.target); if($target.is("#flyer")) { alert("adasd"); } else if($target.is("#flyer2")) { alert("adasd2"); } } }); }); Without the if it works. But then I can't get the dropped object. Any ideas why my target isn't recognized? thanks a lot.
