What test will tell me a normalized percentage of the data?

I'm working with baseball statistics and I have a list of the players' batting percentages. I want a formula that will tell me what percentage of the data is represented from a player's score compared against the others as a percentage. For example, I have PlayerA , he has the highest batting average in the sample, so he is represented as 100%. PlayerB has the second highest batting average, he is represented as 98%. The percentage is NOT dependent on the size of the population (i.e., if the total population were 50 and I wanted to measure the value from the population directly then it would go by twos down to zero). The measurement is a percentage of the range of values. So if five players all had close batting averages their percentages would all be nearly the same. Another way to phrase this would be, e.g., I am 6'2" and I know the height of each member of the population. After I plug in this formula I am able to discern that I am taller than 72% of the population. It seems like it would be related to a Z-score but I'm not positive.
