Yet Bayesian methodology at least the subset of it you allude to, does not offer variable selection methods. The closest you can get is Bayesian selection which poses bernouli priors on variables in or out of the model and then say multivariate normal on the coefficients of variables in the model. The output of this is posterior probabilities for each variable being in or not and as such is not really selection at all. And no matter what methodology you settle on using, choice of models is always there. I suppose that your answer will be that the final model under the bayesian approach will be a mixture, for which inference is available. This may not be satisfactory for some situations.
