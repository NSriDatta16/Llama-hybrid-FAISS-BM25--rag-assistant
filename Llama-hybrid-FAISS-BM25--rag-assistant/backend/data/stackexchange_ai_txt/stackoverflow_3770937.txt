Despite its failure to meet one of your big criteria (static* typing), I'm going to make a case for Python. Here are a few reasons I think you should take a look at it: For an imperative language, it is surprisingly functional. This was one of the things that struck me when I learned it. Take list comprehensions , for example. It has lambdas, first-class functions, and many functionally-inspired compositions on iterators (maps, folds, zips...). It gives you the option of picking whatever paradigm suits the problem best. IMHO, it is, like Haskell, beautiful to code in. The syntax is simple and elegant. It has a culture that focuses on doing things in a straightforward way, rather than focusing too minutely on efficiency. I understand if you are looking for something else though. Logic programming, for instance, might be right up your alley, as others have suggested. * I assume you mean static typing here, since you want to declare the types. Techincally, Python is a strongly typed language, since you can't arbitrarily interpret, say, a string as an number. Interestingly, there are Python derivatives that allow static typing, like Boo .
