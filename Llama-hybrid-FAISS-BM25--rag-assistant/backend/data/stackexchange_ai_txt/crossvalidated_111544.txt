Removing the intercept term in a dynamic regression justified?

I'm trying to build a cross-sectional prediction model (dynamic panel) with the following form: (including a LDV) $Y_{i,t+1}=a+bY_{i,t}+cX_{i,t}+e_{i,t+1}$ As the sample contains for example countries that differ greatly in terms of size and as all variables are in absolute values (e.g. absolute GDP in USD) the intercept term severely biases my forecasts. As my intercepts are often extremely negative, the forecast for a small country with a low gdp will be negative. I' am wondering now whether you can improve the model (in terms of higher forecast accuracy) by simply removing the intercept. Doing so implies that we go through the origin but I don't see how that should not fit my model. What are other consequences? I've read that R^2 can be significantly higher but R^2 is not the best way to evaluate a model anyway and as I include a lagged DV I should not pay too much attention on R^2 anyway.
