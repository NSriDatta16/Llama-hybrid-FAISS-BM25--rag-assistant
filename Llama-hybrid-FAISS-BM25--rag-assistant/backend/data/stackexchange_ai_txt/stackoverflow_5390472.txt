If you run IE8 in compatibility (quirks of forgiving mode) it works okay. Your markup is not well formatted. You have an unnecesary closing in the second last div of class type "entry" that throws the IE 8 parser. The Iligan ACG, through the radio program, also partnered with groups such as the ....... also taken up in partnership with PIA. Take out this and your markup might work. I also picked up some other bad markup in one of your links (note the unpaired quotation mark at the end of the img definition): There were also a few XHTML validation errors that should be looked at, for example you should not nest div elements inside of P elements.
