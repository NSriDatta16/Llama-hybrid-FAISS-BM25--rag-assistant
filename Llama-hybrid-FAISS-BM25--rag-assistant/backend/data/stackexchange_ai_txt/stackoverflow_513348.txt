How do I delete an OU with everything inside at once?

I would like to have a single LDAP command that would delete an entire OU atomically, including all children. I see there's a command for the windows command-line: Delete an Organizational Unit dsrm [-subtree] That -subtree option deletes children too. Is there a way to do that using LDAP? Bonus points, if someone knows how to do that using the ActiveLdap gem. But I will be extending ActiveLdap to include this functionality otherwise. Thanks!
