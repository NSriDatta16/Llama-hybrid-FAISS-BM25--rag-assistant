Analysis after Gregory-Hansen cointegration test

I have two time series which fail E-G cointegration test over the whole sample, but G-H cointegration test indicates the presence of cointegration when regime shift is allowed. Can I set up a dummy taking on value 0 before and 1 after the regime shift (where the date of regime shift is identified by G-H) and include it in the ECM to estimate the parameters or is there other superior approach?
