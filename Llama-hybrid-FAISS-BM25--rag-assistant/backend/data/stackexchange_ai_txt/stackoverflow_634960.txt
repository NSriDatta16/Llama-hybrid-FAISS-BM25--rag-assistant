Setting innerHTML is often faster than inserting seperate nodes. Another possibility would be to create a DocumentFragment , which allows to insert the nodes all at once. Another advantage of using DocumentFragments is that they can easily be cloned , which can replace a lot of use cases for innerHTML and is potentially faster as no parsing is involved.
