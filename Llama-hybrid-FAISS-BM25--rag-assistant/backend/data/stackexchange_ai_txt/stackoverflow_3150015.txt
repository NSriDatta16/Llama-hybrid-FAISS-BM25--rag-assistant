When you are testing variations, that is a private URL. As long as there are no external links to it and you don't publicize it, you can destroy it when your tests are done. If you share it only with others in your organization, under the agreement that it is ephemeral, that is a gray area. Daniel Egeberg's suggestion of maintaining forwarding for a time is civilized. Once you make the URL public, you must treat it as archival . That means you make sure it works forever . There are a couple of exceptions I might condone: Someone has exercised force majeure and has shut down the entire domain, like Geocities. Don't let this happen to you: don't put your valuable web pages under the control of for-profit entities. Someone has bought your domain out from under you with an offer you couldn't refuse. You've gone bankrupt or can no longer afford to maintain a presence online. In these cases, your moral obligation is to make your content available through archive.org or through Jason Scott , who has plenty of good advice. If you control your own domain and you let a public URL go stale, you will burn in hell. (Little-known post-Dante theology.)
