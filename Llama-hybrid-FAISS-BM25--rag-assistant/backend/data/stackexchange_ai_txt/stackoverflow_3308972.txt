It will be a bit of a tedious search through your source code and other database objects I'm afraid. Don't forget SSIS Packages, SQL Agent Jobs, Reporting Services rdl as well as your main application code. You could use a regular expression like spProc1|spProc2 to search in the source code for all object names at the same time if you have a tool that supports searching through files using regular expressions (I have used RegexBuddy for this in the past) If you want to just cover the possibility you might have missed the odd one you could leave all the previous stored procedures behind for a month and just have them log a custom SQL trace event with APP_NAME(), SUSER_NAME() and any other info you find helpful then have it call the renamed version. Then set up a trace monitoring this event.
