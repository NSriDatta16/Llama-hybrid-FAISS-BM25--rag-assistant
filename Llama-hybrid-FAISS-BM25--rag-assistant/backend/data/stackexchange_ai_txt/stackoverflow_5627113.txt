drag and drop a hyperlink from a webpage That page wouldn't be in a web browser running in low integrity (e.g. IE Protected Mode), would it? Drag-and-drop doesn't work across integrity levels. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Integrity_Control What happens if you use icacls to set your executable's integrity level to low as well? If drag-and-drop starts working, this was the problem.
