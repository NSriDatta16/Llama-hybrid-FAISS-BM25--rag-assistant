It is amazing how fast technology evolves and improves! With the advent of the just-released (June 7, 2010) SketchFlow/Blend version 4 there is a much more elegant way to handle this. SketchFlow 3 followed the hub-and-spoke approach, where multiple reviewers could submit feedback, but only the designer could see them all. SketchFlow 4 lets you publish to SharePoint with one click, where all reviewers may now see each others' comments. The (minor) drawbacks, though, are two: You must have SharePoint. You must use a Silverlight prototype (not a WPF prototype). For further reading, I direct you to these: Expression evangelist Christian Schormann, Collaborative SketchFlow Feedback with SharePoint , June 6, 2010. My just-published article Creating WPF Prototypes with SketchFlow , June 18, 2010. See the Managing Feedback section.
