jQuery selector context question

I'm trying to do make the following selection: $(".program", row) Where "row" is a jQuery object containing two table rows. One of the tr's has the class 'program". This selector doesn't seem to find it. However the following works: $(".title", row) where div.title is a descendant of tr.program. If I use a jQuery object as a selector context, am I not able to match top-level elements of that jQuery object? thanks, -Morgan
