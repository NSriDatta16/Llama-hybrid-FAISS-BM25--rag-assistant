State space model parameterized by a neural network

For the sake of argument, assume the following simple state-space model: Transition model: $x_{t}=a\cdot x_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ Measurement model: $y_t=f(x_t)+\delta_t$ Assume $x_t$ and $y_t$ are 1D, while $\epsilon_t$ and $\delta_t$ are zero-mean Gaussian noise with some variances. Function $f(x)$ is unknown and parameterized by a neural network. How one would go about training this neural network?
