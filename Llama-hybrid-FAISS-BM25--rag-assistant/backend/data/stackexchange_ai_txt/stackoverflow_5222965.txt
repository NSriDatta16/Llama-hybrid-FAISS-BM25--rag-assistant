I once wrote a bootstrapper using InstallScript to support a similar story. This was before InstallShield included this functionality and was based on my work that I shared with them. Basically my code did a lot of work reflecting the instance transforms out of the MSI's Storage and then querying the MSI API to understand which instances were already installed and whether the current MSI represented a Maintenance UI ( same ProductCode and same PackageCode ) or a Major Upgrade Upgrade ( Different ProductCode ) or a Minor Upgrade ( same ProductCode different PackageCode). You can read about it in more detail at: Multiple Instance MSI's and InstallShield 12 Here's an explanation of how it works in IS2009+ with screen shots of the bootstrapper UI.
