The area of computer science this most closely relates to is natural language processing . There is a large body of work and ongoing research in this area. You have a few barriers to achieving interest in your ideas from people studying the subject: The methods as you present them, are not tightly defined or easy to comprehend. Where the methods are comprehensible, they appear to be a form of expert system which attempt to address questions about a piece of text. Expert systems are not new to NLP and are used in many text comprehension systems, but generally work at the level of text adventures, or in very limited domains (e.g. Amazon's Alexa might use such rules after analysing input, when deciding between playing some music that you requested or booking you a table at a local restaurant) Some of the terms you use in your heuristics (such as "opposite") are not well defined for all inputs, and could be the subject of a large piece of research in their own right. A computer programmer would likely halt and ask you to define how to extract "quality of X" from a piece of content, before they could apply your rule. Claims such as "FORMULA FOR FINDING NEW THEORIES OF PHYSICS" will not be well received by any research or academic community. Unless you have actually discovered, published and had verified a new formula for physics using your heuristics, you are most likely to receive negative attention for making such a claim. If you cannot defend this claim about the effectiveness of your methods with proof , I'd advise not making such a claim. Probably you could have some of your rules encoded as an expert system (perhaps with some existing NLP analysis to help with identifying the loose concepts in your rule system), and they would generate output for a range of inputs. They might be interesting in some contexts e.g. these rules, or ones like them, might be useful topic generators for chatbots . However, they don't appear to represent a novel approach to NLP, nor do they align well with open research topics in the subject.
