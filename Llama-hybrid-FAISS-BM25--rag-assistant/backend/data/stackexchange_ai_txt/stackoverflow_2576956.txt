Getting data from external program

I need a method to get the data from an external editor. def _get_content(): from subprocess import call file = open(file, "w").write(some_name) call(editor + " " + file, shell=True) file.close() file = open(file) x = file.readlines() [snip] I personally think there should be a more elegant way. You see, I need to interact with an external editor and get the data. Do you know any better approaches/have better ideas? EDIT: Marcelo brought me on the idea of using tempfile for doing that. Here's how I do it: def _tempfile_write(input): from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile x = NamedTemporaryFile() x.file.write(input) x.close() y = open(x) [snip] This does the job, but also not quite satisfying. Heard something about spawning?..
