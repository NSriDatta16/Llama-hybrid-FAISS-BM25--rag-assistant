Noting the lack of BSDs here, I figured I'd chip in: The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System (dead-tree book) Unix and BSD Courses (courses and videos) FreeBSD Architecture Handbook (online book) I haven't taken any of the courses myself, but I've heard Marshall Kirk McKusick speak on other occasions, and he is really good at what he does. And of course the BSD man pages, which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average Linux man-page. Take for instance the uvm(9) man-page, describing the virtual memory interface in OpenBSD. Not quite related, but I'll also recommend the video History of the Berkeley Software Distributions as it gives a nice introduction to the BSD parts of the UNIX history and culture as well as plenty of hilarious anectodes from back when.
