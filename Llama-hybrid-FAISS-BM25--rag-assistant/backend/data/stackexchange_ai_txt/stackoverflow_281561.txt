Delphi 2007 VI/VIM Key Mapping

After reading The Pragmatic Programmer , I became quite accustomed to VIM. When in Visual Studio I have ViEmu ( http://www.viemu.com/ ) to provide me with VIM functionality. Is anyone aware of a similar program/key binding/workaround to integrate VI/VIM key bindings in CodeGear Delphi 2007?
