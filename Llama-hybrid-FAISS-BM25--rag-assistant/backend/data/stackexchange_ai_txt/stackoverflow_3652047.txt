If you're calling playSound in a click handler, could your users be double-clicking? On most browsers, double-click causes two click events to occur (in addition to a dblclick event; example ). You might want to build in some hysteresis -- for instance, ignore a second (third, fourth) click on the sound for 500ms after the first click, that sort of thing. Edit : Example: var soundsPlayed = {}; function playSound(url){ var userAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); var appVersion = navigator.appVersion.toLowerCase(); var appName = navigator.appName.toLowerCase(); var isOpera = (userAgent.indexOf('opera') != -1); var isIE = (appName.indexOf('internet explorer') != -1) && !isOpera; var soundPlayed = soundsPlayed['p:' + url]; var now = new Date().getTime(); // If we haven't played this sound, or we haven't played it in the // last half-second, go ahead and play it. if (!soundPlayed || (now - soundPlayed) > 500) { // Remember when we played it soundsPlayed['p:' + url] = now; // Play it switch(true) // true?? { case isIE : $("#soundSpan").html(" "); break; default : $("#soundSpan").html(" "); } } }
