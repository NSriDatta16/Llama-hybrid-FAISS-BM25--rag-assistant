The problem you pose here is called named entity recognition (NER), or named entity extraction. There are multiple technologies (not necessary neural networks) that can be used for this problem, and some of them are quite mature. See e.g. this repo for an easy-to-plug-in solution, or try to apply the ne_chunk_sents function from the NLTK module in Python.
