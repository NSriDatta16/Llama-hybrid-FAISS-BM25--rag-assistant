Magento: Two flat rate Shipping Rates based on weight

Trying to set up my shipping rates as follows: If the total shopping cart is under 1KG in weight then the shipping will be £3.68 If the total shopping cart is over 1KG in weight then the shipping will be £6.68 If the total price of the cart is over £100 shipping is free. I’ve managed to hack this all together using a flat rate of £6.68 then using the Promotions > Shopping cart price rules section to discount the extra £3 if under the 1KG weight. But the deduction doesn’t come off the shipping price, it simply displays as a discount which will be confusing and doesn’t look right. So i’m looking for a alternative/the right way. All this is in the UK, we don’t ship abroad for the moment. Any help appreciated.
