Your code Trace.WriteLineIf(mySwitch.TraceError,"my error"); will produce output only if mySwitch.TraceError is true, Trace.TraceError("my error") will produce output regardless of the value of mySwitch.TraceError Trace.TraceError calls the TraceEvent method for each trace listener, with the trace event type Error and send a message to trace listener. Trace.WriteLine and Trace.WriteLineIf just send a message to trace listener. Consider using TraceSource . TraceSource is an upgraded Trace system. [Edit @Robert Snyder] Trace is still there, not marked as obsolete, so I don't have argument for not using it. However, in big real world solutions I will prefer TraceSource: TraceSource is more configurable , you have better control over granularity/filtering (TraceSwitch, TraceListener), which is great when you are working with multiple assemblies. It is easier to trace additional information, call stack, thread information... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163767.aspx Take a look at John Robbins article for more details:
