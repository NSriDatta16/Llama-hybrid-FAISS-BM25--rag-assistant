I did not find an easy way to do this. I could not find any event or anything similar on TWebBrowser, that would dissable refresh. Maybe you should check TEmbededWB as it has more events and is more capable than the default TWebBrowser. Otherwise they are very similar. But I found a way to prevent refresh. Now it is funny that even with KeyPreview set to "True" on the main form I could not recieve key notifications. It seems that TWebBrowser eats them up somehow. But this worked: procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject); begin Application.OnMessage := OnAppMessage; end; procedure TForm1.OnAppMessage(var Msg: TMsg; var Handled: Boolean); begin if Msg.message = WM_KEYDOWN then if Msg.wParam = VK_F5 then Handled := True; end; Not the most elegant way but at least it works. I have not found a better solution yet.
