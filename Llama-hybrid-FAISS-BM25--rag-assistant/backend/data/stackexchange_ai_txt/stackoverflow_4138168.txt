What happens when I throw a C++ exception from a native Java method?

Suppose I'm embedding Sun's JVM in a C++ application. Through JNI I call a Java method (my own), which in turns calls a native method I implemented in a shared library. What happens if this native method throws a C++ exception? edit: compiler is gcc 3.4.x, jvm is sun's 1.6.20.
