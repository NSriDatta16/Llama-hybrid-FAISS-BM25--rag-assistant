Assemblies added to the GAC are not normally listed in the Add Reference dialog. You will have to add a key to the Registry that points to the location of the assembly. For example: [HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\.NETFramework\AssemblyFolders\MyAssemblies]@="C:\\MyAssemblies" where MyAssemblies is the name of the folder in which the assembly resides. See this knowledge base article for more details. Do also note that you are generally discouraged from installing assemblies in the GAC. To directly reference an assembly from a project in Visual Studio, you should add the assembly to your project folder and add a reference to this local copy of the DLL instead.
