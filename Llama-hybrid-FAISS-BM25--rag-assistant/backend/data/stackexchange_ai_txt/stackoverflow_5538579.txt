True False - Getting an SSL certificate that works on iOS is as cheap as free. I have used StartSSL on iOS with flawless results. The cost of PKI is a myth. There are lots of reputable solutions out there and there really should not be any excuse why you wouldn't be able to implement security like this for either low cost, or none at all. Don't use raw sockets if you can help it, why not use HTTP? If you go with standard protocols, you get a lot of lift and not coincidentally, SSL as well. If you go HTTP, then you can use NSURLConnection , or bare-minimum, CFNetwork , which is a C API that bakes in all the HTTP communication you'll need to make. Because C++ is a superset of C you can add that in without any problems. That said, I am not sure what your aversion to Objective-C is. It's the first-class citizen on iPhone, why not leverage it?
