Comparing paired and unpaired samples

I have data from three groups of participants: Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3. Participants in Group 1 have their performance recorded on Task A and Task B. Participants in Group 2 have their performance captured only on Task A. And participants in Group 3 have their performance captured only on Task B. I want to determine whether the average in participants' performance difference across Task A vs B for people in Group 1 is statistically different (less than) the average in participants' performance difference across Tasks A and B for the people in Groups 2 vs 3. What would be the best statistical test for this comparison? If I have a table with average performances by group on each task type, it would look something like this Group Task Type Average Performance 1 A -2 1 B 2 2 A -6 3 B 6 I want to be able to say that 2 - -2 is statistically less than 6 - -6
