jQuery draggable / droppable problem

I can drag items without any problem unfortunately items can be dragged everywhere which I do not want. I only want items to be dragged on some specific areas such as buttonmenu. I used many methods but I have not got any result. Could you please tell me how to disable a buttonmenu which has id of 34 not to drop buttons there? You can see the code that I am using (which does not work for not droppping) Best Regards Altaico Here is the code: $("#35").draggable(); $("myArticle").droppable( "option", "disabled", true );
