It's called name mangling, is necessary because of overloads and templates and such (i.e. the plain chars-and-numbers name isn't enough to identify a chunk of code unambiguously; embedding spaces or <> or :: in names usually isn't legal; copying the additional information in uncondensed, human-readable form would be wasteful), and it therefore depends on types, arity, etc. The exact scheme can vary, but usually each compiler is self-consistent for a relatively long time (sometimes even several compilers can settle for one way).
