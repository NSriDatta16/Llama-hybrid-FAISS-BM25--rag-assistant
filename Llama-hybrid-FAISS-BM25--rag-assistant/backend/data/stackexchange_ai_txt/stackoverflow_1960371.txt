How to create a 20x20px cell grid background programmatically?

I'm trying to build a grid the size of the browser window that has 20x20px squares. My first idea was to just construct a table with the following code, but IE8 (in any mode) will not render the cells unless they have non-white space content. According to this , it will if it has a &nbsp; , but from my testing, it only works if the table is in the original DOM - not from javascript. dojo.ready(function(){ var grid = dojo.byId("grid"); var tr; for(var i=0; i After giving up on that approach, I decided to try google-closure's vector graphics library - thinking vector drawing would be the more appropriate solution in principle since tables are not intended for this.. I got it working cross browser, but for a decent sized grid (say 1000x1000) the load times and memory utilization are outrageous. I suppose it was not designed to be used for this either: var graphics = goog.graphics.createGraphics(800, 800); var path, stroke = new goog.graphics.Stroke(1, "gray"); for(var x=0; x Maybe the pragmatic solution would be to create a 20x20px image and repeatedly insert that?
