The only solution I know is to create a complete backup of your active database and restore this backup to a copy of the database in a 'warm backup' state. First create a backup from the active db: backup database activedb to disk='somefile' Then restore the backup on another sql server. If needed you can use the WITH REPLACE option to change the default storage directory restore database warmbackup from disk='somefile' with norecovery, replace .... Now you can create backups of the logs and restore them to the warmbackup with the restore log statement.
