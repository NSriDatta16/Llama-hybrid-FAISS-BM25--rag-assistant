If your company sells packages of just Intel Servers with your software, then you shouldn't bother learning the AMD approach. But if you're going to have to offer software for both (or many) different platforms, then it might be worth looking into the different technologies. It will be very difficult to create the wrappers for the hardware-specific libraries. (Especially since threading is involved.) And you definitely don't want to write completely separate implementation for each hardware configuration. In fact, if your software is to be consumed by a generic user, then you may want to abandon the Intel technology, and use standard threading techniques. I don't mean to be discouraging, but I believe that the Intel threading libraries are a bit ahead of their time for all intents and purposes.
