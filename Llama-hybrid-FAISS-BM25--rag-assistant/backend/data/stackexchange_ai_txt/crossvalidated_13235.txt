How to design a study and test the effect of dosage level on cure probability?

My goal is to quantify dosage impact on cure probability for different patients. Let's suppose I have N patients with their charateristics such as age, gender, weight.... Also let's assume there is a known range for dosage, say from 0 to 1. Here is what I'm currently doing: Randomly split all patients into 3 groups Group 1 is given dosage of 0.1, group 2 dosage of 0.5 and group 3 dosage of 0.9. Please note size of group is different. Presumably group 1 is largest because I need decent number of cured patients and I know low dosage leads to low cure probability. Also note that I can not test more dosage because N is limited. Get outcome (0/1) for all patients Train logistic regression model for each group If I want to get cure probability for any particular patient with untested dosage (say 0.7), I just calculate 3 probabilities based on models in step 4 and do some simple interpolation. My question is if there is any better way to do this. I'm not feeling very comfortable about the interpolation part.
