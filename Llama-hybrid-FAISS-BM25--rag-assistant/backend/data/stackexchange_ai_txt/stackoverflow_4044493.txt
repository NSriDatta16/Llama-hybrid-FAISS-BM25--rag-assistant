I haven't worked with FogBugz, although I recently recommended our company goes with that. OnTime is what the company decided to use and I personally don't like OnTime because of slowness and badly organized GUI. We opted to host it ourselves, but I don't think the machine is slow. The web app doesn't really look like a web app, more like it copies a windows app, just as Brian Scott said in his answer. And don't try using the windows app over Internet (over VPN). It's awfully slow. I suppose it could be due to our Internet connection latency. Of course, my experience might be different than other people's, I could be having network issues. Someone else will have to confirm my claims of slowness. :)
