Heterogeneity testing in logistic regression models

We ran 5 separate logistic regression models testing a set of independent variables on 5 different country-specific datasets. Our goal was to assess the relative contributions of known risk factors of preterm birth to individual preterm birth risk. Risk factors include: age, education, smoking habits, etc. We just received comments from reviewers and one of them is asking us to " assess heterogeneity " in our models. For example, is the variation in the association with smoking more than would be expected by the play of chance? Could anyone explain how to do this (in simple terms)? We have been using SPSS for all our analyses so far and it would be great to hear how to do this with this software.
