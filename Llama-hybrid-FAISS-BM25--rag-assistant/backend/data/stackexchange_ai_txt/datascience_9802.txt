What is the difference in xgboost binary:logistic and reg:logistic

What is the difference in R in xgboost between binary:logistic and reg:logistic? Is it only in evaluation metric? If yes, how does RMSE on binary classification compare to error rate? Is the relationship between the metrics more or less monotonic, output from tuning on one metric should not differ significantly between those two approaches?
