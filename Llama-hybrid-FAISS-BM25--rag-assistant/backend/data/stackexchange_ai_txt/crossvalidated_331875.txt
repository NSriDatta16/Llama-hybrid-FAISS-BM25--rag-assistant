There are a lot of complicated answers given to this question, but what about the Inverse Variance Weighted Mean: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-variance_weighting Instead of n repeated measurements with one instrument, if the experimenter makes n of the same quantity with n different instruments with varying quality of measurements... Each random variable is weighted in inverse proportion to its variance. The inverse-variance weighted average seems very straightforward to calculate and as a bonus has the least variance among all weighted averages.
