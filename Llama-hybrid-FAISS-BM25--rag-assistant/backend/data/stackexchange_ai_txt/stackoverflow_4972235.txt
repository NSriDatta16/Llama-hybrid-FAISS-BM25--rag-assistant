Just found the answer. Reference to "COMPUTER SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION" by Andrew Tanenbaum, page 54 to page 59. Intel chips are CISC based and all CISC based chips have an interpreter (microcode) to break the complex instructions into small steps. Earlier all chips contained microprogram. there was no CISC term, till the time RISC concept was introduced by David Patterson and Carlo Sequin in 1980. RISC stands for reduced instruction set computer. In today's time size of the instruction set does not matter. what matters in RISC design is simplicity of the instructions, but the name 'reduced'stuck. RISC design is about issuing more and more simple instructions quickly. how long an instruction took mattered less than how many could be started per second. Also the advantage of using faster CPU ROM over slower main memory CISC design had, is gone by the advent of equally faster main memory. RISC is definitely better than CISC performance wise. then why chip maker Intel didn't move to RISC? for two reasons. first of all, there is the issue of backward compatibility and the billions of dollars companies have invested in software for intel line. secondly, intel could manage to use the idea of RISC in its CISC chips. starting from 486, intel CPUs contain a RISC core that executes the smiplest and most common instructions in a single data path cycle, while interpreting the more complicated instructions in the usual CISC way. I guess Intel superficially moved on to the hybrid approach to keep the face/fame/goodwill in the market in line with the technology advances. I would take intel chips as CISC based only.
