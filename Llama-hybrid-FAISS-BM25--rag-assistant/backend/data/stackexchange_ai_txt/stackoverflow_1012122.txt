Why does this Upcast not work?

I have 2 classes Test(Base)and Program(child). Now I am facing some problem while downcasting. Test t = new Program();// upcasting-works Program p = (Program)t;//Downcasting-works Program q = (Program)new Test();//Downcasting -throws exception. I want to know why its throwing exception? May b its very basic, but somehow I am not getting. Is it for that new object? Thanks.
