Displaying questions & answers from mysql database with php into a html form in the frontend

I have 3 tables in mySQL database. questions_table with these fields: question_id (unique ID for the question) question_name (the name of the question) question_positionID (the position of the question, I need this because the admins are able to change the positions of the questions in the html form in the frontend. I use this to display the questions in the form appropriately) questions_users_relationship_table with these fields: questions_answers (this is the field where it stores what the users answered in the frontend form) user_id (this is used to connect to the users table, when loading the specific user's answers to the form) question_id (this is used to reference the question in the questions_table) users_table with these fields: user_id (unique id) username (as the name implies, username) password (as the name implies, password) So, erm.. The reason why have these 3 tables in the database is because I have to build an admin section on the website which allows the administrators to switch and change the position of the questions in a form. Therefore the reason for the question_positionID field in the questions_table. I have no problem in listing down the questions and its respective answers in the admin section for the administrators to do the position change ( i used ajax drag n drop to update the mysql table on the question_positionID field).. My problem lies on the frontend html form itself. Because In the database, I only stored the questions and also its answers in its respective tables.. and did not store what type of questions it is (for example: a gender question might use radio buttons for its answers (Male/Female) or maybe address field which has the Country field with answers in the form of a drop down box).. So, in the frontend html form, I am not sure How to list down the questions and its answers for the respective user_id sorted based on the question_positionID and still would properly display the correct form elements (example: questions with dropdown with list the value in the dropdown boxes, questions with answers in radio buttons would be properly checked in the respective radio buttons, and etc etc).. I believe many people would love to know how to do it.. I not an expert in PHP and mySQL and slowly learning it through examples and online tutorials.. So I would appreciate it if you guys could shed some light on this question of mine..
