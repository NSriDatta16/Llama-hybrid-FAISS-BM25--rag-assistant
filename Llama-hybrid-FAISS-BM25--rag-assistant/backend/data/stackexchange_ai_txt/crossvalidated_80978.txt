If you use a classifier, then you generally don't use PCA before. Classifiers don't require that you reduce the dimensionality of your data. Reducing dimensionality (via PCA) may discard important information. If you didn't reduce the dimensionality, then PCA also makes little sense before classification, because you loose the original meaning of the features.
