ActiveX Control Drag and Drop in C#

I'm making Windows Form App in C# and best control for what I need is ActiveX Control (Calendar). The problem is that I need drag and drop but Control that I use does not have events for it (only positive thing is that it has property "AllowDrop"). (Control is Xtreme Calendar - Codejock)
