You can use the Organizer. Connect your iPhone and choose Window->Organizer in Xcode. Lots of options there, including what you're looking for. Specifically, click your iPhone under Devices, then in the Summary section find your app under Applications. Click the triangle next to your app which should reveal your Application Data with an arrow button to download it to your Mac. Good luck!
