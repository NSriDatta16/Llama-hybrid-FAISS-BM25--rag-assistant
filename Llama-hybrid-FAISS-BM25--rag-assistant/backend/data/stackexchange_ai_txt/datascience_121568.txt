Does a classifier based on optimal bayes classifier equation classify every new instance the same way?

I'm trying to understand how optimal bayes classifier works and I was wondering if, given that the function we try to maximize when making a new prediction does not depend on the instance we are trying to classify, is it correct to state that the optimal bayes classifier would always predict the most probable class no matter what the input is? EDIT: I've been studying the subject on "Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw Hill, 1997" where is stated that the prediction for a new instance is the class $v_j$ for which the function $\underset{v_j \in V}{\operatorname{arg max}}\sum_{h_i \in H}{P}(v_j|h_i){P}(h_i|D) $ Where $V$ is the set of all possible classes, $H$ is the space of the hypothesis and $D$ is the train dataset.
