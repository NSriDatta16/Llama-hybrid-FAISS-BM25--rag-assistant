I propose a free detection system which is based on uaprof and user agent: http://www.mobilemultimedia.be UAprof should be the primary key for detection when it's available as there are usually multiple user agents for the same uaprof. If you want to manage this on your own, you should then go for Wurfl because you can download the entire database and manage it locally by yourself.
