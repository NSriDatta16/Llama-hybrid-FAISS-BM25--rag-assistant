I solve this by parsing the cobertura XML files and pushing the individual build data into a database. You can do this with other metrics, like number of tests and complexity. Placing the results into a database gives you a wide range of display options. We use Excel and SharePoint to display are most important metrics. A simple web page with charts and graphs (is it still simple?) will also do the trick.
