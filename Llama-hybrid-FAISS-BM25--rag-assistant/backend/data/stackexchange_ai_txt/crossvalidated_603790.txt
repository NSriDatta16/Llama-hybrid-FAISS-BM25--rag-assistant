The stationary combination $S$ of a pair of cointegrating time series $(A,B)$ can be treated as any stationary time series. If the cointegrating vector is $(1,-1)$ , then $S:=A-B$ is stationary. Its (unconditional) mean can be estimated as the sample mean, just as you would do with i.i.d. data. The (unconditional) standard deviation can again be estimated as the sample standard deviation; see e.g. this thread . The standard error of the mean can be estimated using autocorrelation-robust standard errors such as Newey-West. Here is some R code: T=1e3 set.seed(1); x=arima.sim(model=list(ar1=0.9,ma1=-0.3),n=T) mean=mean(x); print(mean) sd =sd (x); print(sd ) se =sqrt(sandwich::NeweyWest(lm(x~1))); print(se)
