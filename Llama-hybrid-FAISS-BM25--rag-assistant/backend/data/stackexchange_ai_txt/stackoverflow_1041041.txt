First of all, I'd like to say that most of the comments here are true, different JVMs may work slightly differently indeed and you should remember about APIs you are using. However, there's one more consideration that should be taken into account: standardization . I mean such things as Mobile Services Architecture (MSA - JSR 248), they greatly simplfy things by creating some standart sets of APIs. Moreover, they carry some clarifications to included APIs and rules on how to implement them. Also such things as MIDP 2.1 are tightening standarts. 2.1 verison is basically 2.0, but with "bolts tightened": more strict rules that make some aspects clear and remove potential fragmentation. For example, there's a requirement to include double buffering in any case or to support touch screen in Java if a device has one. Having said that, I should conclude that fragmentation is really decreasing, manufacturers do adopt standarts like JSR 248. But test your applications as much as needed anyway, we're all people and JVM developers also make mistakes and leave bugs in their code.
