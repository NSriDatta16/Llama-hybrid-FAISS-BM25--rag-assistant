Are you updating your data model for the table in targetIndexPathForMoveFromRowAtIndexPath Or in the DataSource delegate method: tableView:moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath: ? Taken from the Table View Programming Guide for iPhone OS, under reordering table cells: The table view sends tableView:moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath: to its data source (if it implements the method). In this method the data source updates the data-model array that is the source of items for the table view, moving the item to a different location in the array . And for the delegate method, it is written: Every time the dragged row is over a destination, the table view sends tableView:targetIndexPathForMoveFromRowAtIndexPath:toProposedIndexPath: to its delegate (if it implements the method). In this method the delegate may reject the current destination for the dragged row and specify an alternative one. tableView:targetIndexPathForMoveFromRowAtIndexPath:toProposedIndexPath: is for determining whether a relocation is allowed, but actual changes to your data model should take place in tableView:moveRowAtIndexPath:toIndexPath: Perhaps this is what you're doing, but I can't tell just from the info you provided.
