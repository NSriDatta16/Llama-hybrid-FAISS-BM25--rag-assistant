“Independent” and “dependent” variables describe how variables are used in a regression model. Without such a model, you just have variables. The way you handle such a situation is to run a regression with the predictive variable(s) as independent as the outcome as dependent. If you want to predict the day of the week from the number of cyclists, feel free to do so as you would predict anything else. my current idea is to use multinomial Naive Bayes and swap the variables so that days of week are dependent categorical and total cyclists are the independent variable. It is not clear that naïve Bayes is the right model over a multinomial logistic regression, random forest, or neural network (just to name a few), but $1)$ it might be, and $2)$ you’re getting the important idea that you can use whatever to predict whatever else if you would get use out of such a model.
