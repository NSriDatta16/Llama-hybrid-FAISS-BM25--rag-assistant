Is random forest for regression a 'true' regression?

Random forests are used for regression. However, from what I understand, they assign an average target value at each leaf. Since there are only limited leaves in each tree, there are only specific values that the target can attain from our regression model. Thus is it not just a 'discrete' regression (like a step function) and not like linear regression which is 'continuous'? Am I understanding this correctly? If yes, what advantage does random forest offer in regression?
