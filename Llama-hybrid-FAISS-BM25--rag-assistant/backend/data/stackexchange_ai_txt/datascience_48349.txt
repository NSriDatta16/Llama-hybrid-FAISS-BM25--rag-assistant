You say that the agent can achieve high results so it appears to be learning something but it fails to do this consistently. Is there are significant drop off in performance at some points? Is there no improvement in the results if you use Adam instead of RMSProp? I'd be surprised if this was a "difficult" environment that needed a lot of tweaking. I'm curious as to what your reward graph looks like when compared to just "random" behaviour which I think would also survive in this environment.
