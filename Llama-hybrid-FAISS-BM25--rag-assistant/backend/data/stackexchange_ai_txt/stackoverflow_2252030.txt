How can I find out a web page viewers pixels per inch?

Can anyone think of a way I can discover a users pixels per inch? I want to ensure that a image displays in a web browser exactly the size I need it to, so using a combination of resolution (which I can get from the user agent) and pixels per inch I could do this. However, I'm not sure if there is any way to discover a users pixels per inch, ideally using JavaScript or some other non-invasive method. Any suggestions? Thanks, CJ
