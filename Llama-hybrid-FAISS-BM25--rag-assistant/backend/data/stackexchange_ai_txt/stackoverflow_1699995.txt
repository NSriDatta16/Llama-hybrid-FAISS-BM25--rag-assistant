There are two ways to do what I think you are asking, which is embedding a form in a panel or similar. There is a TForm.CreateParented(handle) function, but in our code we tend not to use that. Instead, we create the form with this sort of code: MyForm := TMyForm.Create(Self); MyForm.Parent := MyTabSheet; MyForm.Border := bsNone; MyForm.Align := alClient; MyForm.Show;
