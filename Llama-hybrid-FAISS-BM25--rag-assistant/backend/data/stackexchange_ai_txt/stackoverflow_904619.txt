You can get a string representation of any object using the -description method, but for instances of NSValue it's unlikely to print anything especially meaningful. In other words, it's up to your value transformer to interpret the passed-in object and produce a string. If it's an NSValue instance, the question is what type of data that instance contains. Once you know that, you can write code to represent it as a string (similar to NSStringFromRect() ).
