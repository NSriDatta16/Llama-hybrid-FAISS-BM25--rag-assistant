You could create a web application that serves your file. Here you could check for the user agent string in the request and decide on that user agent string whether to serve the file or not. For this to work, your "java downloader" must have an identifiable user agent string and your application must "know" it. Of course any bad guy who knows this, could make his browser send you the same user agent string, so this in not really secure :-/
