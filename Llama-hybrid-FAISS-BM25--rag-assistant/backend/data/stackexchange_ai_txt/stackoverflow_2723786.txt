UIControlEventTouchDragExit only fires ~100 pixels out

Im trying to "get" when a finger/touch leaves a UIButton in objective C for iphone. I was told in another answer to use UIControlEventTouchDragExit however this event only fires when the touch gets about 100 pixels away from the button, whereas I would like it to be immediate. The apple docs say that goes according to the bounds however my understand is the bounds and the frame are the same unless you rotate the UIbutton (or whatever)
