To what degree does reproducibility of research differ across disciplines?

Have there been any statistics meta studies that compare the reproducibility of results, as well as the willingness of researchers to provide reproducible data, analysis, and code, in their studies across disciplines/industries (including, but not limited to academia)? Background In some research areas, very small numbers of observations can completely shift the outcome of a study, and therefore the way that data are treated (e.g. how 'outliers' are in/excluded) can have a very large impact on the results. I am interested to know which disciplines are more forthcoming with reproducible research, and which aren't. Examples Some researchers make their entire datasets, code and thought processes available on their website, their university/organisation's website, or on github or perhaps kaggle. But on the other extreme, some researchers do whatever they can to hide their work (like a black box). Question Have meta studies been conducted comparing the willingness for researchers to share their data, thinking, and code across disciplines, and if so, what were the results (i.e. which industries/disciplines were happy to share their work and which weren't)?
