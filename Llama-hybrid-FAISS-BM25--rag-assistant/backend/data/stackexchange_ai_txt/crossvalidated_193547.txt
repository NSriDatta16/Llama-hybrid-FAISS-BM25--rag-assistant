A couple of key terms that you may want to research that relate are "Standard Error" and "Regression Toward the Mean". The standard error is a measure of uncertainty that takes sample size into account as well as variability within a group and reflects that fact that we are less uncertain about means based on larger samples. Regression toward the mean is a somewhat related concept where we tend to see extreme values when looking at individual measurements or means of small groups, then when we observe additional data the new values or means tend to be closer to the overall mean, such as in your example of D seeing a 0 by bad luck and further observations bring D's mean closer to the others. One approach for analyzing the data would be a Bayesian Hierarchical model (though you need to learn a fair amount to do these properly). This is a method that assumes a certain similarity among your groups and will therefore pull all the means towards a common center, but where you have large samples the means will be pulled a lot less than where you have fewer data points.
