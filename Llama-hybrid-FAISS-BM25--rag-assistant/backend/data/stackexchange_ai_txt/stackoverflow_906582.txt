SSRS 2008 TimeDataRetrieval timings

I've a report with an odd performance issue. When running it under the following conditions, SSRS Server ( UAT_SSRS ) & SQL Server ( SERVER_SQL ) I'm getting a TimeDataRetrieval value of 23726. When I run it under a different SSRS server ( PROD_SSRS ) and still use the same SQL server, the TimeDataRetrieval value is 325952 (well over ten times more ) for the exact same parameters. My understanding is that the TimeDataRetrieval covers both the connection handling & data set retrieval of the data. Why would there be such a huge difference between these two reports?
