How can I get only classes defined in the current project in EnvDTE?

I've got a Package for Vs2010 that currently follows EnvDTE=>Solution=>Projects=>CodeModel=>CodeElements to do the following recursively and find classes var q = elements.Cast () .Where(x => x is CodeClass || x is CodeNamespace) .Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("System") == false) .Where(x=>x.Name.StartsWith("Infragistics")==false) .Where(x=>x.Name.StartsWith("Microsoft")==false) .Where(x => x.Name.StartsWith("ICSharpCode")==false); It runs fairly slowly, is there a way to restrict this query/search to only classes/types defined within the current project? As I understand it FileCodeModel is neither useful nor appropriate since that would require opening every project Item.
