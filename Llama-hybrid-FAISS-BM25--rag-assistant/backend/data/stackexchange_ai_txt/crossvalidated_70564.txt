Yes. A non-time series method that I have used (as a "hack") to model time series is a generalized additive model (GAM) with a nonparametrically-smoothed time effect. For example, using the mgcv package in R , if y is the response variable and t is time, you could run something like model = gam(y~s(t)) . This is not a standard time series model, probably due to the fact that it makes no explicit accommodation for autocorrelation over time. That is, the model assumes that the observations are i.i.d.
