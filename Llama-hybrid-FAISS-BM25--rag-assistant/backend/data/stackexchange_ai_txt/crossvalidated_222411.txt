Yes , contrary to previous replies. I'm going to take the question as nontechnical, particularly the definition of "correlation". Maybe I'm using it too broadly, but see my second bullet. I hope it will be considered appropriate to discuss other answers here, because they illuminate different portions of the question. I'm drawing on Pearl's approach to causation, and in particular my take on it in some papers with Kevin Korb. Woodward probably has the clearest nontechnical account. @conjugateprior says "any controlled system is a counterexample". Yes, to the stronger claim that noncorrelation observed in your experiment implies no causation. I'm going to assume the question is more general. Certainly one experiment might have failed to control for masking causes, or inappropriately controlled for common effects, and hidden the correlation. But if $x$ causes $y$, there will be a controlled experiment where that relationship is revealed. Almost all definitions or accounts of causation treat it as a difference that makes a difference. Therefore no causation without (some kind of) correlation. If there is a direct link $x \rightarrow y$ in a causal Bayesian network, it does not mean that $x$ always makes a difference to $y$, only that there is some experiment fixing all other causes of $y$ where wiggling $x$ wiggles $y$. @aksakal has a great example why linear causation is insufficient. Agreed, but I want to be broad and nontechnical. If $y=x^2$, it's incomplete to tell a client that $y$ is uncorrelated with $x$. So I'll use correlation very broadly to mean a difference in $x$ that is reliably associated with a difference in $y$. It can be as nonlinear or nonparametric as you like. Threshold effects are fine ($x$ makes a difference to $y$, but only over a finite range, or only by being larger or smaller than a particular value, like voltage in digital circuits). @Kodiologist creates an example where $y = \mathrm{Unif}({x,-x})$, so $|y| = |x|$ but no linear correlation. But clearly there is a discoverable relationship, so correlated in the broad sense. @Szabolcs uses random number generators to show an output stream constructed to appear uncorrelated. Like the digits of $\pi$, the stream appears random but is deterministic. I agree you're unlikely to find the relationship if given only the data, but it's there. @Li Zhi notes you can't logically jump from correlation to causation. Yes, no causes in, no causes out. But the question begins from causation: does it imply correlation? In the air pressure example, we have a threshold effect. There is a range where air pressure is uncorrelated with health. Indeed plausibly where it has no causal effect on health. But there is a range where it does. That is sufficient. But probably better to note ranges where there is and is not an effect. If $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D$, then there is correlation all along the chain, because there is causation. Repeated observation (or experiment) can show that $A$ does not directly cause $D$ but the correlation is there because there is a causal story. I do not know what @user2088176 had in mind, but I think if we take the question very generally, then the answer is yes. At least I think that's the answer required of the causal discovery literature and the interventionist account of causation. Causes are differences that make a difference. And that difference will be revealed, in some experiment, as persistent association.
