What does it mean for the training data to be generated by a probability distribution over datasets

I was reading the Deep Learning book and came across the following para (page 109, second para): The training and test data are generated by a probability distribution over datasets called the data-generating process. We typically make a set of assumptions known collectively as the i.i.d. assumptions. These assumptions are that the examples in each dataset are independent from each other and that the training set and test set are identically distributed, drawn from the same probability distribution as each other. This assumption enables us to describe the data-generating process with a probability distribution over a single example.The same distribution is then used to generate every train example and every test example. We call that shared underlying distribution the data-generating distribution, denoted $p_{\text{data}}$ . This probabilistic framework and the i.i.d. assumptions enables us to mathematically study the relationship between training error and test error. Can somebody please explain to me the meaning of this paragraph? On page 122 the last paragraph, it also gives an example a set of samples $\{x(1), \dots, x(m) \}$ that are independently and identically distributed according to a Bernoulli distribution with mean $\theta$ . What does this mean? Here are a few more specific questions. The probability distribution over datasets: What are the datasets? How is the probability distribution generated? The examples are independent of each other. Can you give me an example of where the examples are dependent? Drawn from the same probability distribution as each other. Suppose the probability distribution is Gaussian. Does the term "Same probability distribution" mean that all the examples are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance? "This assumption enables us". What does this mean? Finally, for the last paragraph of page 122, it is given that the samples follow Bernoulli distribution. What does this mean intuitively?
