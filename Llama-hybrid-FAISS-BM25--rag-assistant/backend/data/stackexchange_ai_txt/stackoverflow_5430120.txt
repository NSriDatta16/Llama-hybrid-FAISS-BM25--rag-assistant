Well from your posted code what I think is missing is at the beginning of each *.h file: #ifndef _some_unique_identifier_for_each_header #define _some_unique_identifier_for_each_header ...header contents #endif //_some_unique_identifier_for_each_header or a #pragma once if your compiler supports it. Without this, if the header is included multiple times from various sources you get errors relating to redefinition.
