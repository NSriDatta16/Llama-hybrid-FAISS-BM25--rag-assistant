1) z-normalization would not result in target range of [0,1]. z-Transformation does not result in a limited scale at all. Any values are possible yet unprobable. For possible processing it can be valuable to have all data only within a certain limit (knowing both max and min). Therefore z-normalization is not done here. 2) q set to the 90th percentile only for a time series of standard white noise - thereby effectively asking that 90% of standard white noise results in an influence of less than 0.1 for q. 3) It is not a common precodure (to my knowledge)
