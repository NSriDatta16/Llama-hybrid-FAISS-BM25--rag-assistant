What do I need for development for an ARM processor?

I'm familiar with X86[-64] architecture & assembly. I want to start develop for an ARM processor. But unlike desktop processors, I don't have an actual ARM processor. I think I need an ARM simulator. http://www.armtutorial.com/ say An ARM assembly compiler will be required, the most accessible is the ARMulator. I thought of downloading Armulator but found from http://forums.arm.com/index.php?showtopic=13744 that Its not sold seperately. But you can download an eval of RVDS - which includes RVISS/ARMulator I've downloaded & installed RVDS but It looks very complex. I'm unable to figure out what do I need to do to write ARM assembly & run it . I want to write in assembly not in C/C++. I don't have an ARM processor. What is a good simulator? Can any one please mention in short. How to write assembly & assemble & simulate using RVDS. Please be clear? Are there any other alternative ways. I can't afford buying any kind of boards. I always learn from books rather than tutorials. I'm following these two books: ARM System Developer's Guide: Designing and Optimizing System Software (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design) ARM System-on-Chip Architecture (2nd Edition) Do you have any better suggestions?
