How do I make an image follow the cursor even outside an application?

In VB.Net with Winforms how do I make an image follow the cursor even when it leaves the form? I want to do this during a drag and drop operation. BCL and/or GDI is better for my usecase than P/Invokes. If you are familiar with PeaZip, it does something of this sort when dragging a file from it's interface.
