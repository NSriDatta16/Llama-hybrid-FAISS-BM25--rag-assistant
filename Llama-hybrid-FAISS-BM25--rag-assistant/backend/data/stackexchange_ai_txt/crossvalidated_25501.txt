Can I use the output of one neural network as labelled training data?

Is there a term for using the best and worst results of a neural network classifier as labelled input for another neural network? Or isn't this approach valid at all? E.g. I train a neural network and then I classify unlabeled samples with this neural network. The outputs I use a labelled training for a new neural network.
