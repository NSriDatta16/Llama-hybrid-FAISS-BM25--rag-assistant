execute task before source block cruisecontrol.net 1.5

I'm trying to execute a program before the source control block executes and downloads the source to my local working directory. the prebuild task executes after and the tasks block executes after. I've poured over the docs and just can't figure it out. I eventually wrote an executable that ran before the code retrieval. Even then it was fragile. So, I switched to Automated QA.
