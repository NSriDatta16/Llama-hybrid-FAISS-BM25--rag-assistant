Is my time series stationary?

I am using R and have found that both KPSS ( Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin ) and the adf (Dickey-Fuller) tests indicate stationarity, having a p-value of 0.01 . Here is a plot of the original data: However, when I plot the correlogram, it looks as though the data are non-stationary. So what do you think? Is the data stationary or non-stationary?
