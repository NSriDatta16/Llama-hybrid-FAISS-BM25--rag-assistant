PCA is a method to reduce the dimensionality of your data. If the numerical values constituting your data set represent a cloud of points around a high-dimensional version of a plane, then there is a way of changing this representation of the points - say by rotating and stretching the co-ordinates - such that the order of the amount of variance matches the order of the axes - so in three dimensions, the x-axis of the new representation will have the most variance, the y-axis less than that and so on. (if you know some basic linear algebra then you are are simply changing the basis of the transformation underlying the covariance matrix to an orthogonal (orthogonality means zero correlation) one consisting of its eigenvectors; the spectrum measures the amount of variance so you select the eigenvectors corresponding to the higher eigenvalues.) In your case, when you perform such a thing, then the new features that you will get will be a mixture (linear combination) of your SST readings from different locations (assuming your matrix is shaped such that your rows are your SST readings) and will no longer be interpretable as 'temperature at a location'. A more natural way for you to reduce the dimensionality would be to consider a subset of the locations from which you have collected your SST values based on, well, climatological/geographical reasons.
