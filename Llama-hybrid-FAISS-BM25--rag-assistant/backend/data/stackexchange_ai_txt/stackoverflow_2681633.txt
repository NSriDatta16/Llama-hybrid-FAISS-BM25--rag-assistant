If your file system supports writeable snapshots - LVM, ZFS, Veritas, etc. - you can take an instant copy of the entire database partition, mount that in another place, start a new instance of MYSQL which uses the snapshot, perform your testing, remove your snapshot - all without disturbing your replica. The snapshot only needs storage for the amount of data that gets changed during your testing, and so might only need a few GB.
