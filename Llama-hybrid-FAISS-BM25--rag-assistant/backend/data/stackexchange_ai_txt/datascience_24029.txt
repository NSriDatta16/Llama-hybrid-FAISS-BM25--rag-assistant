Data Science Project Manager - Planning

I'm a project manager and I've been tasked to work with a data scientists. As a project manager it's my role to create a plan which I will monitor and report against. The data scientist has experience in his role however is struggling provide a breakdown of the work that he intends to do. Example the initial task is to analyse customer data held on our database to identify potential insights. Can data science projects be Project managed by identifying time constrained tasks? Can you direct me towards some examples or resources which may help breakdown data science projects?
