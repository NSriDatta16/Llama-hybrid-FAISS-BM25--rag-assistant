Statistics based image processing

I have a question in Bayesian based image processing tasks. When I was going through some papers, I found that distribution fitting can be used to choose the prior for the model? Why it is useful since observed data = target data+noise. How come the prior (information about target data) distribution can be chosen as a fitted distribution? My point of view fitted distribution is the distribution of the observed data, right?then how do I choose the likelihood? Can we choose the fitted distribution act as a likehood? I am totally confused. Please let me know the correct way of dealing with. All the answers are appreciated. thanks
