Yes, it is possible to have a non-clustered primary key, and it is possible to have a clustered key that is completely unrelated to the primary key. By default a primary keys gets to be the clustered index key too, but this is not a requirement. The primary key is a logical concept: is the key used in your data model to reference entities. The clustered index key is a physical concept: is the order in which you want the rows to be stored on disk. Choosing a different clustered key is driven by a variety of factors, like key width when you desire a narrower clustered key than the primary key (because the clustered key gets replicated in every non-clustered index. Or support for frequent range scans (common in time series) when the data is frequently accessed with queries like date between '20100101' and '20100201' (a clustered index key on date would be appropriate). This subject has been discussed here ad nauseam before, see also What column should the clustered index be put on? .
