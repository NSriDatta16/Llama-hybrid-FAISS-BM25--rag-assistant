OnColumnChanged and OnRowChanged events to TStringGrid

I need to know when the row/column property of a grid was changed in order to do some processing. In TStringGrid Row property is property Row: Longint read FCurrent.Y write SetRow; But, unfortunately I cannot override the SetRow as it is private. SelectCell is not private BUT it is called BEFORE the new column and row attribute is set. The only solution will be to replace all calls to Row property with my own property property MyRow: Longint read Row write SetMyRow; but it is not the most elegant solution. Any ideas? Delphi 7, Win 7 32 bit
