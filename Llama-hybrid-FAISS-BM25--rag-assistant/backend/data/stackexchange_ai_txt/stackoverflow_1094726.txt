In part, it depends on what your scenario is. The "simple" answer is to just compile the expression and invoke it, but that has a potential performance impact if you are doing it in a tight loop (passing a delegate would be a lot quicker). I'm not sure whether if would apply in this particular case (because of the agent ), but to avoid doing too much expression compilation, you can look for simple scenarios and read the value directly from the expression tree; a little bit of PropertyInfo / FieldInfo is going to be quicker than compiling it... For more, look at TryEvaluate here , and how it is used with Compile as a backup strategy (although you have the advantage of a known delegate type).
