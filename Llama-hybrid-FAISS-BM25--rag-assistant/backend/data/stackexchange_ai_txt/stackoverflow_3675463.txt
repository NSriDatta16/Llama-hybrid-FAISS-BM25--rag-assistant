I think the issue is the way you are using MVC more than anything. You are using a call to a helper method directly in your web page. Rather than doing this you should hand this processing off to controller or code that calls (one way or another) and then add that to the model and use something like in the view Once you have this model implemented you would already have the processing only making the call once per request. At that stage you can profile your application and see if any further optimisation is needed. Options open to you then are to wrap the retrieval of the email address in some sort of caching that could persist between calls. But that's only if it's needed - you might be optimising prematurely as the overhead of only calling it once per request may be acceptable.
