This is an old problem without an efficient solution. As you know, confidence intervals and prediction intervals are very different things. Bootstrapped variance estimates for parameters will not give you robust prediction intervals. A theoretically correct approach would require you to iteratively bootstrap the data by hand, fit mixed models and obtain predictions, then you must calculate bias, and using a theoretically correct approach to obtain bootstrapped prediction interval estimates. This would probably take days to do. Furthermore, the question of whom exactly you're predicting effects in needs to be addressed. Predictions can be obtained at any heirarchical level of correlation. Mixed models capture individual level effects. So you might be giving predictions for a particular individual (in which case the random effect is a fixed, non-zero value), or it could be marginalized to a population averaged result. If you consult the default predict.merMod method, you'll see the option re.form which requires you to tell R among exactly whom you're prediction. Also this is an illuminating read: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/merTools/README.html
