Python to clean miswritten words with repetitive letters such as "wwwwooorrrrddss" to "words"

When cleaning text-data in Python3 for NLP, are there are any 'common practices' when it comes to addressing repetitive letters in words such as "wwwwooorrds" to "words", or "fffunnnyyyyyy" to "funny"? The source of the miswritten words is an OCR and I am not able to address the issue upstream, and thought I would check if there was anything that I can do downstream to fix this. Thanks!
