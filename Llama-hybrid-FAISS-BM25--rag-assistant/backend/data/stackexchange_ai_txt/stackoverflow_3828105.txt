Determining weight matrix

I need to design a neural network which has the following behavior: p(1)={0,1,1,1} outputs a(1)={0,1,0,0} p(2)={1,1,0,1} outputs a(2)={0,0,1,0} p(3)={0,0,1,0} outputs a(3)={0,0,0,1} p(4)={0,0,1,1} outputs a(4)={1,1,0,1} How can i do so? Which type of neural network should I use? Which learning method can be used here? Thanks.
