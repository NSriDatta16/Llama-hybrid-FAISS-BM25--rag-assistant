How can I change the position of a div using jQuery?

I'd like reposition a div on my website using jQuery. Basically I have a toolbar with many slots. I'm using the Draggable+Droppable items from jQueryUI to handle the moving and dropping. I'd like the dropped element to be positioned dead in the center of the container(droppable) to simulate a 'snap-to-center' effect. How would I do this? I'm pretty new to jQuery, sorry for the simple question. Thanks!
