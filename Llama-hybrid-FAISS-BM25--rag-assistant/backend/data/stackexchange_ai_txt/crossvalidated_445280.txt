For anyone who might stumble upon this question, I have a solution using scikit-learn's Pipeline , as recommended in the accepted answer. Below is the code I used to get this to work for my problem, chaining together StandardScaler , PCA and Ridge regression into a cross-validated grid-search: from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler pipe = Pipeline([("scale", StandardScaler()), ("reduce_dims", PCA()), ("ridge", Ridge()) ]) param_grid = dict(reduce_dims__n_components = [0.5, 0.75, 0.95], ridge__alpha = np.logspace(-5, 5, 10), ridge__fit_intercept = [True, False], ) grid = GridSearchCV(pipe, param_grid=param_grid, cv=10) grid.fit(X, y)
