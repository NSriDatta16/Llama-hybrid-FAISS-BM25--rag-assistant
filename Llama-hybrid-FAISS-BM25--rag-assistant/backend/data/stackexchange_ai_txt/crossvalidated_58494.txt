Randomly distributed residuals or not?

Using Minitab I have checked for regression assumptions. Here I can see that the residuals (errors) of x4 are distributed normally. (y is response). However, are they distributed randomly? Looking at the "Versus Fits" graph they seem to be distributed normally, however I'm not very sure. What do you think? Regression Analysis: y versus x4 The regression equation is y = 62,1 + 4,98 x4 Predictor Coef SE Coef T P VIF Constant 62,125 9,683 6,42 0,000 x4 4,979 2,634 1,89 0,063 1,000 S = 11,5115 R-Sq = 5,5% R-Sq(adj) = 4,0% PRESS = 8703,56 R-Sq(pred) = 0,00% Analysis of Variance Source DF SS MS F P Regression 1 473,5 473,5 3,57 0,063 Residual Error 61 8083,3 132,5 Lack of Fit 3 638,8 212,9 1,66 0,186 Pure Error 58 7444,6 128,4 Total 62 8556,9 1 rows with no replicates Unusual Observations Obs x4 y Fit SE Fit Residual St Resid 35 3,00 49,00 77,06 2,21 -28,06 -2,48R 56 2,00 60,00 72,08 4,54 -12,08 -1,14 X R denotes an observation with a large standardized residual. X denotes an observation whose X value gives it large leverage. Durbin-Watson statistic = 2,22949 Durbin-Watson is 2.22. Close to 2. So it means that the (standardized?) residuals are randomly and independently distributed?
