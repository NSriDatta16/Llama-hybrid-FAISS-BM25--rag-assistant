Look and feel of workflow (.net WF4, beta2)

can i change the standard look and feel of a sequential workflow back to the wf 3.5 look and feel? I miss the on DragOver automatically expanding arrows between the elements. If this is not possible, can i change the xaml of my activities to a similar to .net 3.5 wf visibility? Thanks!
