There is no perfect solution (mouseover/hover-simulation effect) in firebug. However, there are a couple ways to edit your hover state in firebug: Add an :active state, along with your :hover a:hover, a:active { ... } If you mouse down on your element, drag off and release, it remains active. Turn the :hover state into a .hover class You can edit the CSS rule by clicking on the source file (in Firebug's Style tab) Then of course, you'd add (and remove) the .hover class from your element.
