I would try the following: SELECT user_id FROM user_data WHERE ( field_id = 1 AND value= 'Gandalf' ) OR ( field_id = 3 AND value = 'Glamdring' ) GROUP BY user_id HAVING COUNT( field_id ) = 2 It will search for all the rows that match one of your criteria, and use GROUP BY and HAVING afterwards to find the user_id that has the expected count of matches.
