Here's my definition after doing some research. Component-Driven Development is an approach in software development in which code is fragmented into reusable and testable components that are combined together to form application foundation for delivering business functionality. The combination and management of components is usually delegated to Inversion of Control Container. A component itself is a class that implements some service contract and explicitly defines the dependencies that it needs in order to fulfill this contract. Actual implementation is hidden from everybody else outside the component. Related links: Component-Driven Development and IoC Container
