As others have mentioned, linear interpolation doesn't give the best sound quality, but it's simple and cheap. For each new sample you create, just average it with the next one, e.g. short[] source = ...; short[] result = new short[source.length * 2]; for(int i = 0; i You should definitely search for a library that helps you with working with WAV files. Even though it's a simple format, you shouldn't have to do that yourself if there's code available that will do what you need. By the way, why are you doing this in the first place? Perhaps you could just use sox or a similar tool to do this.
