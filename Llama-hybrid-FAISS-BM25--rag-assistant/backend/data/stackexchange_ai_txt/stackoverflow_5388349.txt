Including SVG in HTML5 for iOS

I'd like to include an SVG image in an HTML5 web page, to interact with this SVG via JavaScript, and to apply CSS styling. If possible, I'd prefer to keep the SVG in a separate file. I'm hoping to be able to use the web page offline so hopefully whatever solution is recommended will be compatible with this. Please could someone suggest the best / most cross-browser compatible way of doing this? If there's not really a method that will work across all browsers, I'd be happy to settle for a way that works with iOS 4.3's Safari browser :-) Thanks in advance! Thanks to everyone and apologies for not giving an update sooner - Unfortunately, I got distracted by another project! After some time playing with various alternative options, ( http://tavmjong.free.fr/SVG/SVG_IN_HTML/svg_in_html.html / http://www.schepers.cc/svg/blendups/embedding.html ) I've still not been able to use an external .svg file and keep the JS in the main HTML5 file - i.e. I've been unable to get these approaches to allow the SVG file to reference JS functions, or to allow the HTML file to gain access to elements from the included SVG file. Even inline SVG doesn't yet work on iOS :( So, I'm going to try my luck with Raphael (http://raphaeljs.com). I think this may mean that I'll need to create the SVG programatically rather than being able to just link to an external .svg file. I'll just have to write a script to translate the SVG content to JS Raphael function calls and hope to avoid any other other stumbling blocks.
