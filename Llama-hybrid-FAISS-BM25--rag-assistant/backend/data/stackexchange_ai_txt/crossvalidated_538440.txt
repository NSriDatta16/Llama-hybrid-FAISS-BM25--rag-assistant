Real-World, Operationalized Applications of Multi-Arm Bandits

Multi-armed bandits are wonderful and have lots of potential applications. However, I don't know many companies or real-world practitioners who have implemented bandit algorithms. What are some examples of multi-bandits that are up and running? By this I mean: An organization (company, government or whatever) has implemented the bandit. And the algorithm is live, performing explore/exploit and touching real-world decisions that change something (large or small). In the real world. Refute this claim : "Bandits are an academic novelty. Despite attractive theoretical properties, practitioners have systematically refused to adopt them in practice since their invention in 1952." Note: I'm not asking for potentially good (new) uses for bandits . There's already a question about that , and I agree there are lots of potential applications. I'm asking what anyone actually has used them to do. Lets list the biggest and most impressive applications!
