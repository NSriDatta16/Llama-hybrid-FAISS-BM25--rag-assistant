Why does AIC select the wrong logistic regression model?

I've noticed a phenomenon with logistic regression: when the probability of success is small and number of trials large the AIC consistently selects the wrong models. In fact the more wrong the model the lower the AIC. Here's some example code to show what I mean. About $96\%$ of the time the model with the random probe gets chosen. $100\%$ of the time the model with $3$ random probes gets chosen. The models with probes have AIC between $300$ and $2000$ units lower. If I replace the $\lambda$ in the Poisson distribution with something smaller, like $1000$ , this doesn't happen anymore - the model with the random probe gets selected about $9\%$ of the time, the model with 3 probes $6\%$ of the time. This seems very odd to me. As the number of trials goes up the number of successes does too, so why does the metric break down? nreps 0] $fit > result$ fit0) mean(result $fit > result$ fit2) ```
