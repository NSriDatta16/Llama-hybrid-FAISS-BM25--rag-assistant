invalid attribute character xml docfrag innerxmll

the following lines work just fine and they write down the proper values into a xml file. The problem is trying to change the first tag. It keeps saying " What i have atm: test test But i would want it exactly reversed: (this is where the error occurs trying to achieve this) Below code is working but only for the first example. docFrag.InnerXml = " " + " " + txtQuestionName.Text + " " + " ";
