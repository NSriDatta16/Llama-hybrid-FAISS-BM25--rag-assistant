Calculate 3-sigma for a non-gaussian distribution of GPS observations

I am analysing the precision of an RTK GPS solution. I have a set of 2000 errors - distances from the average and I would like to calculate the 3-sigma value, which, were it Gaussian is ~13 mm. Now, the deviations are not at all Gaussian, here the absolute error values and I think that the classic calculation of sigma by sqrt(variance) is only valid for Gaussian datasets. Is it possible to validly calculate the 3-sigma CEP from this data, and if so, how? Sorry if this is a laughable question, I last went to a maths class in 1971... Edit I have updated the XY plot, the point colours show the age, cold first, hot last; blue -> green -> red. It is clear that at the beginning the errors were mostly negative (bottom left) and at the end they were mostly positive (top right). This is typical of GPS drift, due the changing configuration of the constellation. It would become more-or-less Gaussian after a very long time, but I need to make estimates based on thousands of points, not millions. The number I am trying to ascertain is the chance of a point being outside a given CEP and I want this number to be comparable with the CEP that I would get from an infinite (close to Gaussian) set of points. The StdDev of my data is 4.33, but 1301 out of the 2020 points = 64.4% have an error > 4.33. What am I doing wrong?
