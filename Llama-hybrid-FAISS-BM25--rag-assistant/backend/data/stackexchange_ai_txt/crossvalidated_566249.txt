How to perform statistical power analysis for generalized linear models on IBM's SPSS?

I ran a generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) on some data of mine. This is my simplified syntax: {(Poisson) GLMM embryo count BY Lineage(Ploidy), Ploidy, P treatment, Ploidy*P treatment, Length} My dependent variable is embryo count (discrete data). My independent variables are qualitive excluding length (which is continuous data). Lineage is can be thought of as a family or tribe and ploidy is the number of sets of chromosomes my organism has. When I perform a general linear model on SPSS it is relatively easy to do a power analysis since there is an option to check on a power analysis button and the user receives "Observed Power" values. I have no idea how to do a power analysis for a generalized linear model or if there is a more appropriate way to perform a power analysis on my general linear model. Via syntax or drop-down menu are both great options for me! I just looked at my results and it seems like there isn't any type of pattern with the observed power.
