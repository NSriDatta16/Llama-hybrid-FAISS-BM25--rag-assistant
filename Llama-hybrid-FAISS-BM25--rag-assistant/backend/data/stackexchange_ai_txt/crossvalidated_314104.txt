How would you test instantaneous causality?

I'm working with two time series over the same time period, and by plotting the time series graphically there is an obvious relationship that exists between the two. When one's values peak, the other's instantaneously drop. Is there a way I could calculate a significance test for such relationship? I know the Granger causality test models a series' current state as a function the previous states of itself and the other series. In my case the relationship is instantaneous, so it's not giving me anything tangible.
