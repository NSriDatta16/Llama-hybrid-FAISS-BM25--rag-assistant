What's the relation between deep learning and extreme learning machine?

Often I have found deep learning and extreme learning machine discussed together. Based on my little knowledge of the subject my impression is that they are different methods with different aims. So what's the relation between deep learning and extreme learning machine ? Is there any important paper that I am missing and that I should read?
