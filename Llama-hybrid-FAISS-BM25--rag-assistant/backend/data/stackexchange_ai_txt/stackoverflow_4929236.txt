The original reference to Strand sort is http://groups.google.com/group/fido7.ru.algorithms/msg/26084cdb04008ab3 ... according to that, it is O(n^2). Strand sort was presented as a component of J sort, which it claims is O(n lg n). That the average complexity is O(n^2) makes sense since, in random data, half the strands will be of length 1, and O((n/2)^2) = O(n^2).
