Difference between deep neural network and convolutional neural network

I wanted to develop an app similar to this on my own which is based on image classification using neural nets. While in early phases of my research I came across through terms Deep Neural Nets and Convolutional Neural Nets . What is the difference between two and which will be the best bet for me to work on for this project? Edit1:- I looked on kaggle's digit recogniser for my initial research
