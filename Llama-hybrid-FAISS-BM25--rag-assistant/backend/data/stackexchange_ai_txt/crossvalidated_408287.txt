If I understand your question correctly, you would like to combine both the point estimate (percentage of up-votes) and its reliability (roughly represented by the total number of votes) in a single number. As confidence intervals represent both values, a very simple approach would be to base the score on the lower limit of a (e.g. 50%) confidence interval for a binomial proportion $\hat{p}$ . To make sure that this value is positive, you should use a confidence interval that also works with small values of $n$ and also with values of $p$ close to one ore zero, e.g. the Bayesian HPD interval, the "exact" Clopper-Pearson interval, or the WIlson interval. The latter has the attractive feature of being computable in closed form, i.e., the lower limit is: $$p_{lower} = \frac{1}{1+z^2/n}\left[\hat{p} + \frac{z^2}{2n} - z \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}+\frac{z^2}{4n^2}}\right] $$ where $z=z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\alpha/2)$ standard normal quantile; for $1-\alpha=50\%$ , it is $z\approx 0.7$ .
