Using spring:message to define form tag attribute in Spring web application

I'm developing a Java/Spring web application. The problem I'm currently facing is that I'd like to have message from message.resources shown as an attribute in an HTML. So instead of the hardcoded value "login" I need to the value of as the value attribute of that input tag. As the pages are all xml, it's no option to nest tags like " /> as it does not compile. I could, of course, read the value in the Java controller and use a JSTL variable to display the value, but I think it would be too hackish and complicated, especially for pages with large amount of submit buttons. Is there some kind of elegant way of accomplishing what I want to do?
