Most views don't communicate directly with the view controller. Rather, they are connected to an IBOutlet, or they use target-action to call a method on the view controller. For the former, just declare an IBOutlet property as you normally would and set it after you create the view. (Note that technically, you don't need the IBOutlet keyword as you're not making a connection in IB, but I don't think it hurts anything.) self.myViewOutlet = myNewView; If your UIView is a subclass of UIControl , use addTarget: action: forControlEvents: to have methods of your view controller called when certain events happen on the control. [myNewControl addTarget:self action:@selector(mySelector:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDragInside];
