Drag drop html table in powerpoint 2007

I've been dealing with this problem for quite a while: Our company develops addins for word/excel/ppt (both for 2003 and 2007 versions) One of the options our addins offer is to drag a table from the addin into the application. This is implemented in 3 different ways: Excel --> we create a tab delimeted string and drag-dropping it as DataFormats.text Word --> we create an RTF table, and drag-dropping it as DataFormats.rtf PPT --> we create an HTML table, and drag-dropping it as DataFormats.html Everything is working great in both the 2003 & 2007, except for the powerpoint 2007, which doesn't seem to support any kind of html dropping (unlike powerpoint 2003, which is working great) We've tried everything but we're beginning to despair. Anyone knows how to allow PowerPoint 2007 to allow dropping html into the presentation?
