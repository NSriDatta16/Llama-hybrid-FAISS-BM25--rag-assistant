t-SNE dimensions as additional predictor variables

This question could also (maybe) relate to PCA. I built a supervised RandomForest on a dataset that I'm currently working on - the actual V Prediction $R^2$ was holding around 80% across many CV folds. I then decided to look at the data from an unsupervised standpoint by dropping the Response variable and using t-SNE and noticed that we had interesting structure to the data. I used the t-SNE output (3 columns) and added them my original data set as 3 more predictor variables and rebuilt the Model. The performance of the model jumped to 90%. I'm looking for a simple explanation of why this would have happened? Is it okay to do this? How would one actually make live real world predictions using this approach? (I mean the t-SNE predictor vars are formed from the whole dataset, which I wouldn't know at "Prediction time").
