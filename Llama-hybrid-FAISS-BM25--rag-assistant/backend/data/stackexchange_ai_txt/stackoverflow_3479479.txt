Looking neater is irrelevant in writing SQL Code. What looks elegant is often the worst possible way to solve the problem from a performance standpoint. The only way to know for sure which is best is to first make sure both ways you are testing return the same results and then performance test them and check out the execution plans (or explain in mySQL). Techniques which make the query better are database specific as well. What works best to performance tune in SQL Server might be the worst possibility in Oracle.
