Useful stock SQL datasets?

Does anyone know of any resources that provide good, useful stock datasets? For example, I've downloaded a SQL script that includes all of the U.S. states, cities, and zipcodes. This saved me a lot of time in a recent application where I wanted to be able to do lookups by geography. Are any of you aware of other useful datasets that are freely available for download? For example: Blacklisted IP addresses Names of colleges/universities Names of corporations/stock symbols Anyone have any recommendations? EDIT: As an example, here is the location where I found a MySQL script containing all of the U.S. zip codes and their corresponding latitude/longitude. Has anyone else found similarly useful datasets in SQL that can be easily imported and used? http://www.chrissibert.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/zipcodes.7z EDIT 2: To clarify what type of datasets I'm talking about... I'm referring to datasets that can be immediately useful for applications, can be applied across a variety of scenarios, and typically represent information that is easy to find for small cases but harder to compile for larger data sets. The zip code database is a great example to me. It's not hard to get the lat/long for a single given zip code. But, it's a bit more time consuming to get the values for all valid zip codes in the U.S. This data is also not useful to a single industry or business sector, but can be applied across a range of applications.
