You have several phases of the data retrieval process: connection time, download time, and database procesing time. If you store your data in a csv file in a blob storage then the processing time will be faster (essentially zero). So every day you could save the data from the database to a csv file and then access the file when you need it. Azure serverless will reduce the connection time and download time (if your internet connection is slow), but will not reduce the processing time of the database.
