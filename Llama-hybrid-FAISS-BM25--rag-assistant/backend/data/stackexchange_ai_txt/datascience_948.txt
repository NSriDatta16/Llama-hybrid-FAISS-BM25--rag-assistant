Any clear winner for Data Science in Scala?

I have found a number of libraries and tools for data science in Scala, I would like to know about which one has more adoption and which one is gaining adoption at a faster pace and to what extent this is the case. Basically, which one should I bet for (if any at this point). Some of the tools I've found are (in no particular order): Scalding Breeze Spark Saddle H2O Spire Mahout Hadoop MongoDB If I need to be more specific to make the question answerable: I'm not particularly interested in clusters and Big Data at this moment, but I'm interested in sizable data (up to 100 GB) for information integration and predictive analytics.
