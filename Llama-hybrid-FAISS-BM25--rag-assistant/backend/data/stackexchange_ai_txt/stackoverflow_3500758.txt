In what cases should public fields be used instead of properties?

Possible Duplicate: Public Data members vs Getters, Setters In what cases should public fields be used, instead of properties or getter and setter methods (where there is no support for properties)?

After all, they break the Object-Oriented principle of encapsulation where getters and setters are allowed and encouraged.
