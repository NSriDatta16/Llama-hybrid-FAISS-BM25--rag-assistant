As James suspects, this is isomorphic to the Halting problem and thus provably impossible. In fact, this problem can trivially be reduced to compiling Perl (because Perl requires situation-dependent knowledge). There exists a simple, elegant proof that Perl cannot in fact be compiled. Thus, we have at least one counter-example (Perl) where a static compiler is unable to check a programâ€™s correctness, thus contradicting the hypothesis. Q.E.D.
