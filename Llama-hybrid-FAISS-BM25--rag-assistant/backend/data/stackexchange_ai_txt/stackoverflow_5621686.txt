Apply 9-patch drawable to Button, keeping default padding

I'm attempting to customise the look of a Button using a 9-patch drawable with no padding defined within in (no pixels on the right or bottom inside the 9-patch editor). Is there a simple way to apply a 9-patch drawable to a button and maintain the button's default size. For example, when I apply the 9-patch to the Easy button shown below, it is a different size to the other default styled buttons, which share the same layout, except for the 9-patch style. Mdpi layout: Hdpi layout: So basically, is there a way to make the Easy button the same size as Medium and Hard, on both mdpi and hdpi screens, without making a new 9-patch for each density, and working out the correct padding. Thanks in advance for your help, I can provide more information if required.
