Using a database system is mainly useful if you want to have permanent storage, which I gather is not your goal. What you may be interested in is some kind of message queuing system that can arrange for the reliable transport between your various applications. As for the data format, the decision between XML and JSON is mostly a matter of taste and a question what your applications and transport mechanisms can handle best, unless you are interested in using some kind of schema language to validate the XML, something that is currently not widely practices with JSON.
