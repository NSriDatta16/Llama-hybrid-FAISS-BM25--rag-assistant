Overriding the JSP servlet (filter "*.jsp") to wrap in an authentication model

Can the JSP servlet that filters on *.jsp (org.apache.jasper.servlet.JspServlet in Tomcat 6) be extended in some way so whenever someone goes to a JSP page I can do some server side authentication to check whether the user can view the page. Our current technique is a taglib in a common include that is imported into each JSP page, but it's not very elegant. The key here is that I don't want to reinvent the wheel and worry about compiling JSPs into Servlets, I would ideally like to delegate in each method with super.meth(). I've been searching Google but I don't know the right keywords to use. Anything containing JSP and Servlet returns beginner tutorials. Thanks, John
