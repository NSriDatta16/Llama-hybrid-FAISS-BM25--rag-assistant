Classifying ultrasound videos with a small dataset

I have a small dataset of ~300 ultrasound clips, about evenly divided between 3 classes. Due to the nature of the data (medical) it's difficult to get more. I need to train a model (or an ensemble) to classify these clips. Feature reduction is a necessary first step. I've considered using HOGS (for example) on a cropped part of the video to create relatively small set of time-series features. However, even a "dumbed down" version of HOGS would give at least 100 time series features. That being said, lets assume for a minute I'm able to reduce the feature space even more while maintaining variability between classes. Which model(s) would be best suited for this problem?
