strtok_r is your friend. Don't use plain strtok() , as it's NOT thread-safe. Even on platforms where it is thread-safe (because the state is held in Thread-Local Storage), there is still the problem that the use of internal state means you cannot parse tokens from several strings simultaneously. for example, if you write a function which uses strtok() to separate string A, your function cannot be called within the loop of a second function which is using strtok() to split string B.
