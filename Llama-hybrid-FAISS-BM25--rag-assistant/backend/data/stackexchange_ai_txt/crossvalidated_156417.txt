As far as I can see, the distribution of the IVs isn't directly relevant. Assuming you're talking about a continuous power-law distribution ($f(y)\propto y^{-k}$ for all $y>1$), this would be a Pareto distribution. One approach would be to model $y^*=\ln(y)$ as exponential using a GLM, where the power in the Pareto becomes the rate parameter, as long as the available link functions for it allow you to match the model you want. Failing that, you will likely need to look at writing and dealing with the likelihood more directly for whatever model you have. In packages that don't offer the exponential directly, this can be done with a gamma GLM, setting the dispersion parameter to 1. -- In R you can fit an exponential GLM as follows: fit If you specifically want a Bayesian GLM, see the arm package. You may also find the following document helpful - Bayesian Generalized Linear Models in R , Starkweather, 2011 (pdf).
