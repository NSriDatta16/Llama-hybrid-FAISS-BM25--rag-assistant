It's not the most elegant solution, but this should get you started: $(function() { $('#slide').click(function() { var bigLeft = $('#big').position().left; var item = $('.item:eq(2)'); var itemLeft = item.position().left; var itemTop = item.position().top; item.css({ position: 'absolute', float: 'none', display: 'inline', top: itemTop, left: itemLeft }).animate({ 'left': bigLeft }); }); }); Basically, jQuery makes it so that you don't actually need to know how far to slide your item, you only need to know its final destination. You'll also have to tinker with the item's position when you do the animation, since you won't be able to animate it the way that you want while it's floating left. Once you've set a firm position for the item, you just need to call .animate() and tell it to animate the item's left position to match that of your big div's left position. Here's a demo showing this in action: http://jsfiddle.net/Ender/Jbrqh/
