Hmm, this is tricky. This is a so-called E_DEPRECATED notice, pointing out a function call that still works, but will be removed in one of the coming versions of PHP. You could manually edit the code to fix this, but it seems to be in a core part of Magento or the PEAR client. It is likely to be fixed in a future version of Magento. Turning off error reporting for E_DEPRECATED notices might be justified in this case. The error_reporting setting for that would be error_reporting(E_ALL ^ E_DEPRECATED);
