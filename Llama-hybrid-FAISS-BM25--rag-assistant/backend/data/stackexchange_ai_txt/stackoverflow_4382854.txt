What you are trying to do requires lower level network analysis than sockets. Namely libpcap and its Java bindings , jNetPcap . This will let you capture packets much in the same way wireshark does, but from Java. The other options are analysing Wireshark logs after an experiment and that can get clunky quite quickly. You may also consider writing a custom wireshark dissector .
