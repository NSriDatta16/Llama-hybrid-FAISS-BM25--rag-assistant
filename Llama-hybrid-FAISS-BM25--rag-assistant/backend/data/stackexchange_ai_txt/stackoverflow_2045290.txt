XStream: Collapsing XML hierarchy as I parse

I have an XML document (generated by Adobe XFA forms), that contains data like the following: Since this file is defined elsewhere, I am not at liberty to change the format of the XML that I get. In my Java code, I create a Position class that contains the Title, Start and End Dates. My problem is, when I use XStream to parse the file, it wants a PositionBorder class to hold the title and dates. I want to basically ignore the border and place all of the fields into the Position class. What I'd really like to do is use something like the convertAnother method to convert the child of the position element. I tried to do just that and it fails, because my PositionConverter gets called for the PositionBorder (when I call convertAnother). Anyone have any clues how to deal with collapsing the structure of an XML when parsing?
