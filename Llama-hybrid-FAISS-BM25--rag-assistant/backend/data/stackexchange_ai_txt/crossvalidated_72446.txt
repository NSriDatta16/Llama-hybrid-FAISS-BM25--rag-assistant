R e1071 tune plot does not give me the best gamma?

I am using the R e1071 library for the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm. And I used tune to find out the best Cost and gamma parameters. Though the plot doesn't seem to provide the actual best prediction. Here is some details: gammalist Here is the plot obtained: The plot leads me to believe 0.02 is roundabout the best gamma. But I actually tested manually several others and find better results for 0.042. On a 200 sample, I get 23 errors with gamma=0.042, and 26 errors with gamma=0.02. How do you explain this?
