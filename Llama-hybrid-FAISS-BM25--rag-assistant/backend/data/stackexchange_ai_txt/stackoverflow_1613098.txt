Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303. I don't know what pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents there are out there, so... Depending on what you're going for, I'd use either 301 (permanent) or 307 (temporary). 301 will tell Google to behave as if you linked to the redirected site directly. 303 looks like it's intended for use in redirecting after submitting forms, specifically. edit: though your question is "What HTTP redirect status should I use to link offsite?" -- how about linking offsite directly? (which I guess doesn't work if you're using a form to do the linking, in which case you would use the 303 status code)
