Logistic regression with complete separation AND repeated measures

Consider a typical logistic regression on data with a binary response $Y$ , and some predictor variables $X$ 's. I understand that when the event is rare, or in the case of complete separation, one could apply the Firth correction, for example in SAS: proc logistic data=mydata descending; class x1; model y=x1 / firth; run; Recently I encountered a situation where repeated measures were made for all subjects ( $\text{time}=1,2,3)$ . All $X$ 's such as race and gender would be considered time-invariant. Only the binary response $Y$ might change over time. With three rows per participant, I can then fix a mixed model or GEE (with repeated statements in SAS) to account for the repeated measures. But what can I do in case of a rare event or complete separation now with repeated measures? After some research, it seems that the Firth correction is only available in proc logistic , which I believe does not handle repeated measures.
