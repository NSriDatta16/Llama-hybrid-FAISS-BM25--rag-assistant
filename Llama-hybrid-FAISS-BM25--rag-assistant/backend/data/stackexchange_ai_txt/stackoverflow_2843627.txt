How to bring the parent element with floated child elements to the center of the document?

I have organized a menu. Its HTML is as follows: Text 1 Text 2 Text 3 Text 4 This is a horizontal menu, so I have floated the list items to left to appear them in a horizontal line. I could have used display:inline to appear them in a single line, but since IE does not support it and I don't know any other way to do so, I used float:left;. It's css is: .topmenu { list-style:none; margin:0; padding:0; } .topmenu li { float:left; } This brings the menu in a perfect horizontal line, but the entire list is floated to the left. I want to bring the .topmenu to appear in the center of the document and keep the listitem inside it floated towards the left. I found that this is achievable by defining width property of the .topmenu, but I dont want to fix its width as the list-items are dynamically generated and thus could increase and decrease. Any one know of any solution?
