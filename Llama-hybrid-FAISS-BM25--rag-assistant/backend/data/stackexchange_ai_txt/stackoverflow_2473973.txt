Robert, try replacing dict_start = datetime(*start_time[:6]) with dict_start = start_time and dict_end = datetime(*end_time[:6]) with dict_end = end_time It looks silly, but perhaps try it anyway. My reason is this: datetime.strptime returns a datetime.datetime object. Since the code originally says dict_start = datetime(*start_time[:6]) it appears that dict_start is intended to also be a datetime.datetime , with the same 6 fields (year,month,day,hour,minutes,seconds). So try dict_start = start_time If that doesn't work, you might have to show us more of the code so we can form a better guess as to what was intended. Edit: The easiest way to get at the individual fields (year,month,day,hour,minutes,seconds) is to use the dot notation to access the attributes. For example, (start_time.year,start_time.month,start_time.day) gives a 3-tuple with the year, month, and day as integers. PS. For more info about datetime objects, see http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html . It may contain useful examples for you.
