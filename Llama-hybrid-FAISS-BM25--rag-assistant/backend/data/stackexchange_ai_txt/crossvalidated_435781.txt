find the actual mean from "noisy data"

Case: A team is estimating the amount of work they have planned to do for the next week. There are 4-5 items each week and each individual item is estimated to be between 1 and 20 units of work. The team is afraid of under-estimating, so they have a tendency to pad the estimates with safety. In X% of the cases, they manage to complete all work items and in the cases where they didn't need all of the safety, they still use it (Student's syndrome). Based on this data and all the assumptions needed such as the actual sizes of the work items being normally distribution and that half of the estimates without safety are too low and half of the estimates are too high but the average is just right. Would it be possible to create a function of X (the percentage they complete everything on time) and the amount of safety they were likely putting in?
