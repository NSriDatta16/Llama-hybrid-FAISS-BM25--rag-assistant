Bayesian Structural Time Series in BSTS package: implementing mixed model

I have been using BSTS package for quite a while and I have found it pretty effective with respect to ARIMAX models. I was wondering whether it would be possible to share regression coefficients in the regression part (the equation being: $Y_t = \mu_t + \mathbf{x_t} \boldsymbol{\beta} + S_t + \epsilon_t$, with $\mu_t$ being the level at time $t$, $S_t$ being the seasonal component at time $t$) across different time series. Furthermore I would like to have also mixed effects so that my new equation would become something like: $Y_{it} = \mu_t + \mathbf{x_t} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \mathbf{Z_t} \boldsymbol{\eta_i}+ S_t + \epsilon_t$. Question: Is this achievable through BSTS? Having read Steven Scott presentation I see he implemented Lasso Variable selection and other stuff which makes it difficult for me to implement it directly in STAN..
