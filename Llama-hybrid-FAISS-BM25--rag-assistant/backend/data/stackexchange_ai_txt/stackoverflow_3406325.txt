Basic Database design question - 1 attribute three Entities

Please can someone clarify something which I should really know by now? If I have Three Entitys Organisation, Director and Company secretary and each have the attribute primary address. If I were modelling a conceptual ERD should I have the attribute ‘primary address’ separately in each entity or should I model a fourth entity Address, add primary address and have them all PK > FK to that? Have since found this link Is this a good way to model address information in a relational database? which pretty much covers everything I need to know.
