My data is highly overlapping, but when I apply logistic regression, it is giving an impressive accuracy of 79%. Why?

Logistic regression is supposed to work well only on data that is linearly separable. As we can see in the pair plot, the data points heavily overlap. The logistic regression model is in fact showing better accuracy than Decision Tree, KNN, & Random Forest (Methods that are suitable for overlapping data). Even the cross validation score is higher for my logistic regression model.
