Regarding point 3 Binding tools generally don't handle very elegantly. This is understandable, since they have no information about what it could contain, so they'll usually give you an untyped placeholder. It's up the the application code to handle that at runtime. JAXB is particular (the RI, at least) makes a bit of a fist of it, but it's workable. This corresponds to the @XmlAnyElement annotation in JAXB. The behaviour is as follows: @XmlAnyElement - Keep All as DOM Nodes If you annotate a property with this annotation the corresponding portion of the XML document will be kept as DOM nodes. @XMLAnyElement(lax=true) - Convert Known Elements to Domain Objects By setting lax=true , if JAXB has a root type corresponding to that QName then it will convert that chunk to a domain object. http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/08/using-xmlanyelement-to-build-generic.html
