Can we use result of cluster analysis (e.g. K-means) as the input to train a classifier?

I am having a project in which I need to group test cases failing due to same faults, and obviously, test cases are not labeled with due-to fault. So clearly we have an unsupervised classification (clustering) problem. However, the requirement is that we need to classify new coming failed test cases into existing/new groups. My question is : can we use the result of cluster analysis (e.g. K-means) as the input to train a classifier (e.g. Naive-Bayes or SVM ) for future prediction; we also plan to implement a feedback system (let the users tell whether the prediction is right or wrong and let them suggest the correct prediction) for classifier re-training. Or it is better to use only the resulting clusters to predict new data (decide which centroid new data belongs to, use HDBSCAN for example)? I appreciate all your answers and suggestions. Thanks in advance.
