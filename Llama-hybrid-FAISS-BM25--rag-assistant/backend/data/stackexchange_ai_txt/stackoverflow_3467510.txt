regex: put text outside inside

I have some broken html-code that i would like to fix with regex. The html might be something like this: text1 text2 text3 text4 text5 But there can be much more paragraphs and other html-elements too. I want to turn in into: text1 text2 text3 text4 text5 Is this possible with a regex? I'm using php if that matters.
