As prelic points out, whatever error metric you use, make sure you measure it out-of-sample. You should do this through cross-validation, but you can also use a held-out test set if time does not allow for cross-validation. Your error metric depends on what sort of data you are dealing with. In general, there are 2 kinds of problems in machine learning: classification problems and regression problems (though this is not always the case). For classification problems, it is useful to look at confusion matrixes , roc curves , and precision-recall curves . For regression problems, it is useful to look at RMSE or MAE , xy plots of your predicted y values vs the actual y values, and histograms of your residuals (predicted y-actual y).
