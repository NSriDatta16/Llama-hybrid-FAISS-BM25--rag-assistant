What's happening here is that the variable $value is typed to Object[] in the script. The call to Get-Member works because you are piping the value into the function. Hence instead of seeing the array it sees the values in the array which are indeed typed to String . This can be viewed by using the following Get-Member call without piping Get-Member -MemberType Method -InputObject $value This is also why ToUpper correctly fails (it's an array not a String ).
