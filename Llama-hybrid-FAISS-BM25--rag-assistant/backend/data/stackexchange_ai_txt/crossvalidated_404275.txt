Inconsistency between multivariate logistic regression and independent t test

I have data in which there are 1 dependent continuous variable ( $Y$ ) and 20 independent continuous variables ( $X$ s). I discretized $Y$ into two categories ( $low$ and $high$ ). Then, I applied independent samples t test taking the discretized $Y$ as grouping variables. Next, according to to test result, of the 20 continuous variables, 5 variables had different means Y. Finally, I applied multivariate logistic regression model taking discretized $Y$ as the dependent variable. This time, it was seen that none of the 20 variables had significant p values. How should I interpret this? Thanks GÃ¼nal
