Could somebody help me read these ACF and PACF plots?

So, I have this time series that I have already forecasted using an ARMA model, but I am new to this and am therefore not at all sure whether or not I did this (somewhat) correctly. I got the best results when differentiating the series twice, but I am not sure if it was really the right way to go. What would your inputs be when looking at the provided ACFs and PACFs? They all are from the series. Without differences, once differentiated and twice differentiated.
