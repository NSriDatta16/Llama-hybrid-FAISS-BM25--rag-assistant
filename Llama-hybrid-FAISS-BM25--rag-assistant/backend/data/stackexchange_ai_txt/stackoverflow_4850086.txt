Passing state between screens in a Symbian/QML app

I'm trying to use a Loader to load full screen components to changing screens in a Symbian/QML project. This doesn't feel like the correct way to do it, so I'm probably missing something obvious. The example I'll use is a button on one screen which should open a full screen WebView (a.k.a ChildBrowser). I'd like to make the ChildBrowser a re-usable component, so need to pass the URL to it. I've tried building a Javascript file with a pragma library : .pragma library var map = {}; function put(key, value) { map[key] = value; } function get(key) { return map[key]; } For want of a better title, we call this intent.js . The screen holding the button: import "intent.js" as Intent Button { onButtonClicked: { Intent.put("url", "http://example.com"); console.log("Going to " + Intent.get("url")); } } Later on, in ChildBrowser.qml , I'm importing "intent.js" and then getting the Intent.get("url"). This is undefined . My questions are: is using a Loader the intended way to build and transition between screens? how do you pass parameters between screens? how do you maintain state across the lifetime of the app? I'm especially interested in building controllers and models in Javascript. I'm sure these are newbie questions, so a set of links to the relevant documentation is probably all that is needed; I suspect not however.
