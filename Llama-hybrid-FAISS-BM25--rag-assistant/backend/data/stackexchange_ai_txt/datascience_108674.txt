To Do: Good Infrastructure : A data science team required a lot computing power and good infrastructure if they work on Big Data, ML problems etc. You should have machines with good computing power and ideally access to any cloud for better performance. A good data science team may not work efficiently if lack of resources Data Engineering Team : Most of data scientist can access data from databases but it is not fair to expect them to create Data Pipeline. So hire good data engineers who can help you ingest the data and create pipeline which can be used by Data Scientist. This may also include a thorough documentation of data to ease the process. Good MLOPs Practices : Data Scientist tries 100s of different ideas before implementing a final thing. It becomes very important to properly document these ideas for reproducibility and collaboration. A good company should encourage use of tools like MLFlow, Tensorboard etc for tracking. for more details : https://towardsdatascience.com/mlops-practices-for-data-scientists-dbb01be45dd8 Code Sharing & Version Control : Every data science team should have best practices around code sharing and version control. This helps teams to collaborate more effectively and efficiently. Please refer to this link : https://neptune.ai/blog/version-control Problem First Approach : Sometimes for data scientist it becomes very important to understand what are the burning business problem. A data scientist should always be encouraged to solve business problems which brings value to the business. You may take ideas from this blog : https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/discover/business-problem-to-ai-data-science-solution/ CheckPoints & Discussion : Given the nature of business problems it is very difficult for data scientist to come up with right solution. Ensure that data science team and stakeholders have continuous checkpoints to ensure that everything is in right direction otherwise it can sometime lead to solutions which business was not expecting Help Them Improve Skill : Good data scientist thrive on learning. A good organisation should provide enough opportunities to learn and grow their skills. This will help them to stay happy and grow with you. To Avoid: Expecting Unicorn Data Scientist : Some companies expect data scientist to do data engineering, model development and prodcutionalize the model.

The agile approach has been popularized by the success of agile software development and it relies on short-term deliverables aka sprints that allow teams to show progress frequently and adapt quickly. However, when we need to do research or explore data for unknown insights, the agile methodology does not work because we cannot predefine nor schedule these activities with certainty.
