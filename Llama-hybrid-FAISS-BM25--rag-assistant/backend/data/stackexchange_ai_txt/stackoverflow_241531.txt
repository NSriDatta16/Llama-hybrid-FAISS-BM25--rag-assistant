For Perl, you have the File::pushd module from CPAN which makes locally changing the working directory quite elegant. Quoting the synopsis: use File::pushd; chdir $ENV{HOME}; # change directory again for a limited scope { my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' ); # working directory changed to /tmp } # working directory has reverted to $ENV{HOME} # tempd() is equivalent to pushd( File::Temp::tempdir ) { my $dir = tempd(); } # object stringifies naturally as an absolute path { my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' ); my $filename = File::Spec->catfile( $dir, "somefile.txt" ); # gives /tmp/somefile.txt }
