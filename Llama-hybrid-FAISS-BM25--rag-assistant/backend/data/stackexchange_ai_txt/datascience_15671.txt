How are per-layer-detected-patterns in a trained CNN plotted?

In the case my question is not clear, I am talking about the patterns that are detected in each of the layers of an image-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Take the following image as an example (by Honglak Lee). I think I understand the concept: different layers start coding for different features with increasing complexity. The first layers code for edges, the middle layers code for simple features (e.g. nose, eyes), and the later layers code for whole faces. However, I do not see the equivalence betweence each of the patterns in the picture and the network elements. Do each pattern inside a pattern-class correspond to one neuron of that layer? How are these cool pattern detection pictures even plotted?
