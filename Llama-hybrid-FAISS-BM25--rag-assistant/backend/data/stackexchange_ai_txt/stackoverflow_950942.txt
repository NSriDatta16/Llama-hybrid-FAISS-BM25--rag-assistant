Barrier-Free Drag&Drop Pattern

In days of ajaxish Web2.0 I wonder whether it is possible to create 100% barrier-free web pages or if there are even patterns to support common Web2.0-practices. What came to my mind is drag&drop. Is there an all-round solution for this or does it depend highly on the way the technique is used? Thanks!
