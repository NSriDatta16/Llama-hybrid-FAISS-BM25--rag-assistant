what after the basic c++?

i studied basics of c++ in college, we used the book object oriented programming in c++ by robert lafore. i studied till pointers (almost half the book) and i still feel outdated using the console and not doing something other than that (forgive me for my ignorance) i want to do windows simple apps and knowing how to employ the little i learned. the problem is when i open a win32 project in Visual studio for example it opens a lot of stuffs and many .cpp's and .h's . is there a way to comprehend that and walking on the right path? the code is complicated to me and mind teasing is it suppose to be like this ?intended to be like this for beginners ? is there a reliable tutorial to introduce me to that or do i need to learn the advanced concepts of c++ like templates and virtual functions and file i\o or they are not necessery ? thank you.
