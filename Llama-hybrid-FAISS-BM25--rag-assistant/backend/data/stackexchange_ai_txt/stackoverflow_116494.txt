Python regular expression to split paragraphs

How would one write a regular expression to use in Python to split paragraphs? A paragraph is defined by two line breaks (\n). But one can have any amount of spaces/tabs together with the line breaks, and it still should be considered as a paragraph. I am using Python, so the solution can use Python's regular expression syntax which is extended. (can make use of (?P...) stuff) Examples: the_str = 'paragraph1\n\nparagraph2' # Splitting should yield ['paragraph1', 'paragraph2'] the_str = 'p1\n\t\np2\t\n\tstill p2\t \n \n\tp3' # Should yield ['p1', 'p2\t\n\tstill p2', 'p3'] the_str = 'p1\n\n\n\tp2' # Should yield ['p1', '\n\tp2'] The best I could come with is: r'[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*' , i.e. import re paragraphs = re.split(r'[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*\n[ \t\r\f\v]*', the_str) But that is ugly. Is there anything better? Suggestions rejected: r'\s*?\n\s*?\n\s*?' -> That would make example 2 and 3 fail, since \s includes \n , so it would allow paragraph breaks with more than 2 \n s.
