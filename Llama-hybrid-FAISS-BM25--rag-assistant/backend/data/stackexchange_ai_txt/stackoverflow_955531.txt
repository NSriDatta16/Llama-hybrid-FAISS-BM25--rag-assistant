To be honest, deleting a million rows from a table scales just as badly as inserting or updating a million rows. It's the size of the rowset that's the problem, and there's not much you can do about that. My suggestions: Make sure that the table has a primary key and clustered index (this is vital for all operations). Make sure that the clustered index is such that minimal page re-organisation would occur if a large block of rows were to be deleted. Make sure that your selection criteria are SARGable. Make sure that all your foreign key constraints are currently trusted.
