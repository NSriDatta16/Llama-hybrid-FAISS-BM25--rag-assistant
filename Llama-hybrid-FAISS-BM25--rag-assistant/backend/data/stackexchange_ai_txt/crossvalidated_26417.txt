Computation of composite score or summed score from Likert scale

I am proposing a survey for my research proposal in speech therapy. There is a set of guidelines that speech therapists are supposed to follow, so that all questions are conceptually related - so that I can used a composite score if I understood that right. My research question is Are speech therapists influenced by personal attributes in their choice of assessment? Hence I want to do a correlation between if somebody is bilingual and is then more likely to follow the guidelines (using the composite score/summary score). I hope somebody can help. Please indicate how often you use the following assessment procedure. 1 Never 2 Occasionally 3 Sometimes 4 Usually 5 Always I assess all languages of the patient. 1 2 3 4 5 I use a language usage profile 1 2 3 4 5 I use the following individuals as interpreters during assessment: ... family and friends of the patient 1 2 3 4 5 ... bilingual coworkers 1 2 3 4 5 ... professional interpreters 1 2 3 4 5 It is encouraged to use either bilingual coworkers or professional interpreters (no difference in preference) but family and friends should not be used hence I would not be able to use family and friends as a positive score (never would be good so score high) and I thought I could just average the score of the three items as I don't want the professional usage be weighted higher in the composite score than using the language profile and assessing all languages. I was wondering if I would simply add up all the scores like this: (for example somebody answered like this) assess all languages (4) use language usage profile (4) use appropriate individuals (4) (e.g., never use family and friends (5 as positive) + frequently use bilingual coworkers (2) + frequently use professional interpreters (5) = 4) Which then as the composite score would be 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 out of a possible 15. Then I was going to use Spearman's correlation as the question on bilingualism leads to a dichotomous variable and the composite score would be interval/ratio data?
