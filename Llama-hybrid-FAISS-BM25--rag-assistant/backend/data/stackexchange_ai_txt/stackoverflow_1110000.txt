Editing markup of an ASP.NET control then saving on PostBack

I am using jquery to append or remove a (rendered as ) from the (rendered as ). The problem arises when I try to save on PostBack. The correct information is saved to the database. However, when the page is loaded on PostBack instead of the new data from the database being loaded, the old data from the initial is still there. When I set Response.Expires = 0 and refresh the page that is loaded after PostBack everything is where it needs to be. I have tried: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Cache.Remove("Add_Product.aspx"); Also to bypass the problems with EventValidation I am setting EnableEventValidation="false". So my question is how should I approach this problem? Is there an quick and easy way to force PostBack to load the fresh page? I would rather not have to redirect to the same page after the PostBack.
