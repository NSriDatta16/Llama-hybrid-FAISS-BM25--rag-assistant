Are there models that can make prediction based on fixed value of a variable?

So I am making a time series analysis and even though packages like Prophet are good at it, I want to know how a certain value can change the prediction. For instance, I want to know how high the sales will be if I set the value of discount variable to 0.2 in my future data frame for the next month, but it seems like Prophet isn't good in that. Are there any recommendations which model would be the best to do this? I am writing my code in R
