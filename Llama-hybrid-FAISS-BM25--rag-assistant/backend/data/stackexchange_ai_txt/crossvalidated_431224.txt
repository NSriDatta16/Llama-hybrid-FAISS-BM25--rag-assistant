Hypothesis testing with regression models

I have two regression models: a linear model with one variable, and a neural network with many. I want to test whether the neural network is better than the linear model. I am wondering the best way to do this. I think I could do leave-one-out cross validation with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test by comparing the out-of-bag errors from each model. Would this work? Is there any literature to support this approach?
