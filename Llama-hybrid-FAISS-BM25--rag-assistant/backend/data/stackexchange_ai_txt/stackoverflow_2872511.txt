Seems to me like you want a morphology-engine for polish. In very short they can do both analysis and generation from surface-form (what we read and write) to some abstract form, like "Dorothy + FEM + DAT", taking both declensions and phonology into account. Take a look here (im not polish but it looks good, and most imporantly it has downloads :) ) http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl/~wolinski/morfeusz/ Here are some introductory on the subject.
