Getting and terminating class's/threads in C#

okay, so here is what im doing: class Connection { public int SERVERID; private Thread connection; public Connection() { connection = new Thread(new ThreadStart(this.Run)); } public void Start(int serverid) { SERVERID = serverid; connection.Start(); } void Run() { while(true) { //do stuff here } } } now, there is the class i need to manage, here is how im calling it: static void Main(string[] args) { StartConnection(1); StartConnection(2); StartConnection(3); //etc } static void StartCOnnection(int serverid) { Connection connect = new Connection(); connect.Start(serverid); } i was origanally trying to do somthing like this: foreach(Connection connect in Connection) { if(connect.SERVERID == 2) { //destroy the thread, and class. } } but that gets the error " 'Connection' is a 'type' but is used like a 'variable' ", and i dont know how to do that destroy the thread and class part... Summary: So what i basically need to do, is get a list of all the open Connetion class's, and be able to, based on the settings of the class be able to destroy it. how do i do this? ~code examples please
