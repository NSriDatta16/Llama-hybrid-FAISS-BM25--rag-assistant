What screen resolution should my web app target for an average non-technical users?

I noticed StackOverflow appears to be targeting screen resolution widths of 1024px or more. I also checked Amazon, NBC, MSN, & AOL which target more lay users, and they all appear to be targeting the same width. Is 1024px the current recommended width for web apps targeting the largest cross-section of users who use default monitor resolution/browser size?
