According to the Using Flex 4 reference: To use a container as a drop target, you must use the backgroundColor property of the container to set a color. Otherwise, the background color of the container is transparent, and the Drag and Drop Manager is unable to detect that the mouse pointer is on a possible drop target. In the subsequent example, they use an mx container ( Canvas ), but I checked the AS3 reference, and spark.components.SkinnableContainer does have a style backgroundColor . I haven't tried this myself, so please confirm whether it is the issue. From your description that only certain parts of the container are registering the dragEnter event, this seems like a consideration that would lead to such effects.
