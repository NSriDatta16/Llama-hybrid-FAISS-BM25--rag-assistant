How to estimate Rails app development cost?

I have an application I would like built. For the most part, I know what I want. And, I have good sketches of how it should work and look. I would like to understand how to estimate the cost to implement an application. I would like to do this prior to approaching developers so that I can make sure I can afford to fund the development myself and not waste anyone's time. I can imagine that this is not an easy question to answer, and perhaps one that can't be answered here at all. However, I'm hoping there are some ballpark figures and methods to approximate cost. Also, If anyone has any suggested steps to going from idea to implementation, I'd love to hear them. Thanks! Clarification: I'm not looking for an answer with a dollar amount. I'm looking for guidance on how to come up with a (very rough) figure. Ultimately, I'll be using this figure to determine whether or not I can comfortably fund development personally. Again, this question may be flawed, but I can't help but think that someone might have a savvy answer. Perhaps a figure of cost/time based on a project of their own or good advice otherwise. Just don't tell me it'll cost a million, because Robert already has. :)
