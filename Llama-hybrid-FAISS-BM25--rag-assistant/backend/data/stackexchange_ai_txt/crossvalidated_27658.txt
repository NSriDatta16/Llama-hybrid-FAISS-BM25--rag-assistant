I wouldn't call the response a random component. It is a combination of a deterministic and a random component. I think I would describe generalized linear models this way. We have a response variable and a set of related variables that can aid in predicting the response. However the response and the predictors are not linearly related. The link function provides a transformation of the response so that the transformed response is linearly related to the predictors. For example in logistic regression the predictor could be continuous variables that can take on values over the entire real line. But the response is a probability (the probability of a successful outcome in a clinical trial for example). So the response is constrained to fall between 0 and 1. The link function in logistic regression is called the logit function. It equals $\log(p/(1-p))$. You can see that the logit function transforms a variable constrained to $[0,1]$ to a variable that can take values over the entire real line. In this case the link function makes the response compatible with the predictor variables and hence it is possible to make it a linear function of the predictors plus a random component.
