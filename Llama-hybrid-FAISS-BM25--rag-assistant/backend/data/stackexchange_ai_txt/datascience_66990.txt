Modelling data with Machine learning without a target variable

I want to understand the required steps that need to be taken into account while handling a dataset that does not have a target variable . I can do machine learning on top of a labeled dataset having a target variable, but not sure what would be the best way to start with a dataset where is there is no target variable. I need a step by step guide to achieve an efficient clustering at the end. Do I need to do the following in order to achieve that?: Data Cleansing EDA Encoding and scaling Model build Validation Or are there any more steps that I need to take care of while dealing with an unsupervised class of data. I am doing this in python
