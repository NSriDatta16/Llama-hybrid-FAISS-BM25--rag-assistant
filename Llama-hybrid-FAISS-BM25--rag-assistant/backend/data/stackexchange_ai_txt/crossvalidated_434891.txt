Here are a dozen normal probability plots in R, each for a sample of size 100 from a known standard normal population. Each plot is roughly linear, but most have a 'wobble' or two, especially toward the extremes. set.seed(116) par(mfrow=c(3,4)) for(i in 1:12) { z = rnorm(100); qqnorm(z, pch=20) } par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Repeat the code (without the set.seed statement) for more examples. Examples of normal probability plots in textbooks seem, on average, to be better behaved than the plots one typically sees in practice -- even when normality assumptions are very nearly true. Addendum: Six additional plots with reference lines as suggested in Comment by @Henry. set.seed(117) par(mfrow=c(2,3)) for(i in 1:6) { z = rnorm(100) qqnorm(z); qqline(z, col=2) } par(mfrow=c(1,1))
