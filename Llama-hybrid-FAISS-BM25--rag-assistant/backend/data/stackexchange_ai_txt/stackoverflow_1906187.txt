I used to run CC.NET on my domain account; I got a similar behaviour when I had to reset my password. The only way I was able to do this without locking my account was to log on to build server, change my password, change password service uses and then reboot the server. It seems that CC.NET spawns some other processes upon startup that do not refresh the password until reboot. If I didn't reboot it takes about 2 minutes for my active directory account. So yes ... I have had a similar problem. Solution, like DilbertDave says try using a dedicated account. Kindness, Dan
