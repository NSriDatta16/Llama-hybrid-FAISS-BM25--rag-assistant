Reporting guideline for bayesian using pd and ROPE

In the bayestestR articles , I came across the reporting guidelines that they recommend “the effect of X has a probability of pd of being negative (Median = median , 89% CI [ HDI_low , HDI_high ] and can be considered as significant ( ROPE % in ROPE).” Is this applicable for Bayesian logistic regression? Since in logistic regression, we are more interested in the odds ratio. For instance: If we are looking at whether vintage transplant ( =5 years) has an association with being vaccine-acceptance. Based on my results, “the effect of transplant vintage of >=5 years has a probability of 96.47% of being positive (Median = 2.26, 89% CI [0.25, 4.52] and can be considered as significant (2.45% in ROPE).” How do I write it in terms of OR? "Patients with transplant vintage of >=5 years have 9.58 times (pd = 96.47%, 2.45% in ROPE) higher odds as compared to those with
