There's a wide range of APM tools and they all work differently and are capable of collecting different statistics. Here are some examples of how different tools work and why they might be more or less useful depending on what you're trying to monitor: Server-based agents. Allows collection of stats like CPU and memory load. See Splunk or Cacti. Web end-user monitors often work by including some JavaScript on the pages you serve up. I'm sure you can imagine there's plenty of statistics that can be gathered only from the within the end-user's browser. Code-level augmentation/reporting/analysis. For example, with .NET there's some tools for this from AVIcode. Network traffic analysis. Product quality varies by how much traffic it can handle and how many protocols are understood. There's a company called ExtraHop that has a product in this category. I believe that their technology powers http://www.networktimeout.com where you can upload a packet dump for analysis.
