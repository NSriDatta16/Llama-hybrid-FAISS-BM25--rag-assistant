I strongly, strongly recommend MigLayout (And getting away from GUI layout tools). Any time you think you are saving by using a GUI tool quickly evaporates the second you run into layout manager behavior. Real UI's are coded, not built with drag and drop. I found that it took me about 3 hours of fiddling to get used to MigLayout - after that break in period, I found it to be incredibly intuitive and powerful.
