Relationship between logistic regression and hyperplane

I have always been a bit confused about logistic regression modeling. If I speak to a statistician, they refer to the modeling efforts in terms of the logit link function. However, if I speak with a machine learning expert, they refer to logistic regression as simply implementing a hyperplane (similar to SVM). What is the relationship between the logistic function and the separating hyperplane?
