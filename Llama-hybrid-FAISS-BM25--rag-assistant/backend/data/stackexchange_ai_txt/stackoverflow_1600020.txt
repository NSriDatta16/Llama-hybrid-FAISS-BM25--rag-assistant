How can I dump & load MS-SQL preserving identity columns?

I'd like to be able to dump & load a MS-SQL database so I can recreate the storage locations, the original database was poorly configured with 1 storage location and I'd like to correct this issue. My current attemtps at doing this have resulted in the identity columns being regenerated upon a load, this was while using the `Tasks > Import' facility that comes with "SQL Management Studio". Restoring from a backup keeps recreating the original storage locations. I'm new to MS-SQL so please forgive me if this is a basic topic, but I haven't been able to find a solution anywhere. I'm currently more familiar with Progress OpenEdge RDBMS.
