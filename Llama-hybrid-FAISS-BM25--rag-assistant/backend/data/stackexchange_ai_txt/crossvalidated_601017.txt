For a Poisson distribution $f_\theta(y)=\frac{e^{_\theta}\theta^y}{y!},y\in\mathbb{N}_0$ , an M-estimator is given by $$ \sum_{i=1}^n\psi(y_i, \hat{\theta})=0, $$ where $$ \psi_{k,a}(y_i,\theta)=\frac{y_i-\theta-a\sqrt{\theta}}{\sqrt{\theta}} \min\left[1,\frac{k\sqrt{\theta}}{y_i-\theta-a\sqrt{\theta}}\right]. $$ This estimator is equivalent to the one based on Huber loss in case of estimation of location for a Normal distribution. Parameter $a$ is necessary to correct for bias (the problem nicely discussed by @AdamO), and satisfies $$ E\psi_{k,a}(Y,\theta)=0 $$ In practice, the $a$ is calculated using the sample average and the current estimate of $\theta$ , in the course of iteratively reweighted least squares procedure (IRWLS), commonly used for M-estimators. This estimator is implemented in the R packages cited in the OP. The particular form of the estimator is due to Cadigan and Chen, Properties of robust m-estimators for Poisson and negative binomial data . A clear presentation, accessible to non-statisticians, can be found in thesis Robust modelling of count data by Elsaied , which also proposes a similar generalization of Tukey's M-estimator.
