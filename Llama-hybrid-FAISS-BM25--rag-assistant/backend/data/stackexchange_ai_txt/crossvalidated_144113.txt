I started by typing a comment but it became too lengthy... Keep in mind that they are CS student. You won't please them the way you please mathematicians (with $\sigma$ algebras) or biologist, physicians (with biological or medical data, and classical recipes for testing good old null hypotheses). If you have enough freedom to decide the orientation of the lecture, if the point is that they learn basic concepts, my advice is to make a radical change of orientation. Of course, if other teachers want them to be able to perform some predefined tasks, you are a bit stuck. So, in my opinion, they will like it if you present inference from a "learning" point of view, and if you present tests from a "decision theory" or "classification" point of view -- in short, they're supposed to like algorithms. To grok algorithms! Also, try to find CS related datasets ; e.g. the duration of connections and the number of request per unit of time to an html server can help to illustrate many concepts. They will love to learn simulation techniques. Lehmer generators are easy to implement. Show them how to simulate other distributions by inverting the cdf. If you're into this, show them Marsaglia's Ziggurat algorithm. Oh, and the MWC256 generator by Marsaglia is a little gem. The Diehard tests by Marsaglia (tests for fairness of uniform generators) can help to illustrate many concepts of probability and statistics. You can even chose to present probability theory based on "(independent) streams of random doubles, oups, I mean reals" -- this is a bit cheeky, but it can be grand. Also, remember that page rank is based on a Markov chain. This is not easy matter but following the presentation from Arthur Engel (I think the reference is the probabilistic abacus -- if you read French, this book is absolutely a must read ), you can easily present a few toy examples that they'll like. I think that CS science student will like Discrete Markov chains much more than $t$-tests, even if it seems more difficult material (Engel's presentation makes it very easy). If you master your subject enough, don't hesitate to be original. "Classical" lectures are ok when you teach something you are not fully familiar with. Good luck, and if you release some lecture notes please let me know!
