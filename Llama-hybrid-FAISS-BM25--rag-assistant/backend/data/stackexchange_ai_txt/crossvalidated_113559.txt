To answer your questions: 1) Is MDP the most general type of stochastic decision process? No, there also exist various kinds of non-markovian processes. Semi-Markov Decision Processes are also popular to model stochastic control problems where the time spent in each state is not constant but itself a continuous random variable 2) Can the MDP be solved by dynamic programming with other "metrics" than MEU? Well, the maximisation of expected utility does not by itself constitute a particular metric, as there are many ways of definining the utility w.r.t. the reward function. For instance, you may or may not used a discount factor, you may use a finite or infinite horizon, etc. All these variants can be solved by dynamic programming. If you define "metrics" outside this family of functions, of course it may be necessary to use other types of solution methods than dynamic programming.
