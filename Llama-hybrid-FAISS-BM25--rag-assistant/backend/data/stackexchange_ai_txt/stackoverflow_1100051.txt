Like everything Magento, there's a numerous reasons this could be happening. First, I'd avoid using a capital letter "V" when naming your blocks. Although I don't think this would cause a problem (as names are references to URIs (core/textlist, etc.) and template filepath (/path/to/template.phtml)), there's a de-facto naming convention in the layout system of lowercase/underscore names which someone, somewhere (i.e Varien) may decide is an enforced convention. Second, have you called $this->loadLayout(); in your controller action before the line where you attempt to set the form action? Until you do this your Layout object won't have instantiated and/or have a reference to your block objects, which means $this->getLayout()->getBlock('...') will always return false. Other debugging tips. Try the following to make sure you're getting back the classes you think you should. die(get_class($this->getLayout()->getBlock('root'))); die(get_class($this->getLayout())); Finally, if all that fails, go to the source of the layout object app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Layout.php And take a look at the getBlock method public function getBlock($name) { if (isset($this->_blocks[$name])) { return $this->_blocks[$name]; } else { return false; } } and start throwing in debug statements to see if you can figure out why the system isn't returning a reference to your block. Don't forget to remove/not-check-in your debugging statements as this is core system code.
