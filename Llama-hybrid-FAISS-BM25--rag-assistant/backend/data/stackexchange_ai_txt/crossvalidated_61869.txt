How to interpret the model fit indices generated by lavaan (in R)? Something wrong with the model specifications?

I am trying to replicate a path analysis SEM model using Lavaan in R, and was very confused about the results that it gave regarding the model fit statistics. The code is as follows: #Import Package library(lavaan) #Input Correlation Matrix sigma And the output I get is as follows: lavaan (0.5-12) converged normally after 93 iterations Number of observations 37300 Estimator ML Minimum Function Test Statistic 0.000 Degrees of freedom 0 P-value (Chi-square) 1.000 Model test baseline model: Minimum Function Test Statistic 16594.387 Degrees of freedom 10 P-value 0.000 Full model versus baseline model: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 1.000 Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) 1.000 Loglikelihood and Information Criteria: Loglikelihood user model (H0) -882379.005 Loglikelihood unrestricted model (H1) -882379.005 Number of free parameters 15 Akaike (AIC) 1764788.009 Bayesian (BIC) 1764915.910 Sample-size adjusted Bayesian (BIC) 1764868.240 Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: RMSEA 0.000 90 Percent Confidence Interval 0.000 0.000 P-value RMSEA |z|) Regressions: Illness ~ Exercise 0.318 0.048 6.640 0.000 Fitness -8.835 0.174 -50.737 0.000 Hardiness -12.146 0.793 -15.321 0.000 Stress 27.125 0.451 60.079 0.000 Fitness ~ Exercise 0.109 0.001 82.602 0.000 Hardiness 0.396 0.023 17.211 0.000 Stress ~ Exercise -0.001 0.001 -2.614 0.009 Hardiness -0.393 0.009 -44.332 0.000 Fitness -0.040 0.002 -19.953 0.000 Covariances: Exercise ~~ Hardiness -7.581 1.309 -5.791 0.000 Variances: Exercise 4422.131 32.381 Hardiness 14.440 0.106 Illness 318744.406 2334.012 Fitness 284.796 2.085 Stress 41.921 0.307 These are my questions: Why does the chi-squared say that there are no degrees of freedom? Why are the p-values exactly 1? Why is the CFI and TLI exactly 1? Why is the RMSEA 0? What would I need to do to simulate a more realistic model that doesn't appear artificially "perfect"? Does it have to do with the model specification?
