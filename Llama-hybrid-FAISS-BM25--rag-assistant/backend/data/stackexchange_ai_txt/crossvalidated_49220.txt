Estimation of 'counts analysis' of Max-Diff data in both R and SPSS is straightforward (after recoding it is just computed as an average). This page explains the how to do such analyses. More complicated analyses proceed by either using a 'tricked' logit model (e.g., Sawtooth Software ), or, use the rank-ordered logit model (see Allison, P. D. and N. A. Christakis (1994). "Logit Models for Sets of Ranked Items." Sociological Methodology 24: 199-228), which is available in SAS (using PHREG with the EXACT option for ties) or in Q using a 'Question Type' of Ranking. This page shows a case study which shows how to compute the counts, rank-ordered logit with ties and tricked logit models in R.
