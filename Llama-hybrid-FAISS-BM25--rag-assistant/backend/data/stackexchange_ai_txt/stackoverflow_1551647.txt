I don't think the LDAP directory would be the best place to store this, really. If it's web application preferences, you should store them with and in the web applications - in a shared fashion. The LDAP directory is concerned with your user accounts, permissions, your organization's structure - I would not recommend putting application-specific settings inside the LDAP directory. Marc
