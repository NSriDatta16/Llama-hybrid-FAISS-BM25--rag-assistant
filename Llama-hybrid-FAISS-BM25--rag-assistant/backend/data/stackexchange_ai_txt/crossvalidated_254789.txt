Summary This diagram displays the key idea. Assume all $n+1$ variables are independent, have the same distribution, and have no chance of coinciding. Then $X$ will be to the left of $X_{r:n}$ a proportion $r/(n+1)$ of the time. The Problem For (a) to be correct, $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ , and $X$ must be independent continuous random variables with the same distribution $F$ . We are asked to demonstrate this mysterious-looking equation: $$\mathbb{E}\left(\Pr(X \le X_{r:n})\right) = \frac{r}{n+1}\tag{1}$$ and then, using this result, we may conclude that $X_{r:n}$ ought approximately equal $F^{-1}(r/(n+1))$ . It is this intended conclusion that helps us resolve the inherent ambiguity in $(1)$ : after all, to what variable(s) does the expectation $\mathbb{E}$ apply and to what variables(s) does the probability $\Pr$ apply? To find out, we should try to understand $(1)$ in terms of $F$ . Interpreting the Question Recall the definition of the distribution function $F$ : for any real number $x$ , $$F(x) = \Pr(X \le x).\tag{2}$$ No ambiguity there: $X$ is the random variable. Comparing this to $(1)$ suggests we should (temporarily) view $X_{r:n}$ as just a number, because $X_{r:n}$ evidently plays the role of $x$ in $(2)$ . Thus the probability is taken over $X$ , whereas the expectation applies to $X_{r:n}$ . Analysis The difficulty with mixing up expectations and probabilities in $(1)$ is primarily technical, not conceptual, so let's take care of the technical issue right now. The probability of an event $\Pr(X \le x)$ can always be rewritten as the expectation of the indicator variable $$\mathcal{I}(X\le x) = \cases{\eqalign{1, &\ & X\le x \\ 0, &\ &\text{otherwise.}}}$$ This allows us to rewrite $(1)$ solely in terms of expectations as $$\mathbb{E}\left(\Pr(X \le X_{r:n})\right) = \mathbb{E}_{X_{r:n}}\left(\mathbb{E}_X(\mathcal{I}(X \le X_{r:n})\right).$$ To be clear, the subscripts indicate which variables the expectations are being taken over. However, as you well know (and is intuitively obvious), it doesn't matter, because this is a total expectation: $$\mathbb{E}_{X_{r:n}}\left(\mathbb{E}_X(\mathcal{I}(X \le X_{r:n}))\right) = \mathbb{E}_{(X_{r:n}, X)}(\mathcal{I}(X \le X_{r:n}))\tag{3}.$$ We may reverse the process that took us from a probability to an indicator: this expectation $(3)$ is merely the probability $$\mathbb{E}_{(X_{r:n}, X)}(\mathcal{I}(X \le X_{r:n})) = \Pr(X \le X_{r:n}) .$$ This probability is taken over the full $n+1$ -variate distribution of the variables $(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n, X)$ . (There are other ways to analyze the problem, but this method avoids any use of conditional probabilities, which can be tricky.) Solution It rests on this simple, elegant observation: $X \le X_{r:n}$ means $X$ is among the $r$ least values when all $n+1$ variables are lined up. $\tag{4}$ That is because, by definition, at least $r-1$ of the $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are less than $X_{r:n}$ but there is zero chance that $X_{(r-1):n}$ equals $X_{r:n}$ . (This is one reason we must assume $F$ is continuous.) Because all $n+1$ variables have the same distribution, are independent, and have zero chance of being tied, any one of these variables--including $X$ itself--has equal chances of appearing in any one of the $n+1$ positions when all $n+1$ are lined up from smallest to largest. Given $n+1$ equally likely possibilities, of which $r$ correspond to the event in question (according to $(4)$ ), we may immediately conclude $$\Pr(X \le X_{r:n}) = \frac{r}{n+1}.$$
