Invision Power Board: Add message at top of board index

And here I am, wasting my time trying to achieve things that would take two minutes with any other forum software. IPB's template system is insane . Anyway: I just want to add a simple block of HTML, specifically a paragraph of text, on top of my board's index page, before the forums list. Could someone be so kind to point me in the right direction? i.e., what's the template I have to edit? Thanks a lot, any hint would be appreciated.
