MySql, InnoDB & Null Values

Formerly I was using MyISAM storage engine for MySql and I had defined the combination of three fields to be unique. Now I have switched to InnoDB, which I assume caused this problem, and now NULL != NULL. So for the following table: ID (Auto) | Field_A | Field_B | Field_C I can insert (Field_A,Field_B,Field_C) Values(1,2,NULL) (1,2,NULL) (1,2,NULL) infinitely many times. How can I prevent this behavior?
