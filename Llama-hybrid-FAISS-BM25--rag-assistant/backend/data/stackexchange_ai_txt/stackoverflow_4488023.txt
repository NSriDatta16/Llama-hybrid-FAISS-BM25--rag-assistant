How to maintain web-politeness (avoid being banned) during web-crawl?

A web-bot crawling your site and using bandwdith resources. Bots are numerous and for many purposes, starting from homemade, university research, scrappers, new startups to established search engines (and many more categories probably) Apart from large search engines which can potentially send traffic to a site, why webmasters allow other bots whose purpose they do not know immediately ? What are the incentives for webmasters to allow these bots ? 2nd question is: Should a distributed crawler with multiple crawlagent-nodes on internet, use different User-Agent string for each agent, because if they all use same UA, then benefit of scaling via multiple agents is highly reduced. Because large websites with high crawl-delay set, may take weeks or months to crawl fully. 3rd question: Since robots.txt (the only defined crawl control method) is at domain level. Should crawler have politeness policy per domain or per IP (sometimes many websites hosted on same IP) . How to tackle such web poilteness problems ? Any other related things to keep in mind ?
