Proposal in MCMC lives in bigger space than parameter space. Which transformations should I choose?

I'm using a MCMC algorithm. The proposal is, due to lack of information on my part, a multivariate T-Student distribution, i.e. $\theta \sim \mathcal{MT}(\mu, \Sigma)$ . However, some of the components of $\theta$ are restricted to a specific interval. To make sure that most of the draws from the proposal do not get rejected due to a acceptance probability equal to 0, I'm thinking of using some transformations. For example, for the components which take values in $]0,1[$ , I'm thinking of using a logit transformation. For $]0,+\infty[$ a $\log$ transformation. For $]-1,1[$ , I will translate to $]-\pi/2,\pi/2[$ and apply $\tan$ . What other transformations maybe used? Is this a good policy? What precautions should I take to choose good transformations?
