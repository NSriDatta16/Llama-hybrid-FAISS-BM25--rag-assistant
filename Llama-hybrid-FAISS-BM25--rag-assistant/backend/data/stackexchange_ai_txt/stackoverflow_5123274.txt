How to enhance ItemSelector scrolling performance?

I'm using an ItemSelector with two lists like the second one from this demo: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/multiselect/multiselect-demo.html I have around 600 items in my first list and the performance when I drag the scrollbars is unacceptable in Firefox 3.x. For some reason, IE7 is not a problem. Are there any optimizations than can be done so scrolling will be faster? [Update] Seems like the problem occurs when the widget is placed in a xtype: 'fieldset' The problem goes away once the widget is moved out of the fieldset.
