I would go with the notation in Hamilton: { $X_t$ } for the infinite sequence of random variables /the process { $x_t$ } for a realization of the process (also infinite )/these are values / scalars ( $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$ ) for the finite observed time series/our data (a subset of a realization) $x_t$ for the particular realized value at time t Uppercase letters used for random variables; lowercase letters used for realized values of random variables; {} used for infinite sequences; () used for finite sequences.
