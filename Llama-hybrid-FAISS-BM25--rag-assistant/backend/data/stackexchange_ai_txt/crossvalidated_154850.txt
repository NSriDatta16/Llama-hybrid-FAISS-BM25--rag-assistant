As A. Karpathy illustrates, there are many types of RNNs. The model described in the paper belongs to the fourth one. Picture from A. Karpathy ( http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ ) The target delay (aka time delay) is an arbitrarily chosen number that introduces a delay between the inputs and the targets, thereby giving the network a few timesteps of future context, and it can be crucial as it makes robust to short distortions, especially when it is used with LSTM cells. In other words, as you well said, it is the number of frames that you will input to the RNN, until you start getting predictions from the output.
