Correct setup for a Bayesian gamma model

I am interested in understanding how center volume affects a quality metric in a healthcare application . Each program's performance is reported as an observed/expected (O/E) ratio where the expected count of outcomes is estimated from a multivariable model. The O/E ratio is calculated by (O+2)/(E+2). The distribution of this ratio is calculated using a Bayesian method where the prior is a gamma distribution with shape=2 and rate=2 (mean=1, variance 0.5), and the posterior distribution is a gamma distribution with shape = 2 + observed count and rate = 2 + expected count. Does this suggest that for a center with 50 observed events and 40 expected events that: HR = (2+50)/(2+40) HRprior = gamma(2,2) HRposterior = gamma(52, 42) If not, please correct me. Some R code for thinking with: # Ratios hr
