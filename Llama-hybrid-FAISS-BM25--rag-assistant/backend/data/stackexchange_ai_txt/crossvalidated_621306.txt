Overestimation of low values, and an underestimation of high values: Random forest

I performed a random forest model after transforming the predictor variable using the Box-Cox transformation, and found an R2 of 0.65. But the scatterplot between the actual and predicted values showed a systematic overestimation of low values, and an underestimation of high values (figure 1 below). In addition, I used the plotmo packages for residual analysis, which showed that the residuals are not random (figure 2 below). Any advice on how to solve this issue, please?
