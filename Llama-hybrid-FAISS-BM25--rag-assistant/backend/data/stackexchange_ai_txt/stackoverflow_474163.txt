Setting database and access control permissions

I am part of a team creating a web application using PHP and MySQL. The application will have multiple users with different roles. The application will also be used in a geographically distributed manner. Accordingly we need to create an access control system that controls user permissions for specific database records i.e. modifies database queries so that only specific records are displayed. For example, for a user at the city level, only those records should be displayed that relate to the user's particular city, while for a user at the national level, records for ALL CITIES in the country should be displayed. I need help on designing a system that can handle this type of information retrieval without hardcoding the information in the SQL queries. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance
