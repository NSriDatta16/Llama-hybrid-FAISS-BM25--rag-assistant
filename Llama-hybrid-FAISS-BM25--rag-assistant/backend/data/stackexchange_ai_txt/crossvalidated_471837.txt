Power analysis refers to calculating power of a hypothesis test The power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test rejects the null hypothesis ( $H_{0}$ ) when a specific alternative hypothesis ( $H_{1}$ ) is true In machine learning you make no hypothesis, are not interested in testing them, and don't have any hypothesis tests available. Since there's no hypothesis tests, there is no power analysis. You can make power analysis for the hypothesis tests related to logistic regression , because logistic regression is a statistical model that is also used in machine learning as a classifier. That is not the case for other machine learning models. Moreover, even if you were using logistic regression for making predictions, rather then inference, you would not do any power analysis. Finally, power analysis for logistic regression would not tell you how accurate the predictions would be. This is also not really a case in machine learning. In machine learning we do not care about "minimal sample size", as machine learning models are are usually used with large datasets. For small dataset, you would usually use simple algorithms like logistic regression, because with more complicated ones you risk overfitting. As about being "confident in the classification your ML model creates", this is judged by using things like cross validation . What machine learning models do, is they learn to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions given the familiar patterns. Whatever data you give them, they will always find some patterns and make some predictions. If the data is garbage, they will give you garbage predictions.
