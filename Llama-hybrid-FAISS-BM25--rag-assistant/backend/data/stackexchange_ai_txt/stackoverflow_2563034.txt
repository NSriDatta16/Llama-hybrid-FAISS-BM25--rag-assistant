Flash 10 - read file from a drag and drop action?

I'm looking at how to read a file in flash 10 here: http://www.thedesilva.com/2008/11/flash-10-file-reference/ is there a way to initiate the file read from a drag and drop? For example, the user drags and drops a text file onto my flash element in the browser - can I initiate the file read from that? Thanks
