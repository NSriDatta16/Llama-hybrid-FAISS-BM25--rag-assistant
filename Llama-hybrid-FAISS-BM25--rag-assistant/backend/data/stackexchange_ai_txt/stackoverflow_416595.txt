We use FinalBuilder and FinalBuilder server here. Lets you build complicated build processes using a relatively nice build interface and launch them from a web application or on a timer. Our "average" project will grab source from SVN, add the revision number to the version and build, grab the database scripts and upgrade or rebuild the database and deploy to either a webserver, ZIP it up for emailing or even create an ISO for it.
