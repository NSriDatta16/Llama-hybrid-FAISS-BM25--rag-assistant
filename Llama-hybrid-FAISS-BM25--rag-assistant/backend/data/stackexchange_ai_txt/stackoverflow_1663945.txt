Even if you hot deploy the WAR file (by not restarting the server) there will still be some downtime while the context reloads. This isn't a Grails thing as such, more of a J2EE/servlet thing. As dogbert said, best to put up a maintenance page (using Apache in front of Tomcat is a good idea) and shut down the app server, upload the new WAR then start the server up again.
