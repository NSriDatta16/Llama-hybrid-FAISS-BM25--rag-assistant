That's an interesting question. I don't agree with most people who say that ROC is always terrible for imbalanced data. It really depends on the use case and what you want to say with the ROC curve. I assume why some people regard ROC as a bad metric for imbalanced problems could be that it focuses mostly on the positive examples and kind of neglects giving the same attention to the other (negative) class. I.e., in ROC curves, you have TP/P and FP/N. With Precision-Recall curves, you also focus on the correctly predicted negative examples via recall TN/N (i.e,. the true negatives, TN, are what make the difference). In either case, I wouldn't say that PRE-REC are always to be preferred over ROC curves, it really depends on the context.
