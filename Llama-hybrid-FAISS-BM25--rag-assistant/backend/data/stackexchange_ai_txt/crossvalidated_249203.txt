Difference or similarity between a biology and genetic algorithm

What id the difference/similarity between a biological chromosome and a chromosome from a genetic algorithm? A biological chromosome represents a specific living organism who can be a result of an evolution, and can be a starting point of a new evolution. A chromosome in the genetic algorithm represents a specific solution. This solution can act as the starting input of the genetic algorithm and can participate in creating new solutions, or can be a result of an algorithmic evolution. What id the difference/similarity between a biological population and a population from a genetic algorithm? In biology, population means a collection of living organisms. Since, one chromosome represents one living organism, we can also say that a population is a collection of chromosomes. In genetic algorithm, population means a collection of chromosomes. I.e. a set of chromosomes == a collection of possible solutions. Am I correct?
