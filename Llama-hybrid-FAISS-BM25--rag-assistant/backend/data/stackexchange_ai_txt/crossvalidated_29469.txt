OLS vs. logistic regression for exploratory analysis with a binary outcome

In the idealized logistic model, we obtain an S-shaped curve linking each continuous IV to the DV. But in practice this S-shape infrequently occurs, making the logistic approach seem a little less superior for such types of data. Of course predicted probabilities that each observation will be "1" on the DV are usable in logistic and not in OLS regression, since in the latter these probabilities can exceed the bounds of [0,1]. But, for exploratory purposes, and if we don't need predicted probabilities, how sound is it to use OLS to see which IV have strong vs. moderate vs. weak relationships with the DV? Wouldn't this amount to a sort of multivariate version of point-biserial correlation? (Standardized regression coefficients, not to mention collinearity statistics and partial plots, are all I think more easily obtained in OLS than in logistic.)
