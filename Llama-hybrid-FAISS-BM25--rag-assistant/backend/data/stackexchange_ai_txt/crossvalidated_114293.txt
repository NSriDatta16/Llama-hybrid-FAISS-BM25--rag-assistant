Thanks to Fabian Scheipl, developer of package::spikeSlabGAM among other things, for pointing me toward mboost , which is more scalable than spikeSlabGAM , GMMBoost , and glmmLASSO , and includes all of the model specifications of these packages as subsets. It is more scalable because it does not use MCMC. So it is good for use cases when what you are looking for are point estimates, and you've got large-ish data.
