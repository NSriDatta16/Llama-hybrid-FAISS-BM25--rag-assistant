There is a bug report on this: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=318680 I tried the recommended workaround (included below), but could not find the build path page, nor the Libraries tab, referenced in the workaround. Instead, I right-clicked on the HelloWorldSWT package (in the Package Explorer window), selected Build Path -> Add External Libraries, and selected the jar file swt.jar. As the tutorial warns, there were compile errors, so I selected Source -> Organize Imports. The program now compiles and runs, but does not do anything. Inserting System.out.println() statements shows that it dies in creating the new Display(). I don't know if this helps [anyone], but I figured I'd share what I've tried so far. If anyone has any suggestions, they would be welcome. For reference, in case it matters, I'm running Eclipse Helios (3.6) on Mac OS X (64-bit). Here's the aforementioned workaround: Lakshmi Shanmugam 2010-07-02 11:16:01 EDT The step to import the SWT project from the zip is no longer valid. The cheatsheet needs to be updated. Please follow the below steps: 1) Extract the swt-3.6-win32-win32-x86.zip file 2) The extracted folder contains 2 jar files swt.jar and swt-debug.jar 3) On the Java build path page of your project, open the Libraries tab. And add the swt.jar as an external jar.
