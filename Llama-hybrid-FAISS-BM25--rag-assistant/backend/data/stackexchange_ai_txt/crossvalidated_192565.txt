Siena 3.0 is working just fine performing ERGM. It uses the same algorithm as the PNet. It is just Tom (the developer for Siena) is moving on to Siena 4.0 for longitudinal SNA. It does not mean Siena 3.0 is useless though. In fact, my favorite is still Siena 3.0 because it is simple and easy to use. My guess is that PNet is also very easy to handle, I just happen to pick Siena when I run ERGM first. Many people mentioned R and illustrated ERGM with R. I do not know much about R, although it seems it has deep learning curve.
