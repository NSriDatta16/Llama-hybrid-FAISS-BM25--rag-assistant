The absolute positioning is the reason the images are over the text (since nothing is giving the #slideshow any height), but your system needs the images to be absolutely positioned in order to stack them on top of each other for the slideshow effect. Since you are using jQuery anyway, you can programmatically expand the container to the height of the largest image. var maxHeight = 0; $("#slideshow img").each(function(){ if (maxHeight I'm sure someone can point out a more elegant way to write the maxHeight part of the script!
