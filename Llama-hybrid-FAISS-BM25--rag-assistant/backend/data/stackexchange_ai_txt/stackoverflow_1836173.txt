Entity Framework: "Store update, insert, or delete statement affected an unexpected number of rows (0)."

I am using Entity Framework to populate a grid control. Sometimes when I make updates I get the following error: Store update, insert, or delete statement affected an unexpected number of rows (0). Entities may have been modified or deleted since entities were loaded. Refresh ObjectStateManager entries. I can't figure out how to reproduce this. But it might have something to do with how close together I make the updates. Has anyone seen this or does anyone know what the error message refers to? Edit: Unfortunately I am no longer at liberty to reproduce the problem I was having here, because I stepped away from this project and don't remember if I eventually found a solution, if another developer fixed it, or if I worked around it. Therefore I cannot accept any answers.
