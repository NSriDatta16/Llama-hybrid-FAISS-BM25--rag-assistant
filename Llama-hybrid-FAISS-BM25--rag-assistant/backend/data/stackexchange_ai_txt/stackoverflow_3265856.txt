How to organise Webdriver tests

I want to create some Webdriver tests to test my Java web application but I'm not sure whether they should live inside another project or if they should live inside my web application project. I also want to run these Webdriver tests from my Hudson CI server upon every commit to my SVN repository - would this be a standard practice? I don't think it matters too much but I would like to know what other people do?
