Meta Regression- Average AGe

I want to conduct a meta-regression, using the variable. The studies in my meta-analysis include studies, that compore two indipendent groups. My question: to calculate average age of a study - is it enough to simply to add up the age of the two indipendent groups and divided it by two? Or are there any other, better ways to get the average age?
