Publishing my Website to my Local Disk Causes Exceptions to show Paths including my Local Disk

I've published my website many times. But didn't think about this though until I came across this issue. So I decided to publish my WAP project to a local folder on my C drive first. Then used FTP to upload it to my shared host on discountasp.net. I noticed during runtime that the stack trace was referencing that local folder still and erroring out. Anyone know what config settings are affected when publishing? Obviously something is still pointing to my local C drive and I've searched my entire solution and don't see why. Here's the runtime error I get when my code tries to run in discountasp.net's web server Cannot write into the public directory - check permissions Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. Exception Details: ScrewTurn.Wiki.PluginFramework.InvalidConfigurationException: Cannot write into the public directory - check permissions Source Error: An unhandled exception was generated during the execution of the current web request. Information regarding the origin and location of the exception can be identified using the exception stack trace below. Stack Trace: [InvalidConfigurationException: Cannot write into the public directory - check permissions] ScrewTurn.Wiki.SettingsStorageProvider.Init(IHostV30 host, String config) in C:\www\Wiki\Screwturn3_0_2_509\Core\SettingsStorageProvider.cs:90 ScrewTurn.Wiki.StartupTools.Startup() in C:\www\Wiki\Screwturn3_0_2_509\Core\StartupTools.cs:69 ScrewTurn.Wiki.Global.Application_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\www\Wiki\Screwturn3_0_2_509\WebApplication\Global.asax.cs:29 System.Web.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute() +68 System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously) +75 Discountasp says it's not a permission issue but obviously it is.
