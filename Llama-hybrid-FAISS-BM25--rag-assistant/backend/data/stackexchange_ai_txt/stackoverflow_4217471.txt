FCKeditor, removing stuff

I am using FCKEditor in a CMS and need to post some javascript code in the editor. This is stored in my database but it removes the + sign from this javascript code: function _check(val){ loadFragmentInToElement('captcha_check.php?val='+val,'captcha_div',''); } Now why would it remove the + sign? I've tried using &#43; and %2B but then it posts &#43; and %2B instead of a + sign. No, outside parties will not be able to access this to post stuff. Edit.... The form with the editor is submitted using a javascript function called submitform. The editor content is passed as an object called noofeditor. I see where it 'escapes' the code retrieved from the editor using this: if(noofeditor){ var editorArray=noofeditor.split('::'); for (l=0;l Is there a way to prevent it from escaping the + sign?
