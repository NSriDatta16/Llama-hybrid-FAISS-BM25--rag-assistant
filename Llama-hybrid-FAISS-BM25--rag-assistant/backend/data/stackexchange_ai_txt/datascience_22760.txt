Number and size of dense layers in a CNN

Most networks I've seen have one or two dense layers before the final softmax layer. Is there any principled way of choosing the number and size of the dense layers? Are two dense layers more representative than one, for the same number of parameters? Should dropout be applied before each dense layer, or just once?
