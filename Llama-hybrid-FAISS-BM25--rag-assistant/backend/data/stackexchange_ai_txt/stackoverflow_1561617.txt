Why does object.ToString() exist?

Isn't it much more elegant and neat to have an IStringable interface? Who needs this Type.FullName object returned to us? EDIT: everyone keeps asking why do I think it's more elegant.. Well, it's just like that, instead of IComparable, object would have CompareTo method, that by default throws an exception or returns 0. There are objects that cannot and should not be described as a string. object could have equally returned string.Empty . Type.FullName is just an arbitrary choice.. And for methods such as Console.Write(object), I think it should be: Write(IStringable). However, if you are using WriteLine to anything but strings (or something that its ToString is obvious such as numbers), it seems to me it's for debugging mode only.. By the way - how should I comment to you all? Is it okay that I post an answer?
