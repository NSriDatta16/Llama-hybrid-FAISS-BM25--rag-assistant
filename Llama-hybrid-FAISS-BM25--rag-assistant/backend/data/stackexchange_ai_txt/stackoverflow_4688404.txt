php open an asynchronous request and allow client to check if the request has finished

I am trying to create an asynchronous request via php that will allow me to check on the status(complete or still running), the request will take about 6-20 minutes to complete. I need the code to be system independent and maintain the request headers agent id(as this is used in authenticating my users), so I'm thinking I could do something along the lines of the second answer to this question. the problem is that I don't see a way of communicating with the server to verify that the operation had completed once the request was fired off. Is there some easy way to do this? (I can not predict the effects of the event, aka values might or might not change as a result of it)
