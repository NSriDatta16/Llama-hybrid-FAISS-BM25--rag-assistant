There are two issues here: 1) You haven't got much data 2) You haven't got strong priors. The first is a problem whether you are a frequentist or a Bayesian or anything else. Not much data yields imprecise estimates, dangers of over-fitting and so on. I don't see how the size of your data set influences whether you should go Bayesian or not. It might mean that you shouldn't do anything except get more data, but that's a different issue. As to weak priors being a concern, I think that's just backwards. I would be much more leery if I read a study that had very strong priors. I am not a Bayesian, but, to me, that raises the question: If you already know the answer, why are you doing the study? There may be a good answer to that question, it depends on the situation. But it would alert me and make me curious.
