There is a lot you can improve. First of all the best integer data type depends on the machine (word size). I don't know how are your int8_t and uint16_t declared. Also, not for performance but for readability, I usually don't use "cascading" ifs, like if condition { if another_condition { if third condition { but instead: if not condition return false; // Here the condition IS true, thus no reason to indent Another point of attention: low = (dir == 1)? mid : (mid + dir); high = (dir == 1)? (mid + dir) : mid; you do the dir==1 twice, better to use ifs: int sum = mid+dir; if dir == 1 { low = mid; high = sum; } else { low=sum; high=mid; } But there's more to say. For example you could use a faster searching algorithm.
