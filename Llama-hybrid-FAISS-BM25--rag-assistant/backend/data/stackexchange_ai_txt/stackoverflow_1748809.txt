For a DOM element, how to I get all styles specified in css for a particular element? Is it a case of iterating over all css style names? Yes, it is. Or is there a more elegant way? I don't know about more elegant (elegance is pretty high on the subjective scale), but it would certainly be shorter and sweeter if you made use of a library such as jQuery, here's a solution someone coded to answer another question: How Can I Get List Of All Element CSS Attributes with jQuery? How does Firebug do it? I have no idea.
