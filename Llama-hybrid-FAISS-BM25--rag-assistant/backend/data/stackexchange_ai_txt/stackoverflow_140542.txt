My current workaround is to add a custom CSV extension as such: Tab-delimited (requires patch) ASCII REPLACE_WITH_TAB txt ...you can see I'm using the text "REPLACE_WITH_TAB" as my field delimiter, and then I use a simple platform-independent Perl script to perform a sed-like fix: # all .txt files in the working directory @files = ; foreach $file (@files) { $old = $file; $new = "$file.temp"; open OLD, " ", $new or die $!; while (my $line = ) { # SSRS 2005 SP2 can't output tab-delimited files $line =~ s/REPLACE_WITH_TAB/\t/g; print NEW $line; } close OLD or die $!; close NEW or die $!; rename($old, "$old.orig"); rename($new, $old); } This is definitely a hack, but it gets the job done in a fairly non-invasive manner. It only requires: Perl installed on the user's machine User's ability to drag the .pl script to the directory of .txt files User's ability to double-click the .pl script
