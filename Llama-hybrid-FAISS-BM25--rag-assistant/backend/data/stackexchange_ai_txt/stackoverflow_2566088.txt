How do I debug a Net::HTTPInternalServerError error when using Mechanize?

c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/mechanize-1.0.0/lib/mechanize.rb:259:in `get': 500 => Net::HTTPInternalServerError (Mechanize::ResponseCodeError) I get the above error when I try to navigate to the following webpage http://fakewebsite.com//admin/edit_building.cfm?page=buildings&updateMode=yes&id=1251 I can navigate just fine when copy and paste the link into a browser. Note: This website does require a login, which I handle with code like the following $agent = Mechanize.new $agent.get('http://fakewebsite//admin/login.cfm?res=-5') form = $agent.page.forms.first form.EMail = "admin" form.Password = "password" form.submit This login works just fine, since I access other webpages protected by the login. I'm not sure where to go from here, any suggestions? I solved the problem with some help from below. Turns out after I successfully login into the site, it takes me to a home page. This home page has several iframes in it pointing to other webpages. Mechanize doesn't automatically retrieve these pages. When I manually retrieved them I discovered that these pages were setting cookies that were necessary to access other pages on the site. I had mistakenly assumed that all cookies would get set after the login process was completed but before I arrived at the home page.
