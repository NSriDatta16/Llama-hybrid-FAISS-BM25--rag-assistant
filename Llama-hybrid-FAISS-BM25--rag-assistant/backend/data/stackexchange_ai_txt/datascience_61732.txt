Update: we have updated TRAINSET to include the ability to upload multiple series as well as apply multiple labels! See demo in GIF below. We had this same problem again and again at Geocene, so we came up with this open-source web app called TRAINSET. You can use TRAINSET to brush labels onto time series data. You import data in a defined CSV format, then label the data, and export a labeled CSV. You can also import a pre-labeled CSV if you're really just trying to refine labels. You can use the hosted version of TRAINSET at https://trainset.geocene.com or you can deploy it yourself by following the readme at https://github.com/geocene/trainset
