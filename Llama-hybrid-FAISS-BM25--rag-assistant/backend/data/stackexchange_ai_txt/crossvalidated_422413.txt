Dynamic regression, models with coefficients = 0 chosen as top models

I am running auto.arima on part of a time series (training data) using all possible combinations for several external regressors. I then choose the top 5 models according to fit to testing data using RMSE. In some cases, chosen models estimate ARIMA or xreg coefficients equal to zero. Why are these models chosen? Wouldn't coefficients = 0 essentially cancel out that term in the regression equation? How can I avoid this behavior? Example output for two models below... also, the s.e. = 0 in some cases and NaN in others. I have started running auto.arima(... stepwise = FALSE, aproximation = FALSE), but that takes 5-10x longer, and I'm not sure if it fixes the behavior (sorry, not all models have finished running).
