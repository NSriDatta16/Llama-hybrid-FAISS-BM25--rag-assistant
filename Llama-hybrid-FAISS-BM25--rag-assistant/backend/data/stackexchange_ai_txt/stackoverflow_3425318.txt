Thanks - Alex: My code for the other set is working, and the only relevant part is that I have a string that may or may not contain the 'keyword' that is in this dictionary. Structurally, this is how I organized it: def main(): f = open('c:\python\ggce.sms', 'r') sensetree = etree.parse(f) senses = sensetree.getiterator('SenseMakingItem') bodies = sensetree.getiterator('Body') stories = [] for body in bodies: fix_body(body) storybyte = unicode(body.text) storybit = storybyte.encode('ascii','ignore') stories.append(storybit) rows = [ids,titles,locations,stories] out = map(None, *rows) print out[120:121] write_data(out,'c:\python\output_test.csv') (I omitted the code for getting its, titles, locations because they work and will not be used to get the real locations from the data within stories) Hope this helps.
