As far as I know, there aren't any drag and drop managers (it would take a lot of messing around to do, but it's possible with AJAX or something), but there is Net2FTP . The site has a usable demo, but you can download it and put it on your own server. I like your idea of web based drag and drop FTP... Maybe a future project for myself? ;-)
