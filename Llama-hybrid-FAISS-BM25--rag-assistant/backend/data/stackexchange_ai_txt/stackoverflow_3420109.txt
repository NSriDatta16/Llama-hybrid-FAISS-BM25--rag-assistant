Mark Byers has the right definition for that table. Basically an intersect table. See any database textbook. But in reality I've worked with many DBAs/Architects and most invent their own style for doing things and are not open to hearing anything else. Things like indentation rules, case for SQL statements, naming conventions for tables (even really bad ones), archival strategies, etc... You basically have no choice if they are in control of the database. You can mention it is an intersect table, point to the proper literature, but in the end if she wants to call it MyStupidlyLongAndPointlessPrefixForTablesBecauseICan_Lookup_Location_Quadmap and insists then there is nothing you can do. So try to point it out to her, but if she doesn't go along with it, don't take it too seriously... I just thought of something else. Lookup tables (our definition) are commonly called code tables as well. So she may call intersect tables lookup tables and lookup tables code tables. In which case you may have to learn to speak her language...
