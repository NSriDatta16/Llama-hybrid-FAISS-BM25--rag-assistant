Entities as views of a table

Is it possible to create multiple entities as 'views' of one master table? Let me explain. Lets say we have a very large table called Foo in a database which schema we're not allowed to alter. Foo ( Key1, field1, field2, field3, field4, field_n ) We want to create 3 updateble entity types from Foo. FooLite ( Key1, field1 ) FooAlt ( Key1, field2, field3 ) FooAlt2 ( Key1, field4 ) Inheritance wouldn't work even if we were to rebuild a hierarchy from scratch as some entity variations should exclude some fields. By trying to build a model following this scenario above we keep on getting the error below. If feels like you're not allowed to map an entity field more than once to a storage field, is this true? Error 3007: Problem in mapping fragments starting at lines 703, 860:Column(s) [CREATE_DATE] are being mapped in both fragments to different conceptual side properties.
