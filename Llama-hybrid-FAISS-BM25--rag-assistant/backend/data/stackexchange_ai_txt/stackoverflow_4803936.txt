Do you recommend any good book about distributed systems and cloud computing?

I'm learning about Microsoft Azure, and there are lots of concepts that, although are not new for me, I'd like to know more about them, like for example database sharding, denormalization, nosql, content delivery networks, distributed cache (like memcache), asynchronous processing, split systems, load balancing, etc... etc... I'm looking for a book about approaches rather than technique. The problem is that I can read a lot about how to use Azure Storage, or how to use Azure CDN, but without a correct approach, the result won't be as good as expected. Thanks in advance.
