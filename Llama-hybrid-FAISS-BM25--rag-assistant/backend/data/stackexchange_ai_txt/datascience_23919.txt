There are quite a few papers on predicting the next image in a set of video sequences. So I would familiarize yourself with those first. With that being said it is definitely possible to do this sort of things using ML. There has been a lot of work on recurrent layers for Convolutional Neural Nets. These at a high level seems like it would be a good candidate to investigate for your initial architectures. Here is some info on RCNNs: Example RCNN in keras: link Papers on RCNNs: link link
