I would use the reference measurements to calibrate the other sensors' biases: $$x_{ij}=s_{i}+\mu_j+\varepsilon_{ij},$$ where $x_{ij}$ - measured value from sensor $j$, $s_{i}$ - true value, $\mu_j$ - bias and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ - random error. We don't know the true value $s_i$, but we can use the reference sensors $r$ assuming they have no bias and small errors $u$: $$r_{i}=s_{i}+u_{i}$$ Plug one equation to another, and take the expectation: $$\mu_j = E[x_{ij}-r_{i}]\approx \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij}-r_{i}$$ Once you know the bias, you can use it to get the best measurement estimate: $$\hat s_i=\frac 1 m \sum_{j=1}^m x_{ij}-\mu_j$$ You can get more sophisticated but you need to keep the focus on what matters most. Your main issue is the bias, once you figure out how to deal with it, the stochastic errors will be averaged out by multiple sensor measurements. Consider a case where all sensors have the same bias: $\mu_j=\mu$ This is the worst case scenario, and you have no way to correct it without the reference sensors, unlike the stochastic errors that will be reduced or eliminated by repeated measurements.
