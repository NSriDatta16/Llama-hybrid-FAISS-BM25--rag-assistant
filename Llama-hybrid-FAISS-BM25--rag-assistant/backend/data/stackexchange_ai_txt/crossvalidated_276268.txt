Why avoid stepwise regression?

I have been using model averaging and model selection bases on AIC and BIC for a while. I have recently discover the stepwise regression technique and I found a lots of people critize this methods. Why stepwise regression is to avoid ? Is it just only because you may not capture interaction between variable and therefore loose informations ? Thank you
