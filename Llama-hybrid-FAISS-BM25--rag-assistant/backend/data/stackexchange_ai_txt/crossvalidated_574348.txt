Regression analysis with time series data

I'm completely stuck. I'm making a regression analysis in Python : my dependent variable - share price of company, independent variables - price of steel, price of coal and changing in local currency. According theory I can't use this time series depended and independent variables due to autocorrelation. Can I solve this problem by taking percent changing day-to-day of share price and percent changing day-to-day independed variable ? I have check this data for stationarity with Dickey Fuller test and get appropriate results, but I think that isn't right way. or What are the ways to build such a model ? P.S I'm recently read that for time series data ARMA model is the good choice, but I don't understand how take in account independent variable, not predict on dependent variables on itself. Thank you in advance!
