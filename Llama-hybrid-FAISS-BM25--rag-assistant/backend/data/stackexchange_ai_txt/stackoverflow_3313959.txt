Make a custom message box (inheriting from Window ) that has placeholders for header/message and confirmation button text. Then you can design a nice, attention-grabbing dialog that will stand out from the hundreds of standard OK/Cancel MessageBoxes a user typically sees. For example, you can use a larger header font similar to the Windows Vista dialogs, or include a custom image. Then, you could obviously handle the Escape key yourself, and define the default Escape behavior on a per-dialog basis.
