Calculate compass heading to a CLLocation - Haversine functions for iOS

I understand how to get the distance between 2 CLLocations. I need to determine the generalized compass bearing (N, NE, E etc.) from a CLLocation to another CLLocation. Before I implement something to derive the bearing with the haversine formula is there a generally adapted open source library or code fragment that you've found solves this problem with or without using haversine? Thanks!
