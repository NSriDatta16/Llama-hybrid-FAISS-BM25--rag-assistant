Which model is better for incremental learning?

I'm trying to implement face recognition. I'm planning to use some model (like DeepFace) to extract discriminative features and then use a classifier to recognize the faces. I'm confused as to which classifier to use. My setup is as follows: Initially, I'll have a few labelled samples and I train a classifier. Then I start getting more labelled samples and I want to update my classifier with the new data. Also, the newer samples may contain new classes (faces). So, I want my classifier to be able to learn to classify new classes as well. My question is which classifier is better suited for this task. I would also prefer to get multiple predictions with a confidence score. K Nearest Neighbors algorithm: Here I can use distance as some form of confidence score. As presented here , I can use SVM: Train on the initial data and retain support vectors alone. Repeat the process as and when new data comes up. But, I have no idea if the above 2 classifiers are suited for the task at hand or how they would perform. Any inputs regarding this is greatly appreciated. I'm also open to any other classifiers as well. Thanks!
