Setting SharePoint List Metadata

Metadata seems to be used frequently to describe a SharePoint list's structure . That structure allows the storage of data at the list item level. How can I specify information about the list itself without relying on an additional column? Ideally I want something like SPList.Properties ["Mykey"] = "MyValue" PropertiesXml isn't settable but is there any way to alter the data it returns?
