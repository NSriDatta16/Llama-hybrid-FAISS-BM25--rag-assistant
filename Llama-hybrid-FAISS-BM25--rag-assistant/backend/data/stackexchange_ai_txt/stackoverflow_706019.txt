UPDATE: This doesn't really help with your issue... I am just researching OSGi myself. Not quite what you're looking for, but the following post discusses the same issue when using vanilla equinox (ie: not hosted within tomcat/jetty). It suggests creating a 'fragment bundle' (example available for download) to hold your log4j.properties. Perhaps you could try something similar? Or perhaps you just need to place the log4j.properties inside META-INF of your WAR?
