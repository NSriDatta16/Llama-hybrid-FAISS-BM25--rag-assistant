You cannot access heap reliably without malloc, but there are alternatives for memory allocation. If you're trying to get finer control over memory allocations, you can use other memory managers like bget memory allocator . Here you grab a huge chunk of heap (the maximum memory requiredment anticipated + some overhead) using malloc and pass it to the bget using bpool . From there on, call bget instead of malloc to allocate memory and brel to free it. bget is reportedly better in avoiding memory fragmentation.
