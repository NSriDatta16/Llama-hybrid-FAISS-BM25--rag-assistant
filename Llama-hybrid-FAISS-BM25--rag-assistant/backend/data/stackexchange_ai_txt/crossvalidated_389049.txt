How to adjust p-value for slow features?

I have some monthly, weekly and daily features. I want to do regression against a daily target. I use locf to fill monthly/weekly features. Also I have some moving average of daily features. All these are slow in the sense that, 1) they have much less independent data 2) they have lower sd Therefore I think they will boost the p-value/r-squared/t-statistics compared to other normal daily features. How do I adjust these statistics? Edit: I did not notice the source of the problem is my y has some auto correlation. I have created two examples with this problem. Normal x: library(zoo) n = 1000 list_p = list() for (ii in 1:1000){ y x created with na.locf library(zoo) n = 1000 list_p = list() for (ii in 1:1000){ y
