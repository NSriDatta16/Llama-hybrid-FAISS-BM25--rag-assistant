How can I detect anomalies with geo spatial data?

I have time series with objects and their geo points. X1 = [(time1, (longitude1, latitude1)), ...] X2 = [(time2, (longitude2, latitude2)), ...] ... XN = [(timeN, (longitudeN, latitudeN)), ...] This dataset represents moving objects on a plane. How can I detect anomalies within these dataset? I know that the majority of objects are moving in 3 or 4 paths (clusters). What method should I use to detect anomalies? When some object is trying to move off the the main paths?
