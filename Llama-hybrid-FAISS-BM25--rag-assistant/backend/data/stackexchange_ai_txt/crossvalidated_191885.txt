Is this a nonlinear time series?

Could someone please help me to find out whether a time series is linear? And if it's nonlinear, what degree of nonlinearity? I searched for an appropriate function in Matlab, but it seems there's no function which takes a vector as an argument and returns a boolean as a result or something like that. I'm not really sure how to determine it visually. The link for data: https://datamarket.com/data/set/22px/annual-sheep-population-1000s-in-england-wales-1867-1939#!ds=22px&display=line
