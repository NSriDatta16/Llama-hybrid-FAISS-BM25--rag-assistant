I have been finding more and more that if I'm required to pick a username, and my preferred one is already taken, I'll simply leave the site. At least one company has lost a sale this way, and I refuse to join Twitter. On the other hand, sites that use your email address as a username don't have quite the same problem. For me, it's a different problem: Which address did I give them? The good news about OpenID is that a few major sites have found a way to make it easy for new users to figure out what's going on, by listing the icons of a few sites where they're likely to have accounts. Whether your average user will trust that method is still in question, though.
