The MySQL documentation gives a good explanation of the storage requirements of the various data types. In particular, for a string of length L, a CHAR(M) datatype will take up (M x c) bytes (where c is the number of bytes required to store a character... this depends on the character set in use). A VARCHAR(M) will take up (L + 1) or (L + 2) depending on whether M is 255. So, it really depends on how long you expect your strings to be, what the variation in length will be. NB: The documetation doesn't discuss the impact of character sets on the storage requirements of a VARCHAR type. I've tried to quote it accurately, but my guess is that you would need to multiply the string length by the character byte-width as well to get the storage requirement.
