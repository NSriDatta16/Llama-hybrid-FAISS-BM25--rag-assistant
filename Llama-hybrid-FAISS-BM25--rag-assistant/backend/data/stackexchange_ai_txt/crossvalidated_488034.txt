Dealing dataset with NAs (MNAR)

I have a dataframe with many (>50%) NAs values and I am looking for a way to deal with it. From what I've found, I think many people recommend using imputation like multiple imputation or using random forest (rf deals with missing values by replacing the NAs with median). However, let me explain my situation with a sub-dataset: basket.Africa.1 basket.US.10 basket.France.20 apple 1 0 1 orange NA 3 2 pear NA NA 2 peach 1 NA NA banana 1 2 3 Each basket is scan by a machine (pour the fruits from the basket and the machine will scan each fruit), and then the amount of fruits will be recorded. So, there are 1 apple, 1 peach, and 1 banana in basket.Africa.1 . Note that basket.Africa.1 refers to basket #1 from Africa. The NAs here is NOT missing by random, it means it is not possible to have NAs. For example, basket.Africa.1 has NAs in orange and pear, because Africa does not produce any orange and pear, so it is for sure that orange and pear counts are NAs. In other words, the zero in basket.US.10 (this basket is from the US) does NOT mean missing value, but instead, it is possible to have apple in this basket but there're none in this particular basket (basket # 10 from the US). My goal is to use the dataset (~100 columns of different baskets from 5 countries (Africa, US, France, China, Australia) and ~10 rows of different fruits), and answer: if I am given a random basket, how can I determine which country is this basket belongs to? I don't think it is appropriate to fill any values for the NAs because the NAs should have no value! I also try the multiple imputation but my data contains WAY TOO MANY missing values, so this method doesn't work neither...
