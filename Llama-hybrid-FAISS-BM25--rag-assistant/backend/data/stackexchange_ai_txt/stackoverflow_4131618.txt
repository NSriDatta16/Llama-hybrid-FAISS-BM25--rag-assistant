How can I add a thumb to a slider without losing the slider tap behavior?

The question may sound weird, here it goes: Sliders in silverlight 3 for windows phone have a thumb but it's set to transparent: Everything works ok with the above settings, if I tap the corner (or the part) of a slider the active zone goes towards that corner and so on... Now If I want to add a thumb image let's say something like: The slider loses it's behavior, now I can change its value only using the drag event. To be more specific now if I tap a slider part the active zone won't go to that part but if I drag from one part to another the slider active zone will go in the direction of the dragging. this is the rest of the code which will use the above template ( I only use the horizontal slider ). --> Does anyone of you gets what is happening here ? Thanks.
