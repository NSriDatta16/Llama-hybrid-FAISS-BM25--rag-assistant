1) I don't believe you can. This is managed by the Azure Fabric controller. The most you can do is force an individual instance (the one you've RDP'd into) to reboot/restart. 2) Yes. But they won't be reverted unless the VM is recycled, so be prepared to back them out yourself. This is a good use of RDP 3) Not directly. Again, this is controlled by the Azure Fabric controller. But you could put the original bits you had back into the VM manually. I'm not sure I understand the questions regarding server manager, but I can answer the question about where things live. The "base" Windows Azure VM image is the root drive where you see INetPub at. The application is deployed to a seperate VHD (thus its presence on another drive). If you request local storage, that will come from yet another virtual drive. This is just how the Azure Fabric manages the application deployments. Properly constructed, the roles of course won't care where things live.
