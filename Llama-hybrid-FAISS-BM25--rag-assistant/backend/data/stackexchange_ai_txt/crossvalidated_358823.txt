When I change the training set for a VGG16-CNN algorithm or any other CNN, will the results change? Yes. Machine learning algorithms crucially depend on the data used to train them. when I use the same neural network 'the same algorithms' but with different training set and with more data, will the accuracy and the results change ? Yes. Different problems are suited to different solutions. Success of VGG16-CNN on some problem does not imply that it will find success on another one.
