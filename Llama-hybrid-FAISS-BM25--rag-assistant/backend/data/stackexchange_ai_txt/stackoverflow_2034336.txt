I'm not going to completely answer Your question, but I would like to help You understand variables, as I had the same problems understanding them, when I began to program by myself. For the moment, don't bother with the electronic representation of variables in memory. Think of memory as a continuous block of 1-byte-cells, each storing an bit-pattern (consisting of 0s and 1s). By solely looking at the memory, You can't determine, what the bits in it represent! They are just arbitrary sequences of 0s and 1s. It is YOU, who specifies, HOW to interpret those bit patterns! Take a look at this example: int a, b, c; ... c = a + b; You could have written the following as well: float a, b, c; ... c = a + b; In both cases, the variables a, b and c are stored somewhere in the memory (and You can't tell their type). Now, when the compiler compiles Your code (that is translating Your program into machine instructions), it makes sure, to translate the "+" into integer_add in the first case and float_add in the second case, thus the CPU will interpret the bit patterns correctly and perform, what You desired. Variable types are like glasses , that let the CPU look at a bit patterns from different perspectives.
