The Major, criteria i was looking for any Modular changes/multiple oscillations to track. Explored few methods like Stationarity Test and Interdaily Stability , but both of these methods have assumption of some kind of pattern/trend, which may/may not be present in our Target Feature. And since we are doing Regression problem on a time series dataset due to certain challenges, it is important to acknowledge No Model Possible scenarios, where there is no fluctuation/deviation observed in a the Op Signal(Target feature.) The below pct_change() and diff() method helps in identifying the extent of movement observed in the op signal. def pct_change_diff(dataset,tag_name_col,threshold_val): ''' 1. Computing Percentage Change in a TIME SERIES beteen consecutive elements. 2. Computng First Difference in a TIME SERIES between consecutive elements. There is no difference between the two methods apart from that, pct_chnage represents the value in %. PCT CHANGE may become NAN is the values are constant at 0, so we opt for First Difference as our KPI value! ''' dataset['pct_change'] = dataset.pct_change() dataset['first_diff'] = dataset[tag_name_col].diff() # Calculating the number if time stamps where no change/difference is observed pct_change_zero = round((len(dataset[dataset['pct_change'] == 0.0])/len(dataset))*100,2) first_diff_zero = round((len(dataset[dataset['first_diff'] == 0.0])/len(dataset))*100,2) # Threshold is 75% if first_diff_zero >= threshold_val: print('No Model Possible') else: print('Model Possible') return pct_change_zero,first_diff_zero,dataset This simple approach helps in identifying such target features, which are operating at a fixed value ( maybe sleeping/stable for the whole period ), and also helps in capturing the extent of oscillation occurred.
