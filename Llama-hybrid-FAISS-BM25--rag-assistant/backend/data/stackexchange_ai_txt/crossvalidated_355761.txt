Assuming $\beta^{(t)}$, the value of the Markov chain after $t$ iterations, is demonstrably generated from the stationary distribution with density $f$, generating$$\beta_1^{(t+1)}|\beta_2^{(t)}\sim f_{1|2}(\beta_1| \beta_2^{(t)})$$produces one random generation $(\beta_1^{(t+1)},\beta_2^{(t)})$ with distribution $f$, since the conditional generation preserves the stationary distribution. So, rigorously,$$(\beta_1^{(t+1)},\beta_2^{(t)}) \sim f$$ For the same reason, generating further$$\beta_2^{(t+1)}|\beta_1^{(t+1)}\sim f_{2|1}(\beta_2| \beta_1^{(t+1)})$$produces one random generation $(\beta_1^{(t+1)},\beta_2^{(t+1)})$ with distribution $f$:$$(\beta_1^{(t+1)},\beta_2^{(t+1)}) \sim f$$with no approximation involved. What may be the source of your confusion is that, conditional on $(\beta_1^{(t)},\beta_2^{(t)})$, $(\beta_1^{(t+1)},\beta_2^{(t+1)})$ is not distributed from $f$. But marginally $(\beta_1^{(t+1)},\beta_2^{(t+1)})$ is distributed from $f$.
