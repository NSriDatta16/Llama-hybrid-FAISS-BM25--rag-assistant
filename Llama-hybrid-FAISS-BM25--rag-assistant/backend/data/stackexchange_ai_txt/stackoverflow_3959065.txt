How can I set a default value for a Perl variable?

I am completely new to Perl. I needed to use an external module HTTP::BrowserDetect. I was testing some code and tried to get the name of the OS from os_string method. So, I simply initialized the object and created a variable to store the value returned. my $ua = HTTP::BrowserDetect->new($user_agent); my $os_name = $ua->os_string(); print "$user_agent $os_name\n"; there are some user agents that are not browser user agents so they won't get any value from os_string. I am getting an error Use of uninitialized value $os_name in concatenation (.) or string How do I handle such cases when the $os_name is not initialized because the method os_string returns undef (this is what I think happens from reading the module source code). I guess there should be a way to give a default string, e.g. No OS in these cases.
