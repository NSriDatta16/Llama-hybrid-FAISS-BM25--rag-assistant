I own the first release the the Lego MindStorms robotics kit, and I can not praise it enough. It's easy to get started with, and the possibilities are endless. Not only is it fun constructing things, it's a joy bringing them to life. It challenges you as an engineer and as a software developer. It makes you truly appreciate and understand the fragility of robotics research and development. The new NXT set is out as well. Largely developed by user feedback, it is the best Lego robotics kit yet.
