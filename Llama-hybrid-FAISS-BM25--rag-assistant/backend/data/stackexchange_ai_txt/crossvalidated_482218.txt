Appropriate Feature Selection methods

I'm running a multinomial logistic regression and I'm torn regarding which variable selection method to apply... The ones I know are backwards elimination or forward selection, chi square feature selection, and that's pretty much it. But I haven't found a general consensus or rule that explains why backwards elimination would be better or worse than Chi square, for example. I'm not just asking for those, if you have more to recommend they're welcome. With this I'm looking to predict the probabilities of a 3-choice nominal variable, with independent variables that are the classic demographics, which range from continuous to nominal (age, income, years at job, gender, residential status) and some variables showing the amount of time the client has been in certain state (in months). From a total 17316 observations, 4599 belong to the class 0, 976 to class 1 and 11741 to class 2. I was wondering if anyone had any resource that could help me with this?
