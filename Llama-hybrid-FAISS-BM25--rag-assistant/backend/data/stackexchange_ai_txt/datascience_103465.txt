How to suppress Python from showing status of my random forest run?

How can I stop scikit-learn Random Forest from displaying the following status output during run? I have already set verbosity to -1 in RandomForestClassifier() and GridSearchCV() [Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Using backend ThreadingBackend with 8 concurrent workers. [Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 2 out of 9 | elapsed: 0.3s remaining: 1.3s [Parallel(n_jobs=-1)]: Done 9 out of 9 | elapsed: 0.4s finished [Parallel(n_jobs=8)]: Using backend ThreadingBackend with 8 concurrent workers.
