Your emphasis is likely to be the wrong way round. Throwing away time as a variable is unlikely to be the best way forward. You need to think hard about what is a panel. If you really want countries to be panels, then you may need to average or otherwise combine repeated observations for the same country and the same year. But it sounds as if your panels are firms. If so, firm should be the panel identifier. I don't know what cusip identifier is.
