How to have a top-level SVN working dir, when contents don't mirror repo

Bad title, let me provide an example: Repository repo | |-- project1 | | | |-- trunk | |-- tags | |-- branches | |-- project2 | | | |-- trunk | |-- tags | |-- branches | |-- project3 | | | |-- trunk | |-- tags | |-- branches | Working copy c:\work\my-wc | |-- project1 ( I the top-level WC to act as a SVN WC so I can update it, have IDE tools let me drag files between projects, etc. But how is that possible, if at all? So far I manually checkout each project/trunk into a folder and obviously the parent directory is nothing to do with SVN at all. The aim is to stop people checking out the entire branches/tags structure, which could be massive.
