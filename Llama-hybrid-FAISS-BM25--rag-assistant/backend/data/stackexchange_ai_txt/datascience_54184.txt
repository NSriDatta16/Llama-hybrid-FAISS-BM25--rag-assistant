How to interpret feature importance (XGBoost) in this case?

I found two dominant features from plot_importance . My dependent variable Y is customer retention (whether or not the customer will retain, 1=yes, 0=no). My problem is I know that feature A and B are significant, but I don't know how to interpret and report them in words because I can't tell if they have a position or negative effect on the customer retention. Is there a way to find that out or anything that helps make it clear? Thanks.
