Forgive me for stating the b*****g obvious but: Use YOUR software to check the hardware requirements for YOUR software. I don't quite understand why the spec of your development machine isn't simply the required spec for the laptop you propose to buy. But if that's not good enough for some reason, run your software on some hardware with other specifications. You could, for example take 1GB RAM out of your development machine to see how things go with less memory available. There is a huge amount of benchmarking software available for all sorts of tasks. For example LINPACK is much used for benchmarking supercomputers. The flaw in all of these off-the-shelf benchmarks, and in the approach in general, is that they only give you good information about how a computer runs the benchmark. Transforming benchmark results into predictions of performance of hardware with your software is more an art than a science. In the supercomputer world organisations benchmark their own key applications on new platforms before purchasing.
