Stata's xtlogit (fe, re) equivalent in R?

Stata allows for fixed effects and random effects specification of the logistic regression through the xtlogit fe and xtlogit re commands accordingly. I was wondering what are the equivalent commands for these specifications in R. The only similar specification I am aware of is the mixed effects logistic regression > mymixedlogit but I am not sure whether this maps to any of the aforementioned commands.
