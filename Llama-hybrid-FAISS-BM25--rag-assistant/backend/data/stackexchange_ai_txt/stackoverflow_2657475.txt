To strictly answer your question, I think that a typical install would at least include glassfish-appserv, glassfish-javaee, glassfish-toplink-essentials (for JPA). But for development, I'd warmly recommend to use GlassFish v3 (because of the session preservation across deployments feature, to maximize productivity) and to install it manually in your home directory. Download the self-extracting installer file from here .
