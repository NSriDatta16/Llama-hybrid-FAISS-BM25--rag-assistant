Before attempting to parse screen images and produce mouse clicks (which would be exceedingly difficult), first take a look at the data actually being sent/received by the game between the browser and the server. Interact with the game as normal and use something like WireShark to capture the packets and see if it's something you can automate. It's unlikely (since they specifically don't want people to do what you're trying to do), but it's possible that the communication with the server is just simple requests with parameters. (I know this was the case a long time ago with MySpace games, such as Dragon Wars and Mafia Wars.) If the data is something you can parse and understand then you can skip the Flash interface entirely and just write your own.
