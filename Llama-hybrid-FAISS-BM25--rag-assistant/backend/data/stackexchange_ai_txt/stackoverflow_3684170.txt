I'd ask your professor for some data to support "performance hog". Sounds like shallow thinking and FUD to me. Benchmarks can be found to support either position, so I don't pay much attention. The real reason to learn a language is so it can affect the way you think about programming. I think Python will be beneficial. Shame on your professor for not bringing that up. S/he's worried about performance? Ask when they last wrote code where performance mattered. I'm learning Python right now as a long-time Java guy. I think learning anything takes some time. I'm working my way through "Core Python Programming" by Wesley Chun. I'm enjoying it very much so far. I like the language. The ideas map pretty nicely onto what I already know about Java and OO, but there are differences (e.g., dynamic typing, functional programming, etc.) that are worth understanding. The most important thing is writing code. I'm working through the exercises carefully and getting it under my fingers and into my brain. I'm using PyCharm from JetBrains as my IDE. It's brilliant to have such a good tool at my fingertips. I started about a month ago. I'm about 1/3rd of the way through the exercises (reading is further ahead; about halfway). My goal is to finish it before the end of the year and feel comfortable enough to pick up Django. I hope you like it as much as I do. Good luck.
