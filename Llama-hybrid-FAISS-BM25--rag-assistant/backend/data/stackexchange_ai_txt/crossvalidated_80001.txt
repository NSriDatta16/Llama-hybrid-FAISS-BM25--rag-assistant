That it isn't a Bayesian credible interval (i.e. from a frequentist point of view, the probability that the true value of the statistic lies within a 95% confidence interval is not 0.95, but one or zero). The idea of a confidence interval is not fundamentally flawed (from a Bayesian perspective), it is just an answer to a different question (see my answer to this related question ). The confidence interval is the answer to the request: "Give me an interval that will bracket the true value of the parameter in 100p% of the instances of an experiment that is repeated a large number of times." The credible interval is an answer to the request: "Give me an interval that brackets the true value with probability p given the particular sample I've actually observed." The frequentist confidence interval fundamentally cannot answer the second question. If you ask a Bayesian the first question, the answer you get will be very likely to be the same as the frequentist confidence interval (for some appropriate choice of prior). The key think to remember is to interpret a confidence interval as a confidence interval, not as a credible interval.
