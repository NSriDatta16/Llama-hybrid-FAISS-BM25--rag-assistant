Why is PostSharp causing my project build to fail?

I am working on a unit testing project. This project has roughly 2600 test classes with an average of 15 unit tests per class. I'm not sure how many more classes I need to add to this project to recreate the error mentioned below, but I do know that adding a large amount (I tried 500) of files to the project is directly related to it. If I remove some files, I am able to build. Compilation errors unknown_location error PS0034: PostSharp: ILASM exited with return code 255. Tool output: This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information. What is causing this to happen? Edit: It might be important to note that that the test project does not use the custom PostSharp attribute directly. In other words, in none of the test classes do I have a using directive for a PostSharp dll. They are, however, used in the classes that the tests are testing.
