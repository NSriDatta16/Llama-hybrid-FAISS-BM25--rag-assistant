Salting is the practice of adding a unqiue string of characters to whatever is being hashed. Suppose mySalt = abc123 and my password is passwd . In PHP, I would use hashResult = md5(mySalt + password) . Suppose the string is intercepted. You try to match the string, but you end up matching gibberish because the password was salted before encrypted. Just remember that whatever you use for salt must be continuous throughout the application. If you salt the password before storage, you must compare the hashed, salted password to the DB.
