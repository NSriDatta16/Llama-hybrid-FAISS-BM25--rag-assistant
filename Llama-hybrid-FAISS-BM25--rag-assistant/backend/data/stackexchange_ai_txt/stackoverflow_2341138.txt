Magento dispatching outside application

I'm trying to figure out how exactly Magento's dispatching system works. I want to dispatch a certain part of the layout (e.g. the body) from outside the application directory. What i have so far; getFrontController(); $request = $front->getRequest(); $request->setRequestUri($myRequestUri); // dispatch everything $front->dispatch(); ?> Dispatching goes OK, but i need to strip this down to just the body or a certain block. Also the generated HTML should be returned instead of outputting it directly (better not using output buffering). // Roland Edit: I've added the progress i made, stil leaves me with some questions.
