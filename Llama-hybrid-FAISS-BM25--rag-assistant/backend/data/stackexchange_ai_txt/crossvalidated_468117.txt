We need to be precise about the terms "frequentist" and "Bayesian", because they are ambiguous. "Frequentism" can be understood as adhering to a specific interpretation of the meaning of probability, which doesn't necessarily imply that any specific methodology needs to be applied. In this sense one can be a frequentist without ever computing confidence intervals, and as a frequentist one can do Bayesian statistics (particularly if the prior has a frequentist interpretation). However more people use "frequentist" as referring to what is known as standard frequentist approaches to inference, estimation, tests and confidence regions. These rely crucially on the sampling distribution. "Bayesian" on the other hand is often meant refer to a particular interpretation of the meaning of probability, usually understood as "epistemic" probabilities, although this is not the only possible meaning "Bayesian" can have. A frequentist probability would be defined by a data generating process in reality, whereas an epistemic probability refers to a state of knowledge of an individual (or science as a whole) about something rather than the real process that generates this "something". The concept of a "sampling distribution" is understood by frequentists as referring to a distribution of a statistic given that data are distributed according to the underlying real process. As there is no such thing in epistemic probability as an underlying real process defining probabilities, they don't have a sampling distribution in this sense. They don't "bypass" it, it is a concept that isn't meaningful for them. However a Bayesian still can think of a real process as a sampling process for choosing and processing their epistemic probabilities, in which case something can occur in the Bayesian computations that looks and acts like a sampling distribution. Note: Following a remark by Sextus Empiricus I add that when writing about "frequentists" and "Bayesians" I don't intend to imply that anybody has to be either a frequentist or a Bayesian as a person . What I do think is that whenever we do data analysis involving probabilities, we should be clear what we think these probabilities mean, and this can be frequentist, or epistemic (various versions), or other. This shouldn't stop us from adopting a different interpretation in a different situation if it seems fit. So where I write "as a frequentist", I mean "as somebody who locally, in a given situation, takes a frequentist hat", etc.
