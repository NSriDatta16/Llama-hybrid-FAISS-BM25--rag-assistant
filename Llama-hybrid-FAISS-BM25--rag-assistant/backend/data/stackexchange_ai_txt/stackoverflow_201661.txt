If you want IE to be fast - or generally consider speed, then you'll want to build up a DOM fragment first before inserting it. John Resig explains the technique and includes a performance benchmark: http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/ var i = 10, fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(), div = document.createElement('div'); while (i--) { fragment.appendChild(div.cloneNode(true)); } $('#container').append(fragment); I realise it's not making a lot of use of jQuery in building up the fragment, but I've run a few tests and I can't seem to do $(fragment).append() - but I've read John's jQuery 1.3 release is supposed to include changes based on the research linked above.
