Saxon Transformerfactory placing unneceary xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" in transformer output

I am using Sax transformer factory to do an XSLT transformation on large set of xsd files, so a particular line the xslt is as follows. .... the reference tag being the root of the document, but the result has an unwanted xmlns:xsd attribute shown below. ... this additional attribute is causing problems with parser that uses the transformed xml. is this an issue with the XSLT or with SAXON api, how can i avoid this?
