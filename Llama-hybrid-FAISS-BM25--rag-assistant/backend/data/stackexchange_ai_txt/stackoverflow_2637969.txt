Local development using HTML5 storage

I am experimenting with HTML5 local storage functionality, but was frustrated to learn that the browser won't allow local storage when the file is local. My guess is that the browser (Chrome in my case, FF too) wants to see a domain rather than a file location. Has anyone here discovered a workaround for developing locally? Perhaps setting up a local domain? That sounds like too much trouble. There should just be a developer option in the browser, grrrrrr.
