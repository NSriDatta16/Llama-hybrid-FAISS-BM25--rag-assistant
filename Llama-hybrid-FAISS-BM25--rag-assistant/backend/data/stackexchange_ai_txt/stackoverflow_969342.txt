Displaying same image multiple times at different locations in a web page using JavaScript

I have a simple web page with a simple puzzle. There are some images that user is supposed to drag to their designated drop zones. I use solution in JavaScript generated by DreamWeaver. I want to add a JavaScript function that will show a correct.png or wrong.png image next to the image a user just dropped. The straightforward way to do it is to just have correct and wrong div elements for each of the draggable images. But is there a more elegant way? Another way to put it would be: Write a JavaScript functions Show(commonImageId, nextToImageId) and Hide(commonImageId, nextToImageId) that would be used like Show('correct', 'draggable1'); .
