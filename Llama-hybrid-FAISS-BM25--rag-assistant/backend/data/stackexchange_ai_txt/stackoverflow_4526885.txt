Configure position of window for cv::imshow

Is there a way to change the position of the window that pops up when cv::imshow is called? For me, the window seems to appear partially off-screen, so I have to drag it around before I can see entire image. It's very annoying to have to do this every single time. I had a look at the reference manual -- it seems you have control over what goes into the title of the window, but I can't see anything relating to window position. Oh, and the behavior is the same if I use the old C interface ( cvShowImage ). Any ideas?
