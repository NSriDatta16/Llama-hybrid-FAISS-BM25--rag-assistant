You can find a very good answer to your question in the Who Are The Bayesians? thread and How exactly do Bayesians define (or interpret?) probability? that discusses the specific way how Bayesian approach probability, which is one of the core concepts of the approach. But making the answer more specific, it is not about latent variables, because there are many non-Bayesian models with latent variables. There is a whole class of latent variable models that can be treated as Bayesian models but do not have to (e.g. you can find their parameters with maximum likelihood). It's more about using priors and specific definition of probability, as you can learn from the threads mentioned above.
