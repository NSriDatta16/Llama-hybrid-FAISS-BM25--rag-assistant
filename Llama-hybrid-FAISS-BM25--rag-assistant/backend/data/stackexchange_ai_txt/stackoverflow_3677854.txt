Can I run a program from visual studio without elevated permissions?

Okay, so originally I was going to ask about dragging and dropping in Windows 7. I found the answer I was looking for here: C# Drag drop does not work on windows 7 . Basically it says that since I'm running Visual Studio (and subsequently, my program) with elevated permissions, some sort of isolation layer prevents me from dragging and dropping files from explorer into my program. The reason I run visual studio with elevated permissions is because admin privileges are needed to run a site locally on IIS and the web app is in my solution. Is there a way I can tell visual studio to run and debug my other apps as a normal user?
