Here is the general recipe: http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/ , You may specifically try to overfit one batch to check the model capacity. activation to Relu -> Tanh, also suggested in the comment above by Alex. Add another dense layer before the last layer to increase the capacity of the model to learn more nonlinearity of the curve Dense(4, activation='tanh') Also, you may try to increase the batch size to 35 assuming your seq_len=50. It worked for me when I was trying to train a simple autoencoder on sine and cosine waves. Hope this helps. :)
