Each time series should be evaluated separately with the ultimate idea of collecting i.e. grouping similar series into groups or sections as having similar/common structure. Since time series data can be intervened with by unknown deterministic structure at unspecified poins in time,one is advised to do Intervention Detection to find where the intervention actually had an effect. If you know a law went into effect at a particular point of (de jure) this may in fact (de facto) not the date when the intervention actually happened. Systems can respond in advance of a known effect date or even after the date due to non-compliance or non-response. Specifying the date of the intervention can lead to Model Specification Bias. I suggest that you google "Intervention Detection" or "Outlier Detection". A good book on this would be by Prof. Wei of Temple University published by Addison-Wessley. I believe the title is "Time Series Analysis". One further comment an Intervention Variable might appear as a Pulse or Level/Step Shift or a Seasonal Pulse or a Local Time Trend. In response to expanding the discussion about Local Time Trends: If you have a series that exhibits 1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,17,18,19... there has been a change in trend at period 5 and at 10. For me a main question in time series is the detection of level shifts e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,..or another example of a level shift 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2, AND/OR or the detection of time trend breaks. Just as a Pulse is a difference of a Step, a Step is a difference of a Trend. We have extended the theory of Intervention Detection to the 4th dimension i,e, Trend Point Change. In terms of openess, I have been able to implement such Intervention Detection schemes in conjuction with both ARIMA and Transfer Function Models. I am one of the senior time-series statisticians who have collaborated in the development of AUTOBOX which incorporates these features. I am unaware of anyone else who has programmed this exciting innovation. Perhaps someone else can comment on an R package that might do that but I donâ€™t think so.
