I've run into quite a few people who just weren't aware that such features existed -- they cut their teeth in the early days of mySQL, and they've never really used anything else, and they haven't kept up with the advancement of the new storage tables in mySQL, even. Or they learned databases in school, and they've never gone back to see all of the stuff they missed. They learn the bare minimum SQL to get by, and don't realize all of the different extensions that different RDBMSes offer. On one project, I'd love to have materialized views ... but I'm using Postgres. I'd love to use spatial data types for another project, but I'm going to have to do a hack, or change databases to deal with mySQL's insistance that they be not null. I've even had to figure out how to disable Oracle's transactional consistency to deal with long-running queries on an OLTP that would've been no problem in mySQL. I can normally code around the shortcomings of the database for a given problem, but part of the problem is in selecting the right tool for the job -- on a current project, we've wasted man-months on data replication because we're using Postgres, and they decided on Slony-1 before they actually knew all of what we'd be replicating. ... I view this question as being like 'why don't more people use feature x in language y ' -- if they're not an expert in language y they might not know feature x exists. (and don't take this as support for getting DBA certification ... I've known some Oracle DBAs that couldn't program their way out of a wet sack; I've taken all of the courses in the 8i days, but refused to take the tests as I didn't want to be lumped in with that group)
