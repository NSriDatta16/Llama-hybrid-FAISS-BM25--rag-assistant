About the type of application your are talking about a canvas / diagram based app (create elements, drag & drop, change properties...)? In my free time (started when SL 2 was on alfa), I implemented this DBSchema Diagramming tool (SL Based): http://www.dbschemaeditor.com/ The main limitations that I have are: Printing (I need to go to the server side and using GDI+ draw a bitmap then go back to the client side returning a JPEG). In theory in SL3 now you can directly save a canvas as a bitmap. Saving files to local: I used Isolated Storage, but on SL3 you have available a save as dialog. Good stuff that I found: Pretty powerful, I have a diagram that has more than 80 tables (and a big bungh of relations) and performs quite well. Instead of javascript use .net on the client side... wow that's great ! :). HTH Braulio
