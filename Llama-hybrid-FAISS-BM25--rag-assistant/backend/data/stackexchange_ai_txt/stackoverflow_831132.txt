Sadly there is no Continue if VB6 - this was new in VB 2005 I believe. I wouldn't always be afraid of goto statements - that's effectively what the Continue is, but without the need for a labelled line after the loop. As long as your goto statements don't jump very far, they will always be readable, and it is probably the most elegant solution to this problem. Nesting another if/then/else inside a for loop is actually HARDER to read and maintain later than a nice simple goto (with a comment on the goto line saying something like "' read as Continue For"). Good luck!
