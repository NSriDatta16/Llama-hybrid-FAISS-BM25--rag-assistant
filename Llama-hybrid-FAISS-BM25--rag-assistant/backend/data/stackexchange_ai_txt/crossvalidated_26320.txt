For data point $x$ your SVM calculates decision value $d$ in the following way: d If $d > 0$ then label of $x$ is $+1$, else it's $-1$. You can also get labels or decision values for data matrix newdata by saying predict(m, newdata) or predict(m, newdata, decision.values = TRUE) Be cautious when using SVM from package e1071, see Problem with e1071 libsvm? question. Several other SVM packages for R are kernlab, klaR and svmpath, see this overview: Support Vector Machines in R by A. Karatzoglou and D. Meyer.
