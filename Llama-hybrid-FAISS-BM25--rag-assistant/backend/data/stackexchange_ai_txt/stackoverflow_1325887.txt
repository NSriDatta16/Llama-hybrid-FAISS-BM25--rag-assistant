Trusted Sites is strictly an IE feature and has no effect on the execution at the RP. So I suspect the RP is sending the instruction to redirect to the user agent. Fiddler can confirm or refute this. If IE has a 'feature' that breaks redirecting from a trusted site to an untrusted site, then I'm not sure there's anything the RP can do about that. Incidentally, StackOverflow uses DotNetOpenId (predecessor to DotNetOpenAuth), so the fact that you say it's working for you suggests there's something different about your configuration that perhaps you can control to fix. Update : Win7 RC had a bug in IE8 and Win7 RTM has the fix. If you're running RC, sit tight for RTM to be available. You may also retry this scenario on any other RTM Windows operation system and IE browser.
