ActiveScaffold: How to create a drop-down select for polymorphic association?

I'm trying to create a drop-down select box for a polymorphic association with ActiveScaffold. I have: class Award belongs_to :sponsorship, :polymorphic => :true end class Organization has_many :awards, :as => :sponsorship end class Individual has_many :awards, :as => :sponsorship end While trying to create a select drop-down box in awards_controller with: config.columns[:sponsorship].form_ui = :select I get the following error: ActionView::TemplateError (uninitialized constant Award::Sponsorship) I'm not sure if it's something I'm not doing right or what I'm trying to accomplish not directly supported in AS. Would really appreciate some advice.
