Is ARIMA appropriate for time series prediction involving a mix of explanatory and independent variables?

I have a table with the following columns: Date(Month,Year), Sold_Past_Month, Quantity_Available, Quantity_Shipping_In, Missed_Sales, Quantity_Needed Quantity_Needed is the dependent variable that is numerical. I want to predict Quantity_Needed and train a model using the columns mentioned above; however, I also want Quantity_Needed to train the model. I have data from the past 5 years -> so I would have roughly 60 rows of data for one item. Is it possible to use ARIMA for this? If it is, what should I do next to build my model?
