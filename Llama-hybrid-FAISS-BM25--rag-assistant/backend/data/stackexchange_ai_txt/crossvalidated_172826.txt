Some notes on the topic The R package VGAM in the cumulative command (Ordinal Regression with Cumulative Probabilities) allows to change the proportional odds assumptions, with the option parallel=FALSE . It is known to be a common problem (from the book: Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata, Second Edition, By J. Scott Long, Jeremy Freese) "A Caveat regarding the parallel regression assumption: We find that the parallel regression assumption (PRA) is frequently violated. When this is rejected alternatives models that do not impose the constraint of parallel regressions should be considered. Violation of the PRA is not rationale for usig OLS regression since the assumptions implied by the application of the LRM to ordinal data are even stronger. Alternative models that can be considered include models for nominal outcomes [...] Stereotype Logistic model or Stereotype ordered model; the Generalized Ordered Logit model; the continuation Ratio model, are alternatives" (page 221) This paper goes in depth in this topic, being clear and well written, but it does not consider the VGAM package or the "cumulative" command: Ordinal logistic regression in epidemiological studies
