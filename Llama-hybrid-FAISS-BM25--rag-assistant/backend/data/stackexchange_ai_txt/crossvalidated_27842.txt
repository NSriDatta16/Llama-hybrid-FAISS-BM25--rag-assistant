It's OK to call them error bars , but as they're asymmetric they are not representing the standard error so it's not correct to talk about 'lower/upper standard error'. I assume the error bars here represent confidence intervals , though they might also be credible intervals if they were constructed using Bayesian methods. Hard to be sure if you're not going to tell us where you got this graph from.
