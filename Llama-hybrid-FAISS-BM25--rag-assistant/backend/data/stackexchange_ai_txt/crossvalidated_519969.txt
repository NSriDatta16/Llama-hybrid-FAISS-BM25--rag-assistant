Create Fitness score/highscore with multiple variables

I am currently building a Neural network( + genetic algorithms) that learns to fly a 2D drone to a target. My goal is that it achieve all tasks as fast a possible but I want the drone to also fly stable and upright. the way I tried to calculate fitness was to create a function that has the greatest value when the drone does everything I want right. fitness += 1/distToTarget + cos(drone_angle) my current inputs are: difference_target_X difference_target_Y velocity_X velocity_Y angular_velocity (degree per second) drone_angle | = 0; |_ = 90 _| = -90 output (i don't think it is important but:) left_thruster_angle left_thruster_boost right_thruster_angle right_thruster_boost The NN is programed in unity and the drone uses a 2D Rigidbody and the NN adds a force to the thruster at the right angle. How do I get the drone to set the best weights to fulfill all tasks: fly stable, fly fast, fly to the target ? thanks in advance
