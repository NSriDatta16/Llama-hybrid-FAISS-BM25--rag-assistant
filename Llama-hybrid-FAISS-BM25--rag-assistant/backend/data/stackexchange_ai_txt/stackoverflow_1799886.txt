Are master pages the way to go?

I may be nuts, but master pages scare me because I fear that once I am locked into using a master page, I will encounter a situation where I will want to inherit only 90% of the visual content of the master page, forcing me to break the inheritance and thus having to reproduce the content that was in the master and bring it into the child. I sense that this is a problem with any kind of "inheritance" in that you have to be careful, but it seems that at least you can override methods in a regular class. I'm probably not too coherent here, but user controls seem to give you more flexibility. The only draw back is that you have to drag them onto a webform. To that, I say big deal. Converting my app from using usercontrols to master pages is scaring me and I am afraid that my Javascript will break. Comments?
