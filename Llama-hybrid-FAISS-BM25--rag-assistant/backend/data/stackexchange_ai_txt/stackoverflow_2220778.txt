How to create a Macro/Snippet/HTML Fragment/Named section in JSP without using tags/includes/JSPFragments?

This might be a very newbie question, but I didn't find anything satisfying I want to do somethign like this in JSP (out of the box preferably): e.g. in a file called products.jsp an imaginary implementation that explains what I want Product: ${product.name} price: ${product.price} and later on use this in various location in the same JSP it is defined I've looked into JSP tags , and JSP Fragements , but there the fragment snippet is just passed from the caller JSP to the JSP tag, and I want it to be in the same location Is the only solution is to craete a JSP tag for that specific small snippet (or include?) Am I missing something very basic?
