Martin Fowler had an article on the benefits of Continuous Integration . It will take some time to set up an automated build. On the last project I introduced CI into it took one developer a day to get things working then about a week to have everything fine-tuned. There are so many benefits that it is hard to list them all, but here are the ones that have helped us: Encourages frequent integration - helps everyone stays on the same page Automated tests - every time someone checks in makes sure that issues are dealt with early Automatic deployment - one click and in minutes the latest version of our software is on all the servers For me, the biggest change was the last. It turned an hour-long process that was prone to errors (Did you remember do update the remoting version number? Oh crap...) into a 5 minute process that we could rollback if something went wrong. When I was learning to set up CI, this article by Carol Lotz was infinitely helpful. It walks through, step-by-step setting up a complicated project.
