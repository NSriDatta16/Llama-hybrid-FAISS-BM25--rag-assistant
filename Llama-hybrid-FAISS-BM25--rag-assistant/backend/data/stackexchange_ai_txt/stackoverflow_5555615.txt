Average Case Complexity of a function

What is the average case complexity of the following function given that the input is a set of independent uniform natural numbers. def d(a): for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0 or a[i] == 1: for j in range(i+1, len(a)): if not (a[j] == 0 or a[j] == 1): swap(a, i, j) break What do you think, how to approach this problem in mathematical terms?
