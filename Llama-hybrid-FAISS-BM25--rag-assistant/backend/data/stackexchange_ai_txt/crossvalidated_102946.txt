A standard feed forward network is conceptually not meant to generate samples. It is a discriminative model. There are, however, generative models like restricted Boltzmann machines that allow you to generate samples. That being said, it's not completely impossible to get something sample-like from a feed forward neural network. You could fix the output of the model and also keep all the weights fixed and then optimize for the inputs. If it's a binary classifier, dog=1 vs not-dog=0, you could fix the output to one and do your usual backprop-gradient descent but instead of optimizing the weights you only optimize for the network's input. That will give you input values that will lead to a high score for the classifier and if the network was trained properly it might look like a dog. Maybe you can get some inspiration from Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks by Zeiler et al.
