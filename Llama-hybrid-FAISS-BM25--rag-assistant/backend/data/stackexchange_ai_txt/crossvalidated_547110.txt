Is there a method/package that combines multivariate and network meta-analysis?

If you want to perform a meta-analysis on the general strength of the population and where each study can offer multiple outcomes (for example, measuring strength through deadlift capability and/or the number of push-ups someone can do), you normally use a multivariate meta-analysis (for example the rma.mv function in the R package metafor ). If you, on the other hand, want to perform a meta-analysis on how different drugs affect strength and where each study can offer results from one or many different type of treatments (for example, drug A, drug B, and/or drug C), you normally use a network meta-analysis (for example, the netmeta function in the R package netmeta ). However, what do you do if you want to performa a meta-analysis on how different drugs affect strength and where each study can offer results from one or many different type of treatments as well as well as multiple outcomes (for example, effectiveness of drug A, drug B, and/or drug C, measured through deadlift capability and/or the number of push-ups someone can do)? I have searched high and low for a statistical method and/or package that combines the two approaches described above into one, but so far, I've come up short. My question is meant to be as general as possible with the concrete examples only placed there for clarity. So, in the example above, you could probably perform two network meta-analyses, one for each type of outcome. However, this might not always be possible to do, for example if the different type of outcomes are hard to cluster into comparable groups (and where you only assume that they, with enough study, will average out to something comparable, just as you do in a multivariate meta-analysis).
