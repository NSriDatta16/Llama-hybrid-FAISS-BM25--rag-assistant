AFAIK that's a bit tricky, because CMake, more precisely the find_library command, prefers shared libs and finds those if both shared and static are available. I'm still looking for a good solution myself to be able to compile binaries "as static as possible", but I've found no elegant solution yet. The only way it would surely work is to implement everything through custom FindXXXX modules.
