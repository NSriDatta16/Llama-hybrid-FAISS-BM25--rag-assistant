ASP.NET: How to initialize when *user control* is initially loaded

I have an ASP.NET user control that I'm embedding in another user control. This works fine. I need to know the best logic/method for detecting when the control is loaded. In other words, I have some display initialization logic that needs to run when the control is initially displayed. Surely there is a pattern for this. The typical method is to put (!IsPostBack) logic in the Page_Load method of the control. This works great until you end up with a state when the Parent page has already posted back many times. My user control gets added to the page but its display does not intialize properly. I'm hoping to find a way that keeps this logic inside the control, versus various hacking around in the codebehind of the parent page.
