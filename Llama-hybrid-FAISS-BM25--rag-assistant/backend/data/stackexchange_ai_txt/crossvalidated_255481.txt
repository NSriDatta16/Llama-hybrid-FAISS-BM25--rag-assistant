Conducting analyses with participants who contribute varying amounts of data?

I have data from approximately 200,000 people all of whom do a task at least once, and I record the time it takes them to complete the task. They can complete the tasks in one of two ways (method A or method B). Most people choose to use method B, but some use method A, and some use both (considering most people repeat the task a number of times). If I wanted to determine whether one method was more efficient (or faster) than the other method, is it okay to stick to parametric statistical measures given the following qualities of the data? The number of data that each person contributes varies due to there being no limit to the amount of times each person repeats the tasks. Thus, for example, one person might contribute 50 trials (trials referring to one repeat of the task) using method B and 20 trials using method A. Another person might contribute 1 trial of method A and 1 of method B. Another person might contribute 10 trials of only method B. If I averaged all the trials per method for every person, and then conducted a within-subject t-test according to method used, then method A will be much more variable than method B. One workaround I have considered is to remove any people who did not contribute data to both methods, and to randomly remove data from each person until their number of trials for each method are equal (thus equal variance between methods). The unfortunate consequence of this is that the vast majority of people end up having only a single trial for each method remaining (because most people, if they contribute to both methods, only use method A one time). Is this still an okay workaround to use if I am restraining myself to a parametric approach? Or am I thinking too much and do not need to resort to removing data at all? This also still does not get around the possible problem that people who contribute more trials to both methods are left with an average that is less variable than those who contribute one trial to both.
