Library routine for rolling window lag 1 autocorrelation?

I am looking for a library routine that will calculate the lag 1 autocorrelation of a time series with a rolling window; meaning "slide a window of size N points along the time series, calculate the lag 1 autocorrelation for each window." I have implemented an algorithm inspired by Wikipedia but would like something to compare the results with. Is the mentioned routine available in for example R or Python?
