Moving Plone sites in the ZMI isn't actually supported. It's unfortunately still possible to do this in the UI. Various internal data structures inside the Plone site will break as a result of this. For example all catalogs will have invalid data (which can be fixed by reindexing the entire site) but also data structures inside the automatic redirection machinery will break without an easy way to fix them. Also adding Plone sites anywhere except in the Zope root is generally discouraged. We are likely to disallow any nested folder structures in a future Plone version.
