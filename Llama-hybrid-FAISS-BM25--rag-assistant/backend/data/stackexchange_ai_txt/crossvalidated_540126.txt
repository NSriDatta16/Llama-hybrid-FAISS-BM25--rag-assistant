Moran's test using residuals of linear mixed effect model

A follow up question to Moran's test using the residuals of logistic regression Is this doable on linear mixed effects models (lme)? I want to use Moran's I to determine if accounting for correlation structure removes the spatial autocorrelation of my model residuals.
