you can't use any statements within a port map, port maps are only used to bind ports to signals (or ports of the enclosing hierarchy): : port map( => , ... ) What you can do instead is delaying the assignment of sigand0 to f(0): module1: a_n_d port map( x(0) => x(0), y(0) => x(1), f => sigand0); f(0) Hope that helps!
