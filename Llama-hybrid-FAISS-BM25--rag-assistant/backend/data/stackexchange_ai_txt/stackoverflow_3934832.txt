How do I bind a SQL bit field to a True/False combobox or listbox?

I store True/False values as bit fields in SQL Server. The fields are nullable. What is the XAML syntax to bind a bit field to a WPF combo box so the user can choose True/False or blank (null)? By the way, I'm binding to a strongly-typed dataset/datatable. Drag and drop binding has simplified binding to other datatypes. I certainly don't mind editing the XAML, but I'm wondering if drag and drop can be made to work in this scenario?
