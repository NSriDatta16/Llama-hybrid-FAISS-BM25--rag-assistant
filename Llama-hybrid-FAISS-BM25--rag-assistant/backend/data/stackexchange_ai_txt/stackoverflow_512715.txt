Question: what sort of VCS are you using? Your comment that your boss complained when you left code checked out over a vacation seems odd. I always have code checked out, using Subversion, and nobody cares. If you use a VCS that requires reserved checkouts, or you are required to fake reserved checkouts, you're incapable of using best practices, and your organization should upgrade to Subversion or better. This may well not be up to you, but if you are using an antique VCS, that could affect the answers being given.
