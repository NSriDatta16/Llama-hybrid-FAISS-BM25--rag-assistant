Fine-tuning a Pre-trained model (Resnet50) do I need to validate it or just train it?

When fine-tuning a Resnet50 model should I do the standard train validation split and train like any normal CNN or should I just do the training and not the validation if I am going to use this model as a base model in another more advanced model? I think I will need to do the train/val split but wanted to get a good answer for this from other people as I have seen on Github people just training with no validation. Thanks for all the input.
