Obviously, the specification should be complete, consistent and comprehensible. IMO it should also be well-organized, in that it keeps all requirements for a specific part of the product together. I've more than once read specifications where requirements for some module were scattered throughout the whole document, e.g. the general description is in chapter 4, but additional requirements can found in clauses in chapters 2, 5, 7 and appendix B. To work with such a specification, I first have to create a cross-reference map of requirements to modules.
