What's the most practical way to have "functions in a dictionary" in Java?

When programming with C/C++ or Python I sometimes used to have a dictionary with references to functions according to the specified keys. However, I don't really know how to have the same -- or at the very least similar -- behavior in Java allowing me dynamic key-function (or method, in Java slang) association. Also, I did find the HashMap technique somebody suggested, but is that seriously the best and most elegant way? I mean, it seems like a lot to create a new class for every method I want to use. I'd really appreciate every input on this.
