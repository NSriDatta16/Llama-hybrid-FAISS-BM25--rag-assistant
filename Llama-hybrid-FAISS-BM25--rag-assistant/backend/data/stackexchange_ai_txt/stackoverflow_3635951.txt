Okay. I have been thinking about this some time now, and the following approach seems to work for me :) I have configured the left tree as this: listeners: { beforenodedrop: function (dropEvent) { // Does this node come from the right tree? if (dropEvent.source.tree.id !== dropEvent.tree.id) { // The node should be discarded. dropEvent.dropNode.parentNode.removeChild(dropEvent.dropNode, true); // The node has been discarded, return drop succeeded. dropEvent.dropStatus = true; return false; } return true; }, nodedragover: function (dragevent) { // If the node comes from the right tree, it is allowed to be dropped here. if (dragevent.source.tree.id !== dragevent.tree.id) { return true; } // A node from this tree is not allowed to be dropped. return false; } } The right tree is configured like this: listeners: { beforenodedrop: function (dropEvent) { // Does this node come from the left tree? if (dropEvent.source.tree.id !== dropEvent.tree.id) { // The node should be cloned and inserted in the right tree. // Copy the node. var node = dropEvent.dropNode; // the node that was dropped var nodeCopy = new Ext.tree.TreeNode( // copy it Ext.apply({}, node.attributes) ); // Match the id's. nodeCopy.id = Ext.id(null,'newnode') + '_' + node.id; // Find the right place to put it. if (dropEvent.target.parentNode === dropEvent.tree.getRootNode()) { // The node is placed on a folder, thus drop it there. dropEvent.target.appendChild(nodeCopy); } else { // The node is placed inside a folder, thus place it in there. dropEvent.target.parentNode.appendChild(nodeCopy); } // The node has been dropped, return okay and stop further process. dropEvent.dropStatus = true; return false; } // Just use the normal builtin drag and drop. return true; } } Both trees has been set to enable Drag'n'Drop: enableDD: true All leaf nodes have the following configuration: allowDrop: true, draggable: true All folders are set to: allowDrop: true, draggable: false The conclusion is, that I have chosen to override some of the builtin drag'n'drop methods in the treepanel while still maintaining the builtin functionality.
