The obvious answer to an imprecise question is that, if all mixing probabilities $\pi_k$ are equal, they all equal $1/K$ and hence do not need to be estimated. If one is using the EM algorithm this removes one term in the $M$-step. If one is using a Gibbs sampler for Bayesian estimation there is one less distribution to simulate from..
