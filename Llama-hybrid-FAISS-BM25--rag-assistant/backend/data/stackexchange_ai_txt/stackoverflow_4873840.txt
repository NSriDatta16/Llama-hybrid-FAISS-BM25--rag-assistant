Storing file information in a database

I am building a file hosting site and would like to keep track of users file quota ( Each user is only allowed 2gb of file storage). Could anyone explain how I could store file name, type and importantly size of all files uploaded by a user in a mysql database. And is it possible to calculate using php script or MySQL when users exceed limit, display a message and reject any further uploads until files have been deleted by them to reduce quota? I am fairly new to mySQl and would really appreciate some simple guides on how to achieve this. Thanks R
