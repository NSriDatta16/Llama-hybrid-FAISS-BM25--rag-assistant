Proof of Markov Chain property

Suppose that $X_n$ is a Markov Chain.Then for $m,n \in N$ such that $m $Pr[X_n=j_n|X_m=j_m,X_{m-1}=j_{m-1},...=X_0=j_0]=Pr[X_n=j_n|X_m=j_m]$ When proving for n=3,m=1 case we have to show that $Pr[X_3=j_3|X_1=j_1,X_0=j_0]=Pr[X_3=j_3|X_1=j_1] $ I don't understand the following step. $Pr[X_3=j_3|X_1=j_1 and X_0=j_0]= \sum_{j_2}Pr[(X_3=j_3)\cap (X_2=j_2)|(X_1=j_1)\cap(X_0=j_0)]$ I don't understand how this $j_2$ terms are brought in and why?
