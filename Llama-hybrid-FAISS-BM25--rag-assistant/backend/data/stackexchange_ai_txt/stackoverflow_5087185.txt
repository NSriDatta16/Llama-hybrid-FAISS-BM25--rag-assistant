You're imagining there's something called an "Application" but that's an illusion. Your application is just a collection of Activities, Services, Receivers, etc. If you look at the intent-filter tags in your manifest, you'll see that each icon in the home screen is associated with a filter like this: You can put that same chunk of XML on both of your Activities, and you'll get two icons in the home screen, one that always launches Activity A, and one that always launches Activity B. What you may want to do instead is create a master Activity that launches one of the other Activities based on the shared state. As for where to actually store the shared state, that depends on how complex your state is. This is a good place to start: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html
