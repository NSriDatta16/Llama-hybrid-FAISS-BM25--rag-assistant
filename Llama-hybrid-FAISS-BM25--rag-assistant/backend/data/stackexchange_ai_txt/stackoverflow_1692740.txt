Instead of TableB , why don't you create a view ? ( Warning: I never used Firebird and I don't know how well it supports views). Such view will be something like: create view Totals (SumX, SumY) as select SUM(FieldX), SUM(FieldY) from TableA group by ID Every time TableA will be changed, such view ( Totals ) will be updated automatically. A decent DBMS will do a good job at optimizing this: it will recalculate enough of Totals only when TableA is changed, unlike your TableB , which will be recalculated every time is queried (I presume by your performance problems - to be sure one needs to know Firebird internals). Totals will be like any other table (but read-only); you will filter information with something like: select * from Totals where ID = ... P.S.: Walter Mitty brought to my attention in comments below what I assumed about your original solution, i.e. that TableA : must be in (at least) First Normal Form (1NF) - otherwise one does not have guaranteed correct results for relational operations ( nota bene: one must know your application requirements and conceptual/logical design in detail - which is impractical to acquire in a forum/via indirect communication - to spot eventual problems in a not completely normalized design, such us insert/delete/update anomalies; a good book on DB theory will spare you headaches and unfortunately such books are few); it is properly indexed (at least on ID). It is unfortunate that SQL-based DBMSes require such physical design details from users to have decent performances, it is contrary to what a DBMS is supposed to be good at (it has all the information needed to do a good job automatically, i.e. ownership of physical data structures and data access path statistics).
