Unrealistically High R squared value of 1 (and low RMSE of zero)

I am working on a regression problem of load prediction (where I try to estimate next hour consumption using previuous consumption values). At first I had relatively poor perfromance, however when I added features like consumption_rolling average and temprature) I managed to get an R^2 of 1 and RMSE value of zero using a linear regression model (A random forest regressor had a very close perfromance, R^2 almost 0.98) Now obviously this is an unrealistically hight R squared bascially no error. But I am not sure where could I have went wrong to achieve an RMSE value of 0? To double check my results I ran my experiment in two different environments Microsoft Machine learning Studio local machine using sklearn linear_model (python) My sample size is 7640 record (with 0.75 non randomized split) ( P.S. I am coming from a CS background) Update (In response to comments) Scatter Plot: Energy consumption (label) vs. rolling_energy (window of 3) Scatter Plot: Energy consumption vs rolling temprature (window of 3)
