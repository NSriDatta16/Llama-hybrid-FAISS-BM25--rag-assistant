$\chi^2$ test for significance of a logistic regression?

From "Thirty Years Training Rural Physicians" by Wendling et al. in Academic Medicine ( https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/FullText/2016/01000/Thirty_Years_Training_Rural_Physicians__Outcomes.34.aspx ): The overall logistic regression model including factors impacting rural practice choice was statistically significant, $\chi^2(4, N = 2,344) = 142.3$ , $P . I'm struggling to understand what is actually being tested here with this $\chi^2$ test statistic. Is this supposed to be some sort of a deviance test?
