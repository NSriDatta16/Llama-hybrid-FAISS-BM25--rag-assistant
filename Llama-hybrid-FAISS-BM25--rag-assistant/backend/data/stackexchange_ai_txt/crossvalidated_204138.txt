autoencoders can be used to learn features from an input vector. one more more layers can be used to learn a mapping between the input vector and itself. Thereby learning new ways(features) to represent the original information. There is a substantial amount of literature on autoencoders that you could easily find if that suits your need. This link shows how to extract features using autoencoders http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/
