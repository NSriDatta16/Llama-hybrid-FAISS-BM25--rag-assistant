two infragistics controls on same line

My ASPX code is: Remove I want it to render that top-level span all in the same line/row. However infragistics renders that out into a bunch of tables and divs, some greyed out in firebug ... ... Remove which renders out into 3 lines (one for each of two IG controls, one for my Remove span) How do I make all this generated HTML into the same line?
