The documentation is currently somewhat fragmented. To get you started, take a look at the ReSharper Extensibility Guide which I think targets version 4.5 but is still a good start. As the other poster mentioned, Hadi Hariri's blog is a good source for finding information on ReSharper plugin writing. Also, check out the ReSharper PowerToys for some sample code. Finally, there are (very few, as yet) articles on ReSharper 6 plugin development available here . More content will be added soon.
