What topic does a "selection" algorithm fall under?

I am looking to develop a simple algorithm that is given a set of 10 vectors for a year from which to predict the "winner". This will be a supervised task where the algorithm will be trained with 20 years of data and thus will know the 20 winners. My question is: what topic or style of machine learning algorithm is this? I am new to machine learning and planning to research more on this style/task before I begin to develop my algorithm.
