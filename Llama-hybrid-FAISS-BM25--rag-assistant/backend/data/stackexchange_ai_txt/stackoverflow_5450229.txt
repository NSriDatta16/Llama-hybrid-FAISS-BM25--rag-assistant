qemu vs qemu-kvm: some performance measurements

I conducted the following benchmark in qemu and qemu-kvm, with the following configuration: CPU: AMD 4400 process dual core with svm enabled, 2G RAM Host OS: OpenSUSE 11.3 with latest Patch, running with kde4 Guest OS: FreeDos Emulated Memory: 256M Network: Nil Language: Turbo C 2.0 Benchmark Program: Count from 0000000 to 9999999. Display the counter on the screen by direct accessing the screen memory (i.e. 0xb800:xxxx) It only takes 6 sec when running in qemu. But it takes 89 sec when running in qemu-kvm. I ran the benchmark one by one, not in parallel. I scratched my head the whole night, but still not idea why this happens. Would somebody give me some hints?
