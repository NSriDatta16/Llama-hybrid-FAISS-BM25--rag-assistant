It really depends on how you're going to use it. Databases can handle more entries in a table than most people think, especially with proper indexing. On the other hand, if you aren't going to be making use of the functionality that a relational database provides, there might not be much reason to use it. Ok, enough generalizing. Given that a database eventually boils down to "files on disk" anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about what "the right thing to do" is. If the primary purpose of the database is just to efficiently retrieve these files, I think it would be perfectly fine to keep the DB entries small and look up file paths instead of actual data - especially since your file system should be pretty efficient at retrieving data given a specific location. In case you're interested, this is actually a common data storage pattern for search engines - the index will store the indexed data and a pointer to the stored data on disk, rather than storing everything in the index.
