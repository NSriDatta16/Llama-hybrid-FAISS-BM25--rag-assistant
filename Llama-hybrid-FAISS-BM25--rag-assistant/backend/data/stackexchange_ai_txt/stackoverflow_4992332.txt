What you need is an exact case of Transform Feedback (TF): you want to get the transformed vertices back. That's perfectly fine for today's OpenGL. Here are the instructions to use it: Create a shader (with only vertex components) that performs necessary vertex transformation. Call glTransformFeedbackVaryings before linking tell GL about your varying outputs in a shader you want to record. Prepare a VBO to store result. Before doing TF, call glBindBufferBase to tell GL about the storage for resulting values. When doing TF, call glBeginTransformFeedback() and record a query of type GL_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN.
