I've never designed Monopoly rules (too easy, methinks), but I have dabbled in writing engines for other well-known games for personal pleasure and with the understanding that all of this is an academic exercise. The two games I tried to model (and continue to try) are D&D and M:tG . With D&D, the emphasis is on very good OO design - making classes and class hierarchies that make sense. With M:tG, you basically realize that the straight OO paradigm is incomplete for this sort of thing. You end up then working with agents, event brokers, and creating really complicated rulesets. It's all fairly meaningless unless you're a game designer. Good fun, though.
