Getting profiling results with VS2010: C# API vs vsperfcmd

This post has the info about how to run profiler as the following batch file vsperfcmd /start:coverage /output:run.coverage hello vsperfcmd /shutdown into C# code // A guid is used to keep track of the run Guid myrunguid = Guid.NewGuid(); Monitor m = new Monitor(); m.StartRunCoverage(myrunguid, "run.coverage"); // TODO: Launch some tests or something // that can exercise myassembly.exe // Complete the run m.FinishRunCoverage(myrunguid); For the TODO: part, I used this code p = new Process(); p.StartInfo.FileName = "hello.exe"; p.Start(); p.WaitForExit(); // Look at return code â€“ 0 for success if (p.ExitCode != 0) { Console.Error.WriteLine("Error in profiling"); System.Environment.Exit( -3 ); } The code runs fine, but I can't the profiled result I did with running batch file. This is the result from running batch file which has all the info. This is the result from C# code which doesn't have profiled info, but only schema What might be wrong?
