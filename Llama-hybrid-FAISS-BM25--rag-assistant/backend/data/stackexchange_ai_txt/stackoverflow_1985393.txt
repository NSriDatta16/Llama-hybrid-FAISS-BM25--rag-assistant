What you are describing is exactly what NSFetchedResultsController was designed for, and is one of the huge advantages of using Core Data on the iPhone. With NSFetchedResultsController, you can set up a fetch request from your database for the elements to be displayed in your table view, and limit the batch size of items to be loaded at any given time. This significantly reduces memory consumption and loading time (I've seen 8X improvements in loading time in specific examples). NSFetchedResultsController was designed to be integrated with a UITableView. For specific examples, I'd consult Apple's sample code, such as their CoreDataBooks one, as well as the appropriate sections in Marcus Zarra's Core Data book and the Pragmatic Programmers' iPhone SDK Development book . Both of those books have very good explanations of the core concepts.
