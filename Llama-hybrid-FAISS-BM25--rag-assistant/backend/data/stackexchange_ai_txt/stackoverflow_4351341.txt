how to read properties from GWT host page?

What's the best way to read properties from the GWT host page? I'm trying to find a simple way to embed properties into the host page and access them from Java. It seems like Dictionary is the recommended way to go, but it's somewhat fragile in that your dictionary must exist in the host page, or it errors with MissingResourceException . Similarly, Dictionary.get() will throw a resource error if the key you request does not exist. I'm writing a library, and I'd prefer a more robust solution that won't error out if the user doesn't specify the dictionary or key. Should I just catch exceptions thrown by the Dictionary and return null? Is there a more robust way to do this? EDIT : at the moment, I'm using the following: protected Dictionary dict; public ClientConfiguration(String configName) { try { dict = Dictionary.getDictionary(configName); } catch (MissingResourceException e) { dict = null; } } public String getString(String key) { return dict == null ? null : dict.keySet().contains(key) ? dict.get(key) : null; }
