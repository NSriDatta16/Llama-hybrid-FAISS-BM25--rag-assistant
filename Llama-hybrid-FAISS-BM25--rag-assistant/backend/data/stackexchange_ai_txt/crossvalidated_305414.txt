Multiclass Summary Metrics in R's Caret when predicting Probabilities

It's not clear to me, how the different summary metrics for caret's train function are defined, when I predict probabilities of a multiclass problem. Without a loss of generality, assume that I use a random forest to produce probabilities: library(caret) data(iris) control = trainControl(method="CV", number=5,verboseIter = TRUE,classProbs=TRUE) # iv) tuning parameter grid = expand.grid(mtry = 1:3) rf_gridsearch = train(y=iris[,5],x=iris[-5],method="ranger", num.trees=2000, tuneGrid=grid, trControl=control) rf_gridsearch # Output: .... mtry Accuracy Kappa 1 0.9600000 0.94 2 0.9666667 0.95 3 0.9666667 0.95 Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. The final value used for the model was mtry = 2. For the binary case I know how to compute the AUC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic So my questions are: How is the Accuracy computed for mutliclass prediction? (How is it condensed to a single value) Why is mtry=2 chosen, even if mtry=3 is equivalent according to the Accuracy? Why isn't it possible to compute the RMSE for a classification problem? (Throwing the error "Error: Metric RMSE not applicable for classification models" if metric="RMSE" is used. Furthermore, for multiclass prediction the RMSE is still defined - other then the AUC.) Since, the Brier Score is simply the MSE (for 2 classes), why not allowing to use the RMSE for probability predictions? Many thanks in advance!
