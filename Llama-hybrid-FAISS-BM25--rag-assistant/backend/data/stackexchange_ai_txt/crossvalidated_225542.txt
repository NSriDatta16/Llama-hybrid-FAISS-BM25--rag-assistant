This is the sort of question considered in the field of psychometrics , the study of mental measurement. Measures of worker performance in particular are often considered in industrial-organizational psychology . Many of the criticisms mentioned here, by you and others, seem on the money. A broader issue is that no studies seem to have been conducted to estimate the ratings' (or rankings') reliability and validity, which are two qualities that any good mental test should have. Reliability is the degree to which the test gives consistent results when the thing it is measuring is consistent, and various subtypes of reliability such as retest reliability and parallel-forms reliability can be assessed directly. An unreliable test is one that is too noisy to provide useful measurements. Validity is a quality of a test specific to an intended use of the test, which concerns how accurate it is for the intended use; for example, how well it predicts whether a customer will use the service again. The methods of assessing validity are as wide and varied as the uses of mental tests. But in any case, a test that lacks validity for a specific use is too inaccurate to be useful. Could these ratings and rankings be reliable and valid? They might be, but unless we check, we don't know, and any test put to a high-stakes purpose, such as controlling what jobs workers can take, doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt.
