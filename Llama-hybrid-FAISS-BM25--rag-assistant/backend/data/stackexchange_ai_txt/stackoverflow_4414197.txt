Practical Limit on number of Azure Shared Access Signatures?

I'm looking to avoid having to use a handler/module in my Webrole to protect images being served up from Block Blob storage on Azure. Shared Access Signatures (SAS) seems to be the way to go. My question, is there a practical limit on the number of SAS I can issue - Could I issue one every 1 minute, say? Is there a performance issue (time to issue SAS) that would be the limiting factor? I had initially thought that one SAS per user session would protect me better than a single SAS, but since there is nothing tying a SAS to a user, that won't help...
