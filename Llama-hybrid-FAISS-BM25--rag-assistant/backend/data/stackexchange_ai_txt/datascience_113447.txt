How to increase the accuracy of 1 class

Hai I am working with blood transfusion data set using SVM classifier.I applied SVC with C=17 and kernel rbf. It is highly imbalanced data set and I balanced it using SMOTE. But class 1 is performing very bad and no prediction in that class. How can I improve this? from sklearn.svm import SVC rbf_svc = SVC(C=17) rbf_svc.fit(X_train,y_train) y_predict = rbf_svc.predict(X_test) print('Model accuracy score with rbf kernel and C=17 : {0:0.4f}'. format(accuracy_score(y_test, y_predict))) Result is: Model accuracy score with rbf kernel and C=17 : 0.7361 print(classification_report(y_test,y_predict)) 0 0.74 1.00 0.85 106 1 0.00 0.00 0.00 38 accuracy 0.74 144 macro avg 0.37 0.50 0.42 144 weighted avg 0.54 0.74 0.62 144
