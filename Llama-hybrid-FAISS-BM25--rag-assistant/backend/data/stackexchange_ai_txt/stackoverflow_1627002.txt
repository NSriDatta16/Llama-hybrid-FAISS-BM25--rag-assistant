don't confuse data organisation inside your program and data organisation for serialization: they do not have the same goal. for streaming across a network, you have to consider both side of the channel, the sending and the receiving side: how does the receiving side differentiate between a DataPoint and an ArrayOfThese ? how does the receiving side know how many ArrayOfThese are appended after a DataPoint ? (also to consider: what is the byte ordering of each side ? does data types have the same size in memory ?) personally, i think you need a different structure for streaming your data, in which you add the number of DataPoint you are sending as well as the number of ArrayOfThese after each DataPoint. i would also not care about the way data is already organized in my program and reorganize/reformat to suit my protocol and not my program. after that writing a function for sending and another for receiving is not a big deal.
