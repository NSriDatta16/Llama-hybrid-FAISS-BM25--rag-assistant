Random forest regression, back transformation of the dependent variable

I'm fitting a random forest regression model on consumption data. This model give me better results if I use log(consumption expenditure) instead of consumption expenditure as dependent variable. When I try to do a prediction I obtain very poor results if I do the Exp of predicted values. I haven't find any type of correction that I can do... Any one know a precedure that can I applied to correct the baias that arraise from the back trasfomration? Thanks.
