Java Web Framework for Ajax-based UI

Background Looking to leverage an existing web framework to create a simple data-driven user interface. Problem The mock-up allows creating JasperReports Server domains. Creation of domains is based on a data dictionary comprised of Business Areas and Column Clusters. It works as follows: User selects one or more Business Areas. This causes the Column Cluster list to update (AJAX-style) with the available Column Clusters for the selected business areas. User selects one or more Column Clusters. User shuttles Column Clusters into Domain Content list. The user has two options: Create Domain and Upload Domain . Both buttons do the same thing: create an XML document based on the Domain Content list. Technologies Here are the technologies I am considering: Servlet. Means hand-crafting database queries and jQuery code. Grails. There is no writing to the database, though. JavaServer Faces. Quite bulky, but it has shuttles. Facelets. Integrates with RichFaces. Eclipse + JBoss + RichFaces. ??? Tapestry. ??? Requirements The fixed requirements: Apache Tomcat 6 Java PostgreSQL (JDBC) Firefox or Chrome No Struts No IE Constraints Other criterion to consider: Easily maintained by novice developers Easy to extend (add interactive widgets) Database model has already been designed and implemented Resources Websites that demonstrate potential solutions: http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=723 http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-richfaces/ Question What Java-based web framework would you recommend for this task?
