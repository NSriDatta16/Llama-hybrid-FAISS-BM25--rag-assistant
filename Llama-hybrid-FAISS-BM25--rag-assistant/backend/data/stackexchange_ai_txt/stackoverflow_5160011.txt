With a framework, an approach to your scenario (3) -- combining both methods -- is to use a view "partial". A partial is a fragment of a view that can be rendered on its own; a single view could be made up of several partials. In your case, you'd define a partial to render a review. When showing the page from scratch, the server-side code loops through existing reviews and calls the partial to render them one after the other. When a new review is added to the existing page, the javascript asks the server to render just the partial for that new review and return it as an Ajax response, and then appends it to the existing reviews on the page.
