If you unit test the elements forming the composition to demonstrate stand-alone correctness, then when testing the composed unit, you only need test the composed unit functionality and need not worry about the test coverage that applies to the composed elements. That is to say, if you test bottom-up there may be no problem regarding testability. When testing the composition elements, you stub the composed unit (with a test harness), not the other way around. Test of the composed units then uses the concrete units rather than stubs.
