I finally got where the error was coming from. The LSTM layer takes in an input of 3 dimensions from the Embedding layer as can be seen from the code above. But in my KerasTuner function, I had forgotten to include an Embedding layer before the LSTM layer which was the reason I was getting the above mentioned error!
