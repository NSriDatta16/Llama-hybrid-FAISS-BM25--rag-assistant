Can all statistical algorithms be parallelized using a Map Reduce framework

Is it correct to say that any statistical learning algorithm (linear/logistic regression, SVM, neural network, random forest) can be implemented inside a Map Reduce framework? Or are there restrictions? I guess there may be some algorithms that is not possible to parallelize?
