Gamma-gamma conjugacy for rate parameter of Gamma distribution

the question is as follows. Assume the shape $r$ is a known constant. For $x \sim$ Gamma(shape = $r$ , rate = $v$ ), the p.d.f is: $$p(x|r,v) = x^{r-1}e^{-vx}v^r/\Gamma(r)$$ a) Show that the $\theta \sim$ Gamma $(r_0, v_0)$ prior for $\theta$ is the conjugate prior for a Gamma( $r,\theta$ ) likelihood. Do this by finding the exact posterior distribution of $\theta|y,$ where $y=(y_1, y_2,...y_n)$ and each $y_i \sim$ Gamma $(r, \theta)$ . b) Generalize this conjugacy result to a more general multiplicative relationship. Assume $\theta \sim$ Gamma $(r_0, v_0)$ prior distribution. Now, the rate parameter of the likelihood is $c\theta$ , where $c$ is a known constant. That is, each $y_i \sim$ Gamma $(r, c\theta)$ . Find the exact form of the posterior distribution of $\theta|y$ which will now also involve $c$ . c) What choices of $r_0$ and $v_0$ will minimize the effect of the prior distribution on the posterior distribution? I'm unsure about how to solve this question. For part (a), how do I find the exact posterior distribution of $\theta|y$ , and proceed further? I thought the posterior distribution was likelihood times prior, but I'm not sure how that applies here, and how to show that the asked for prior is a conjugate prior for the Gamma likelihood. Similarly for part (b) and (c), I'm a bit confused as I'm new to Bayesian and proof-based Math. Would appreciate any detailed help - thank you in advance!
