Where to store configuration for a simple .NET application?

I'm programming a fairly simple application which I want to cut to just one simple EXE file + some data storage (XML for example). My question is regarding configuration files. Where to put those files? I saw a few applications that have just an EXE file (uTorrent, Media Player Classic - I can use them without any installation), but they store their config somewhere else. How to achieve this? How would you approach such situation? Is it better to try to achieve the thing I described above, or simply use a configuration file and data storage in the same directory as the EXE file?
