Is there a way to transform lcov's coverage info file to be used with one of Hudson's coverage plug-ins?

I am generating test code coverage using lcov (a graphical gcov tool extension). The code is compiled using Hudson and a Publish HTML plug-in is used to show results report per build. I lack a trend graphs available from other Hudson's coverage plug-ins. Is there a tool/project to transform lcov's coverage output to xml format compatible with e.g. Cobertura, Emma... etc.?
