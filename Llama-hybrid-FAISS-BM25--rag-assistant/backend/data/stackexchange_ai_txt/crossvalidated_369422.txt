What is "data distribution"? Does it Belong to Probability Space?

While reading the paper BEGAN : Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network the autor writes as following: "the generator $G(z)$ , which maps a sample $z$ from uniform distirubiton to the data distribution, and the discriminator $D(x)$ which determines if a sample $x$ belongs to the data distribution" I think I understood what they are trying to do.. and see the reproduced codes and its corresponding result too. But my question is pretty simple "What is data distribution?" More in detail, when we are talking about distribution, I consider it as a probability distribution. However, the problem is then does it mean every point of x which is all collected into a set to be a mathematical object has a predetermined probability which comprise a well-defined $PDF$ or it only comprise the $joint-PDF$ with given any well-known and well-defined distribution $z$ , such as Normal or Uniform etc. More formally, 1) Does PDF of $X$ exist? 2) or we have a $belief$ that JointPDF of $X\times Z$ exist? Hard for me to get to the very basic start of data science before understand the underlying rationals.
