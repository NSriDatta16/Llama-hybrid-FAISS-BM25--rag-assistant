Good overview of different algorithms: Computing pi ; Gauss-Legendre-Salamin . I'm not sure about the complexity claimed for the Gauss-Legendre-Salamin algorithm in the first link (I'd say O(N log^2(N) log(log(N)))). I do encourage you to try it, though, the convergence is really fast. Also, I'm not really sure about why trying to convert a quite simple procedural algorithm into a recursive one? Note that if you are interested in performance, then working at a bounded precision (typically, requiring a 'double', 'float',... output) does not really make sense, as the obvious answer in such a case is just to hardcode the value.
