Variance covariance matrix of parameters in logistic regression?

The given below image is taken from book Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis (Douglas C Montgomery) My apologies in advance for not typing , I just want to understand the concept. (1) First Question We are estimating the parameters in logistic regression by Maximum Likelihood Estimation concept. The thing I am not able to get in this image is - what is $n_{i}$ and how the expression is obtained.( Doubt already marked by violet arrow; the highlighted yellow expression is the same as in above equation.) $\ $ $\ $ (2) Second Question This $n_i$ expression is also involved in the variance of parameters(see below picture). But in these links - Link 1 and Link 2 , $n_i$ is not mentioned anywhere in the discussion. Could someone help me to understand this thing?
