Take it as a fact that no single book can satisfy your criteria. It depends on the depth of the concepts you want to go into. It also depends on what do you mean when you say statistical concepts. If by statistical concepts you mean distribution theory, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, Regression and other day to day statistics then Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger should be followed. If you want details of a specific advanced concept say Time Series then you can follow Time Series Analysis by Box and Jenkins for Univariate Time Series and Introduction to Multivariate Time series by Lutkepohl etc and so on for different topics Similarly for Machine learning also . Mining of Massive datasets is a comprehensive book with proofs on Machine Learning, but again it all depends on where you are where you want to head to. That being said, Forums,Research Papers and Publications are way to go for latest proofs, results etc.
