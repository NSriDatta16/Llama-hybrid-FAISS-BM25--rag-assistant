Is there a better way to read one xml value from the database

I'm currently using this code fragment to retrieve the one xml value that will be returned from my scalar query. using (SqlDataReader reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader()) { while (reader.Read()) { SqlXml xml = reader.GetSqlXml(0); XmlSchema xmlSchema = XmlSchema.Read(xml.CreateReader(), validationEvent); break; } } I would prefer to use sqlCommand.ExecuteScalar() but it seems that to do that means bringing back to the xml into a String which seems wrongheaded to me, since I'm not interested in having a String .
