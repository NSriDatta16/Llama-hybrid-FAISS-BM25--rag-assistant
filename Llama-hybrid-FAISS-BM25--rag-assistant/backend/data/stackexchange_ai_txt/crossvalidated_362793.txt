Partially answered in comments: It appears as if your null hypothesis is not true. Or your model may be misspecified. Could you clarify the context in which you are calculating F statistics? – Stephan Kolassa I have seen this when the linear model was fitted without intercept term with the response that was not zero-centered. In such case the obtained model is compared not with "average-response" null-model, but with "zero-response" null-model. – O_Devinyak One way it could happen is if your model is overfit. But, like others, I think you need to give us more details of what your data was, what your model was, and so on. – Peter Flom
