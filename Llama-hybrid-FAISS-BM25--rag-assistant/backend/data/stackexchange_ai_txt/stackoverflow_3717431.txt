For an extended period (as many days as you can be bothered to compute for) calculate the number of calls active at each minute of the day -- there are 1440 of them. Then for each minute of the day calculate the moving 60-minute sum of active calls, the minute for which this sum is maximised is the start of the busy hour (provided that you've calculated forward moving averages). Don't forget to wrap around at midnight. This seems so simple that I suspect I've misunderstood your question.
