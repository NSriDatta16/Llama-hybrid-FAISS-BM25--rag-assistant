Typically, what is estimated is the log hazard ratio instead of the hazard ratio directly. This is than transformed to hazard ratios. One typically computes the standard error and test statistics with the Delta method, which is an approximation. For the confidence interval there are multiple approximations, some are guaranteed to match with the delta method, but others, with better coverage properties, can differ. In practice the disagreement happens when the p-value is close to the critical value. So we wouldn't be able to distinguish between significant and nonsignificant anyhow.
