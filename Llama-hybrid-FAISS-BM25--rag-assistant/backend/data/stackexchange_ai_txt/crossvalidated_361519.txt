Partially answered in comments: I don't know the full reason, but CART uses a trick to reduce the number of splits considered. For regression, the levels of a categorical predictor are replaced by mean of the outcome; for binary responses, levels are replaced by the proportion of outcomes in class 1 (see Elements of Statistical Learning book or link for reason). For categorical predictors, there are some approximations. I don't know why randomForest caps this at 32. â€“ Peter Calhoun For some alternative ideas see Random Forest Regression with sparse data in Python
