Not without swapping widget trees in and out, which I don't think can be done cleanly with Tk. Other toolkits can do this a little more elegantly. COM/VB/MFC can do this with an ActiveX control - you can hide/show multiple ActiveX controls in the same region. Any of the containers will let you do this by changing the child around. If you're doing a windows-specific program you may be able to accomplish it this way. QT will also let you do this in a similar manner. GTK is slightly harder.
