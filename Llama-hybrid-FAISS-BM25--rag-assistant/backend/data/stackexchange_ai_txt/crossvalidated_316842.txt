How to augment imaging data for deep learning if I have subject meta information about the original images?

I'd like to try deep learning on about 200 CTs of cancer patients and I gave a lot of meta information about these people that I'd like to make use of in the classification (age, body mass index, chemotherapy response, etc). If I start augmenting the image data set using rotations and such, how do I deal with the fact these are the same patients? I cannot really start scrambling the clinical information just to fake a larger database. Or can I? So, how would I "augment" the clinical variables?
