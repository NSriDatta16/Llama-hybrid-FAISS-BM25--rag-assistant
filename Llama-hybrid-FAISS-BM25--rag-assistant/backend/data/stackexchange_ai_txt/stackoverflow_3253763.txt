Like Robert and Mtr I can recommend the FatFs Generic File System Module . I am using it on an Cortex-M3 with 3 logical devices (USB, SD-Card and external Flash). Especially the f_mkfs was very handy to get the FileSystem to the external Flash. The "only" thing I had to code my self were the low level disk I/O functions. If you do not need all functionality provided by the FatFs module, reducing the module size is pretty easy using the config.h (can't remember the name :D). Edit: I chose FAT as it can be used by Win & Linux...
