dynamically creating & destroying logging appenders

I have a legacy PSVM application which I'd like to redirect its logging output to unique files per execution. So, if I invoke it at 10:00, then have it redirect it's output to {thread-id}-10:00.log; and another thread of execution may begin an execution at 10:01, and its output would go to {thread-id}-10:01.log. I understand that this is not elegant. My questions are: is this possible? does someone have an idea of how to approach? is it possible to release/destroy an appender when it's no longer needed? Thanks!
