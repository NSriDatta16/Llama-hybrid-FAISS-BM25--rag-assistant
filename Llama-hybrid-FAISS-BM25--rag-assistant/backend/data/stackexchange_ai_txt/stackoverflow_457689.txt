WPF: Custom Window

There are many articles that described how to create a custom shaped window in WPF but none of them (at least I can't find any) described how can build a reusable one such as inheriting from it in other windows. I have tried to create a ControlTemplate from my custom window. The problem is with the Close button and the MoveDrag() method. If I wire the event to one of my other controls in ControlTemplate their Parent property is null, so I can not drag or close the window. Does anyone have any ideas how can I create a reusable custom window template or something?
