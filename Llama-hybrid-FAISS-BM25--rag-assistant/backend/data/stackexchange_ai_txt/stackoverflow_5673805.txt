Use the cgi.FieldStorage class to to handle the data as a form-data avaiable from the POST.. And when you go the portion which is the body of the POST and which in your case is in json format. def do_POST(self): # Parse the form data posted form = cgi.FieldStorage( fp=self.rfile, headers=self.headers, environ={'REQUEST_METHOD':'POST', 'CONTENT_TYPE':self.headers['Content-Type'], }) Here is an example illustrating how to do that And if the content is a proper json, use the json module from the standard library to load to json format and you can deal with it further. >>> import json >>> s = '{"name": "john"}' >>> d = json.loads(s)
