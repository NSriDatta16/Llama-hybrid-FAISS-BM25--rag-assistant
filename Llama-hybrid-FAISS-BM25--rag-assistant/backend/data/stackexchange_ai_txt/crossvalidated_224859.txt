PCA is considered a non-supervised method (you don't train with a dependent variable) and extracts useful "meta-information". In short it is generally hard to find the kind of interpretation you want from PCA A multiple regression (lm function in R) would allow you to see if and how much the soil property is affected by other effects in the model. It would also be okay at prediction but there are other methods that might be better at prediction like LDA or K nearest neighbors (only if you have much more data than features).
