Drupal 7, subpages not showing up

I have pages that I've organised to be under another main page but it isn't showing up under the secondary menu. How do I get the secondary menu to display child pages of the current page? Would there be a theme that does this already, i've tried zen and stark but they don't list the pages organised under the current page.
