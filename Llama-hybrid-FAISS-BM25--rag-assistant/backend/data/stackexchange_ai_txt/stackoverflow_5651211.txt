magento add session messages to cms page

In my Magento site I have a custom signup form and a CMS thank-you page that the user is redirected to after they complete the form. Is there a way to include the session messages in the CMS page? I've tried playing w/ the Layout Update XML field, but I'm not getting anywhere Here is what I've tried so far, all w/ no luck. {{block type="core/messages" name="global_messages" as="gloabl_messages" }} {{block type="core/messages" name="messages" as="global_messages" }}
