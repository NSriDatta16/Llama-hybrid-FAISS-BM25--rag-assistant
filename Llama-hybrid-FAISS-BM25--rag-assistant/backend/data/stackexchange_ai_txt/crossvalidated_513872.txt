How to correctly interpret coefficient of a multiple meta-regression in metafor?

When fitting a multiple meta-regression in metafor, the output shows multiple coefficients, for each predictor. To make an example, similar to what is done here: https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:meta_regression_with_log_rr dat where ablat is a continuous moderator, and alloc a categorical moderator. The output shows: Mixed-Effects Model (k = 13; tau^2 estimator: REML) tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity): 0.1402 (SE = 0.1109) tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value): 0.3744 I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 68.79% H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability): 3.20 R^2 (amount of heterogeneity accounted for): 58.50% Test for Residual Heterogeneity: QE(df = 9) = 24.3281, p-val = 0.0038 Test of Moderators (coefficients 2:4): QM(df = 3) = 12.4943, p-val = 0.0059 Model Results: estimate se zval pval ci.lb ci.ub intrcpt -0.2609 0.4017 -0.6495 0.5160 -1.0483 0.5265 allocrandom 0.1801 0.3482 0.5170 0.6051 -0.5025 0.8626 allocsystematic -0.1461 0.3766 -0.3881 0.6979 -0.8842 0.5919 ablat 0.0294 0.0091 3.2222 0.0013 0.0115 0.0473 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Now, we know that exponentiation of the coefficients for allocrandom and allocsystemic will gave us the "ratio of Odds Ratio", compared to the "alternate" location; similar, we know that the exponentiation of the coefficient for ablat will gave us the average odds ratio for one-unit increase in absolute latitude (Let's skip for a moment the proble of the exponentiation as a non-linear transformation, for simplicity). Now, the question is related to the formal interpretation of these coefficients in a multiple meta-regression model like the one reported above. It is right to say that, according to this multiple meta-regression model, the change in average odds ratio for one-unit increase in absolute latitude is 1.03 (which is equal to the exponentiation of the coefficient 0.0294), independently from the type of allocation? Or do I miss something?
