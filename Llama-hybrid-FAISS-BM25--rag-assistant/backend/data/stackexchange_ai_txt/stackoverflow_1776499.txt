I found a clean way to work with node text. It assumes that you have ownership of the XML content/format. What I am now doing is using the CDATA section for my node's "text()" attribute. This does not include the whitespace that I would use to tabulate my xml document. The code to read is like this: - (void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser foundCDATA:(NSData *)CDATABlock { NSLog(@"%s", __FUNCTION__); NSLog(@"[%@]", CDATABlock); NSString *strData = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:CDATABlock encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding ]; NSLog(@"convertToString=[%@]", strData); } and the XML fragment is like this (tutorial with 'famous quotes'): and the trace output is like this: 2009-11-21 13:17:51.901 Fate[2241:4203] -[XMLReader parser:foundCDATA:] 2009-11-21 13:17:51.901 Fate[2241:4203] [ ] 2009-11-21 13:17:55.774 Fate[2241:4203] convertToString=[And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.]]>
