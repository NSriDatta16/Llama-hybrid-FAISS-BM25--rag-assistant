Add a variable that indicates whether it was your first call to the person; that will be very useful when you generalize the results later to people you never called before (and who must be excluded in your training data). If it was me I'd start with a more exploratory technique, like decision tree. You can implement decision tree with rpart . The decision tree will show ways that your potential explanatory variables split and correlate with different probabilities of having the call answered. Then use that to build your model. You mentioned that you have experience with logistic regression, that would be a suitable option.
