laptops which are suitable for heavy Image and video processing

I am a graduate student and My thesis is based on deep learning, vision, video and Image processing. I am going to do heavy computing and processing. I am looking for a compatible laptop which has a fast GPU-enabled laptop. CUDA enabled on an NVIDIA GPU with good TFOPS would be a perfect choice. Also, it must have SSD. Anything by hp, Dell, Microsoft, Acer. do you have any recommendations? my budget is $CAN 1800. which GPU-Nvidia is suitable for this kind of programming?
