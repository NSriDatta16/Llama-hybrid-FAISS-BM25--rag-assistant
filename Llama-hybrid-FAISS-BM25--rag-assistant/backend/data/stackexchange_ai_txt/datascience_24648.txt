It's hard to answer your question because it is too general. It's like asking how to build a website without even knowing how to do programming. But I will be constructive Given your background and assuming you are familiar with Python, I recommend you using auto-sklearn . auto-sklearn is a library based on the popular sklearn which automates a lot of steps involved in general machine learning, like feature selection and hyperparameter-tuning. It also tries a bunch of algorithms and ensemble them to produce the best result. It is hard to beat its performs as a machine learning beginner. While auto-sklearn is very good for a beginner to get started, I must warn you that, without fully understand the how and why it is extremely risky for you rely on it blindly. One thing of particular importance is you need to understand how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm. Please make sure you understand the difference between train, validation and test dataset , before you make any claim on how good/accurate you prediction is.
