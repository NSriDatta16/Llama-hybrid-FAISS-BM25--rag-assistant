Intern working for Indian NGO - Help with PHP 4, advising staff

For the past three months I've been working for an Indian NGO, doing some volunteer work in the field but also trying to improve their website, which needs a ton of work. Recently I've been trying to fix the "subscribe to newsletter" button, which is broken. I used filter_var to filter the email input, but when I tried to test this out I got an error. Then I learned that the web host is still using php version 4.3.2 and register_globals is turned on. I've mentioned that they should upgrade their web host before. That would add a lot of complexity for the IT staff of 3, who would have to update everyone's email information (I assume? this is a 250-person organization), and have me find a new web host and teach them about it. The staff isn't that sophisticated about web usage - the head guy still uses IE6, and the website's laid out in tables (they use Dreamweaver WYSIWYG to lay out pages). So I've got two options - use regular expressions to filter the email, which I'm not that skilled at doing (and would be more vulnerable to exploitation after I leave), turn off register globals and then try to teach the staff what I'm doing, or try to get them to upgrade their versions of PHP and MySQL and/or change web host. I'd appreciate some advice. Thanks for your help, Kevin
