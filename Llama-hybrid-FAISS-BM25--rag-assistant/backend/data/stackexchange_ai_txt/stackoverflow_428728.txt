Read this stackoverflow posting for a rundown on this topic. The answer boils down to scalability and data integrity. At some point the data file will get big enough that it will need on-disk indexes, which are not directly supported in XML. Also, an XML file is not transactional - it has no logs. To implement a transactional storage in an XML file you would have to implement a DBMS, and create supplemental transactional log and index files. This is almost certainly far more trouble than it's worth.
