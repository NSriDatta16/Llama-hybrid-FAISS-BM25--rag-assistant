cgi.FieldStorage always empty - never returns POSTed form Data

This problem is probably embarrassingly simple. I'm trying to give python a spin. I thought a good way to start doing that would be to create a simple cgi script to process some form data and do some magic. My python script is executed properly by apache using mod_python, and will print out whatever I want it to print out. My only problem is that cgi.FieldStorage() is always empty . I've tried using both POST and GET. Each trial I fill out both form fields. If I change the form to point to a perl script it reports the form data properly. The python page always gives me the same result: number of keys: 0 #!/usr/bin/python import cgi def index(req): pageContent = """ A page from""" pageContent += """Python """ form = cgi.FieldStorage() keys = form.keys() keys.sort() pageContent += " number of keys: "+str(len(keys)) for key in keys: pageContent += fieldStorage[ key ].value pageContent += """ """ return pageContent I'm using Python 2.5.2 and Apache/2.2.3. This is what's in my apache conf file (and my script is in /var/www/python): Options FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI Order allow,deny allow from all AddHandler mod_python .py PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
