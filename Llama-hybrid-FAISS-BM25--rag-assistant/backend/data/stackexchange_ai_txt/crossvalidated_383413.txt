That is right: "random projection" is strictly speaking not a projection. Projection a is clearly defined mathematical object: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra) -- it is a linear idempotentent operator, i.e. linear operator $P$ such that $P^2 = P$ . Applying a projection twice is the same as applying it only once because after a point is projected on a subspace, it should just stay there if projected again. There is nothing about orthogonality in this definition; in fact, a projection can be oblique (see Wikipedia). Note that only square matrices can represent "projections" in this sense. "Random projection" uses a random $d\times k$ matrix $R$ with $k\ll d$ , so it cannot possibly be a projection in the sense of the above definition. Even if you make the columns of $R$ orthonormal (e.g. by applying Gram-Schmidt process), this argument will still apply. Somebody has recently asked this question about PCA: What exactly should be called "projection matrix" in the context of PCA? -- a $d\times k$ matrix $U$ of orthonormal eigenvectors is strictly speaking not a projection either.
