What is the best Deep Learning Library in R?

I am looking for a complete deep learning library in R. I am trying to find one or more libraries to implement: Recurrent NN Deep Belief NN Convolutional NN I have tried multiple libraries such as deepnet,darch,RcppDL but none of them seem to do the thing right. The most crucial for me is to be well documented,because I have tried to rerun the examples of the above libraries with my data, but either they crash or they predict a constant value for all test examples.
