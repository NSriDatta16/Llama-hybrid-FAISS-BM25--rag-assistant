You can do a student test to see if the mean is different between the group 4,6 and the rest. Even if your sample size is small you will conclude in a difference. Note that it will tell you that group 4,6 is significantly different in average from the rest but it won't tell you that "The experiment was not conducted properly in Environments 4 and 6" which can't be answered without a knowledge of what "properly" means in the observations.
