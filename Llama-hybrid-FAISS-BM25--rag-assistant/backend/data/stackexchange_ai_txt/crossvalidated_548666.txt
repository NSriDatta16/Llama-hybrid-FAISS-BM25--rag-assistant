Regarding the choice of reference category, there is no rule of thumb for the choice of reference category. The reference category is picked according to different tasks. You need to validate the stationary assumption for time series data, then configure a set of p,d,q with the smallest BIC or AIC values. In the case, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plot of data are useful to determine the values of p and q.
