Dojo - Some of my form.dijit's seem to be dead/inactive on one page

I was started to work on my first sample of the dijit.Tree control. When it didn't work, I added a couple of dijit.form.Textbox'es to the screen, and they didn't work either, even though I have them working fine on a similar form. Interesting enough, when I killed FireFox and restarted it, I was got a clear message in FireBug console on what was wrong with my tree control, and got it fixed. But now I'm rather puzzled while the simple dijits like NumberTextBox that I added are not working. My Samples: 1) http://3wcloud-com-provisioning-qa.appspot.com/testDijitDate - this works great (except the initial date value not showing - I have a separate question open on that) 2) http://3wcloud-com-provisioning-qa.appspot.com/testDijitTree I've done several "diff"s on the two files, and I kind find the difference that would cause one to work and one not to work. Thanks, Neal
