Heresy! XML is king of data. Say no to the usurpers, off with their heads! Long live XML! But seriously if just need data use Json, for support and elegance, but if you need formating ,xpath like queries, additional metadata, etc... Stick with XML Note: I use Xml for configs system building code generation and similar tasks, but Json for Rpc,Sql for queries and persistency, and finally Yaml here and there for logging and quick tasks, in other words choose the appriopiate format for the need.
