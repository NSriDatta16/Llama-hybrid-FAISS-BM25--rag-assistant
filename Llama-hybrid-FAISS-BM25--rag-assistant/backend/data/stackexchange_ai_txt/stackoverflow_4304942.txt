CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo() is returning bad data

Apple introduced the CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo() function in OS 4.1. https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/SystemConfiguration/Reference/CaptiveNetworkRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/kCNNetworkInfoKeySSIDData According to the documentation it should: Return the current network info for a given network interface. However, when used it seems to return the correct SSID (readable network name) but a garbage BSSID(the MAC address of the Wireless Access Point). I have tried this connected to multiple different networks with two different iPads and the results are the same. On my home network, the function returns: { BSSID = "0:19:db:8:5c:cc"; SSID = "Das Boot"; SSIDDATA = ; } In reality, the BSSID of my router is 0:4:ed:66:81:xx where the xx definitely is not cc Does anyone have experience using this function and have I missed something obvious (more likely) or is this an Apple bug (much less likely) ? Any input is greatly appreciated, Nicke.
