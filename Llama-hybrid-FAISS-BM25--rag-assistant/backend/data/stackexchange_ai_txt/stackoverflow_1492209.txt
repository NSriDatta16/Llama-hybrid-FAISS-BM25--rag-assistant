I would definitely go ahead with the containment selector in the case you give. Fewer spurious classes in the markup is easier to maintain, and the rule ‘.main p’ says clearly what it does. Use your judgement to whether more complicated cases are still clear. Note that ‘.main p’ selects all descendent paragraphs and not just direct children, which may or may not be what you want; accidentally-nested descendant matches are a potential source of bugs (especially for cumulative properties like relative font size). If you want only children to be selected you need ‘.main>p’, which unfortunately does not work in IE6. This is one reason why many sites go crazy with the classnames: the more involved selectors that could otherwise be used to pick out elements without a classname, tend not to work in IE.
