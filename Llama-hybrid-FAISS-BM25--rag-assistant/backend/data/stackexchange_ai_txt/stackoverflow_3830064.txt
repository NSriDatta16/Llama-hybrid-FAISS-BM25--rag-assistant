change TLFTextField link style

I've a assets swc file that contains several TLFTextField objects, each one with it's style (font, color, size). I use the following code to set a link: var text_tf : TLFTextField; var url : String = "www.stackoverflow.com"; text_tf.htmlText = " "+url+" "; This works as expected, but it changes the color of the text to blue ; What's the easiest way to configure the color of the text, without having to recreate all the TLF mechanism (ContainerController, Configuration, TextLayoutFormat, TextFlow, ParagraphElement, LinkElement, SpanElement, ...); I was expecting something like this to work: text_tf.textFlow.linkNormalFormat = { color:0x00ffFF, textDecoration:TextDecoration.NONE }; text_tf.textFlow.linkHoverFormat = { color:0x00ffFF, textDecoration:TextDecoration.NONE }; ...but it doesn't :(
