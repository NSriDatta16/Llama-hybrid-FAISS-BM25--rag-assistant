Not sure how it is relevant to the original question. But just in case somebody still needs an answer to this old question, one possible tool in Matlab is the BEAST method I developed, available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72515-bayesian-changepoint-detection-time-series-decomposition . For good or bad, it is a Bayesian changepoint detection algorithm. It can be installed by running eval( webread( 'http://b.link/rbeast', weboptions('cert','') ) ); Then, here is a quick test: load('Nile.mat') % annual streamflow of the Nile River startin from year 1871 out = beast(Nile, 'season', 'none','start', 1871) % trend-only data without seasonality printbeast(out) plotbeast(out) Given below is the plotting of the example: More details about the toolbox are also available at https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast .
