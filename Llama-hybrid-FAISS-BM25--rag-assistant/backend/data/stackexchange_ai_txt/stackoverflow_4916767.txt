The function array_set works because when you pass an array into a function, you are really passing a pointer. Then, inside the function, you are de-referencing the array using "y_out[0][0] = 10" etc. When you use array notation, it automatically de-references the array pointer so you are able to set the values within the array. Ints are completely different from int arrays. An array can be treated in almost every case as a pointer, in this case a pointer to int. An int is an actual numerical value. Therefore, when you pass an int into you're int_set_wrong function, it is copied (that's just what C/C++ does), and you are setting a local variable y, not the int you passed in. You're third question is answered in the first paragraph as well. Hope this clears things up.
