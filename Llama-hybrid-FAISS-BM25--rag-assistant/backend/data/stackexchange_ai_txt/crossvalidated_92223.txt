Caret with rxDForest as custom model

I'm trying to use the train function from the caret package to tune the parameters of the rxDForest from RevoScaleR package (I can't use the random forest because my dataset is too big), but I can't manage to make my code work with resampling: library(caret) library(doParallel) library(pROC) registerDoParallel(cores=4) # ---------------- # Import data train load(file = "data_model_rf.RData") # ---------------- # tune rf rxDForest I got the following error: Error in train.default(data_model[, 1:(ncol(data_model) - 1)], data_model[, : final tuning parameters could not be determined 4: In nominalTrainWorkflow(x = x, y = y, wts = weights, info = trainInfo, : There were missing values in resampled performance measures. 5: In train.default(data_model[, 1:(ncol(data_model) - 1)], data_model[, : missing values found in aggregated results The code works if I switch to method = "none" in the trainControl function, so it's not a problem with the fit or predict functions. Thanks for your help. EDIT : Documentation for the rxDForest : https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-MIQzwMSpnxSlZXNjIxektEWmc/edit?pli=1 rxDForest accept only a specific "rxFormula" which doesn't include class~. but works with my syntax. I've tried the new grid matrix (included x = matrix(1, ncol = 9, nrow = 10) in the grid function) but it doesn't work. I'm using the tunegrid option so the grid function is not supposed to be used, isn't it ? Thanks.
