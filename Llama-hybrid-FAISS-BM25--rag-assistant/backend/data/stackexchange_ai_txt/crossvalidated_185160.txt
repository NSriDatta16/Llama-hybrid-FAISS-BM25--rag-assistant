Detecting if a File is Compressed using Machine Learning?

Let's say that I want a 'general' way using some machine learning model to classify if a file is possibly compressed or not. I don't need a 100% success rate. How would you approach this? I thought it might be nice to get some features like: File name extension file header bytes file entropy And send that to an ANN or SVM model - is that a good approach?
