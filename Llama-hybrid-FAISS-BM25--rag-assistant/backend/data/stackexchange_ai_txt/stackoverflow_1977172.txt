Reading a FILESTREAM over Win32 is quite fast. See Managing FILESTREAM Data by Using Win32 . You should follow the FILESTREAM best practices though. After all, this is what powers Sharepoint and MS would not bet something as important as Office (==Sharepoint) on unperformance storage. There are some case studies and white papers around FILESTREAM, I could only digg out Laren Electronics Fuels Analysis of Formula One Racing Data with SQL Server but I know there are more with more detailed numeric data. If I recall correctly it shows that that FILESTREAM in general shadows SMB performance by about 90-95% factor, over a certain file size. For small files the overhead of obtaining the FILESTREAM API handle starts to show up. I'd also second Marc in recommending reading over the Research paper on the topic (there is also a Channel 9 interview with Catharine van Ingen, available on iTunes podcasts too, where she speaks about this work), but bear in mind that the paper is published in 2006 before FILESTREAM was officially released, so it does not consider the FILESTREAM specifics. As for your second question, asking about performance by only specifying the load and not the capacity of the system is a non-sense. A 128 CPU Superdome with a mountain of storage SANs won't even notice your load. A SQL runing on a 256 MB laptop with a mountain of spyware won't even get to see your load...
