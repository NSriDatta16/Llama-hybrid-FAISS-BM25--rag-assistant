Intuition needed when using weighted average to explain Simpson's paradox

In Freedman's Statistics (chapter 2), the author uses Berkeley's admission statistics (that 44% men and 35% women were admitted to graduate programs in general) to illustrate Simpson's paradox: the difference in overall admission rate per gender could be explained by different application rates to different majors between males and females -- "The men were applying to the easy majors, the women to the harder ones", as stated by the author. To remedy this, the author suggests using a weighted average of the admission rates for each gender. The formula and explanation for the weighted averages are below: My rough understanding is: assuming all applicants have the same major-specific admission rates as that of males, the overall rate calculated from this will be the male's weighted average admission rate, and vice versa for women. However, it's still not intuitive to me yet (both mathematically and conceptually) why these equations would give a more "balanced" admission rates for each gender. For example, when one calculates the overall admission rate for each gender the "old" way, doesn't one already weighted this average with the (male) application volume? Granted, the new volume use the overall (not just male) application volume per major as the weights, but I still don't know why this method would solve this paradox. If anyone could help explain to me these formulas, or point me to concepts I need to learn to understand these formulas, I'd really appreciate it. I have a hunch it might be something related to multivariate statistics (since there seems to be 2 factors in this case: gender and major), but being a new statistics student I may not be aware of them yet. My ultimate goal is to understand why and how these formulas work, so that in the future I know when to use them.
