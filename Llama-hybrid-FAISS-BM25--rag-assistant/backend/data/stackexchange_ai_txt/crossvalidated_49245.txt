Non-exclusive categorical model

I have a project to model users with characteristic tags (e.g. runner, cyclist, swimmer, vegan, pianist) in order to correlate user behaviour to these labels. Obviously a user can have multiple characteristics (non-exclusive) and so the distance (or similarity) between users is determined by the amount of tag overlap. Is there a name for this kind of model? Are there any particular patterns/algorithms that are useful for measuring correlations in data represented by this kind of model? I don't need a complete list; just to be pointed in the right direction.
