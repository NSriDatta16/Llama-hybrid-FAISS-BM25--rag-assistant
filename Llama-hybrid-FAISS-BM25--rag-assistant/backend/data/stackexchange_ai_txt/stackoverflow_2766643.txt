Consuming all touchEvents not preventing scrolling on the blackberry storm

I am trying to make a custom control for the BlackBerry Storm using SDK v5.0. This control needs to disable scrolling while the user is dragging elements within a field. The problem is that even if I my control consumes every single touch event send to it, when the user lifts their finger off the screen it still flings up or down as if its finishing a scroll action. Does anyone know of a way to prevent this from happening or what I might be doing wrong ? Thank you.
