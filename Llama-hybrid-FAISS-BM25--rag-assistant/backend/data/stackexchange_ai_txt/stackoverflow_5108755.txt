How do I move multiple nodes at once in a TJvTreeView?

When you select multiple nodes of a JvTreeView, and then try to drag these nodes, the JvTreeView selects the node you clicked to drag, rather than initiating dragging all the selected nodes. You end up dragging only this single node. Is it possible to drag multiple nodes in a JvTreeView? I am using Delphi 2007. UPDATE: Oddly enough, if I hold down CTRL+SHIFT when dragging the items, I can successfully drag them all. Any ideas?
