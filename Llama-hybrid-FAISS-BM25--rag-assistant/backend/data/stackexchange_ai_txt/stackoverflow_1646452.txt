cd workingcopy svn checkout http://my.repos.com/path/to/trunk # make your edits svn switch http://my.repos.com/path/to/branch svn commit Now your working copy points to the branch instead of the trunk. You could also check out the branch as a separate working copy, then drag-and-drop your changes into it.
