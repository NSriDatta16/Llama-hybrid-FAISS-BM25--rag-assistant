How to add a second thumb to a Javascript slider

I have to create a dual-thumb slider using the YUI 3 libraries. A single thumb slider exists , so I hope I can extend the widget to include a second thumb. However, while I can do some basic Javascript programming, this is a level above and I don't even know how to start. I have tried for weeks to outsource this project, and haven't found anyone willing or capable, so it looks like it is up to me and my noob Javascript skills to solve this. I have been trying to find some kind of tutorial, but no luck there either. Every time I look for how to build a "slider" from scratch (which I figure will give me some starting points), I get instructions on image galleries that scroll from side to side. All I know right now is that to make an extension to the YUI library, I need to use this code: YUI.add('gallery-dual-slider', function (Y) { /* custom code goes here */ }, '0.0.1', { requires: ['dd-drag'] }); And I'm totally stuck after that. I assume that I need to somehow render a div onto the "rail", and then make that div clickable and draggable...? Maybe? Can someone give me a link to the tutorial or maybe a pointer to how I do this?
