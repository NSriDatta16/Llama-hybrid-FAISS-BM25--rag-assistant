How do I figure out my RAM requirements for Cloud Hosting?

I'm new to everything that is 'the cloud.' I will be developing a website/platform that will have around 15,000,000 estimated monthly visitors after the first year of production. I'm assuming that the site will have 5 page views per visitor, and 100kb of data transfer per page. I've contacted several cloud hosting companies, but they tell me that I need to have 'hardware requirements.' Since I'm rather clueless about IT stuff, I'd like to know: What are the factors that need to be analyzed in order to determine How many servers are required VPUs / server required RAM / server required Total storage / server required Big thanks in advance!
