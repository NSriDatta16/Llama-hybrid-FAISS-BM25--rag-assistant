Let $X$ be a normal r.v. and $Y = e^X$ . The quantiles of $Y$ are simply obtained by exponentiating the quantiles of $X$ . Now there's no closed form expression for the quantiles of the normal distribution; consequently, there's no closed form expression for the quantiles of a lognormal. However, as indicated in my opening paragraph, you can express the quantiles of a lognormal in terms of the quantiles of the corresponding normal. If $x_q = \mu+\Phi^{-1}(q)\cdot \sigma$ is the $q$ -quantile of a normal with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , then $y_q = e^{x_q}$ is the corresponding quantile of the lognormal with the same parameters. Since functions are typically available which give normal quantiles to quite high accuracy, you can make use of those in calculations involving lognormal quantiles. A value at risk (VaR) is a quantile, so these considerations apply to value at risk.
