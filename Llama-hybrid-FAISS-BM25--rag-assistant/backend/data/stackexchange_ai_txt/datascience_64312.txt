What are some (non image) datasets where deep networks are required for good performance?

It is well known that deep networks tend to outperform shallow networks and other classical machine learning techniques such as boosting on learning tasks involving images. I believe this is because extracting useful high-level features from low-level pixel intensities requires deep models. I'm curious to know if there are any non-image data sets (e.g., tabular datasets that are typically found in UCI repository) where deep networks are required for good performance and where shallow networks, boosting tend to perform poorly.
