How should I encode LaTex formulas to use as targets for a model with Tensorflow ?

I am working on recognizing LaTex formulas from a given image, and I was wondering how I should represent the formulas in my model (convolutional neural network). To train the model, I input images, each associated with a LaTex formula. However, I'm supposed to be able to measure a loss/cost so how should I represent the formulas ? I though about one hot encoding the formulas. For example, if we consider only 4 letters a , b , c and d , for the sequence bd , and for sequences of 4 maximum characters, I would have this matrix as target: bd a 0000 b 1000 c 0000 d 0100 Is this a good solution ? Which other solution should I consider ?
