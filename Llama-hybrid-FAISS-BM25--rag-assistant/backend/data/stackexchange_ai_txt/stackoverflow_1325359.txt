Yes, there is an awesome framework! It's called Cocoa. It's powerful and flexible. Unless you are using OpenGL it has 95% of what you need to quickly develop great apps. Pick up the Prag Programmers book or Beginning iPhone development and you'll be off and running. Seriously though, There are many frameworks that attempt to abstract out the SDK for web developers and the like. It is much simpler to take a few weeks and just learn the language and the syntax. Three20 is a special case, it gives you a lot of added functionality at the cost or rewriting every Cocoa class to conform to web conventions. It works for some and doesn't for others. If you can use it out of the box fine, but if you need to modify/subclass, just start from scratch instead. There are many, many open source libraries/code that add simple functionality like JSON parsing. The Cocoa community is very open and you won't find yourself recreating the wheel too often.
