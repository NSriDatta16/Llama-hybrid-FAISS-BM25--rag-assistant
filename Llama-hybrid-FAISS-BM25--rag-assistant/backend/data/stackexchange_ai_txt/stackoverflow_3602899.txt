The only USB support in Android is for adb and USB mass storage. Neither let you talk to on-device applications. Both let you access files on the SD card. adb may provide additional features, but you cannot access "installed apps, contacts, messages". None of this is designed to work from C#, though you can call out to the adb command-line executable if you wish. A network-based protocol would be easiest, for a subset of your goals. A Bluetooth protocol may be doable for the same subset.
