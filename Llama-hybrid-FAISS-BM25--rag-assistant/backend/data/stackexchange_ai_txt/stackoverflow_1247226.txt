I'm considering shifting from PHP to Rails. Does an average web host support the Ruby language and everything that Rails needs? I would say yes. I can't be certain if your "average" host will support it, but there are thousands that do, so you'll have a wide variety to choose from. Does a normal Rails app using MySQL or does it handle data differently? You can use MySQL, which is common, as well as other DB systems, and it won't affect your code since it uses a DBA layer. And is it as "easy" to get an app up and running, as PHP? Depends on your platform, but yes :)
