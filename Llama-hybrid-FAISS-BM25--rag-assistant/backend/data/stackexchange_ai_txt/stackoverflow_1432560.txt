I am not sure if there is a clean method to doing this. I have not tried it, but here is an idea: draw the uiwebview at origin 0,0 intercept all screen touches if you detect the user dragging up (scrolling up the webview), dont pass the touch on Instead, move the webview up x pixels so its origin is (0,-x). Then change the height to add x pixels Youy will need to keep some sort of state so that you know when to stop resizing the webview and start passing on the touches so the webview will scroll. Getting it back is the same only you do it on a drag down (scrolling down the webview).
