Average of rate of change in a set of independent change events

What is the right method for computing average of percentage values? Arithmetic average, geometric average, or something else? Here's an example of problems I'm talking about. Suppose for years 2009, 2010, 2011, the annual GDP growth rates are 1%, 2%, 3%, respectively. What is the average growth rate over these three years? I'm not talking about the domain of GDP growth in specific (it's just a made-up example). Instead, I want to know the way to compute average of percentiles in general (or at least somewhat smaller domain of average of certain growth rates). * Update #1 - another example Suppose I have percentages Pi=1 - Ni/Di (i=1, 2, ..., m). Ni is the execution time of program i after optimization, and Di is the execution time of the same program i before optimization. Then, Pi represents the rate of reduction in execution time after optimization. How can we compute the average rate of reduction in execution time for these m programs? The arithmetic average avg(Ni) is not meaningful, right? * Update #2 - change of title From "Average of percentage values" to "Average of rate of change in a set of independent change events" Change event ei: change from original value ai to new value bi, and change rate pi=f(ai,bi) What is the average change rate for a set of events {e1, e2, ..., en}?
