Free/open interactive softwares/plugins for end-users' high-dimensional data visualization

Aside from questions about How to visualize data of a multidimensional dataset (TIMIT) , the Purpose of visualizing high dimensional data? and High-dimensional data: What are useful techniques to know? , I am looking at tools for high-dimensional data (numerical only) visualization, possibly embedding some dimension reduction techniques (Sammon maps, t-SNE), that could be used by end-users. I have found for instance: HiSee (version 1.0.0, 2004-07-05), GGobi (version 2.1.10a, 2010-03-12), Data Projector (2014-07-15). They do not seem to be heavily maintained. Are there more active or efficient developments to follow?
