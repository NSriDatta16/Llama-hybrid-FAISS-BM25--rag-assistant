How to get restructuredText to add a class to every html tag?

I'm using Django's markup package to transform restructuredText into html. Is there a way to customize the HTML writer to add a class attribute to each tag? I could use the class directive for each paragraph, but I'd like to automate this process. For example, I want this restructured text: hello ===== A paragraph of text. To be converted to this html. hello A paragraph of text. The reason I want to insert classes is because I'm using the hyphenator library which works by adding hyphens to all tags with a "hyphenate" class. I could add the hyphenate class to the container tag, but then all the children would inherit the hyphenate class. I could use javascript to dynamically add the class, but I thought there might be a simple way to do it with restructuredText. Thanks for the help, Joe
