How to create labeling data?

I have hundreds of images, each image is one of eight different types of blood cells. The names of the images indicate what type of blood cell it is. I am having trouble getting started with image pre-processing for building a CNN. My current approach is to first read in my images, and convert to one hot encoding. Then, for each image have another vector of size 1x8. Since I have 8 images, I'll assign each image to a number and work from there. Is the right way to proceed or should this be done differently?
