Word completion suggests that you want to find all the words that start with a given prefix. Tries are good for this, and particularly good if you're adding or removing elements - other nodes do not need to be reallocated. If the dictionary is fairly static, and retrieval is important, consider a far simpler data structure: put your words in an ordered vector! You can do binary-search to discover a candidate starting with the correct prefix, and a linear search each side of it to discover all other candidates.
