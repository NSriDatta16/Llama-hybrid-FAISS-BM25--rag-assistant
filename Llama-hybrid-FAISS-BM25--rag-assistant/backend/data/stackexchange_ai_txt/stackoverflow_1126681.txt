Start off by choosing a framework you're comfortable with. I would recommend Code Igniter , CakePHP or Zend Framework . It will help(force) you with a basic organization of your code and files. All these frameworks has dedicated forums with passionate developers. From the project management angle I would recommend you to set goals and milestones. It will help you get things done even though you're learning. Set target of that you should accomplish for this month, this week and today. Small and easy targets like "create signup form" or "set homepage set". It feel so good checking those off. There is a lot of tools to use for this, like Backpack or Basecamp (free versions) or Things (mac application). Be sure to use PHP5 and not copy ugly PHP4 code.
