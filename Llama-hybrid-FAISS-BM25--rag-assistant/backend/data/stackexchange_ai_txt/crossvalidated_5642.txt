It’s easier to explain in terms of standard deviations, rather than confidence intervals. Your friend’s conclusion is basically correct under the simplest model where you have simple random sampling and two candidates. Now the sample proportions satisfy $p_A + p_B = 1$ so that $p_B = 1 - p_A$. Thus, $$Var(p_A - p_B) = Var(2 p_A - 1) = 4 Var(p_A)$$ and so $$SD(p_A - p_B) = 2 SD(p_A).$$ What makes this simple relationship possible is that $p_A$ and $p_B$ are perfectly negatively correlated, because in general $$Var(p_A - p_B) = Var(p_A) + Var(p_B) - 2 Cov(p_A, p_B).$$ Outside this simple model , if $p_A + p_B = 1$ does not hold in general, then you must take into account the correlation between $p_A$ and $p_B$ that is not included in the margin of error. It is possible for $SD(p_A - p_B) \ll 2 SD(p_A)$. But all this nuance seems to indicate that the polling organizations should report the margin of error on the difference. Where’s Nate Silver?
