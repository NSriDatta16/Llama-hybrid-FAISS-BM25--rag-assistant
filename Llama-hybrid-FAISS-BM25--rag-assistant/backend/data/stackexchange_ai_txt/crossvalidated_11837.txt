I agree with JMS, and PCA seems like a good idea after examining the initial correlations and scatterplots between the variables for each county. This thread has some useful suggestions to introduce PCA in non-mathematical terms. I would also suggest utilizing small multiple maps to visualize the spatial distributions of each of the variables (and there are some good examples in this question on the gis.se site). I think these work particularly well if you have a limited number of areal units to compare and you use a good color scheme (like this example on Andrew Gelman's blog). Unfortunately the nature of any "world countries" dataset I suspect would frequently result in sparse data (i.e. alot of missing countries), making geographic visualization difficult. But such visualization techniques should be useful in other situations as well for your course.
