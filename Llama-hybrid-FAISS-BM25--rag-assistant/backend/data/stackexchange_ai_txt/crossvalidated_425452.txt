With discrete regression, I assume you mean that your target variable has integer values, rather than continuous values? In that case, this would be an example of a ordinal regression problem. There are basically 3 ways for dealing with such data treat this as classification loss (not ideal, because you throw away the order information) just do regular regression minimizing MSE between target and prediction. Then, after training the network, round the outputs to the nearest integer. Use a ordinal regression approach. A common and easy to implement one is ordinal regression via extended binary classification for neural networks. There are basically two papers that have neural network code for this that come to mind: Niu, Zhou, Wang, Gao, Hua (2016). Ordinal regression with multiple output cnn for age estimation. http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/Niu_Ordinal_Regression_With_CVPR_2016_paper.html Cao, Mirjalili, Raschka (2019).
