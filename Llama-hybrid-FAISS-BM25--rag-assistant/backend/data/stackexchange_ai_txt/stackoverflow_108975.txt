@p3t0r- is right,MemCached is probably the best option, but you could also use the sqlite database that comes with Rails. That won't work over multiple machines though, where MemCached will. Also, sqlite will persist to disk, though I think you can set it up not to if you want. Rails itself has no application-scoped storage since it's being run as one-process-per-request-handler so it has no shared memory space like ASP.NET or a Java server would.
