Tips for writing a file parser in Java?

EDIT: I'm mostly parsing "comma-seperated values", fuzzy brought that term to my attention. Interpreting the blocks of CSV are the main question here. I know how to read the file into something like a String[] and some of the basic features of String , but I don't think using methods like contains() and analyzing everything character by character will work. What are some ways I can do this in a smarter way? Example of a line: -barfoob: boobs, foob, "foo bar"
