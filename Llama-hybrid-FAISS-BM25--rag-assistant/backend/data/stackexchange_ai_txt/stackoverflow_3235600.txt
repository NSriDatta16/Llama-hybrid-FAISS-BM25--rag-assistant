change Paragraph.generateParagraph = function() { to Paragraph.prototype.generateParagraph = function() { You added the function as a property of the constructor function, rather than to the prototype. By adding the function to the prototype it will be part of the object created when calling the constructor function using the new keyword. Also, you need parentheses to the call to generateParagraph, otherwise you get a reference to the function, rather than calling the function: paragraph.generateParagraph();
