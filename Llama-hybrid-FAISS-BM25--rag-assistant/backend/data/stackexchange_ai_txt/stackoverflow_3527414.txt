Limiting Access to "Functional Modules" in ASP.NET MVC

I am building a site in ASP.NET 4 and MVC2 that will have premium features, such as SMS notifications that will only be available to paid subscribers. I also have additional modules for things like Inventory, and Transactions etc I am already leveraging the standard MembershipProvider, and am leaning towards using Roles tp provide this functionality. ie: have an "SMSModule" role that the user gets if they pay for the add-on SMS service This makes the controllers simple with a little attribute decoration, but the problem I see with this is that there will be a bunch of conditional code scattered through my views etc Is there a better method of providing a "module" style approach in .NET 4 and MVC2???
