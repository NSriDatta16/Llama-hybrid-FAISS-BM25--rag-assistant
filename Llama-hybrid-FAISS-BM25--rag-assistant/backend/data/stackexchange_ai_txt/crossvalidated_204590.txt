Are students with higher grades who score worse on retest cheaters? The question received a substantial edit since the last of six answers. The edited question contains an example of regression to the mean in the context of student scores on a $100$ question true-false test and an retest for the top performers on an equivalent test. The retest shows substantially more average scores for the group of top performers on the first test. What's going on? Were the students cheating the first time? No, it is important to control for regression to the mean. Test performance for multiple choice tests is a combination of luck in guessing and ability/knowledge. Some portion of the top performers' scores was due to good luck, which was not necessarily repeatable the second time. Or should they just stay away from the roulette wheel? Let's first assume that no skill at all was involved, that the student's were just flipping (fair) coins to determine their answers. What's the expected score? Well, each answer has independently a $50\%$ chance of being the correct one, so we expect $50\%$ of $100$ or a score of $50$ . But, that's an expected value. Some will do better merely by chance. The probability of scoring at least $60\%$ correctly according to the binomial distribution is approximately $2.8\%$ . So, in a group of $3000$ students, the expected number of students to get a grade of $60%$ or better is $85$ . Now let's assume indeed there were $85$ students with a score of $60\%$ or better and retest them. What's the expected score on retest under the same coin-flipping method? Its still $50\%$ of $100$ ! What's the probability that a student being retested in this manner will score above $60\%$ ? It's still $2.8\%$ ! So we should expect only $2$ of the $85$ ( $2.8\% \cdot 85$ ) to score at least $60\%$ on retest. Under this setup it is a fallacy to assume an expected score on retest different from the expected score on the first test -- they are both $50\%$ of $100$ . The gambler's fallacy would be to assume that the good luck of the high scoring students is more likely to be balanced out by bad luck on retest. Under this fallacy, you'd bet on the expected retest scores to be below $50$ . The hot-handed fallacy (here) would be to assume that the good luck of the high scoring students is more likely to continue and bet on the expected retest scores to be above $50$ . Lucky coins and lucky flips Reality is a bit more complicated. Let's update our model. First, it doesn't matter what the actual answers are if we are just flipping coins, so let's just score by number of heads. So far, the model is equivalent. Now let's assume $1000$ coins are biased to be heads with probability of $55\%$ (good coins $G$ ), $1000$ coins are biased to be heads with probability of $45\%$ (bad coins $B$ ), and $1000$ have equal probability of being heads or tails (fair coins $F$ ) and randomly distribute these. This is analogous to assuming higher and lower ability/knowledge under the test taking example, but it is easier to reason correctly about inanimate objects. The expected score is $(55 \cdot 1000 + 45 \cdot 1000 + 50 \cdot 1000)/3000 = 50$ for any student given the random distribution. So, the expected score for the first test has not changed. Now, the probability of scoring at least $60\%$ correctly, again using the binomial distribution is $18.3\%$ for good coins, $0.2\%$ for bad coins, and of course $2.8\%$ still for the fair coins. The probability of scoring at least $60\%$ is, since an equal number of each type of coin was randomly distributed, the average of these, or $7.1\%$ . The expected number of students scoring at least $60\%$ correctly is $21$ . Now, if we do indeed have $21$ scoring at least $60\%$ correctly under this setup of biased coins, what's the expected score on retest? Not $50\%$ of $100$ anymore! Now you can work it out with Bayes theorem, but since we used equal size groups the probability of having a type of coin given a outcome is (here) proportional to the probability of the outcome given the type of coin. In other words, there is a $86\% = 18.3\%/(18.3\% + 0.2\% + 2.8\%)$ chance that those scoring at least 60% had a good coin, $1\% = 0.2\%/(18.3\% + 0.2\% + 2.8\%)$ had a bad coin, and $13\%$ had a fair coin. The expected value of scores on retest is therefore $86\% \cdot 55 + 1\% \cdot 45 + 13\% \cdot 50 = 54.25$ out of $100$ . This is lower than actual scores of the first round, at least $60$ , but higher than the expected value of scores before the first round, $50$ . So even when some coins are better than others, randomness in the coin flips means that selecting the top performers from a test will still exhibit some regression to the mean in a retest. In this modified model, hot-handedness is no longer an outright fallacy -- scoring better in the first round does mean a higher probability of having a good coin! However, gambler's fallacy is still a fallacy -- those who experienced good luck cannot be expected to be compensated with bad luck on retest.
