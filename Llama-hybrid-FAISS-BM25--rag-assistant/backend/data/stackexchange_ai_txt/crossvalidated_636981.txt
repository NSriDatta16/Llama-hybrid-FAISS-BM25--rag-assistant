First, high negative values would be just as key as high positive ones. But, more importantly, I don't think this is a good approach. If you want to use a subset of the original variables in your regression, then there are lots of methods that have been discussed here a lot. See the various questions under the model-selection tag. The goal in PCA is to reduce the number of variables to a subset that contain as much of the variance in the original data as possible. You could then use those components in a regression, but a better method may be partial least squares. But neither of these retains the original variables. But, if you use your method, then you will get a bunch of variables from each component. Two problems arise: 1) If a variable is in two PCs, what do you do? 2) If all different variables are in the PCs, then you wind up with a ton of variables, which is what you wanted to avoid in the first place. (In the extreme case, if it's a fully distinct set of 5 variables in each of 14 components, you would have 14*5 = 70 variables.
