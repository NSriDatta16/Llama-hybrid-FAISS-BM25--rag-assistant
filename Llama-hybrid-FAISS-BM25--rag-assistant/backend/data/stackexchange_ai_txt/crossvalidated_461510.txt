Your model statement reflects a mixed model with fixed or non-varying predictors Region and genus , their interaction, and then varying predictor food along with its interactions with Region and genus . We know that food is a varying predictor because it is included in the random part of the model (1+food|sample) . Thus each sample is allowed to have its own unique association between food and Redecimal , the outcome. This model seems to provide a good fit to the data. You can additionally compare the two models using the loo function. For your models: loo1 You can further examine the LOO-probability integral transform (LOO-PIT) plots for each model. You are looking for the simulates to follow a uniform distribution. Since you produced the PPC plots, I assume you have already calculated yrep for each of the models. Assuming that you called the first model's yrep yrep1 , the LOO-PIT plots can be produced as such: library(bayesplot) ppc_loo_pit_overlay(yrep = yrep1, y = Redecimal, lw = weights(loo1$psis_object)) + ggtitle("LOO-PIT Model 1") #first model ppc_loo_pit_overlay(yrep = yrep1, y = Redecimal, lw = weights(loo1$psis_object)) + ggtitle("LOO-PIT Model 2") #second model You can find a very helpful guide for Bayesian modeling and diagnostics here .
