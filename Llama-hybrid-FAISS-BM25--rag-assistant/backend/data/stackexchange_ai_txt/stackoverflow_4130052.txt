How many times does Ruby evaluate a loop's enumerated collection?

In Ruby, if I were to loop over a collection, how many times would Ruby evaluate the enumerated collection? Specifically, I'd like to sort a collection, and loop over the sorted collection. Since I have no need for keeping a copy of the sorted collection around, I figured I'd just write the loop as: for item in @items.sort{ |a,b| b.created_at a.created_at } do #do some stuff end However, after crafting that lovely bit of code I began to wonder how many times I might be actually calling sort. Would the above line indeed only sort the collection once? Or will Ruby end up sorting it N times for each item in the collection?
