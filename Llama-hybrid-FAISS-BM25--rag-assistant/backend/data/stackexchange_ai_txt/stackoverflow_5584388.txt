Making a better summary statistics table with plyr in R

Every time I get a new data set the first thing I do is check out the summary statistics. The summary function does a pretty good job, but I'm frequently interested in standard deviations, quantiles with different breakpoints, number of observations, etc. Also, the presentation of summary isn't really the easiest way to digest or what you see in journals (i.e., summary is horizontal instead of vertical). For example, here is what I get from summary with some made up data. > library(plyr) > library(reshape2) > my.data my.summary my.summary firm returns leverage a:5 Min. :-1.6765 Min. :0.2863 b:5 1st Qu.:-0.6945 1st Qu.:0.3929 c:5 Median :-0.1930 Median :0.5061 d:5 Mean :-0.1159 Mean :0.5009 e:5 3rd Qu.: 0.4323 3rd Qu.:0.6011 Max. : 1.1915 Max. :0.7093 But let's say I really want something more like this. > my.manual.summary rownames(my.manual.summary) my.manual.summary mean median sd returns -0.1158633 -0.1929571 0.6996548 leverage 0.5008895 0.5061301 0.1453381 For this small data set (i.e., just a few firm characteristics) this is easy. But I have more or what to do more statistics or more slicing-dicing, it can get tedious. I tried this with reshape2 and plyr , but get an error. > my.melted.data my.improved.summary This leaves me with two questions: What am I doing wrong with ddply ? Am I re-inventing the wheel here? Given that this is table 1 in everything I read and write, is there an existing solution that I haven't found? Thanks!
