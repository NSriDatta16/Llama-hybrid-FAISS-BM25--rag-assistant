Either Rails or Sinatra is a great learning choice. I began working on a project in Rails where I literally knew nothing of web development or Ruby October 2009 (my cofounder helped me break though some initial hurdles and got me to RTFM). I ran into some problems but could code up business logic fairly easily. Recently I began porting a project over to the app engine and using Sinatra as a framework and it's been an incredible learning process. Mostly for learning about all the things that Rails did automatically. It also was useful for seeing a simplified definition of class members and their persistence method (migrations are unfortunately a pita though, background processes to change the format). You may wish to consider where you will deploy. Since I'm primarily interested in straight forward apps at a low server cost both Heroku and the Google App Engine fit well. Rails/ActiveRecord/Sqlite and Heroku works swell Sinatra/Datamapper/Datastore on the Google App engine flow well. Rails is also successfully running on the app engine so this choice is open too. IMO Heroku's a little easier to deploy to.
