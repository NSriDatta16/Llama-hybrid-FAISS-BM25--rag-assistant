Although Wood 2006 said that p-values shouldn't be trusted, Wood 2013 said that they should be fine. See help("summary.gam") for the references and further explanation. Computation of p-values does not take into account uncertainty of the smoothness parameter, but according to the documentation, this should not be a problem unless the uncertainty is too high. Furthermore, Wood in the GAM book section 6.10.3 says the following about the bootstrap: An alternative might be to use bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty, but this is typically much more expensive, requiring a model fit per bootstrap replicate. In addition bootstrapping is somewhat problematic when there are penalties present. Non-parametric bootstrapping results in some data appearing twice in the bootstrap sample, which leads to under-smoothing (consider leave-one-out cross validation to see why this will happen). Parametric bootstrapping is made awkward by the presence of smoothing bias in the parametric model from which the samples are generated. If the expense of bootstrapping is tolerable, then a better approach to more complete uncertainty quantification is to take a full Bayesian approach, put priors on the smoothing parameters, and simulate directly from the posterior of the model coefficients.
