Do I need to close my connections to Amazon S3 in my Rails App?

I'm migrating my rails app to Heroku and need to change my file upload functionality to use Amazon S3 instead of local storage. I am using the aws-s3 gem and have this working but just want to make sure that I'm doing things right and not creating problems for myself. In my uploading code I have the following; AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!( :access_key_id => 'Not telling', :secret_access_key => 'Really not telling' ) AWS::S3::S3Object.store("#{self.name}", upload_file_field.read, 'my_bucket') This works perfectly but I'm concerned that I'm leaving some sort of connection to the server open. Do I need to close the connection once I'm done (e.g. with AWS::S3::Base.disconnect ) or can I just leave this as it is? Clearly I don't have a good understanding of the protocols being used behind the scenes with my connection to S3 but I don't particularly want to - I just want to make sure that this will work without causing problems.
