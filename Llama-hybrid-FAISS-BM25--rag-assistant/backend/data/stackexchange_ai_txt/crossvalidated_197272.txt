The truth is PCA contains an inherent assumption of linearity, i.e. that changing the basis can reframe the problem to provide a more discriminating view on the data. Does it have to be true when working with Zipf/power law following data? It depends on whether all your variables are of the same distribution. If so, you could take a logarithm of the values of all columns and perform PCA with sensible results. Power law makes your variances explode, PCA will of course yield results, but they will be hard to interpret without making a mistake of arguing that a phenomenon is happening when it actually is only happening in the top 20% outliers. You can also try to use PCA to see the major differences, then divide the data to a point where the long tail is separated from the top outliers and then a PCA on the tail? A good tutorial on PCA with assumptions can be found here: Jonathon Shlens: A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis. CoRR abs/1404.1100 (2014)
