How do I code a histogram, pice chart, etc?

Hint: this may be a thinly disguised request for a FOSS component which alraeady does the same. But, if such a beast is not forthcoming, then how do I go about it? Given a series of (x,y) data, what's the best way to display them in manamagentspeak? Just some pretty pictures ... charts/graphs/histograms/scatter graphs/pie charts ... Edit: When I said FOSS I ought to have stressed that I need something which can be used in a commercial applciation ...
