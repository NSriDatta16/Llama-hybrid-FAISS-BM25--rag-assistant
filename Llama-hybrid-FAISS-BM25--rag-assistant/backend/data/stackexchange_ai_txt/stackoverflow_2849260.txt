Generally when you want to process each row individually, use a data flow, otherwise it may be better to use a Sql Command. Personally I'd go with writing the SQL where I can. It's easier to optimise later and (usually) faster as well. Google will give much more detailed answers. Another factor to think about is the provider you use for your connections. You need to make the decision based on your needs. We use postgres DB, so we have to create a load of staging tables for some processes, which speeds the whole thing up. You should also take into consideration the box it is running on, if you have an all powerful DB box, and a little ETL box, there'd be no point in running anything. If you do all your processing on the ETL box you'll be dragging a lot of data across the network as well.
