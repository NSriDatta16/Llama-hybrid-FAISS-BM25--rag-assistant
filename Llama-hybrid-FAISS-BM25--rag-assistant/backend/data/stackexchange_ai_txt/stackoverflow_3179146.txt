How to change "site_name" in Drupal 6

This is probably a really obvious question, but it's driving me nuts. We have a drupal installation and we need to change the site_name and site_slogan variables. It sounds like it should be easy, but I just can't find an option anywhere in the admin panels to do it. The only place I can find is in the initial installation script I know I can write some code to call variable_set('site_name',...) to do it, but that seems like a last-ditch solution; I'd rather do it the correct way. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks.
