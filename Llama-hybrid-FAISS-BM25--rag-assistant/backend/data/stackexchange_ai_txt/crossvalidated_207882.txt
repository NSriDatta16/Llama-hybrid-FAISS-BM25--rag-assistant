My answer is USA based. Your mileage may vary. First off, the "over-under" is usually a single number. You are betting the score is >= that number. You can be sure that statistically, the final score of the game is likely to be that number. I don't know what the numbers you posted refers to. I don't think there is a single canonical answer for computing this. In the USA, staticians in Vegas usually sets the odds and bookies are required to balance their bets around this. The algorithm they use is certainly complicated and proprietary. But other agencies could compute slightly different numbers and you could have bookies around those too. The answer is complicated because it's not purely additive. You can't just say "on average Team A usually scores X ppg, and team B usually scores Y ppg, so the over/under is X+Y. That is because you can have ways of categorizing defenses, and you may then say "On average against teams with defenses like B's, A scores X ppg". Then there are other factors like "A scores more points when home than away". Most betting agencies probably use a propietary algorithm of: PPG by A PPG by B Points allowed PG by A Points allowed PG by B Who is home/away Weather (And looking at past scores in those settings) PPG by A against B historically PPG by A against B historically Injuries. ...etc. Many factors like this. It is probably a giant regression equation, but the feature set is vast. EDIT: in conclusion, you cannot simply re-create this value. It is some proprietary algorithm that the sports betting agencies compute. It will change daily, or even multiple times per day, up until a cut off point, as new information is assessed (e.g., a player gets hurt during training that week).
