LTV formula calls for Avg Order Value * Purchase Frequency * Lifespan--what to do when Lifespan is less than 1 year and Purchase frequency is 1?

Let's say hypothetically that you have the following: Looking at 5 years worth of data, we have in one group: $200 Avg. Order Value 1 Purchase Frequency (1 lifetime purchase) Using the lifespan for all customers, they average 0.5 years. So when we look at the 1-time purchasers, and apply: AOV * PF * Lifespan Or: LTV = $200 * 1.0 * 0.5 = $ 100 How would it make sense to someone that the LTV for a 1 time purchaser is less than their average order value?
