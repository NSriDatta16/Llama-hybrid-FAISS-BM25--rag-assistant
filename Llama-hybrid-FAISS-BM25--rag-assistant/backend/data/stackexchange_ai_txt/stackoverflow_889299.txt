What do you use for Staging / Deployment Artifact Servers?

I am thinking about writing my own release storage server and before I do this, I'd like to know what people use to see integration instead of create. So what do you use to store your builds for internal access? I'm looking for a web app that allows me to upload artifacts and then reference them by various tags so I can group them together by component or release vehicle. I also want access controls per build by readiness or promotion. I define staging as placing built artifacts on a server for communities of users to access . The artifacts are usually zip files containing either applications or libraries + documentation. The user communities are developers, QA, and service delivery/operations. Basically, the creators, the checkers and external-users. We release artifacts individually and as groups in a release vehicle (e.g., release 1.1 contains foo 1.0.1 and bar 1.0.7). Depending on the artifact, we may want to restrict access. Operations shouldn't be able to access pre-released builds and we may want to track who downloads a limited availability release. So, I'm hoping to find a tool that does most of what I want with a good extensible design so I can add in what I don't have. Any one know of a good tool for managing the builds post-build? Examples might be: quickbuild/lunt build Team forge build forge Jira & confluence as a set sonatype nexus home grown SVN repository using branching to promote builds from dev->Qa->GA
