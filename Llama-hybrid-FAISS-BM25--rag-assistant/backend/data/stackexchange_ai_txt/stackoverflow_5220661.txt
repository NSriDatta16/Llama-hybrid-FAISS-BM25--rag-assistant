Building openears compatible language model

I am doing some development on speech to text and text to speech and I found the OpenEars API very useful. The principle of this cmu-slm based API is it uses a language model to map the speech listened by the iPhone device. So I decided to find a big English language model to feed the API speech recognizer engine. But I failed to understand the format of the voxfourge english data model to use with OpenEars. Do anyone have any idea that how can I get the .languagemodel and .dic file for English language to work with OpenEars?
