No, that will not work. You're confusing an instance with a database. A database is the physical storage of the data and metadata. The number of disks you use and the location of the disks is up for management. You can put indexes one place, data in another; you can put some data on local drives and some on mounted drives. That's a database. An Instance is the memory structures and computer processes which access a database and make it possible to query it, write to it, update it, etc. When you say @DB_LINK... you're saying "That set of memory and cpu processes". When you say Tablespace, you're saying "On those files, on those disks" If you want to store data on the same drives that your @dblink is storing data then mount that drive and build a new tablespace there. If you're trying to OPEN the database with more than one instance, that's called RAC and it's bit over your head.
