Measuring sticks to minimize error

I encountered the following problem while preparing for an interview: There are two sticks $A$ and $B$ with different lengths. In addition, you are given a ruler. However, the ruler is not perfect: any measurement you make has error according to a $N(0, \sigma^2)$ distribution. How can you measure $A$ and $B$ to minimize the variance of the error? I thought about this for a while, and the best solution I came up with is just measuring both sticks many times and averaging. I don't know if there's a better solution or not. Particularly, I noted that I'm not really using the fact that there are two different sticks at all. My technique of just "measuring and averaging" would work with one stick as well. I'm not sure if I can use the extra stick to my advantage, or something like that?
