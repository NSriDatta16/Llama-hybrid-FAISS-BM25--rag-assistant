What I'd do, is sniff the user agent of the browser with javascript, and add a class to the element, based on that. That way you don't have to rely on any kind of hack, you just write your selectors based on the class: .safari .misbehaving-div { } I believe there is already a JS framework that does exactly this, but I don't remember the name.
