Lets see if this helps you. I had the same issue where I used a navigation based application and set up my search, rotation etc.. BUT, when I clicked on the table cell I was directed to the next view but that view did not have a back button present. I tried to add a title to the back button but that did not work so this is what I did. I opened the mainWindow.xib file and added a Bar Button Item to the group of other items inisde the window (where the file's owner is located). I then assigned an image to the button (you can add text here if you want). Then I clicked on the Navigation Item and hit command 2 to open up the Navigation item connections and chose the back bar button item and dragged it to the bar button item I wanted to use for my back button. And there you have it.
