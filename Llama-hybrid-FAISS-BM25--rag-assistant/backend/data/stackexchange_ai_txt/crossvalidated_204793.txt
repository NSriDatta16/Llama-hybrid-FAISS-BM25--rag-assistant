Good books for learning Applied Probability?

I'm looking for a book that provides deep, rigorous coverage of probability theory, but with an emphasis on material that is mostly useful outside of a mathematics department. I've heard "The Theory of Probability: Explorations and Applications" is pretty good, but I wanted to get some other suggestions. For example, Achim Klenke's book is way too much for me...it's organized for theorem proving, not applications as far as I could tell. Also not a big fan of Durrett's books from what I've perused, or Billingsley or Feller...again, too much of a mathematics research focus.
