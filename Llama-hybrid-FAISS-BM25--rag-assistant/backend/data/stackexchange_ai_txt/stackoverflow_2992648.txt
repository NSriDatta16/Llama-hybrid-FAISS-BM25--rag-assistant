Ah - thanks for the clarification. The elements you want to drag are being created after the drag/drop initialization. You need make them draggable: for example, add 'dragMe' as a class to the items. Once the list is populated from the server, then make those items dragable: $('.dragMe').draggable(); I would really look into jQuery's ajax functions and their autocomplete To clarify and for jquery (against your cited example): function showUser(str) { $.get( 'getuser.php', { q: str }, function(data) { $('#txtHint').html( data ); // add the returned content to #txtHint $('#txtHint').find('.dragItem').draggable(); //make the new items draggable }, 'html' ); } In your php, change your display so it is blocks that can be dragged. while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { echo " "; // see how we're adding the 'dragItem' class? echo "Firstname " . $row['FirstName']; echo " "; } past that, you'll really want to do some more research to get a better idea of whats going on.
