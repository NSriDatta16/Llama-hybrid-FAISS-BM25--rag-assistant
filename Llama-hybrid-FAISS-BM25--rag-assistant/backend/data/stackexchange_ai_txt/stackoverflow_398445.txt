That's just a matter of preference. When you read the code, distinguishing between variables and pointers is easier in the second case, but it may lead to confusion when you are putting both variables and pointers of a common type in a single line (which itself is often discouraged by project guidelines, because decreases readability). I prefer to declare pointers with their corresponding sign next to type name, e.g. int* pMyPointer;
