Predicting binary values with binary independent variables in logistic regression

I have two variables both are binary. I would like to see how well one predicts the other. Is it possible to do this in logistic regression? variables are coded as 0 and 1 but 1 does not indicate that something is 'correct'. can I still use logistic regression to see how well it is predicted?
