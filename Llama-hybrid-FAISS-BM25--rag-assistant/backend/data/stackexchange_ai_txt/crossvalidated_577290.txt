Conditional independent variable in logistic regression

First time on Cross Validated, so here goes. I am running a logistic regression where I am trying to predict the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event. I have a number of independent variables, two of them are not independent from each other - the presence and absence of a valve (categorical variable) and the size of that valve (double-precision floating-point variable). Because the size of the valve is dependent on the presence of a valve, for records where there is no valve present, the size is NA/missing. Obviously this is a problem because we have missing data - although it's intentionally missing, not missing due to randomness. Here is my question - I am assuming I should not include both the presence of a valve and the size of the valve as variables in the model. Therefore, is the best approach in this case to bin valve size to 'small', 'medium', 'large', and have the category 'none' to account for the absence of valves? This would mean treating size as a categorical variable. Maybe logistic regression is a sub-optimal analysis framework?
