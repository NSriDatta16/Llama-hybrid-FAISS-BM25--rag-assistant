Look at the graph! The green line indicates the average disk queue length. At one moment, it gets a peak and the CPU goes to 0 afterwards. IO Writes also goes to 0. It goes back to normal until a second peak is shown. Then CPU and IO writes return to normal. Then both IO and CPU drop again, to go up again at the next Queue peak. And again down, then up again... It could be that the disk is doing the physical writes at that moment. However, it could also be that the system is doing a disk validation at that moment, reading the dat it just wrote to validate the writes, making sure the data is written correctly. Another thing I notice is the 2.7 GB size. Since you're running this on a Windows system, I become a bit suspicious since that's about the amount of memory that Windows can handle, as a 32-bits process. The 64-bits Windows will provide the application up to 3 GB of RAM (a bit less) but then it needs to release it again. You might want to use Process Explorer to check the amount of RAM in use and the amount of IO reads. And perhaps use a 64-bits Perl version...
