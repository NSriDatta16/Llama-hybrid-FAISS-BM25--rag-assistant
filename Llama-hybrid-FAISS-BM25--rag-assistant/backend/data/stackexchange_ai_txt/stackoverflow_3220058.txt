Positive feedback

I have a matching game, where a user can drag the answer from the left column to the right. I'd like to provide some positive feedback to the user with some eye candy. I'm thinking of the letters on the right-hand side exploding like fireworks, or doing some sort of animation, like running off the screen in a random direction. You know, fireworks like what happens when you win at Spider-Solitaire.
