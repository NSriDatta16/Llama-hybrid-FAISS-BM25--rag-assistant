How to test an Machine Learning or statistic NLP algorithm implementation pack?

I am working on testing several Machine Learning algorithm implementations, checking whether they can work as efficient as described in the papers and making sure they could offer a great power to our statistic NLP (Natural Language Processing) platform. Could u guys show me some methods for testing an algorithm implementation? 1)What aspects? 2)How? 3)Do I have to follow some basic steps? 4)Do I have to consider diversity specific situations when using different programming languages? 5)Do I have to understand the algorithm? I mean, does it offer any help if I really know what the algorithm is and how it works? Basically, we r using C or C++ to implement the algorithm and our working env is Linux/Unix. Our testing methods only focus on black box testing and testing input/output of functions. I am eager to improve them but I dont have any better idea now... Great Thx!! LOL
