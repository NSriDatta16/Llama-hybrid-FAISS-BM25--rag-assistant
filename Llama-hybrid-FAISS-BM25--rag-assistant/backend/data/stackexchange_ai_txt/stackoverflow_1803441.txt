Here's a partial answer, I expect you can figure out the rest. I fired up the Figures editor and opened the plot tools. I dragged an arrow from the palette onto my figure. Then I generated an m-file. This included the line: annotation(figure1,'arrow',[0.1489 0.2945],[0.5793 0.6481]); So, the first pair of coordinates is the start of the arrow. You're going to have to figure out the pointy end (second pair of coordinates) using a little bit of trigonometry. You might even be able to get the little arc if you do some more fiddling around with plot tools. Let us know if the trig defeats you. Oh, and I forgot to plot the point, but I guess you can figure that out ?
