Passing a variable into a models after_initialize method

I have the following (heavily simplified) model, that uses will_paginate class Search 1 end end and the controller code in my show action is @search = Search.new(params[:search]) This all works fine, but notice i hard coded the page number to 1, problem is passing params[:page] value into the after_initialize method, can anyone suggest an elegant way to do this please? Thanks
