You're pretty much stuck putting the tags back within the form tag if you want normal asp.net behavior such as the events to fire. That being said, if you are stuck on using the jQuery modal, I don't think triggering the postback is such a bad thing. As you mentioned from the linked/related question, you can get the postback reference GetPostBackEventReference in your code-behind and pass in the control who's event you want to fire, such as: //assuming your button is btnMyButton and Page.ClientScript.GetPostBackEventReference(btnMyButton, null); You could attach this javascript call to any other button, including the button you're moving around outside the form tag. This will essentially wireup the postback and raise that control's events as usual. Not the most elegant solution but I think you're on the right track with it if you need to use jQuery modal.
