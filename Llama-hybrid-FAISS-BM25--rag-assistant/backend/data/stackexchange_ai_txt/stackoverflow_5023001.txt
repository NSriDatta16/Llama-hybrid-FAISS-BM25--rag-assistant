Is it possible to use Eclipse IDE as just a text editor?

Is it possible to use Eclipse IDE just as a text editor (with features like sytax highlighting, etc., possibly with extra features) , by dragging files into it or using a 'File>Open' kind of thing, without creating any "Projects" and the like, editing the files and saving them to their original location? Is this a feature built into Eclipse, or would a plugin be necessary? (In case the language makes a difference, this is for Python, although information for other languages would also be useful.)
