Watching changes in Mac OS X

Im working in a security app for Mac OS X and i need to watch any activities in the computer like USB, firewire, network interfaces, audio IO, disc drives and the sudden motion sensor. I found out out how to detect USB/Discs devices using the DiskArbitration framework, ideas of how to detect non-storage USB/firewire devices and all other things listed above are very welcome! Thanks in advance!
