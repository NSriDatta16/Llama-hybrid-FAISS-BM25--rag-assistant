To create a bookmarklet in general or just how to display the box using javascript? Adding your stuff to the body in the top-right corner Let's start with the latter part - you tagged jquery, so lets go with that (might be a bit heavy for a bookmarklet, though): // create the element: var $e = $(' '); // append it to the body: $('body').append($e); // style it: $e.css({ position: 'absolute', top: '10px', right: '10px', width: '200px', height: '90px', backgroundColor: 'red' }); that's all you need for that... Easiest way to create your bookmarklet and include jquery What we need to do: Save the code from above into a javascript file hosted on your server. create a piece of javascript code that adds jquery and your newly hosted javascript file to the current page's body place that javascript code inside an tag. This is the code to do that: javascript:var i,s,ss=['http://yourdomain.com/path-to-your-script','http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js'];for(i=0;i!=ss.length;i++){s=document.createElement('script');s.src=ss[i];document.body.appendChild(s);}void(0); It's just looping through an array and attaching tags to its body with the path to both javascript files as src . As for creating the bookmarklet itself, you just place all the code inside tag, sort of like this (watch out for double-quotes): Drag me to your toolbar And that's it. Note that the bookmarklet actually overrides the jquery version used on the site, if there is one .. could break some sites...
