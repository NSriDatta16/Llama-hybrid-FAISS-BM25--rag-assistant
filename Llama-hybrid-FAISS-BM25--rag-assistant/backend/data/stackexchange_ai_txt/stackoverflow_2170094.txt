What temporary data structures can you use? With push and pop, and no temporary storage for n elements, accessing data near the bottom of the stack would be impossible without storing the rest -somewhere-. If top (equiv to {x=pop();push(x);return x} ) was replaced with shift , it would be perfectly doable - the stack would change into fifo (shift+push; pop would fall into disuse) and it would allow for an easy bubblesort on currently available elements.
