Is testing for cookies in a Django website standard?

I'm new to web development and I'm trying to develop my own prototype. There are certain ragged edges with my code. I'll lump together making the markup cross-browser compatible, detecting if JS is turned on for the client browser, and testing if cookies are enabled for client. General question, but does pretty much every site out there test for cookies within their login view? I know how to do this, I was just curious if it's so blatantly necessary. Obviously, if cookies are disabled, the auth framework won't work. How often do clients turn off cookies these days? Might be a naive question or I may have answered myself but hey, I'm curious.
