Multiple inheritance suffers from the Diamond Problem , which has not been (agreed upon how to be) solved in PHP yet. Thus, there is no multiple inheritance in PHP . BaseClass /\ / \ ClassA ClassB \ / \/ ClassC If both ClassA and ClassB defined their own method foo() , which one would you call in ClassC ? You are encouraged to either use object composition or interfaces (which do allow multiple inheritance) or - if you are after horizontal reuse - look into the Decorator or Strategy pattern until we have Traits (or Grafts or whatever they will be called then).
