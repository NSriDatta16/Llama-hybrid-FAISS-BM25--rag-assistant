How can you map the exceedance of a threshold into an activation function of a Neural Network?

I am totally new to Artificial Neural Networks. Letâ€™s say that the model you are trying to turn into an artificial neural network has an output that is triggered only by the exceedance of a threshold: $y\geq y_{1}. $Therefore, you need to find a way to use this inequality as an activation function. Is this feasible?
