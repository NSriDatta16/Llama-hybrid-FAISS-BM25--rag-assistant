Haskell import declaration

I started to read about monad transformers and what puzzles me is Control.Monad.CatchIO 's import declaration which I see in many code examples: import "MonadCatchIO-transformers" Control.Monad.CatchIO (finally) What does this quoted token mean? I took a look at the Haskell 98 Report's section on import declarations , but this didn't help me understand.
