I am not sure if I understand your question correctly, but if you have time series $A_1$, $A_2$ and $B$ and are interested in whether $A_1$ can help predict $B$ beyond the history of $B$ itself, then you would build a VAR model just for $A_1$ and $B$ to test that. If you built a VAR model for $A_1$, $A_2$ and $B$ instead, you could only test whether $A_1$ can help predict $B$ beyond the own history of $B$ and the history of $A_2$ (unless you restrict the coefficients on the lagged values of $A_2$ to be zero in both the null and the alternative model in the likelihood ratio test; but that would effectively mean working within the bivariate model for $A_1$ and $B$ instead of the trivariate model for $A_1$, $A_2$ and $B$).
