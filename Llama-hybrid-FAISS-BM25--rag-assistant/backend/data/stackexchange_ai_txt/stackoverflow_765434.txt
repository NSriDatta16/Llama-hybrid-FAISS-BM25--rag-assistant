glReadPixels from FBO fails with multisampling

I have an FBO object with a color and depth attachment which I render to and then read from using glReadPixels() and I'm trying to add to it multisampling support. Instead of glRenderbufferStorage() I'm calling glRenderbufferStorageMultisampleEXT() for both the color attachment and the depth attachment. The frame buffer object seem to have been created successfully and is reported as complete. After rendering I'm trying to read from it with glReadPixels() . When the number of samples is 0 i.e. multisampling disables it works perfectly and I get the image I want. when I set the number of samples to something else, say 4, the frame buffer is still constructed OK but glReadPixels() fails with an INVALID_OPERATION Anyone have an idea what could be wrong here? EDIT: The code of glReadPixels: glReadPixels(0, 0, width, height, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, ptr); where ptr points to an array of width*height uints.
