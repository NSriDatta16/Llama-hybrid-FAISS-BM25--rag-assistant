Can't get my access_token using Rails and the OAuth gem

I am developing my Rails 3 application that uses Twitter OAuth and I am getting troubles because apparently I can't get the access_token, after clicking 'Allow' and Twitter redirecting me back to my application url, when I go to twitter.com/settings/connections I can't see my app there as authorized. I guess there is something wrong in my controller, I hope you can point them: class OauthController 'http://localhost:3000') session[:request_token] = request_token.token session[:request_token_secret] = request_token.secret redirect_to request_token.authorize_url end def callback @access_token = client.get_access_token(:oauth_verifier => params[:oauth_verifier]) render :json => access_token_get('https://api.twitter.com/account/verify_credentials.json') end protected def client @consumer = OAuth::Consumer.new( 'key','secret', :site => 'https://api.twitter.com', :authorize_url => 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize', :access_token_url => 'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token' ) end end Please help, tell me where is my mistake, thanks for the attention!
