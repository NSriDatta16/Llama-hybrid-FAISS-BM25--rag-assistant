It would be best to admit redundancy in this case, to improve speed. To the news table, add these fields: comments_count int not null default 0, likes_count int not null default 0, hits_count int not null default 0 When a comment/like/hit is added/deleted, if the database supports triggers, trigger an increment/decrement of the referenced counter, and if not - do it manually on each insert/delete (stored procedure maybe?). This type of data is more often read than written, so to optimize read speed, slowing down write speed and storage space isn't a big deal. From time to time, it would be OK to run a query that would update these counters if by some reason they become erroneous.
