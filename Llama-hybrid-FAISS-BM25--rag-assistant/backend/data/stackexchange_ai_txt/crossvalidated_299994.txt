Clustering Markov Chains

Assume I have a finite set of elements $$A={X_0,X_1,...,X_{n_1}}$$ where every element is itself a finite Markov sequence (i.e. $S_{i+1} \sim P(S_i)$) $$X_i={S_0,S_1,...,S_{n_2}}$$ Suppose I also have a set of transition matrices $$P={P_0,P_1,...,P_{n_3}}$$ My problem is as follows: I know $n_1$ and $n_2$ (i.e. I have sampled a set of sequences) but I do not know $n_3$ (i.e. I do not know how many transition matrices there are and henceforth do not know how they look like). In addition I do not know which transition matrix $P_i$ was used for every Markov sequence $X_j$. Is there any way I can cluster the Markov sequences $X_j$ to belong to transition matrix $P_i$? For example: $(X_0, X_3, X_5)$ were most likely generated using $P_0$, $(X_1, X_2, X_6)$ were most likely generated using $P_1$ etc. I can imagine there are two problems to solve here: How to determine the amount of transition matrices (i.e. the amount of clustering groups) How to cluster the Markov sequences to belong to such a certain group. Any feedback is greatly appreciated! Perhaps there is a well known method on how to accomplish this or maybe you can think of some method that might be able to achieve this?
