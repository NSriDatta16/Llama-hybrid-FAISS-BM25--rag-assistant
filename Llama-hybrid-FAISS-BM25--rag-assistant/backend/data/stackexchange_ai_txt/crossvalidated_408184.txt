What is the relation between ELBO and SGVB?

Evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be maximized, so that to find the most appropriate approximative distribution of the target distribution, which is equivalent to the minimization of the corresponding Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence . The paper that introduces variational auto-encoders (VAEs) uses the SGVB (stochastic gradient variational Bayes) formula rather than ELBO. What is the difference between these?
