At one point in my career, I maintained parts of TCP/IP stack. That puts me in the somewhat rare position of knowing very well that IP addresses should not be used as anything other than Network-layer addresses. Any association between an IP address and a location is all but coincidental - it's an artifact of the way addresses are distributed, not any fundamental part of what an IP address means. (They're also not useful as the unique identifier of a computer, but that's a different story) I suggest leaving geolocation out of it. The HTTP standard includes a way for a browser or other user agent to include the users culture preferences with each request (and remember, it's a list of weighted preferences, not necessarily just one culture). Since the browser is closer to the user than you are, you should honor this request, at least as the default. It's ok to then permit the user to change their preference for your site, either temporarily or permanently. It's even ok to allow the user to choose to view different content with different culture settings. A wild example would be a site that includes both political news and technical information. It's quite reasonable that someone would want the news in their "natural" language, but the technical information in English. Finally, it's ok to have a fallback pattern. If, for instance, you have a site that services users based on their region (resellers, for instance), then it's possible that Japanese content only exists on your Asian regional sub-site. A Japanese-speaking user visiting your EMEA site might just be stuck seeing English content, which might very well be his last choice.
