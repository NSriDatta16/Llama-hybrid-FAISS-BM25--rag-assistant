From the getExternalStorageDirectory's doc : Applications should not directly use this top-level directory, in order to avoid polluting the user's root namespace. Any files that are private to the application should be placed in a directory returned by Context.getExternalFilesDir, which the system will take care of deleting if the application is uninstalled. Other shared files should be placed in one of the directories returned by getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(String). Your /mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.test/files should be in your Context.getExternalFilesDir() and it gets deleted when the app is uninstalled.
