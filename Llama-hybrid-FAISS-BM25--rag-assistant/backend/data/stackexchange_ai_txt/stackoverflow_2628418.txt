How does a portable Thread Specific Storage Mechanism's Naming Scheme Generate Thread Relative Unique Identifiers?

A portable thread specific storage reference/identity mechanism, of which boost/thread/tss.hpp is an instance, needs a way to generate a unique keys for itself. This key is unique in the scope of a thread, and is subsequently used to retrieve the object it references. This mechanism is used in code written in a thread neutral manner. Since boost is a portable example of this concept, how specifically does such a mechanism work ?
