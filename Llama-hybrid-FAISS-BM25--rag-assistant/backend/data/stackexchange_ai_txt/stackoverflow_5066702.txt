Monad Transformers are used for combining / extending monads (add capabilities of one monad to another). E.g., ReaderT (Reader Transformer) enriches given monad M with Reader capabilities (transforms given monad into Reader retaining original features of M ). At the same time, Monad Transformers are normal monads that have bind , return , and other operations. You can find examples of monad transformers in Scalaz - e.g., for Reader and State monads.
