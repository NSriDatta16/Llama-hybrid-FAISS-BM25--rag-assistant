IMPLEMENT_APP is a macro used in wxWidgets to create an entry point to the program without worrying about whether the program will be compiled on Windows, Mac, *nix, or whatever. As a result of this, IMPLEMENT_APP has to define main (or its equivalent, such as WinMain ). You might find the IMPLEMENT_APP_NO_MAIN macro to be useful. Check the other IMPLEMENT_APP_XXX functions in wx/app.h, too. This paragraph from the wxApp overview is a little helpful too: Note the use of IMPLEMENT_APP(appClass), which allows wxWidgets to dynamically create an instance of the application object at the appropriate point in wxWidgets initialization. Previous versions of wxWidgets used to rely on the creation of a global application object, but this is no longer recommended, because required global initialization may not have been performed at application object construction time.
