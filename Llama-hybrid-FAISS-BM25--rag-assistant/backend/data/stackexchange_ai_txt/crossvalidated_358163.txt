How to estimate the kernel of a Markov process with continuous state-space, from a finite sample?

With a discrete state-space discrete time markov chain, given a sequence of sample data $X_{1} \dots X_{n}$, I might estimate the transition probabilities $P_{ij}$ using relative frequencies. From our sampled data, if from state $i$ we transitioned to state $j$ a total of $n$ out of $m$ times then I might just estimate $\widehat{P_{ij}} = \frac{n}{m}$. Similarly, for a continuous state-space, but discrete time markov process, what techniques exist to estimate the stochastic markov kernel if I have a sequence of real-valued sample data $X_{1} \dots X_{n}$?
