Is the likelihood statistic applicable for model selection in machine learning?

Minimising the likelihood ratio statistic is often used as a criterion for model selection in connection with linear and related models and statistics such as as AIC are an extension of this practice, but much of the time the examples given are related to models of a similar type using differing predictors. Is it still reasonable to use the likelihood ratio statistic to compare the performance of completely different models as long as they are on the same data set - e.g. to compare a decision tree to a neural net or an appropriate GLM?
