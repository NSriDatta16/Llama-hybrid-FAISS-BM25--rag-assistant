There are a variety of complicated methods you could use to test this, but I think one that balances simplicity, with accounting for the autocorrelation in financial time series, would be to use generalized least squares. Here you would have a single explanatory variable which is 0 or 1 based on if you are in the US CPI "UP" or US CPI "DOWN" category, and your response variable would be your returns (although you may want to use log returns). You would fit your GLS model and then see if the $\beta$ associated with your binary variable is statistically significant. More information about this method can be found in Introduction to Time Series Forecasting by Brockwell and Davis page 212, as well as in Appendix B.1.2. Also see the section Feasible Generalized Least Squares in this Wikipedia article . I would suggest modelling your residuals as a AR(1) or AR(2) model. I will also note that the problem with that Wilcoxon rank-sum test for your problem is you need to assume the samples are independent, but because of the autocorrelation in your time series this assumption is violated.
