How do I elegantly split pairs of words out of a string in Perl?

In perl, I have a string that roughly looks like my $str = "one 10 two 20 three 30"; Now, I'd like to split that string into word-number pairs, but have no success. I thought I could do a my @pairs = split /([a-z]+[^a-z]+)/, $str; and would then have $pairs[0] eq 'one 10 ' $pairs[1] eq 'two 20 ' $pairs[2] eq 'three 30' However, I get $pairs[0] eq ' ' $pairs[1] eq 'one 10 ' $pairs[2] eq ' ' $pairs[3] eq 'two 20 ' $pairs[4] eq ' ' $pairs[5] eq 'three 30' Now, I can use grep for my desired result: my @pairs = grep {$_ =~ /\S/} split /([a-z]+[^a-z]+)/, $str; But I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution to this problem.
