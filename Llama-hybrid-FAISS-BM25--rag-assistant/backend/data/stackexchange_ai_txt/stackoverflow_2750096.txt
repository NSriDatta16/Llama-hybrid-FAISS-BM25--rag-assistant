Use the notion of paragraph in in the StyledDocument with JTextPane.getStyledDocument. With the position of cursor, you know the current paragraph with StyledDocument.getParagraph(pos). Then you iterate throw the paragraphs from StyledDocument.getRootElements and children, to search the number of current paragraph, so the number of current line. Sorry for my english.
