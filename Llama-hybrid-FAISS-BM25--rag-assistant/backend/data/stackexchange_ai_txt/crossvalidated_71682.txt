As a side note, thinking of this as a classification problem rather than a problem of predicting the probability that $Y=y$ will likely run into trouble. For sample sizes this large it may be best to not use one of the families of ordinal regression models but rather use multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression. For example, if you used the proportional odds model, some non-proportional odds may result in bias that is not overcome by the lower variance of parameter estimates when compared to multinomial logistic.
