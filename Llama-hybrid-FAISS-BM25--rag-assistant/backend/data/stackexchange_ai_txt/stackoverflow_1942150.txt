A lot of the answers in this thread attempt to overengineer the solution. If I'm correct, you just want to store user settings. Use an .ini file or App.Config file for this. If I'm wrong, and you are storing data that is more than just settings, use a flat text file in csv format. These are fast and easy without the overhead of XML. Folks like to poo poo these since they aren't as elegant, don't scale nicely and don't look as good on a resume, but it might be the best solution for you depending on what you need.
