I've backed-up up to UNC's mmany times. Make sure it's not a permissions issue w/ the account that sql server and sql agent are running as. I wouldn't back up to the hidden admin share like that perhaps it's the $ that's causing the problem. Create a share and backup to that. \server\share NOT \server\c$\folder
