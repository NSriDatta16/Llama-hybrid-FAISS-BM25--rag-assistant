I the agile teams I work with, we dont manage task over a long period of time. Instead, we manage a "backlog" of features to be added to the product. We sometime also call those "user stories". This backlog is a kind of slicing of the product in a list of incremental features to be delivered. We manage this backlog in Excel, with very few columns such as description, complexity evaluation and done/not done, iteration, and that's it. During the iteration, the tasks are managed in a postit wall as presented in one of the answers. In case a task last more than one iteration, we manage to fragment it, ensuring features/user stories are delivered at each iteration. An example of user story in the excel backlog, it would have complexity associated with it: "The user can log on the system using a form with id and password" Some examples of associated tasks, to be done during an iteration. Those will be managed with postit, with not complexity. "Code the logging form, using GWT" "Implement security algorithm to check password validity" "Create a user/password table in the database" "Test the logging form on the integration system"
