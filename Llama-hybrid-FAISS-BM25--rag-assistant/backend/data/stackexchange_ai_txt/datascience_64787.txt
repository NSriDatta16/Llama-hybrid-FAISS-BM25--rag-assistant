How can calculate Efficiency for predictive models based on accuracy or error over time?

I was wondering if I could express the efficiency of prognostic models according to their accuracy(error, e.g. MAPE or MSE) over time [sec]. So let's imagine I have the following results for different predictive models: models MSE MAE MAPE predicting Time[sec] LSTM 0.12 0.13 15.67% 456789 GRU 0.06 0.05 5.89% 688741 RNN 0.45 0.51 25.33% 55555 What is the best way to illustrate the efficiency of predictive models over predicting time? Is the following equation right? how about its unit when we use MSE or MAE instead of MAPE which is expressed by % ? \begin{equation} \text{Efficiency} = \frac{Accuracy}{predictingtime }= \frac{error (e.g.MAPE)}{predictingtime }= \frac{percentage}{sec} \end{equation} which graph demosntraete efficiency scientifically for prognestic models? I read this article and the introduce following criteria under name of prediction efficiency PE . is it possible to use such that?
