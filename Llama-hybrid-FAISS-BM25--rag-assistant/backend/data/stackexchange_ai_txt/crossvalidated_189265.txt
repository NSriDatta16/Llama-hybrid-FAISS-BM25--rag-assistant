Like a contrast, a hazard ratio is a ratio of instantaneous hazards, or a difference of log hazards. Unlike a contrast, the referent group, the denominator hazard, is fixed. You can go one step further with this information. One can calculate a difference of hazard ratios (on the hazard ratio scale) using the delta method. I think most contrast implementations will give you this. Usually, you can tell this is the case because the contrast CIs are symmetric on the hazard ratio scale. Differences in hazard ratios are nonsensical to me. Differences in log hazard ratios become, themselves, hazard ratios between two groups of interest when exponentiated. This makes sense. When using contrast functionality, it's important to perform all calculations on the linear predictor scale before exponentiating the output. The "bottleneck" in your plot is given by the referent group: i.e. women who are 50 years old. So the predicted hazard ratio for men who are 70 is a ratio of their predicted hazard over that of women who are 50 years old. This is completely different than the phenomenon attributed to the differences between confidence and prediction intervals. Your predicted hazard ratio for 70 year old men would be interpreted as an interval in which, if the study were conducted an infinite number of times, would be expected to contain $100\times(1-\alpha)$% of other fitted hazard ratios. No matter how many times the study is redone, women who are 50 will always be the referent group, so their HR is always 1. That's why you observe the bottleneck in the plot. Therefore, there's no way to get rid of it. I also note that your predicted hazard ratios are symmetric on the hazard ratio scale. I believe that you are not accounting for the fact that the covariance matrix applies to model effects on the linear predictor scale (log-hazard), and the fitted "hazard ratio" is exponentiated. To calculate asymptotically correct confidence intervals on the hazard ratio scale, you will need to apply the $\delta$-method, i.e. $$\widehat{\log \left( \lambda_{t}(X_i)\right) - \log \left( \lambda_t(X_0) \right)} = \mathbf{X} \hat{\beta}$$ But the hazard ratio is given by: $$\frac{\lambda_{t}(X_i)}{\lambda_{t}(X_0)} = \exp \left( \mathbf{X} \hat{\beta} \right)$$ You can easily apply the delta method to obtain what the approximate variance of the transformation of linear predictors is. EDIT On further inspection, I suspect the issue has to do with how pspline codes the continuous variable age. Can you show the output of pspline? I bet it standardizes the variable to some reasonable average or median value, so that age=50 becomes 0 and therefore a referent value.
