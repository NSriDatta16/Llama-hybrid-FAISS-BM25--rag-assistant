Delta function in the context of Gaussian processes

I am learning gaussian processes from the book Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning , Chapter 19, page 400, section 19.1.2. A snapshot from the text, I failed to understand the use of delta function here, why, the equation can't simply be written as, $$p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) = \int_\mathbf{w} \mathbf{\Phi w} p(\mathbf{w})$$ Am I missing something trivial?
