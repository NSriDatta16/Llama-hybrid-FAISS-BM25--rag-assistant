The denominator in the expression for the posterior is called the marginal likelihood or the evidence. One way to think about it is as a normalizing constant that ensures the posterior integrates to 1. This means the numerator is proportional to the posterior. In some applications (e.g. inference using MAP estimation or some MCMC methods) that's all we need, and the normalizing constant can be ignored. This is convenient because the integral is often inconvenient (or outright intractable) to compute. I think this is also what's happening in your example. The numerator is calculated at a grid of points, then re-scaled so that the maximum value is 1. The goal is probably just to inspect/plot values that are proportional to the posterior. The log of the numerator is calculated at a grid of parameter values. The max is then subtracted before exponentiating. The reason to calculate things this way is to avoid numerical overflow/underflow, as Glen_b mentioned. As above, this is probably just for plotting purposes--for inference, we can often work directly with the log and no re-scaling is needed.
