What's faster? Searching for shortest path in a matrix or a list?

I have to store some cities and the distances between some of them and then search for the shortest path. The cities and the distances are read from a file. I started with doing a matrix but saw that it took too much space(more than double) so I changed to a list. Each list item stores 3 things: point1, point2 and the distance between them. So for example I have this file: Athens Stockholm 34 Stockholm Prague 23 which when I read is stored in the array as this: _____0______ ______1______ point1 | Athens | Stockholm | point2 | Stockholm | Prague | distance | 34 | 23 | ------------ ------------- Then I got some doubts.. This surely saves space but is it going to take more time to go through? The list is an array but the connections(edges) are placed in an arbitrary way and that's why I started thinking that it may take more time than if I used a matrix.
