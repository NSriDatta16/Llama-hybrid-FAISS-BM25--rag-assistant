Having IOC container globally available is not a best practice. Even passing container is not encouraged . If dependency injection can not be used (you need to create\request objects after component has been created) then you can: Use hand-coded factories (factory is injected to the component and component uses factory to create other objects) Use Autofac delegate factories or new auto-generated factories in Autofac 2 .
