Serializing a java object

I'm trying to serialize java objects but i keep getting a list of errors. my program accepts multiple values and creates an instance of a class with them. the created object then gets stored in a StorageSystem class... it looks something like this aCD = new CD(title, artist, playTime, numOfTracks); store.addItem(aCD); Then in the storage system i add the stored object to an arrayList... what i also want to do is add the object to a serialized file... my method for doing this is below... Am i going about this the wrong way. thanks... public void addItem(Item hold) // adds object to the ArrayList { itemList.add(hold); totalStored++; FileOutputStream f_out; try { FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream("thequeue.ser"); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fout); oos.writeObject(hold); oos.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }
