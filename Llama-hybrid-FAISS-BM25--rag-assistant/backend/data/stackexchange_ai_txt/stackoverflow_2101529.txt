"Bad binary signature" in ASP.NET MVC application

We are getting the error above on some pages of an ASP.NET MVC application when it is deployed to a 64 bit Windows 2008 server box. It works fine on our development machines, though these are 32 bit XP. Just wondered if anyone had encountered this before, and has any suggestions? Details as follows: Bad binary signature. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131192) Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. Exception Details: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: Bad binary signature. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131192) All projects are set to compile for Any CPU, and are compiled in Release mode. The ASP.NET site is precompiled, and the precompiled build is on a 64 bit Windows 2008 TeamCity build agent. Thanks in advance. EDIT We're still plagued by this. I have looked at all the binaries in the website's bin directory using corflags.exe. None has the 32BIT flag set, and all have a CorFlags value of 9 except for Antlr3.Runtime.dll which has a value of 1. The problem only affects certain pages, and it seems to be those which use FluentValidation (including FluentValidation.Mvc and FluentValidation.xValIntegration assemblies). None of these shows anything out of the ordinary when inspected with corflags.exe, and there are no odd looking dependencies revealed by ildasm. When built locally (32 bit Windows XP) the site deploys and runs fine. When built on the build agents (64 bit Windows 2008 Server) the site displays these errors. The site runs in Integrated Pipeline mode, and is not set to 32 bit. The stack trace is: [COMException (0x80131192): Bad binary signature.
