Picking a model when everyone in the dependent group has the outcome

I have a project in which a group of people have all had an adverse effect (dependent group). I want to find out whether a set of variables such as smoking, exercise etc. (independent variables) have a statistically significant effect on having an adverse effect. I've thought about running a logistic regression (adverse effect: no/yes) with the independent variables. But the problem is, everyone would be in the "yes" group. Would that be the correct thing to do? Usually when I've worked with logistic regression, not everyone in the dependent group has had the outcome so I'm not sure if that changes things.
