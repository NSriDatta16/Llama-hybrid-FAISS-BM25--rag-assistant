categorical predictors in a GLM

I need some help answering a homework question, Question I have entered the data into R using assignments data I then used output = glm(obese ~ male + white + younger, family = binomial) to model the data. But this doesn't seem to be working. I've not really used much R before for GLMs or logistic regression and I don't understand how to get GLM from categorial, binary predictor variables. If someone could explain the theory behind because searching online I have only found answers where the response variable is binary and this seems straight forward.
