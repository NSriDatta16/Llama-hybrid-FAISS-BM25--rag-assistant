I agree it's a wording error. Feature extraction in this context should mean participation of outputs from model a) in the inputs to some other model (not necessarily of the same type). For example, we could run textual inputs through transformer model like Bert, and use resulting vector as features along with simple text stats as words count, avg length etc to predict sentiment of the text using, let's say, xgboost model.
