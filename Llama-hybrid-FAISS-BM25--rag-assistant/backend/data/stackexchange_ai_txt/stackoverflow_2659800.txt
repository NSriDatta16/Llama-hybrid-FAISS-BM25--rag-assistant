It's good you're asking for help, please don't let what I'm about to say discourage you--keep working at it! There are a lot of issues with this, so I'll just toss out a few: this doesn't really do anything because it doesn't return anything (if $sql is global, it shouldn't be) en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection or die(...) wouldn't belong in a string builder like this--it's not going to handle SQL failures here since all it's testing for is if the given line succeeds.
