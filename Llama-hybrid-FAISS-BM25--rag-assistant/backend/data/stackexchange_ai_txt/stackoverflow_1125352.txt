Can I retrieve the domain name and user name by searching Active Directoy using C#

All, I have a big list of user emails, and I need to get the username and domain name for each one of them. My organization contains lots of domains and our users log on to their machine using usernames that are different from their email addresses. Please advise if we can write a C# utility that can search AD using the email of each user, or if we can do it in a simpler way.
