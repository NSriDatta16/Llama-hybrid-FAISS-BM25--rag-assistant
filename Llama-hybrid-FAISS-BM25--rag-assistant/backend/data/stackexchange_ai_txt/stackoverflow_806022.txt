What exactly are you trying to achieve? HTTP is HTTP, whether it's Sharepoint or not. You can access the mobile version of your Sharepoint site using Mobile Safari by going to http://yoursite/m/ . It's not pretty, but it lets you complete most basic tasks. You could access the full version if you wanted, but I'd doubt all the javascript in use would work properly. Ultimately you'll be constrained by the capabilities of the device. I'm sure a WEBDAV-enabled Sharepoint client is perfectly possible (in fact I know several apps use WEBDAV to allow using the iPhone as portable storage), but would you really want to be downloading/editing/uploading documents on your iPhone? You could potentially do something involving the Sharepoint web services, and build a custom interface around them (it's all just plain HTTP), but I can't see the benefit over the supplied web interface.
