It appears to be undocumented *, but setting the revert property to a number will treat that as the speed (or more specifically the duration in ms). So something like this gives a pretty quick revert animation: $("#sortable").sortable({revert: 100}); (Aside: It's a pity they haven't kept it consistent with draggables, which use revertDuration to specify the speed of the revert.) *Edit : It looks like in the latest version it is now an officially documented feature .
