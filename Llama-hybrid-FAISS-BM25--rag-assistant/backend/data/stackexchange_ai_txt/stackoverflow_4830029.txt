Let's split your big problemn into smaller ones. First, you want to have items of your Price column to be displayed according to a specified format, which you can achieve using a TableCellRenderer (which, when rendering numbers, will use a NumberFormat to display the correct number of decimals). As your table has only two columns of different types, the simplest solution is to use JTable#setDefaultRenderer(Class columnClass, TableCellRenderer renderer) . This way, your numbers will always be displayed using the correct number of decimals. Second, for your edition issue, the same solution can be rather elegant : call JTable#setDefaultEditor(java.lang.Class, javax.swing.table.TableCellEditor) and set as editor a component one that will, before commiting change to your table model, ensure the new value is a valid number (valid of course according to your rules).
