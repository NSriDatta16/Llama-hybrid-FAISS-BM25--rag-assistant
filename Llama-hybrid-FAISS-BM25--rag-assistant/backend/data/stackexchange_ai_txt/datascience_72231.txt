One thing that you can do to try to optimize Brier score, is often done in Kaggle competitions. Is optimize another loss and do early stopping with the Brier score. One Example would be minimizing classic binary logistic loss and per iteration plotting the Brier score. The binary logistic function will keep being minimized but the Brier doesn't have to be. At some point, Brier can start increasing and there is when you stop your training and not based on the binary classification results. You could perform this experiment using different loss functions and see which one is performing better. Here there is some links about early stopping: https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/16/what-is-early-stopping-in-machine-learning https://www.kaggle.com/vincentf/early-stopping-for-xgboost-python Is there away to change the metric used by the Early Stopping callback in Keras?
