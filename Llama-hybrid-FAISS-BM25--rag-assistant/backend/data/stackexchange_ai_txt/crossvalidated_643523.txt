Check if my time series is forecastable using Shannon entropy

According to this answer: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/95232/141037 , is possible to verify the forecastability of a time series using the Shannon entropy, the lower the Shannon entropy value, the more forecastable it is. My question is: the time series I use for forecasting tests (regression problem) is windowed (shape (videos, frames, frame height, frame width), I applied a sliding window to it). Can I use this windowed time series to calculate shannon entropy?
