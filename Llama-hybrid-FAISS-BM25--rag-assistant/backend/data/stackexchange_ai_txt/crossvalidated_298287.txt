No this breaks no theoretical basis for Bayesian inference, nor for Variational inference. However, it may make your computation more complicated. Depending on the form of variational inference this may be more or less of a concern. For example, in mean-field variational inference you will likely break the nice, closed form solutions you get when you choose the conjugate priors.
