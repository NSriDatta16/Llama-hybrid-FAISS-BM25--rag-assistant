You read SQL queries that are stored in your views. So, the overall speed depends of what is actually in your view... Tricky design... To avoid log file grow, you can change the recovery mode of your database to single. That is normally the default under SQL server express 2005. Otherwise, you have to backup your database first, then shrink the log file. SQL server agent is not available in sql server express. If you want job scheduling, you must write it yourself or use a thirdparty product.
