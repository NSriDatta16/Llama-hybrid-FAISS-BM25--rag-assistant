Sample modification or weighting for partially paired data?

I want to analyze age and gender related differences of serum levels of an antibiotic agent, which was administered to 1200 patients during 1700 infectious episodes (1-12 infectious episodes and thus antibiotic serum levels per patient). Serum levels are not normally distributed. Do I have to do some sample modification prior to testing the differences regarding age and gender? Even though there are multiple samples per patient, the second sample is from another infectious episode and has nothing to do with the first and so on. So am I allowed to simply count each of the 1700 serum levels as separate?
