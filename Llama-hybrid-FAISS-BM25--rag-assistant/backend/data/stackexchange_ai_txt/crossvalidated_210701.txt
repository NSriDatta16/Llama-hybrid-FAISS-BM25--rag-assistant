Did frequentist statistics try to squash Bayesian ones?

From http://www.bayesianphilosophy.com/dont-ban-p-values/ : When Frequentists dominated statistics from about 1930 to 1990 or so, they engaged in every kind of draconian, career destroying, and underhanded method possible to squash Bayesians. I wonder at which degree this claim is exaggerated ? (I hope it is exaggerated...) I heard/read this kind of claims several times with various degrees of intensity and I wonder whether it is completely baseless or comes from specific striking articles/attacks/periods/... ?
