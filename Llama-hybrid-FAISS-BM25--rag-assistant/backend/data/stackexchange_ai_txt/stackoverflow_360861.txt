thanks for all the answers. The actual business use case is not creating orders, but if I tried to explain the actual business I'd have to write a couple paragraphs. The bottom line is managers need to moderate changes on a deeply nested object graph, before they "go live." I like the transaction table idea. I also like saving two versions of the "order," one with changes, one without. I guess I'll have to dive into both and see what happens.
