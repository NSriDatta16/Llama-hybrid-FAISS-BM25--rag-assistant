Your variable really has 3 levels, not 2: Got married Already married Not married and didn't get married So you should consider adding in 2 dummies, one for "Already Married" and another for "Not Married", with "Got Married" as the omitted category (or shift around to whatever makes more theoretical sense). If you restrict your sample to only include individuals who are not married at time=0, then your interpretation of the coefficient on "has child" changes. It becomes the average change in log-odds among those that were not married at time=0. I don't think that is what you are looking for. Also, keep in mind, you should be careful running the restricted sample model compared to the full model with a logit regression. You cannot necessarily compare logistic regression models across different samples, because of the latent scaling factor/unobservable heterogeneity in a logit model. See this post for a more detailed description. You can include interaction terms if you believe the effect of having children is different for those that got married vs those that were already married vs those that never married.
