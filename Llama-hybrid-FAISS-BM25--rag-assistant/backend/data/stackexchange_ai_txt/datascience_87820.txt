I need help on how I would go about solving this problem, my apologies for the vague title

I'm a beginner in the Data Science field and I'm trying to find a way to solve this problem, but I'm not sure where to start. Here's the situation: I have a battery that stores and discharges energy into my house from the power grid. Energy is produced by different generation techniques throughout the day and so I have data on the emission impact of using electricity at different hours. I also have data on the energy I've used in the past year. My goal is to charge and discharge this battery in the most effective way for reducing the emission impact of my home. If anyone can point me in the right direction for what I should know and use to solve this problem I would be greatly appreciative!
