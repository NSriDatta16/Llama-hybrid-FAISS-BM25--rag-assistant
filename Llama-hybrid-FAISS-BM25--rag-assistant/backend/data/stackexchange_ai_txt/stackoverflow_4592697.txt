Is it possible to embed Qt Assistant as a widget inside my application?

We're running one of our apps on a 8" touch screen and want to add help to it. Launching Qt Assistant from a menu item works fine for desktop applications, but for touch applications it's far from ideal. I haven't been able to figure out if it is possible, or permitted to do so? QAssistant.exe itself seems to come with some license restrictions, but maybe there's another way to do this, like embedding a small web-browser or something. Have anyone else tackled this, or something similar?
