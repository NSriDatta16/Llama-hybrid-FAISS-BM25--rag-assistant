Since the Theil-Sen thingy is robust to outliers by virtue of dealing with medians, I guess the natural Bayesian regression model is one with a t-distribution with unknown degrees of freedom (or other fat tailed distribution, e.g. double exponential might be closest in spirit) replacing the normal distribution of classical regression. In this case the prior for the slope is not so important because fatter tails for Y allow occasional outliers without affecting the slope estimate. The degrees of freedom in the relevant t is, in a complete analysis, marginalised out of the joint posterior. Some discussion of this class of models can be found in chapter 14 and 17 of Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis . A choice of distributions is explored in chapter 8 (stacks) of the BUGS Examples Volume one.
