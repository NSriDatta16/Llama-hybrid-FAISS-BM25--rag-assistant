Heteroscedastic errors in logistic GLM - a problem?

I am fitting a logistic GLM (assumed binomial distribution) with a random intercept and slope: DV ~ 1 + IV + (1+IV|subject) The DV is the number of successes of 200 Bernoulli trials. I want to extract the subject-wise intercepts and use them for an ANOVA to check whether the intercepts differ with treatment levels. I'm not concerned about inference in my GLM I strictly use it to extract intercepts for the ANOVA. The residuals of my logistic regression show clear heteroscedasticity of the residuals: I checked if the residuals vary systematically with IV levels, but this is not the case. Now, I have read different accounts of the heteroscedasticity problem in logistic regression and some people say that it's not a problem and even expected, however I'm still worrying that this will cause trouble for my second level ANOVA. I'd be glad if someone could help me in assessing the gravity of this heteroscedasticity problem and whether I should worry about it.
