To quote from Wikipedia , a $\sigma$ -algebra is defined as $\Omega$ is in $\mathcal F$ , and $\Omega$ is considered to be the universal set in the following context. $\mathcal F$ is closed under complementation: If $A$ is in $\mathcal F$ , then so is its complement, $A^c$ . $\mathcal F$ is ''closed under countable unions'': If $A_1$ , $A_2,\ldots$ are in $\mathcal F$ , then so is $A=A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ \cdots$ From these properties, it follows that the σ-algebra is also closed under countable intersection (by applying De Morgan's laws).
