When AutoReg was first included in Statsmodels in e.g. v0.12, it used the AIC definition from Lutkepohl's book New Introduction to Time Series Analysis, which computes the AIC based on a version of the likelihood that excludes the constant term. This accounts for the very large difference you see here (+6 vs -771). In version 0.13 this was changed, so that if you upgrade Statsmodels, you will not see this large of a difference between the values. However these two models are not the same: AutoReg uses least squares to estimate the parameters, and so the likelihood reported is from the conditional log-likelihood function (i.e. conditional on the initial datapoints). SARIMAX uses unconditional maximum likelihood estimation, and so it reports the unconditional log-likelihood. So you shouldn't choose a model by comparing the AIC from a model estimated via AutoReg to one estimated using SARIMAX , even if the values look like they are of a similar magnitude.
