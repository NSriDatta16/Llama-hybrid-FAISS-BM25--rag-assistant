Does Django have a built in way of getting the last app url the current user visited?

I was hoping that Django had a built in way of getting the last url that was visited in the app itself. As I write this I realize that there are some complications in doing something like that (excluding pages that redirect, for example) but i thought I'd give it a shot. if there isn't a built-in for this, what strategy would you use? I mean other than just storing a url in the session manually and referring to that when redirecting. That would work, of course, but I hate the thought of having to remember to do that for each view. Seems error-prone and not very elegant. Oh, and I'd rather not depend on server specific referral environment variables.
