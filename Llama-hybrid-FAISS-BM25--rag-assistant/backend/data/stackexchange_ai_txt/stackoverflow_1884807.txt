Magento - Buy X Get Y Free - Realistically, Buy one get one free BOGOF

I have successfully setup a shopping cart rule to allow a user to purchase 2 products and get the third free. I used the "Buy X Get Y Free" option and have inserted '1' into the Discount Amount field and inserted '2' into the Discount Qty Step. I have decided to even further entice my offer and allow the user to purchase only 1 product and get the second free. But when I update the Discount Qty Step to '1', the shopping cart is not even running any type of discounts, no matter what qty of products I have in my cart. Am I completely missing the boat on this or can someone please explain to me how I can successfully run a 1:1 ratio on the Buy X Get Y Free option in the Shopping Cart Rules. Thank you in advance!
