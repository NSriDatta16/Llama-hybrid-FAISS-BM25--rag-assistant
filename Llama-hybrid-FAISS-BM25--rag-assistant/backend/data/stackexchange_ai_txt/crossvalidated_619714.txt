There is nothing wrong with the procedure, I believe. I don't think it's 'standard procedure' to have all predictors independent, though. Predictors are rarely independent (unless one uses e.g. components from a PCA as predictors). Indeed, for interpretation, dependency between predictors matters, because coefficients represent the expected increase in the dependent variable, if an predictor increases by 1, while all other predictors remain constant. The latter may be unlikely with dependent predictors. Dependence between predictors does make the coefficients / the parameter estimates less precise. But this will be reflected in their standard errors, which will be larger when correlation between predictors increases.
