Assigning a substitute value in case of nil

I have a few variables: name age address phone social_security email weight And an array called personal_details with each of these values in positions 0-6. So I assign values like this: name = personal_details[0] address = personal_details[1] phone = personal_details[2] social_security = personal_details[3] email = personal_details[4] weight = personal_details[5] In some cases, however, the data on the right hand side does not exist. What's a more elegant way to handle this than writing something like this for each element in the array? if !personal_detail[0].nil? name = personal_details[0] else name = "" end if !personal_detail[1].nil? address = personal_details[1] else address = "" end
