If a model doesn't know what to predict, then it just predicts the mean of the data. As your predictions go to the future, they are more uncertain; therefore, they are closer to 0. If you plot your image with uncertainty bands, you will see that the uncertainty increase with the time as the average predictions are getting closer to 0
