Classification on multivariate time series

My dataset: 121 individuals characterized by a categorical variable let’s say Y (so 121 values of Y) for each individual, I have 5 time series, let’s say X1, X2, X3, X4, X5. each time series contains 6000 points. All the time series increase over time, with abrupt changes, and end with a plateau. I want to build a classification model to understand which time series (or features of the time series, like abrupt changes, or combination of these features) explain and then predict the best the variable Y. I am not used to work with time series, and I have found that the "Time series" analysis models are mostly around forecasting from existing data, and so I spent time looking for a clear procedure explaining how to handle this type of data for this specific purpose without much success. What I have tested (see below) is always based on one time series (matrix of 121 × 6000) at once since I do not understand how to deal with several time series: unsupervised clustering of each time series (hclust and kmeans) a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract features and application of a decision tree on the extracted features. Here I do not understand how to interpret the features (wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficient) regard to the initial data. Any help or recommendation for a tutorial will be welcome. Thank you in advance.
