I don't know about your shell script, but I know you should be using the right tool for the job. That tool is AWK. It was designed specifically for this task and, if you are using UNIX (or Linux, or Mac OS X or whatever) you have it installed. This is the one-liner: awk '{ sum+=$2; count+=1 } END {print "Sum =",sum; print "Count =",count; print "Average= ",sum/count}' test2.dat Read the guide for AWK . The philosophy of UNIX is DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL . Use the right tools, buddy. Good luck,
