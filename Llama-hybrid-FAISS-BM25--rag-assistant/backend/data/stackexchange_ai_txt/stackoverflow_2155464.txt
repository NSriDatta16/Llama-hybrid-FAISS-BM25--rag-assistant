Are there any easy ways to generate OpenGL code for drawing shapes from a GUI?

I have enjoyed learning to use OpenGL under the context of games programming, and I have experimented with creating small shapes. I'm wondering if there are any resources or apps that will generate code similar to the following with a simple paint-like interface. glColor3f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0); glBegin(GL_LINE_STRIP); glVertex2f(1, 0); glVertex2f(2, 3); glVertex2f(4, 5); glEnd(); I'm having trouble thinking of the correct dimensions to generate shapes and coming up with the correct co-ordinates. To clarify, I'm not looking for a program I can just freely draw stuff in and expect it to create good code to use. Just more of a visual way of representing and modifying the sets of coordinates that you need. I solved this to a degree by drawing a shape in paint and measuring the distances between the pixels relative to a single point, but it's not that elegant.
