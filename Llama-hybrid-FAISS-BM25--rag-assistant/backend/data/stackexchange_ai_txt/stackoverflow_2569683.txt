FYI: this post is long over but I'm just browsing and I have an easy method for this so I thought I'd give an answer in case someone else looks through it. I found that I can't drag a popup button directly to the toolbar in Interface Builder from the Library. However, I can drag a popup button from the window to the toolbar. So I create the popup button on the window first and then drag that to the toolbar... it works! The same with other objects.
