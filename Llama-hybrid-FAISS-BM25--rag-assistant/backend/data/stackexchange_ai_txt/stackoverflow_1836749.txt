Possible to sit on the network and receive a TCP stream/UDP datagrams?

Has anyone out there done the work of sitting on top of a packet capture interface (like jpcap) with an implementation of UDPSocket (for UDP datagrams) and InputStream (for TCP streams)? I suppose it wouldn't be too hard to do given the callback API in jpcap, but has anyone out there already done it? Are there any issues with doing this (do I have to figure out how to reassemble a TCP stream myself, for example?)
