make a protected property public

I'm trying to extend a class like panel so that I can fire click events only when the title area is clicked on. The title area is a protected uicomponent of Panel called titleBar. So I want to make that component public. It seems like I'm almost there but I'm getting a "TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference." when it tries to add an event listener to the titlebar. here is my extended panel package custClass{ import mx.containers.Panel; import mx.core.UIComponent; public class ExtPanel extends Panel{ [Bindable] public var TitleBar:UIComponent; public function DragPanel(){ super(); TitleBar = super.titleBar; } } } Here is a trimmed version of the AS I'm calling in my function that is creating a new panel: var newPanel:ExtPanel = new ExtPanel (); newPanel.TitleBar.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,mouseDownHandler); The error is pointing to the last line. What am I missing? Thanks Edit: Per the answer below I am now trying this: package custClass{ import mx.containers.Panel; import mx.core.UIComponent; public class extPanel extends Panel{ public function extPanel(){ super(); } public function getTitleBar():UIComponent{ return this.titleBar; } } } And then this in the AS: newPanel.getTitleBar().addEventListener(MouseEvent.ROLL_OVER,over); Still getting the same error. This is totally new ground for me, what is my next step?
