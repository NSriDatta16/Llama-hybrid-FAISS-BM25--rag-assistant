To my understanding you have a binary dependent variable and several independent variables, some categorical and some continuous. Logistic regression is the standard choice unless there are specific reasons to chose another modeling strategy, and I can't see that here. However, logistic regression in its basic form assumes that all observations (rows) are independent. That is, every row should come from a different individual. If not, you have to apply a more complex design. But let's assume that the observations are independent unless you say otherwise. I'm not very good at excel except for really basic stuff, so I don't know how to do a logistic regression. I'm sure there are tutorials online. I don't know SQL either, so I can't help you there. But I would recommend using R. Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve, but setting it up and run a logistic regression isn't that difficult and I'll give you the basics. You can start by downloading RStudio which is a programming environment for R I'm not sure, but I think that R itself is included when you install R. Else, you'll just have to google and find out how to download it and install it. Once you have started it, you should watch some R tutorials on youtube or do some tutorials online, that's how I did. Ok, so now you're ready to run some logistic regression models. In R, you can first install a package that lets you run .xlsx files to import your data: install.packages("xlsx") library(xlsx) Now you load your data and create a data frame that we'll call data1: data1 Input path, file name and sheet name as appropriate. You can now take a look at your data: View(data1) Ok, ready for the logistic regression. We'll use the glm() function and we store it to an object called m1. y is your dependent variable and x1-x3 are independent variables (the variable names should correspond with the names in data1). m1 So, we now have a logistic regression model with three independent variables. The summary command gives you some info, perhaps most interesting to you right now are the Estimate (log odds ratios) and Pr(>|z|) columns (p-value). To get the odds ratio you can just type exp(value_of_estimate_of_interest) Or to get all odds ratios you can type: exp(summary(m1)$coef[,1]) To get the 95% confidence intervals you can type: confint(m1) And if you want them as odds ratios: exp(confint(m1)) Now you can try different models as you like: m2 Etc. The * means that you also create an interaction term between x1 and x2. I hope this helps. Good luck!
