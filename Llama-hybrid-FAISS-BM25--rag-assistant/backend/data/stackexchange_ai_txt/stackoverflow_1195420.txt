Just a stab, but you may be able to leverage the volatile keyword, here's an example of using a volatile bool to check state between processes on different threads . You could probably adapt that methodology to meet your needs. Flip it depending on whether or not the msg came across on the second dialog {EDIT} In relation to the PreProcessMessage, I believe that is only for Keyboard input, not mouse. You'd probably have to override WndProc to get those events, that's most likely why the overridden PreProcessMessage isn't firing. Good Luck!
