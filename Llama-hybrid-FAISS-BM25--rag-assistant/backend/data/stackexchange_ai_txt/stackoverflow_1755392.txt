Supressing warnings for a codeblock using gcc 4.1.2?

I have a section of code that uses a Boost library that results in a lot of these type of warning messages: class x has virtual functions but non-virtual destructor Using g++ 4.1.2, how do I temporarily disable warnings for this codeblock then enable them again after it. Everything I try (pragma gcc diagnostic, etc) seems to only be supported by a later version of g++. How do I suppress just these warnings?
