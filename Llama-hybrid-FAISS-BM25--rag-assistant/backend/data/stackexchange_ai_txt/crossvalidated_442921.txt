Different coefficient estimates from ncvreg and glmnet in logistic regression

I'm trying to compare the results from glmnet and ncvreg in logistic regression. The methods have similar coefficients estimates in the case of lasso ( alpha=1 ). It seems they are very different for the other values of alpha . The difference increase as alpha value gets smaller. I have attached the estimates resulted for alpha=1,0.7,0.2,0.01 . I believe that both of the methods use the same loss function and penalty function. Both of the packages standardize the predictors first, obtain the coefficient estimates and scale the coefficients to the original scale. What is the reason for the different coefficient esimates? library(ncvreg) library(glmnet) # Binomial data(Heart) X
