If you have the mean and sd of each group separately then you cannot do it. If you have the mean and sd of the differences and the number of pairs, and are willing to make the necessary assumptions, you can do it, since the formula for the paired t-test is $ t = \frac{\bar{d}}{\sqrt{s^2/n}} $ where the numerator is the average difference, s^2 is the variance and n is number of pairs.
