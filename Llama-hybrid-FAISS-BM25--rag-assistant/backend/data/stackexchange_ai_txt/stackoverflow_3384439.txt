how can I get wordpress to tell me which function rendered a specific piece of output

I've found the List Hooked Functions method to display all the elements that are contributing to the final render, but I want to see which of those functions is ultimately responsible for rendering a specific piece of output. Ideally, it would work similarly to Magento's Template Hints so the responsible code is listed right next to the resultant output. I guess I could write a function that hooks into each event and attempts to find the last function in the chain of hooks for that particular component... Any thoughts appreciated. Thanks, Jonathan
