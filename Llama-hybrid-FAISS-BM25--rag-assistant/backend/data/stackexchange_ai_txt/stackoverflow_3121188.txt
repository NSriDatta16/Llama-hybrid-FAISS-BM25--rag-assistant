Make visual studio autoformat my source code?

I've searched but does Visual Studio 2008 have a setting for C# where it will autoformat/beautify my code as I write it? There is a setting for VB.NET called "prettify". I've also searched the archives already and found a macro to execute this on save and I know I can drag and drop it onto the toolbar but I want it to work without my doing ANYTHING for both ASPX and CS files. Is this possible via built-in setting, modification, or available from an add on? Thanks
