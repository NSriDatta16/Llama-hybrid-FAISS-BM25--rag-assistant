Is it possible for the .NET WebBrowser control to use IE9?

I realise it's an early release and unstable. I wouldn't dream of swapping out the default webbrowser control for IE9 in any other project, but in this case I specifically need IE9 to compare alongside other versions. I'd like to have the .NET WebBrowser control use IE9 instead of the default version of IE on the machine. I have full control of the machine so it's no problem to hack away at system files or whatever else may be necessary. Normally, this could be achieved by installing the update to IE, but in IE9's case, it installs a separate application, leaving the current version of IE untouched. This means the WebBrowser control continues to use the current version (which makes sense and was a smart move by MS, since IE9 is still under development). But in my (edge) case I need the WebBrowser control to use IE9. Is it possible to embed IE9 in a .NET forms application? EDIT With Hans Passant's help I'm getting a bit further. Something very interesting is happening within IE9's prog files directory. There's a directory called "iepreview.exe.local" which, when removed, makes the IE9 Preview app use IE8 (checked it with the acid3 test). Not quite what I want, but I'm wondering if this is some kind of redirection that I could exploit for my needs. EDIT 2 I've tried applying the .local hack to both my copy of iexplore.exe and my .NET app and I've noticed something else interesting - both apps began using IE7 instead of IE8 (my version of IE) or IE9. Could this be iexplore trying to use IE9 and then falling back onto IE7? Seems strange it would even have IE7 available, but that's the useragent string it starts using.
