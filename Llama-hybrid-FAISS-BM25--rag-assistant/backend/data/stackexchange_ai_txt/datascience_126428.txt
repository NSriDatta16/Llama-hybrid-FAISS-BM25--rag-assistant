Residuals magnitude is larger than Seasonality magnitude after performing seasonal decomposition

I'm working on the analysis of a dataset containing time series of hourly traffic congestion in a certain city, during a period of 23 years (number of data points: Roughly 24 X 365 X 23 = 201480). I wanted to spot annual seasonality in the data, so I used: from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose daily_avg_cong = df.groupby("Date")["Hourly_cong"].mean().reset_index() ts = daily_avg_cong['Hourly_cong'] result = seasonal_decompose(ts, model='additive', period=365, extrapolate_trend='freq') Trend and Seasonality seem to reflect the data properly - the trend shows the expected increase over the years, and the Seasonal component shows a cyclic pattern that is in line with what I would expect from observing the data. My problem is the magnitude of the Residuals, especially compared to the Seasonal component. Residuals magnitude is 2-3 times more than the Seasonal component. Here's a plot of all the components: If I understand correctly - the Seasonal component affects the time-series values less than the Residuals. Is this conclusion correct? Does that mean that fluctuations in traffic congestion due to noise are more "meaningful" than the annual pattern? Thanks! Edit: Following a suggestion by @brewmaster321, here's the hourly decomposition. I find it hard to interpret, would appreciate any kind of help with this. For example, I would have expected a smoother trend. I'm adding one example of seasonal period since it's impossible to see on the main plot: Edit #2: Following another suggestion by @brewmaster321, I used MSTL in order to decompose the different components, but the residuals/seasonality magnitude ratio doesn't seem to change much: Seasonal components look OK when inspected on a smaller scale that allows seeing their periodic nature (each line represents 5 random years/weeks/days): I'm just guessing, but is it possible the magnitude of each seasonal component is not larger than residuals' magnitude, but I should actually look at the combined magnitude? This makes sense to me since each data point "contains" these 3 seasonal components. Again, shooting in the dark here and would appreciate any kind of help or guidance.
