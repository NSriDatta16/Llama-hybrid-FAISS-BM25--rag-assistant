Is the geocoding service changed?

We are using the Google Maps API method getLocations() for geocoding addresses the user supplies. This used to work (up until yesterday) using only street names like "Drottninggatan". But as of today, that method returns error 602 instead of an array of possible matches. Did Google change anything yesterday, or what else have happened? We've checked our own code and nothing new is deployed since the 7th of April. EDIT: We are using v2 for this service, but another where we've upgraded to v3 has the same problem EDIT2: I created an issue on Google with this - please star it there if you want the issue to get attention Google Maps Issue
