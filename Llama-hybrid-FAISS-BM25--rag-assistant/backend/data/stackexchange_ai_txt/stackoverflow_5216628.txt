how to take file as input and ignore the new line character

The following is the content of fasta fileA: >1 PLAARRPRRGKSLAGFESLACSFPVVSRGFLASRSARSLSSEGGTMPDNRQ PRNRQPRIRSGNEPRSAPAMEPDGRGAWAHSRAALDRLEKLLRCSRCTNIL REPVCLGGCEHIFCSNCVSDCIGTGCPVCYTPAWIQDLKINRQLDSMIQL >2 PLWRPAVPDAGRARPVWSRWSAASLWFLKASLLPALRGAFHPKAGRCRIIGS RGTGSRGSAPGTSLVPRPPWNRMVAVPGPTVAPRSTAWRSCCAARVVLTF*E SLCV*EDVSTSSVVIV*VTALELDVQCVTPRPGYKT*R*ID >3 TPPLWRPAVPDAGRAWPVSSRWPAASRWFPEASLLPALRGAFHPKAGRCRII GSRGTGSRGSAPGTSLVPRPPWNRMVAVPGPTVAPRSTAWRSCCAARVVLTF now i need to take the fileA as input and find out the mismatches present between 1 and 2 and then 1-3 and also find out the nucleotide change between them. I have written a program so far but it doesn't take fileA as input. kindly help my problem is i need the fileA to be given as input, and the sequences contains new line character after every 51 nucleotides and my program considers the new line character also for finding out the mismatches. Program: $a=<>;$b=<>; @mul=("$a","$b"); for($i=0;$i
