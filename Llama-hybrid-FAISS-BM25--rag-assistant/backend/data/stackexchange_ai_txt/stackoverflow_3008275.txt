At first glance this looks like a problem I had with integrating TinyMCE (a WYSIWYG editor) with GWT - generally, components like these don't like when the DOM changes - in this case, it happens when you switch tabs (in my case it was drag & drop). IIRC, the solution was to remove the TinyMCE widget from the text field it wrapped around when it wasn't shown on the screen. In your case, you'd want to remove the MapWidget from tabPanel, while it's not shown . I'm not familiar enough with the Google Maps API to know if there's a designated method to do that, but you can try a simple tabPanel.remove(googleMapsTab); .
