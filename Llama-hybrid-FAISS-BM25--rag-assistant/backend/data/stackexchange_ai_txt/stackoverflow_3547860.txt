Javascript Orientation Change doesn't work with PhoneGap on iPad

I'm adapting a small HTML/CSS/Javascript driven web magazine as an iApp for the iPad with the great mobile framework PhoneGap. Everything works great, except the orientation change from portrait to landscape mode. I use the following Javascript code in the header of the index.html (portrait): var isiPad = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) != null; var isiPhone = navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) != null; function updateOrientation() { if (isiPad || isiPhone) { switch (window.orientation) { case 90: window.location = "index_landscape.html"; break; case -90: window.location = "index_landscape.html"; break; } } } with the following body tag: If I rotate the iPad to landscape mode, it doesn't change to index-landscape.html. Does anybody know where the problem is? Isn't it possible to change the HTML file, while changing orientation within the PhoneGap framework? With other words, can I only use one HTML file (index.html) with PhoneGap and have to use CSS for the orientation change? If I check out the app as a website with the iPad Safari browser, the orientation change works properly. Thanks for any help!
