Recent deep learning methods using Restricted Boltzmann Machine have shown nice features on several data types (audio, images, text). Since these methods create a generative model, you can often generate really nice samples from the model. Check out Hinton's publications. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/ These methods aren't totally general (run same code on every data), but the underlying model is usually similar.
