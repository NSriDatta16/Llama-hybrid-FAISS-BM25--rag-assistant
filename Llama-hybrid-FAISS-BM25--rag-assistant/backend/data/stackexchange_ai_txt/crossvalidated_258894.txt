@Nikolas is correct, but I should address your question more directly: aren't we eliminating this variance characteristic Yes, the point is to eliminate the variance. We want to eliminate the variability because it's not needed and it influences our PCA analysis. Let me give you an example. If you have 100 USD and it's equal to 1000 Japanese JEN. Even the money is the same, but if you do nothing our PCA might put more weights on the Japanese JEN... We don't want the variance so we need to standardize it (by converting Japanese to USD).
