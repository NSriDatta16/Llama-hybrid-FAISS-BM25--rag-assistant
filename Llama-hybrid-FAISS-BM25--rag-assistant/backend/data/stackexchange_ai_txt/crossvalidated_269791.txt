It could make sense to train an embedding for your categorical data, if you can associate each category with likely contexts (analogously to training a skip-gram or continuous bag-of-words for word vectors). In the example that you give, perhaps you can differentiate salespeople from managerial positions using some chosen characteristics. My main concern with this approach is that you could easily overfit, since word vector embeddings are usually trained with millions of examples.
