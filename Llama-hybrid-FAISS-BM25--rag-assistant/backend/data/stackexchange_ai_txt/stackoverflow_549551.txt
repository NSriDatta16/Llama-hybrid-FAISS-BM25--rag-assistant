As others have said... don't test private methods directly. Here are a few thoughts: Keep all methods small and focused (easy to test, easy to find what is wrong) Use code coverage tools. I like Cobertura (oh happy day, it looks like a new version is out!) Run the code coverage on the unit tests. If you see that methods are not fully tested add to the tests to get the coverage up. Aim for 100% code coverage, but realize that you probably won't get it.
