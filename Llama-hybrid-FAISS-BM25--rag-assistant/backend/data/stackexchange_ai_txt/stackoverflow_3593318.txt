How do I refer to another property in a jnlp?

I want derby.system.home property to be the same as the above one. How do I achieve that other than by expliciting the same CDATA (so by value)? I guess what I'm asking is: how can I let the value of an element attribute but the same of another element, by reference? PS: I'm trying with this jnlp.
