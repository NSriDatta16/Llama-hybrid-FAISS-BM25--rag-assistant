Great question. I like your idea of non-developers contributing to the end-user documentation. This idea might motivate users and testers of your application to easily contribute to the documentation. The first thing that comes to my mind, is using a some sort of wiki engine. You could build a simple function in your WinForm application, that fires up a browser and directs in to the wiki. You could use the context from which it is called to build up an url; e.g. http://dev-wiki.mycompany.com/LoginForm?action=edit . Here the name of the form ("LoginForm") is used in the url of a wiki page. Alternatively, you could simply use the embedded web browser control for WinForms to access the wiki. That would look something like: var url = GetWikiUrl(myForm); browserControl.Navigate(url); This would be very easy to embed in your application. In a controlled (office) environment, this would be very easy to set up. In you production environment it might be a bit more difficult, but still doable. It might leverage some end-user contributions too.
