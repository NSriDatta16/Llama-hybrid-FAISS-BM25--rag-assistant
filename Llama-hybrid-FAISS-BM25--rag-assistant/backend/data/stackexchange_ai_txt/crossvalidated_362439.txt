Interpretation of coefficients from glm Gamma

I am attempting to fit a model to a dataset with frequency (Hz) is the dependent variable. Using a generalized linear model based on a gamma distribution seems appropriate since the values of the dependent variable are $0 \rightarrow \infty$ and I have confirmed that the observed values align with a gamma distribution using a qqplot. I am attempting to fit the model in R using glm , however it is unclear to me what the estimate values returned by summary.glm refer to. The example from the documentation is provided for context clotting |t|) (Intercept) -0.0165544 0.0009275 -17.85 4.28e-07 *** log(u) 0.0153431 0.0004150 36.98 2.75e-09 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 I assume these refer to one of the shape parameters of the fitted gamma distribution, but I have not been able to find a clear explanation. Do these values refer to the gamma distribution average $\mu = k\theta = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$? the rate parameter $\beta$ ? or the scale parameter $\theta$? Also, how should these estimates be interpreted differently in the context of a continuous independent variable (as in the example) verse a discrete independent variable?
