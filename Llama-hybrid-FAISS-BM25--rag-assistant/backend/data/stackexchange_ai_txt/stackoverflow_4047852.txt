Odd. Whether the compiler/linker strips them or not, the fact is, at the end of test execution, there is no record of them being executed. So if the tool can list all the functions, it should have no such evidence, and thus it should report "not executed". Our SD C++ Test Coverage tool does not have this bizarre behavior, at least not if you actually specify that the containing compilation unit or header file that is part of those that should be instrumented. (You might fail to list ah header file that contains a function body, and that won't then get reported). It will even report that a function, which has been inlined, has been executed, regardless of the number of places it has been inlined.
