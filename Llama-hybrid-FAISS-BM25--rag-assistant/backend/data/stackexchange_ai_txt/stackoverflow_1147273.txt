It would have been more elegant to design the tables so that you didn't have 5 spellid columns in the same table - i.e by having an item_spell table that would allow any number of spells per item. Apart from being more future-proof (when you find you now need 6 spells), your query would become: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) FROM item_spells WHERE spell_id NOT IN (SELECT entry FROM research.spell); As it is, you are forced to perform the check 5 times.
