Multivariate, multi-series time data more appropriate for regression or ARIMA/time-series?

I have the following case for which I am needing to forecast a value, say, 12 months out: Many individual entities each with their own time series. Each entity has the same data structure For each series, say 24 - 36 months of historical data exists (each entity is "created" and then "matures") Each entity will mature differently (and as of yet, unpredictably) so we'll use multivariate training data to hopefully capture that unknown signal in suspect variables We are likely only interested in that 12 month step forecast, and possibly only once (made early on, like 6 months in) Forecasts are to be made on new entities based on learning from the old I'm a bit at a loss as to whether this is better modelled with something like ARIMA/time-series like approaches (which I am less familiar with) or simply multilinear regression with some lagged columns. It seems a mix of the two to me, but is there any way in which either is more appropriate here?
