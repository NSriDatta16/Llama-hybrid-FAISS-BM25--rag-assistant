Basically you are finding the number of hours completed over the number of hours total. SUM(T.PercentComplete * T.Hours) computes the total number of hours that you have completed. (100 * 50) = 50 * 100 + (120 * 80) = 146 * 100 is the numerator. 146 hours have been completed on this job, and we keep a 100 multiplier for the percent (because it is [0-100] instead of [0-1] ) Then we find the total number of hours worked, SUM(T.Hours) , which is 100 + 120 = 220 . Then dividing, we find the weighted average. (146 * 100) / 220 = 0.663636364 * 100 = 66.4% Is this what you were wondering about?
