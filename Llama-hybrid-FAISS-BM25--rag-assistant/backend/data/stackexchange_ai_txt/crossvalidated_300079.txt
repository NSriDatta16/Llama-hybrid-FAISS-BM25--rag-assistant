Why is the success rate low and yet still better than random guessing?

I'm reading Introduction to Statistical Learning. It mentions on page 166 for KNN modeling that a success rate of 11.7% is more than double that of random guessing. My question is, first what is the success rate of random guessing and why is the success rate for KNN so low and yet better than other success rates like that of logistic regression which is around 50%?
