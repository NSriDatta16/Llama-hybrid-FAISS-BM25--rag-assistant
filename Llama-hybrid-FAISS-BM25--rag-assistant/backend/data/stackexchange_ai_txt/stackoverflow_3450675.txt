Apache StringUtils addresses this problem too. Failings of the other options: isEmpty() - not null safe. If the string is null, throws an NPE length() == 0 - again not null safe. Also does not take into account whitespace strings. Comparison to EMPTY constant - May not be null safe. Whitespace problem Granted StringUtils is another library to drag around, but it works very well and saves loads of time and hassle checking for nulls or gracefully handling NPEs.
