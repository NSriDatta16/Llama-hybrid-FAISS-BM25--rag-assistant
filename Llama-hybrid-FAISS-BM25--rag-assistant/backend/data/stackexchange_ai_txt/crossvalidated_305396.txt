The Krackhardt ratio , also known as the E-I ratio, provides a measurement of "the relative density of internal connections within a social group compared to the number of connections that group has to the external world." If I understand your question correctly, this is exactly what you are looking for. You could calculate the average Krackhardt ratio for nodes in each geographic location, and compare them against each other. There is a short implementation in R here: https://rpubs.com/pjmurphy/300606
