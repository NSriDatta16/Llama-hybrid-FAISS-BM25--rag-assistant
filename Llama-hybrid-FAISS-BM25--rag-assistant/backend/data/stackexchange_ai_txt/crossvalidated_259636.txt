What is a null model in regression and how does it relate to the null hypothesis?

What is the null model in regression and what's the relationship between the null model and the null hypothesis? From my understanding, does it mean Using "an average of the response variable" to predict the continuous response variable? Using the "label distribution" in predicting discrete response variables? If that is the case, it seems there are missing connections between the null hypothesis.
