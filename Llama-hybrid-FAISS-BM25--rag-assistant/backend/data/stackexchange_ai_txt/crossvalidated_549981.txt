Determining the correlation of a variable with itself over time

I have a mixture of organic compounds that have been stored for a period of 6 months. I want to determine the effects of storage on the compounds (i.e. whether it has caused their amounts to decrease). I was specifically asked to use spearman's rank to do this, but am confused about how it would work. Would I check the correlation between the compounds at month 0 and month 1, and then at month 1 and month 2 and so on?
