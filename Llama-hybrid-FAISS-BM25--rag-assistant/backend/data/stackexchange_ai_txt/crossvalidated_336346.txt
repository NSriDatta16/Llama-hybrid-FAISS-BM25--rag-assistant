does probability estimate for SVM have to be cross-validated?

I want to obtain the probability estimates for an SVM to calculate its perplexity - what is the correct way to do this? 1) do k-fold cross-validation and average the probability estimates? 2) train on e.g. 80% of the data and get probability estimate from remaining 20% in a single instance? 3) train on all the data and get the probability estimate by testing on the same data? 4) some other way?
