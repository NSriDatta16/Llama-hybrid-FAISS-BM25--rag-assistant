Variables and jquery objects

I am using variables to hold jquery objects as $mydiv = $('#somediv'); Now I would like to extend this to reference a paragraph within $mydiv . Obviously you could declare a new variable $mypara = $('#somediv p') But is there any way to extend the $mydiv variable to find the paragraph it contains. I just can't figure out the right notation to do this.
