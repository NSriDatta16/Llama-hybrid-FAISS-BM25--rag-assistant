Yes, you got it correct. The subscript notation is pretty common in machine learning literature, you can find some examples if it being discusses in the following threads: Expected value notation in GAN loss , Notation: What does the tilde below of the expectation mean? , Notation for expected value , Notation: What does the tilde below of the expectation mean? , What is the meaning of superscript in $p_{\theta}(x)$ and ${\mathbb E}_{\theta}\left[S(\theta)\right]$? . Notice that it talks about expected value of the random variable . This is not the same as average of all the datapoints. Average is just an estimate of the expected value, where we cannot observe the true expected value, same as we cannot observe the random variables themselves, just realizations of the random variables.
