Custom MKAnnotation with drag & drop animation

I have an annotation with custom image and drag'n'drop support. But I need to animate the annotation the same way default Google pin is animated. That means the annotation should "jump up" when I drag it and "fall down" when I release it. I was quite surprised that this animation isn't working anymore when I change annotation's image. Thanks.
