There doesn't seem to be any Bayesian component to what you are describing. Write down the multivariate normal densities $f_0(x,y,z)$ and $f_1(x,y,z)$ under the hypotheses $H_0: \mu = (0,0,0)$ and $H_1: \mu = (0.5,0.5,0.5)$. The decision surface is the set of all $(x,y,z)$ for which $f_0(x,y,z) = f_1(x,y,z)$. You will find that it helps to equate $\ln f_0(x,y,z)$ and $\ln f_1(x,y,z)$ and proceed from there, and the answer might surprise you a little. Don't compute the numerical values of entries of the matrix inverse of $\Sigma$ before you actually need numerical values: that is, simply assume that the inverse is a symmetric matrix $A = [a_{i,j}]$ and write the densities in terms of symbols $a_{i,j}$ rather than numbers such as $0.25$. A two-dimensional version of this question but with $f_0$ and $f_1$ having different covariance matrices (which complicates matters a lot) is answered here .
