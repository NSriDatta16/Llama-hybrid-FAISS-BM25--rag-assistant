Subclass of UIViewController don't catch touch event

I have a parent class (A) that is UIViewController. Than i create class B that is subclass of class A. What happens is that i can't catch touch events in class B with methods like touchesBegan. But if i implement this methods in class A ... they get called. @interface A:UIViewController ..... @interface B:A
