Removing variables is different from testing hypotheses. The test of an hypothesis is something you don't do with Machine Learning, but with statistical analysis. In a statistical model, each parameter can be thought as the test of an hypothesis, associated with a degree od significance. Moreover, hypothesis testing tells you something about the world based on how variables are associated with each other. You don't care about performance in this case, just about checking that an association has the sign you expected. Whether it is the case to remove a variable or not, in order to improve your model's performance, it's a different problem. It strongly depends from the data you are working with, could you please provide a description of you task and your dataset?
