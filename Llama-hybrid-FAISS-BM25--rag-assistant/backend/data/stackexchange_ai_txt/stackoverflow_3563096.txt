I've done it. You need to have a DIV on top of the iFrame to let the Draggable/Sortable flow without problems. So I used jQuery to create a DIV right on top of the iframe. Then it show's it when you grab the element and destroys it when you drop it. Works like a charm. If anyone is in need of something like that let me know. update (by popular request): On my specific scenario I use the following DIV: And, as soon as I grab the thumbnail javascript is used to set the display property to block . The process is reversed when you release the dragabble.
