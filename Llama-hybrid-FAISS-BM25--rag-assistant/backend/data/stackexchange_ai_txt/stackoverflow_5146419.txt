How to use asp.net mvc 3 jquery validate with a jquery dialog that does an ajax submit?

I am using asp.net mvc 3 jquery validate unobstructive javascript. I am trying to write all my validation on the serverside through annotations and then have the new feature of mvc 3 take care of the client side. I have a dialog that has a button on it(just a button not a submit button) that I want to post data to the server through ajax. So when the user clicks on the button I do a form submit and return false to cancel the post back. I thought that would trigger the validation but that does not seem to be the case. How do I make the client side validation trigger? Edit var $dialog = $(' ').dialog( { width: 580, height: 410, resizable: false, modal: true, autoOpen: false, title: 'Basic Dialog', buttons: { Cancel: function () { $(this).dialog('close'); }, 'Create Task': function () { var createSubmitFrmHandler = $(my.selectors.createFrm).live('submit', function () { alert('hi'); return false; }); createSubmitFrmHandler .validate(); var a = createSubmitFrmHandler .valid(); alert(a); } } }); This always return true. Edit 2 if I put a submit button within the form it will show the clientside validation(I use jquery to return false as shown in my code). So this means I do have the scripts and everything but it is not working for unknown reasons when I try to do it programmatic. Edit 3 I stuck the jquery validate && jquery.validate.unobtrusive files in the master page. But when I stick them in the partial view that contains the fields that get loaded up and then force a submit the validation kicks in. I don't understand. I pretty sure the pathing is right as I just dragged and dropped the file into my master page and it figured out the path. Having it in the partial views is not really a solution as I going have to do this multiple times and that means every time the partial view loads up I got another copy of these files. Edit 4 I think it is just the jquery.validate.unobtrusive that needs to be for some reason loaded every time. I am not sure why though.
