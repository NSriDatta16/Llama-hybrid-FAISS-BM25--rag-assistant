Access 2007 has a feature where you can split a DB into its Tables/Queries (backend) and Forms/Reports (front-end). Since your question mentions only version controlling the forms and modules, this might be a more elegant solution. I don't know where modules go after the split, so that might be a stumbling block. Microsoft offers VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) , which will let you develop in VS and run version control via any VS plugin (CVS/SVN/VSS/etc.). Finally, you can just directly connect to Visual Source Safe. This MSKB article has some good information and background to go through, while this Office Online article is designed for getting you up and running. Ultimately, I would suggest against taking the code out of Access if at all possible. Assuming the VBA editor is your primary development environment, you'll be adding extra steps to your development process that cannot easily be automated. Every change you make will need to be manually exported, diff'd, and stored, and there is no Application.OnCompile event that you could use to export the changes. Even tougher, you'll have to manually import all changed source files from other developers when they do checkins.
