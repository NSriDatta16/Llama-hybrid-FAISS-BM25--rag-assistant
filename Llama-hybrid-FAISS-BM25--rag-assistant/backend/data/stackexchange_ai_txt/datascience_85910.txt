improving performance for a limited dataset with noisy images, pattern recognition

I am trying to recognize doodles in noisy images like in this one below. My dataset consists of only 10 000 images and 30 categories I've implemented a CNN but it is giving me a 6% accuracy. I am thinking about removing the noise before feeding the images to my CNN, but I have no idea which methods to use to remove this type of noise and I am not even sure that removing noise improves the NNs performance. Do you have any suggestions about methods to remove the noise or other tips to improve the performance of the model?
