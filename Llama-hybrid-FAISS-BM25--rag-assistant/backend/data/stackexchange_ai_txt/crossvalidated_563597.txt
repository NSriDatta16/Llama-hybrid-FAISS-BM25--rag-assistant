Continuous wavelet transform can show the seasonality as well. Because the assumption of periodogram is the seasonality is stationary, wavelet is better than periodogram since it allows the change of seasonality along the time. Just like periodogram decomposes the time series into sine or cosine waves of different frequencies and calculates the power in each frequency, continuous wavelet transform decomposes the time series into Morlet wavelet of different frequencies, and calculate the power of the time series against each frequency. This is an example of wavelet. We can see there is a strong signal of frequency of 0.02/kyr during 0-400 kyrs. One issue of wavelet is that, since the data length is not enough to calculate wavelet at the ends of the time series(like first 100 days has 500-day cycle), the wavelet spectrum is not accurate(which is also called edge effects), cone of influence will be drawn(the dashed line in the wavelet above), and only the spectrum within cone of influence is reliable.
