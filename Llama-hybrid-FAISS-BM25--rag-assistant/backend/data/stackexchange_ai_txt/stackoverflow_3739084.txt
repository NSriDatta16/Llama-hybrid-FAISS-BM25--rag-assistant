Paul -- one extra note: one additional advantage is that you hand multiple requests to the disk driver at the same time. The driver then can sort the requests and issue them in the optimal order. While syscall time is small, seek time (many milliseconds) can be punitive (that's less than 1000 I/O's/sec). Chris's comment about demonstrating the efficiency is pragmatic. Mother nature never lies. Well, almost never.
