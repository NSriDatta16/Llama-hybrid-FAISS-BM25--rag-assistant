Update. The problem ended up being a conflict with Cisco's Security Agent software and obfuscation performed by Xenocode. If one or the other is removed from the equation, the exception doesn't occur. I've also tried a number of ways to work around it, to no avail. So I've got a query into Xenocode (communicating with Cisco was beyond a waste of time). Maybe they can get to the bottom of what is going on.
