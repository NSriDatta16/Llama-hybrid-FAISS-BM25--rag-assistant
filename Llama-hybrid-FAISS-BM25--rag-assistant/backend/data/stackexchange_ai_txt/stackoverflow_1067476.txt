Well, the best thing is to run your application through a profiler and see what the bottlenecks are. I've personally used dotTrace , there are plenty of others you can find on the web. Debug mode turns off a lot of JIT optimizations, so apps will run a lot slower than release builds. Whatever the mode, JITting has to happen, so I'd discount that as a significant factor. Time to read files from disk can vary based on the OS's caching mechanism, and whether you're doing a cold start or a warm start. If you have to use timers to profile, I'd suggest repeating the experiment a large number of times and taking the average.
