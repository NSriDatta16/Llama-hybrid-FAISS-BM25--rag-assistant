Causal Inference of Between-Group Differences in Time Series Data

I'm relatively new to time series data/causal inference (am working my way through Mostly Harmless Econometrics as we speak). Though, I'm still not sure how to appropriately test between-group differences in time series. Basically, I want to test if the "red group" is statistically different from the "blue group". Here is an image of the two groups over time with log first differences on the y axis and time on the x axis: My first thought was that we could possibly test differences in the mean value given the distribution of the values on the y-axis looks like this: But I'm not sure that makes sense. Can anyone provide suggestions for testing differences in these group and then cite sources I can read up on?
