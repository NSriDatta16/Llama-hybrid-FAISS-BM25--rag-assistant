Error while implementing SQL Tree

Hi I'm getting the error while executing following code in MySQL : BEGIN DECLARE right_most_sibling INTEGER; SET right_most_sibling = (SELECT rgt FROM Personnel WHERE emp = 'Albert'); UPDATE Personnel SET lft = CASE WHEN lft > right_most_sibling THEN lft + 2 ELSE lft END, rgt = CASE WHEN rgt >= right_most_sibling THEN rgt + 2 ELSE rgt END WHERE rgt >= right_most_sibling; INSERT INTO Personnel (emp, lft, rgt) VALUES ('Bert', right_most_sibling, (right_most_sibling + 1)) END; I'm getting the following error : #1064 - You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'DECLARE right_most_sibling INTEGER' at line 2 Any ideas, how do I fix it ? I was following this tutorial
