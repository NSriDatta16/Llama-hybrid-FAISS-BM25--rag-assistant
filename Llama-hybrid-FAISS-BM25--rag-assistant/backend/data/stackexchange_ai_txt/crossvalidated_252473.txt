paired t-test for multiple groups

I have had a particular problem that I haven't been able to solve. Here is the scenario: I would like to perform a paired t-test of sorts on multiple groups. Instead of before and after conditions, there are multiple conditions (ex: treatment 1, treatment 2, treatment 3 etc). Each subject appears in each 'group'. I have tried to use ANOVA, but this method averages data of all subjects within each condition, then compares their means. However, I would like to look at the differences of individual subjects between the conditions, and compare those between subjects. To me, it sounds like a paired t-test for of 2+ groups. I am using n=4. I hope that makes sense. thanks for any input
