I haven't done much of persistence storage on Android but I think you need to use SQLiteDatabase and make your own Cusor that De/Serializes your object so that it can be added to the database. A possible solution would be to extend a SQLiteCursor or an AbstractCursor. Otherwise I don't think there is other solution apart from, possibly, "hardcore" Serializabled (Which I suspect it may be too much for a phone, I may be wrong)
