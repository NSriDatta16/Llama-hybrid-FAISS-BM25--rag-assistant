How can I measure the number of times and response time of a method called in a Spring Bean

I would like to measure the number of times a method is called on a service provisioned by Spring. In EJB land this information is usually provided by the container. Now since spring is conceived when "Anything you can do, I can do better" was playing on the radio, I expect there to be a nice and elegant component hidden somewhere which I can weave into my application using a sprinkling of XML. Does anybody know of such a component?
