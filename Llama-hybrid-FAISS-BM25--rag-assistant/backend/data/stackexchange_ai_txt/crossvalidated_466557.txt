Calibration of correlation

Let's say there are two random variables (for example, two time series data of S&P500 and a stock) and their correlation is 0.95. What is the best way to reduce the correlation between these two variables to 0.7, while keeping one as it is? One approach that comes to mind is to add noise (error terms). But how would I know what should the mean standard deviation for the noise? I would appreciate if one could show how to do this in R.
