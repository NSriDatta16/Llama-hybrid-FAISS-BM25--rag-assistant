There is also no syntax highlighting I think. Not sure if that's a bug or a feature, but AFAIK, combining the code this way isn't a good practice. Generally inline javascript is not a good practice, but if you go with it, combine Model properties with it, and later decide to extract the scripts into a separate js file, your code will break. Therefore, it is quite common to populate hidden fields with your Model properties and read them in your js with jQuery, e.g.: " /> " /> ... // in js $(document).ready(function () { createPager(1, $("#valTotalPages").val()); createUnprocessedPager(1, $("#valTotalUnprocessedPages").val()); }); So lack of syntax highlighting and intellisense might be a bug, but might as well be a way of discouraging certain code patterns.
