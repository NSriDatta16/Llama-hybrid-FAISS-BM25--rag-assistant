Java Content Repository(JCR), tries to address these problems (and many others) in an implementation-independent way; that is, the API will be the same regardless of the underlying resource (eg a database, a local or virtual file system). Sitting on top of the data storage, JCR offers content services like granular access control, versioning, content events, full-text search and filtering among others. With an impressive expert group behind JSR-170 led by Day Software, including Content Management Systems (CMS) vendors like Vignette, Hummingbird Ltd., Stellent and the usual Java-driven solution providers like BEA Systems, IBM and Oracle, the specification is likely to become the de-facto standard for content management and document storage.
