Overview articles on Bayesian philosophy and methodology

While we have questions about Bayesian textbooks ( 1 and several other) and the philosophy behind the Bayesian thinking ( 2 ), I am interested papers ( or sources of similar length, e.g. blog posts or book chapters ) that overview the Bayesian approach (philosophy, methodology) and its different branches . They would highlight the fundamental idea(s) and intuition behind the Bayesian approach. They would cover the interpretations of probability, uncertainty and model parameters as random variables. They would perferably be on a somewhat advanced level. This is quite similar to question 2 but focuses on papers rather than books. I suggest one paper (blog post, book chapter, ...) per answer.
