I suggest when in doubt, create the feature, and check the feature importance, which can be done by fitting a random forest. In my own experience, I once tried creating features the way you suggest, and the features had extremely poor feature importance. Apart from that, the model performed worse than without the extra features, so it didn't go very well with me. But in the very end, you'll always have to check what happens with your data.
