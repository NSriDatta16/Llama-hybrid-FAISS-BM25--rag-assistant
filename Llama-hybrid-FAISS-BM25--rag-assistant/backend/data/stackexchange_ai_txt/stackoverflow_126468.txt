The History Tables article in the Database Programmer blog might be useful - covers some of the points raised here and discusses the storage of deltas. Edit In the History Tables essay, the author ( Kenneth Downs ), recommends maintaining a history table of at least seven columns: Timestamp of the change, User that made the change, A token to identify the record that was changed (where the history is maintained separately from the current state), Whether the change was an insert, update, or delete, The old value, The new value, The delta (for changes to numerical values). Columns which never change, or whose history is not required, should not be tracked in the history table to avoid bloat. Storing the delta for numerical values can make subsequent queries easier, even though it can be derived from the old and new values. The history table must be secure, with non-system users prevented from inserting, updating or deleting rows. Only periodic purging should be supported to reduce overall size (and if permitted by the use case).
