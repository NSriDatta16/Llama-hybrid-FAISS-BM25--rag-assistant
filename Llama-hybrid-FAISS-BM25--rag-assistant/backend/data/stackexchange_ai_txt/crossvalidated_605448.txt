References on the reweighting method When you reweight your data to match known population totals (using raking, post-stratification, or some other form of calibration), it has long been common practice to repeat the reweighting procedure for each replicate sample. This practice and its justification are described clearly in the following classical references on variance estimation for surveys: Rust, K., & Rao, J. (1996). "Variance estimation for complex surveys using replication techniques." Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 5(3), 283–310. https://doi.org/10.1177/096228029600500305 Dippo, C., Fay, R., & Morganstein, D. (1984). "Computing Variances from Complex Samples with Replicate Weights." Proceedings of the Section on Survey Research Methods, 489–494. http://www.asasrms.org/Proceedings/papers/1984_094.pdf Packages in R The 'survey' and 'svrep' packages both provide a few different methods for bootstrapping with survey data. This vignette from the 'svrep' package provides guidance on how to choose an appropriate bootstrap method and number of bootstrap replicates: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/svrep/vignettes/bootstrap-replicates.html . When you use the 'survey' package's functions ( rake() , postStratify() , or calibrate() ) to reweight data with bootstrap replicate weights, the package will automatically repeat the reweighting procedure separately for each bootstrap replicate. Below is example R code for how to implement this: library(survey) library(svrep) # Load example survey data ---- data('lou_vax_survey', package = 'svrep') # Create bootstrap weights ---- vax_survey_design svytable(formula = ~ RACE_ETHNICITY) #> RACE_ETHNICITY #> Black or African American alone, not Hispanic or Latino #> 119041 #> Hispanic or Latino #> 27001 #> Other Race, not Hispanic or Latino #> 27633 #> White alone, not Hispanic or Latino #> 423027 raked_boot_design |> svytable(formula = ~ SEX) #> SEX #> Female Male #> 313014 283688
