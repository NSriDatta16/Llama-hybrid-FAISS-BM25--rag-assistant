Syntax for filtering out code coverage (absolute) paths in PHPUnit

I'm just unit testing a single file and although it's the only one to get unit tested (good), code coverage is done on more than just this single file (bad). It covers some files in my PEAR directory for some reason I can't understand yet, so all my coverage stats are distorted. So I'm trying to eliminate these extra files, but can't get the format right for an absolute directory: AntProxyTest.php c:\php\pear is not excluding as I wish, either are forward slashes or file://c:/php/pear .
