Using the DragDropTarget with a traditional Grid

Silverlight 4 now provides controls to handle Drag and Drop actions. All the Target Controls seem to inherit from DragDropTarget Like so public class MyControlDragDropTarget : DragDropTarget . . . A number of controls have pre-defined DragDropTargets including the DataGrid, ListBox, Panels Which is all very well, but I want to drag and drop from a grid not a datagrid, and there is no pre-defined one for a normal grid. I actually want to drag a given row from the grid, but without a Container Type for a Grid I cannot work out how to define a DragDropTarget control for the grid. Only way I can think is instead of using a grid - I use a listbox (for which there is a DragDropTarget) and then place a StackPanel or Grid in each row (which has one row of 'n' columns) Anyone got any ideas Ta in advance
