Sharding was originally coined by google engineers and you can see it used pretty heavily when writing applications on Google App Engine. Since there are hard limitations on the amount of resource your queries can use and because queries themselves have strict limitations, sharding is not only encouraged but almost enforced by the architecture. Another place sharding can be used is to reduce contention on data entities. It is especially important when building scalable systems to watch out for those piece of data that are written often because they are always the bottleneck. A good solution is to shard off that specific entity and write to multile copies, then read the total. An example of this "sharded counter wrt GAE: http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/sharding_counters.html
