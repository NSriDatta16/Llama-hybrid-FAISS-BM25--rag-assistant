You can still test last. It's okay. We'll forgive you. Learn how the unit test tools work in your current language. Start writing unit tests for whatever you're working on now. Eventually, you can move to code-a-little-test-a-little. Then test-a-little-code-a-little. Pure test driven development is an ideal. Pragmatically, most folks test-a-little-code-a-little. More like test-steering or test-guided, rather than test-driven. Start now. Test anything you have at hand.
