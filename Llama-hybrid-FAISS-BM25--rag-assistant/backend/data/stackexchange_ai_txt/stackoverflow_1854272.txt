BlackBerry:Built-in Date Picker API?

In my application screen, i am having a field, where user can to choose his DateOfBirth. I want to popup any built-in "Date" calendar or some built-in Date picker to user, so that it will look professional. As i'm new to this development, i wanted to know there is any code sample available to popoup the built-in Date Picker? Note: I also want to store the selectable Date by user after selecting it in my existing persistent storage. Thank you for your suggestions.
