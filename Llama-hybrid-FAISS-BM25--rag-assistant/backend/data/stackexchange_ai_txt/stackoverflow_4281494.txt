I think the pragmatic solution would be to replace the whole element. This way, the newly inserted one will have the correct width for its elements (disregarding any other styling that may be applied). The thing to bear in mind if replacing the whole select is that any references to the replaced element will need to cleaned up prior to removing it from the DOM (to avoid any potential memory leaks) and event handlers attached to the newly inserted element.
