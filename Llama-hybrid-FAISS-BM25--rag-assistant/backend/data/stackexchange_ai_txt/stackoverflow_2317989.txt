What you want to implement is not spelling corrector but a fuzzy search. Peter Norvig's essay is a good starting point to build a fuzzy search from candidates checked against a dictionary. Alternatively have a look at BK-Trees. An n-gram index (used by Lucene) produces better results for longer words. The approach to produce candidates up to a given edit distance will probably work good enough for words found in normal text but will not work good enough for names, addresses and scientific texts. It will increase you index size, though. If you have the texts indexed you have your text corpus (your dictionary). Only what is in your data can be found anyway. You need not use an external dictionary. A good resource is Introduction to Information Retrieval - Dictionaries and tolerant retrieval . There is a short description of context sensitive spelling correction.
