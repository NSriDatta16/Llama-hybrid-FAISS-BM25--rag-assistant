Yes this is perfectly doable. You would have to: Create a custom view. Override the touchesBegan:withEvent: method with code like this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint locationOfTouch = [touch locationInView:self]; // You can now use locationOfTouch.x and locationOfTouch.y as the user's coordinates } Save the CGPoint . You can create a NSDictionary of it like this: NSDictionary *coordinates = (NSDictionary *) CGPointCreateDictionaryRepresentation(locationOfTouch); Then write it to a file: [coordinates writeToFile:filePath atomically:YES]; That's all.
