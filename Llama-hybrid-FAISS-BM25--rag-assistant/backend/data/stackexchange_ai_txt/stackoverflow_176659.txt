It is usually possible to force foreseen race-conditions and deadlocks by using things like ManualResetEvent to get each thread into the expected state before releasing it - i.e. get thread A to have the lock and wait for a signal... get thread B to request the lock, etc... However - you might typically write such a test to investigate a suspected bug, to prove when it is fixed and that it doesn't re-surface. You would generally design around race conditions (but test them as best as is pragmatic).
