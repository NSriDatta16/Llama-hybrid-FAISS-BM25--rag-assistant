Slight addition to Bertrand's answer gives you a way to not repeat the type argument in you specific use case, or even not mention it: public static class ClassName { public static ClassName Create (ListType list) { return new ClassName { ListName = list }; } public static ClassName Create (params T[] list) { return new ClassName { ListName = new ListType (list) }; } } Using the first method, you can write something like ClassName.Create(new ListType (x, y, z)); using the second method, you can even write ClassName.Create(x, y, z); and let the compiler figure out that T is SomeType , but that doesn't work always. Note that ClassName is different class than ClassName and you might want to name it differently, e.g. ClassNameFactory .
