As an extreme case, I had a chance to study on Forex (Foreign Exchange Rate) forecast and intensively compared performances of LSTM, windowed-MLP and ARIMA. As many articles say, Forex time series is close to the random walk series (it is completely non-stationary). None of these algorithms can predict next day's spot rate. For example, if there is no (or little) change, then it will maintain current value and it looks fit. However, if there is a sudden (substantial) change in tomorrow's spot rate, then it always fails to predict. The problem is that there is nothing to learn from the training data (say, past 10 years' spot rates history) whether it is large enough or not, because it is completely random (perhaps, due to exchange dealers' sentiments ...). In fact, LSTM with just '1' lag, or ARIMA with (1,0,0) will perform the best since storing data with more than 1 time lag doesn't help at all. For this kind of time series, I would say, in terms of tracking performance, 1) ARIMA, 2) LSTM, 3) MLP. Last comment... MLP with macro/micro economic parameters (say, GDP difference, bond rates, crude oil price, dollar index, etc) as additional features didn't work at all also.
