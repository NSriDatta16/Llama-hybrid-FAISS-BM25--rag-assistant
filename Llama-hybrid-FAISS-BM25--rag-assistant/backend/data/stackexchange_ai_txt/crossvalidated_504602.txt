In this example, which of these vectors are support vectors?

The hyperplane of hard margin SVM with $\phi$ kernel is calculated as following that input space using $\phi$ to map to higher dimension space. $$f(\phi(x))=4\phi_1(x)+9\phi_2(x)+4\phi_3(x)$$ $$ \phi(x)=\left[ \begin{array}{c} \phi_1(x)=x_1^2\\ \phi_2(x)=x_2^2\\\phi_3(x)=x_1x_2\\\phi_4(x)=-x_1 \end{array} \right] $$ Which of the following can be a support vector? $$ x=\left[ \begin{array}{c} +1\\ 1 \end{array} \right] $$ $$ y=\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\ -1 \end{array} \right] $$ Options: $\ x=$ YES, $\ y=$ No $\ x=$ YES, $\ y=$ YES The correct answer is option $1$ . My challenge is where is the trick in this question, because calculation by hand shown that none of them are support vectors? How can we choose an option here?
