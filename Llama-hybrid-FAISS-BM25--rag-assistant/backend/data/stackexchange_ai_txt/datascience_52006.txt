Estimating effort of building machine learning model

I know it depends on the problem and various other factors like data availability, the complexity of the use case, the workload of developer ..etc, but can someone suggest effort estimation of building a minimum viable product. I have taken the following parameters into consideration while preparing effort estimation(close to 3months) for building a price prediction model based on two problem definitions(no sample data supplied by client), which would be integrated with web interface. Data loading & pre-processing - 1 week Development of model - 2.5 month Deployment - 2 weeks. not sure whether it's overestimated or underestimated. Note: Please do not close with the comment "too broad" as I do not have much/can not provide more information. Requesting expert advice.
