The term "Directories" in a SharePoint site is deceptive. The 'directory' structure of a SharePoint webservice is a virtual structure that is located in the SharePoint databases. You need to identify what object in the SharePoint Object Model the 'directory' is for example: http://sharepoint.domain.com/dir is probably a SPSite, with in the site you can have a 'directories' that are SPFolders, SPLists, SPDocumentLibraries etc. So if by "create directories that don't exist" you mean in the SharePoint site directory structure, you wont be able to do with the WebClient. You have two options: the Windows SharePoint Services Object Model, and the SharePoint Webservices. The object model is certainly easier to use in my opinion but it will require you to run the app on the same server as your SharePoint server. The Webservices are a bit more work but it enables you to use them remotely. You will need to identify what kind of object you are trying to add (e.g. SPFolder, SPSite, SPList, SPDocumentLibrary ect.). There is ample documentation for using the object model located Here but if you want to use the webservices you will need to access them at the following locations: Administration Service http:// /_vti_adm/admin.asmx Alerts Service http:// /_vti_bin/alerts.asmx Document Workspace Service http:// /_vti_bin/dws.asmx Forms Service http:// /_vti_bin/forms.asmx Imaging Service http:// /_vti_bin/imaging.asmx List Data Retrieval Service http:// /_vti_bin/dspsts.asmx Lists Service http:// /_vti_bin/lists.asmx Meetings Service http:// /_vti_bin/meetings.asmx Permissions Service http:// /_vti_bin/permissions.asmx Site Data Service http:// /_vti_bin/sitedata.asmx Site Service http:// /_vti_bin/sites.asmx Users and Groups Service http:// /_vti_bin/usergroup.asmx Versions Service http:// /_vti_bin/versions.asmx Views Service http:// /_vti_bin/views.asmx Web Part Pages Service http:// /_vti_bin/webpartpages.asmx Webs Service http:// /_vti_bin/webs.asmx I suggest looking into the Lists or Document Workspace Service services. Hope that helps.
