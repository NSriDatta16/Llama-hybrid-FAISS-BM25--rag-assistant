I would have thought that the fact that a given training set only has one possible set of computed parameters would also determine if the model is parametric. This is the case in boosting, logistic regression, linear regression and models of this sort which would mostly be considered parametric whereas the parameters estimated in things like neural networks can be different depending on how the same set is sampled to train the model. Boosting which will always update the pseudo loss at every iteration the same give a set seems to me to be more like a parametric training method. But I'm really just guessing.
