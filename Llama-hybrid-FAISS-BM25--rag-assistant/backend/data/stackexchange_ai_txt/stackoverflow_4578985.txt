Unlike Python's * operator or C#'s params keyword, in PHP you don't even have to specify the variable length arguments. As the second part starts off, "No special syntax is required." As to the rest of the second paragraph: if you want to specify any required or unrelated arguments that come before the variable-length arguments, specify them in your function signature so your function can handle those. Then to get the variable-length arguments, remove the required variables from func_get_args() , like so: function func($required) { // Contains all arguments that come after $required // as they were present at call time $args = array_slice(func_get_args(), 1); } You don't have to do this (you can still slice from func_get_args() and use its different elements accordingly), but it does make your code more self-documenting.
