OK, fantastic Gregg: we're getting somewhere. Combining your idea with that of woodchips, yields this alternative approach. It's mathematically very dirty but it seems to work: library(MCMCpack) library(MASS) p 0){ r1 ub) l1 Basically, this is the idea (say upper bound =.8 and lower it bound=.6), it has a good enough acceptance rate, which is not 100%, but it'll do at this stage of the project.
