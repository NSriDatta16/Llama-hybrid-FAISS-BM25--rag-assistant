I have been using http://www.maxmind.com for over a year now and I am very pleased. It can locate down to the city for free. It can works it's way down even closer and report ISP and organization data if you pay for the service. I pay for the service. I paid for 500K lookups and I still have like 365K left (after almost two years now). I use it for visitor mapping in conjunction with Google maps. It takes about 10 lines (or less) of PHP code to make the query and get information back. You can also download the free databases and use them on your server (updates available each month). They come with all the PHP code required to do the lookups. You can also install the paid version locally. I wish there was a $_SERVER[W3C_LOCATION] do-hicky :)
