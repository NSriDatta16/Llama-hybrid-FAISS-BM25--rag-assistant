Initialization of GAN discriminator

The question is pretty straightforward: how are GAN and WGAN discriminators typically initialized? I couldn't find much info on this. E.x. for GANs, I imagine you would theoretically want the discriminator to not be very good initially, otherwise your generator cannot start learning. You also don't want the discriminator to be too bad, so maybe a good initial discriminator is the one which outputs 0.5 on average. However, do you want this discriminator to output 0.5 to all samples, or maybe 0 to one half and 1 to the other half? I suppose for WGANs this matters less in theory.
