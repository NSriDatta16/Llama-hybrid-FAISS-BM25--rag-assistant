In the event the joint density $p(y,z|D)$ is available in closed form (possibly up to a multiplicative constant), a sample $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ can be exploited to produce a sample from $p(y|z^*,D)$ by acceptance-rejection, assuming $p(y,z^*|D)/p(y,z_i|D)$ is upper bounded [exact sampling, random sample size] sampling importance resampling, selecting with replacement $y_i$ 's with probability proportional to $p(y,z^*|D)/p(y,z_i|D)$ [biased resampling, due to the renormalisation of the importance weights] Markov chain Monte Carlo, with, at iteration $t$ , selecting one index i at random and replacing the current value $y^{(t)}$ by $y_i$ with Metropolis-Hastings probability $$1 \wedge \dfrac{p(y_i,z^*|D)}{p(y_i,z_i|D)} \dfrac{p(y^{(t)},z_i|D)}{p(y^{(t)},z^*|D)}$$ [exact sampling assuming enough iterations for the Markov chain to reach stationarity] Here is a basic R illustration #generate conditional from joint #x ~ Exp(1) & y|x ~ N(0,x) #joint sample N=1e5 smpl=cbind(z zo,2] ya=yo*(runif(length(yo)) zo])*we[z>zo]) ya=ya[ya!=0] # 2. sampling importance resampling ess=round(sum(we)^2/sum(we^2)) #effective sample size yi=sample(y,ess,prob=we,rep=TRUE) # 3. MCMC ym=rep(yi[1],N/10) for (t in 2:length(ym)){ i=sample(1:N,1) ym[t]=ifelse(runif(1) Without such items of information, i.e. in a generative model when the sampler is a black box, there is no generic solution and approximate methods such as ABC or synthetic likelihood need be used.
