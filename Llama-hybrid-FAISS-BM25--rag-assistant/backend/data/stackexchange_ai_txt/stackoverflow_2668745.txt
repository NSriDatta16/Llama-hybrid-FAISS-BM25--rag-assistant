This should work! :) cheers. logger.info({:user_agent => request.user_agent, :remote_ip => request.remote_ip}.inspect) logger.info(params.inspect) By the by.. This should be placed in your controllers action. Ex: If you place it in your create action it should also log the user_agent i.e the browser, remote_ip i.e the remote ip of the user and all the params.
