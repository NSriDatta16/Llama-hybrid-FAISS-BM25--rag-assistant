It depends on the storage duration of the variable. A variable with static storage duration is always implicitly initialized with zero. As for automatic (local) variables, an uninitialized variable has indeterminate value . Indeterminate value, among other things, mean that whatever "value" you might "see" in that variable is not only unpredictable, it is not even guaranteed to be stable . For example, in practice (i.e. ignoring the UB for a second) this code int num; int a = num; int b = num; does not guarantee that variables a and b will receive identical values. Interestingly, this is not some pedantic theoretical concept, this readily happens in practice as consequence of optimization. So in general, the popular answer that "it is initialized with whatever garbage was in memory" is not even remotely correct. Uninitialized variable's behavior is different from that of a variable initialized with garbage.
