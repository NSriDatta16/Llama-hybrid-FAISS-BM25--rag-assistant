Is it advisable to use output from a ML model as a feature in another ML model?

Can I use the probability score generated from a Machine Learning model as a feature in another model? For example, say we have a model which generates the probability of an ad being bad. Lets call it badness_score. I am working on building another model which will predict the probability of an advertiser being a fraudster. Can I use badness_score as a feature while building this model ? Are there any caveats to this approach?
