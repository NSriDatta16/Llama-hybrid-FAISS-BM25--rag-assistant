Yes, it is possible for group (ii) to be greater. (whether it's MUCH greater would depend on your definition) For an intuitive point of view, (i) averages out the effect of height among the people in the groups, but (ii) allows the effect to vary. If you are to look at the calculation (taken from wikipedia on logistic regression), the model is $1/(1+e^{-z})$; so as $z$ gets larger, the odds would increase as well. Hope this helps.
