AJAX is very simple : someone somewhere tought that it would be cool to be able to send something to the server and receive something from it without reload a page. AJAX is not a revolution, it's just a name for something simple : a web page can send a request to the server without being reloader - just some asynch stuff here. You can add AJAX controls on your web pages wihout any works - just drag them in with Visual Studio. You may have to add some manager for them, but it is simply a drag-and-drop task. But be warned : rogue web browser usually don't speak the same AJAX language as IE... :)
