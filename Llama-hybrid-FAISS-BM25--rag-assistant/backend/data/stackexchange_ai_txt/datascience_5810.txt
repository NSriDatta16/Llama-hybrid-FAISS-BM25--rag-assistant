Application of Control Theory in Data Science

I have recently completed an MSc in Control Systems from a top university. It seems to me that control theory must have an application within data science. I would like to apply my degree within this domain, but I want to be sure that it is relevant to the role of a data scientist. The topics which I have particular interest and experience in are State Space Control, Systems Identification, Model Predictive Control and Optimal Control. I imagine that effective management of any large dataset must involve modelling of the system in terms of transfer functions/state space models (based on large sets of historical input/output data). These models could then be used to predict the evolution of a market/variable over time, and therefore optimise a given cost function such as profit, risk etc. If this kind of role exists within data science/ other areas, can you please give me more information/ ideas of job roles/ industries to research.
