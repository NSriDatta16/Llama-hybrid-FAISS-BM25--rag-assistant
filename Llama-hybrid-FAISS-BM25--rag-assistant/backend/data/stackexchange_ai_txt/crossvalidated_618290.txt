Finding trend similarity between two different time series

I am very new to this data analytics field, so bit confused about what to do. I have 2 time series datasets of two different products that have the same attributes. I want to find trend similarity between both the time series. Which one will be best to use, correlation, covariance, mutual information or Euclidean distance?
