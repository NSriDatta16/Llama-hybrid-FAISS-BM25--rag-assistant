Stock return distributions can be well approximated with heavy-tail Lambert W x Gaussian distributions. They are implemented in the LambertW R package and the pylambertw Python module . Advantage of this distribution is that you can "gaussianize" your data based on the estimated distribution parameters (using a bijective trnsformation). Showing R code examples here, but same can be done in pylambertw using pylambertw.mle.MLE() sklearn Estimator/Transformer. Note: I downloaded the data directly from Yahoo Finance for the year of 2015 and computed x = logret * 100 to get daily % change; didn't get exactly the summary statistics you have, but same stylized facts of returns). Simple normality checks (both visual and hypothesis testing) are in line with your findings: LambertW::test_norm(x) $seed [1] 277666 $shapiro.wilk Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: data.test W = 0.97609, p-value = 0.0003105 $shapiro.francia Shapiro-Francia normality test data: data.test W = 0.97193, p-value = 0.0001607 $anderson.darling Anderson-Darling normality test data: data A = 1.4285, p-value = 0.001062 The daily stock returns show the typical stylized facts of a heavy-tailed distribution. You can use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to fit a Lambert W x Gaussian distribution to this data, in particular the location, scale, and tail parameter $\delta$ . mod |t|) mu 0.004030 0.056308 0.0716 0.94294 sigma 0.810480 0.059024 13.7314 In this case the $\hat{\delta} = 0.115$ , which means moments up to 1 / 0.115 = 8.6 exist; the implied kurtosis of the underlying data is 6.34 (as a function of $\hat{\delta}$ ). After Gaussianization the resulting back-transformed, gaussianized stock return data is indistinguishable from a Normal distribution. x.gauss descdist(as.numeric(x.gauss), discrete = FALSE) To @whuber comment above, just fitting a distribution alone does not solve any problem / answer any question. Depending on what specific question you have, this will be more or less useful. Nonetheless you now have a distribution that describes the marginal properties of the sample you have in a way that's indistinguishable from the (latent) Normal distribution. You can use this to answer any question you have about the population of daily returns for SP500 [there might be more efficient ways to answer your questions, but the full distribution allows you to use it downstream in any way/shape/form].
