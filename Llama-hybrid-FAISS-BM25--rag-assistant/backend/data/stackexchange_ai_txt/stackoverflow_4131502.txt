OpenCV has a very nice algorithm which detects closed contours in an image and returns them as lists of points. You can then throw away all contours which don't have 4 points, and then check some constraints of the remaining ones (aspect ratio of the rectangles, etc...) to find your remaining box sides. This should at least solve the image processing part of your problem, though turning this list of contours into a count of boxes in your warehouse is going to be tough. Check here for the OpenCV function: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/structural_analysis_and_shape_descriptors.html#findcontours http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/drawing_functions.html#drawcontours
