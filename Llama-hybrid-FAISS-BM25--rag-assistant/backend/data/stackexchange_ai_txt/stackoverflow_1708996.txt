Entity Framework connections string are more complicated than standard connection strings. They are made up of three parts: the Provider Connection String => this is what you're providing the Metadata => which is where the EF should get the CSDL, MSL and SSDL from (i.e. Conceptual Model, Mapping and Storage Model) the Provider name => i.e. for SQL server this is generally System.Data.SqlClient Here is what it one might look like: metadata=res:// /Model.csdl|res:// /Model.ssdl|res://*/Model.msl;provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string="Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Database;Integrated Security=True;Pooling=False;MultipleActiveResultSets=True" Hope this helps Alex
