What's the best way to approach a regression problem with a lot of features (over 300), many of which are categorical?

I have $20,000$ training examples of various candidate attributes (highest level of education, country, year of formal training completion, etc). My output (prediction) will be for job_performance , which is measured between $700$ and $4,200$ (in my training data). Initially, I was thinking about putting together a fully connected neural network , but I attempted a similar problem in a Kaggle competition, but that didn't produce great results. What method(s) would you use to start?
