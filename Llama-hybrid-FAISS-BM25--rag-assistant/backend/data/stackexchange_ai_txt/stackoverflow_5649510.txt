When you add a UIView or one of its subclasses onto the UITableView using IB (just drag a UIView and drop it onto the UPPER part of UITableView of yours), it automatically adds that UIView component and makes it the "tableHeader" component. Each UITableView has one tableHeader and one tableFooter component reserved... This way the new view would be a part of the UITable, and scroll with it or appear/disappear or whatever you do to the table. You can change its hidden property if you need conditional behavior. On the other hand, if you want the header view stay put, as the table scrolls, then it is better to make the table smaller and put the header above it as suggested in other answers...
