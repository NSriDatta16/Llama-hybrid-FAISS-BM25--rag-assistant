Which pattern to use

I have a class - call it ThankYou that delivers these. Based on the different implementations, generic or Facebook, I need to deliver customized layout. Right now, I am building the HTML in JS and delivering the layout. 1) Sign up for email newsletters (for generic and Facebook implementation) 2) Teaser content (for generic implementation) 3) Facebook like(for Facebook ThankYou implementation) Which design pattern do you think this is better implemented using - Factory or Mediator? I am just starting to utilize some design patterns in my code and would like to start off on the right foot. Some notes: a) Although the functionality might be the same, the layout might be different for generic and Facebook If I don't use a design pattern, I could easily do this using an 'if' statement, but I am just looking for a more elegant solution.
