By default Alfresco treats XML files as plain text and indexes the xml tags as words, that's why they can be found via full text search. XML content is handled by the StringExtractingContentTransformer in Alfresco which converts text/xml to text/plain before indexing it. To check which transformers are registered in your Alfresco installation you can check http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/mimetypes?mimetype=text/xml#text/xml To prevent the indexing of xml attributes you have to write a special transformer which strips out the XML tags. See http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Content_Transformations for an introduction in content transformation with Alfresco. The easiest way would be to integrate a command line utility that converts the xml file into text or you could implement a java class which does the transformation.
