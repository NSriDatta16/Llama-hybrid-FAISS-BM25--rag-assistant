Incremental learning for classification models in R

Assume, I have a classifier (It could be any of the standard classifiers like decision tree, random forest, logistic regression .. etc.) for fraud detection using the below code library(randomForest) rfFit = randomForest(Y ~ ., data = myData, ntree = 400) # A very basic classifier Say, Y is a binary outcome - Fraud/Not-Fraud Now, I have predicted on a unseen data set. pred = predict(rfFit, newData) Then I have obtained the feedback from the investigation team on my classification and found that I have made a mistake of classifying a fraud as Non-Fraud (i.e. One False Negative ) . Is there anyway that I can let my algorithm understand that it has made a mistake? i.e. Any way of adding a feedback loop to the algorithm so that it can correct the mistakes? One option I can think from top of my head is build an adaboost classifier so that the new classifier corrects the mistake of the old one. or I have heard something of Incremental Learning or Online learning . Are there any existing implementations (packages) in R ? Is it the right approach? or Is there any other way to tweak the model instead of building it from the scratch?
