Suggested reading order and other questions

Based on recommendations from episode 57 of the StackOverflow Podcast, I have purchased "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", "The C Programming Language", "Unix Programming Environment", and "Introduction to Algorithms". I'm wanting to improve my fundamental programming skills, contribute to some open source projects, and improve my future employment prospects. Is there a suggested reading order for the selected texts? Also, what particular subjects/sections from the books should I pay more attention to? Thanks.
