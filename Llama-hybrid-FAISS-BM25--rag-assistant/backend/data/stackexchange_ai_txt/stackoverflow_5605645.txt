One way to pass values back from a callback would be to give a pointer to some storage to g_signal_connect() . That pointer will then be passed to your handler, which can write its "return value" there. You could also pass the address of another function (or the address of a struct containing both data and function pointer, or whatever) to enable more complex behaviors in your handler function. As for your second question, I don't think I understand it, and anyway each question should be its own post here.
