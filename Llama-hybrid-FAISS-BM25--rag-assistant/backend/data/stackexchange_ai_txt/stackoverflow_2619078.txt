You should have some kind of session set up. Using POST over GET gets you nothing tangible as far as security is concerned. POSTs can be forged just like GETs. So assuming once your admin logs in, you've got some kind of identifier in the session, you just leverage that. Consider something roughly similar to this: In that example, we're avoiding the "delete someone else's records" problem by leveraging the WHERE clause in the DELETE query. Of course, to be more user friendly, you'd want to first fetch the record, then compare the admin_id on the record to the admin_id in $_SESSION, and if they don't match, complain, log something, throw an error, etc. HTH
