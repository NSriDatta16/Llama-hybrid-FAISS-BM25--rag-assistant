I can't really make the two terms "Windows" and "4TB of data" match in my head. Windows is a desktop OS written for the average user who does a bit of Word and browsing with IE. If you have special needs, use a server OS like Linux. It comes with all the tools you need to handle large amounts of data. You also get FS benchmark tools like bonnie . You can also choose from a large set of filesystems where some (like ZFS) are designed for huge sizes (Exabytes). NTFS can theoretically handle this amount of data but I'm not aware that anyone has actually tried this. See this Wikipedia article for some pointers. [EDIT] Since you use a "server" edition of Windows (which translates to "Desktop OS with a couple of nice wizards to set up the network"), you must have a professional support contract with Microsoft. This means you can just call them, explain your problem and let them tell you how to solve it. Sorry, I'm being unnecessarily sarcastic here but I find all this really amusing ;) Just because the marketing department slaps a "Server" label on something doesn't mean that a professional administrator would buy it. I'd be surprised if someone would post an answer to the effect "we did the same thing and we could get it working reliably and to our satisfaction".
