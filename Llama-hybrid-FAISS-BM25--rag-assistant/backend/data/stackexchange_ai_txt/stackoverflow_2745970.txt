BAR::call_adder() had a couple of problems. For one, you were mixing case. In C++, case is signifigant. BAR and bar are not the same. Second, you decalred and assigned the pointer fine, after fixing the case problems, but when you try to call through the pointer to a member function, you need to use operator ->* with a class object. Here's is call_adder() fixed void call_adder(int a, int b) { int (BAR::*fptr)(int a, int b); fptr = &BAR::add_stuff; cout *fptr)(a,b)
