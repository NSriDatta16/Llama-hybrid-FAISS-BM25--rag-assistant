If my little guy at position x10,y100 moves right 1 unit do I just re-instantiate him using his old values with a +1 to his x position (e.g x11,y100)? Well, not necessarily. You could instantiate the guy once, and change its position during play. You may model this with agents. The guy is an agent, so is the AI, so is the render thread, so is the user. When the AI shoots the guy, it sends it a message, when the user presses an arrow key that sends another message and so on. let guyAgent (guy, position, health) = let messages = receiveMessages() let (newPosition, newHealth) = process(messages) sendMessage(renderer, (guy, newPosition, newHealth)) guyAgent (guy, newPosition, newHealth) "Everything" is immutable now (actually, under the hood the agent's dipatch queue does have some mutable state probably). If immutability is something I should strive for and even jump though hoops of instantiating new versions of objects that have changed...And If I instantiate my guy every time he moves (only with a different position) don't I have exactly the same problems as I would if he was mutable? Well, yes. Looping with mutable values and recurring with immutable ones is equivalent. Edit: For agents, the wiki is always helpful. Luca Bolognese has an F# implementation of agents. This book (called by some The Intelligent Agent Book ), though targeting the AI applications (instead of having a SW engineering point of view) is excellent.
