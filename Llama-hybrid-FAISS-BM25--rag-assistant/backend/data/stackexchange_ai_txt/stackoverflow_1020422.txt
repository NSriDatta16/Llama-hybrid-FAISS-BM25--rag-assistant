It may seem unrelated at first, but check out the dictionary-oriented structure in this Introduction to Cocoa Bindings . (CocoaDevCentral and Scott Stevenson are great resources for new Cocoa developers.) The approach he uses is extremely flexible and easy to change down the road. Using a dictionary instead of ivars isn't always the best solution, but it might be a good fit for your needs. Note: Like Core Data, Cocoa Bindings is also a very complex topic. I'm suggesting using only the organizational aspect of the tutorial, not going all-out with bindings. :-)
