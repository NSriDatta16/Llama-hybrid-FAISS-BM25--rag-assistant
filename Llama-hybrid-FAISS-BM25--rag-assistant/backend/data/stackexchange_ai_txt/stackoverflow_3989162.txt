RoR: Storing HTML in a File for Later Use

In our application we have different themes and each theme has its own default content in the following structure: ROWS COLUMNS CONTENT HTML DATA 1 CONTENT HTML DATA 2 There could be multiple rows, column and content elements. We need to store this data in a file (manually) and then read & dump it into database. We tried with XML but it seems not feasible even with CDATA. Other options we have are: a. Store in simple HTML document and use Hpricot for retrieval b. Use YAML for storing at retrieval Please let me know if which way is better or any other better alternative. Thanks, Imran
