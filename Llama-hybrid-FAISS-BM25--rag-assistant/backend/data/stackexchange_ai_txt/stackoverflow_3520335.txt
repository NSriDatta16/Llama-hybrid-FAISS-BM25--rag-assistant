The Google Docs API provides programmatic access to Google Docs , where you can create and store documents and spreadsheets. Your application could have its own Google login, which it uses to create one or more documents per user. These documents could be used to store the user settings. Provided you can get a unique ID from each user (an email address, or something more secure, perhaps), this should be fairly simple. You can even organize the files into foldersâ€”one per user. Alternatively, you could combine Google Docs with the Google Spreadsheets API , where I have just noticed this rather handy feature: Tables & Records Interact with spreadsheets as if they're a database using Tables and Records.
