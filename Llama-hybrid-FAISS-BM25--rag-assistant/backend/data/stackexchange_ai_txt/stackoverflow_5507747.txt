As far as I remember, the register keyword tells the compiler to try to save the variable in a register of the CPU, for increasing the principle of locality. The programmer knows that the variable will be accessed many times so he wants to keep it in the fastest memory location that he can obtain. I suspect that many compilers today are smarter than (the average) programmers when it comes to this kind of optimizations, so it could be not needed. I would not use it.
