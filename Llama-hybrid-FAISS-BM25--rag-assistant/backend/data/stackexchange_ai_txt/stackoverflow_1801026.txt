From perlfaq8 's answer to How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime . You just need to use one of these techniques with EPIC. How do I add a directory to my include path (@INC) at runtime? Here are the suggested ways of modifying your include path, including environment variables, run-time switches, and in-code statements: the PERLLIB environment variable $ export PERLLIB=/path/to/my/dir $ perl program.pl the PERL5LIB environment variable $ export PERL5LIB=/path/to/my/dir $ perl program.pl the perl -Idir command line flag $ perl -I/path/to/my/dir program.pl the use lib pragma: use lib "$ENV{HOME}/myown_perllib"; The last is particularly useful because it knows about machine dependent architectures. The lib.pm pragmatic module was first included with the 5.002 release of Perl.
