How to retrieve and process Gmail data

I am doing a project that involves processing data from my Gmail history. Specifically, I want to generate a multi-page styled PDF that has a custom page for each of 100 or so people - showing data such as number of e-mails sent in the past year, number of e-mails received in the past year, average word length of e-mail, most used terms in e-mail, date of oldest e-mail sent or received, maybe even average number of exclamation points or expletives per e-mail, etc. I saw this question , which had a helpful link to IMAP functions in the PHP manual , but can someone help me out with what the architecture and difficulty of such a project would be? I am envisioning: write a php script to run some IMAP functions on my Gmail data and write it to a MySQL database. write another script to run a loop of MySQL queries on the database and print to a PDF based on the results
