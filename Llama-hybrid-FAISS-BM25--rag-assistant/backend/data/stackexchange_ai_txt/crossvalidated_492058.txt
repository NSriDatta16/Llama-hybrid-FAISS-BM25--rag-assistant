PCA for reducing number of variables

I have 200 variables and about 300 subjects. I wanted to create a subset of variables based on the 200 variables I have. Basically, I wanted to reduce the amount of variables (currently 200) to a smaller number (ex: 10). Can I use factor analysis or PCA? I tried to do PCA using SPSS but the results seemed weird. The results contained everything (KMO, eigen values, component matrix, etc.). However, there were no results for Bartlett's Test of Sphericity. My first question is, why was the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity not performed? My 2nd question is: is it OK to do a PCA with 200 variables and 200 subjects? My third question is: what are other techniques I can use to reduce the number of variables (i.e., dimension reduction)?
