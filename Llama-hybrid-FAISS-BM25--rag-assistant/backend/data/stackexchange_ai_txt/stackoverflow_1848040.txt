Detect touch on UIView with Interface Builder

How can I detect touches in a UIviewController for a UIView with code only (without Interface Builder)? I found the touchesBegan method but it doesn't get called ever. I didn't initialize anything else regarding this method. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
