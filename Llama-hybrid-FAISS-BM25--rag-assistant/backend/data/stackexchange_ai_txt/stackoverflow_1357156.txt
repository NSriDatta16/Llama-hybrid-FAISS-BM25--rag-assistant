Multiple normal white space characters (space, tabulator and line break) are treated as one single white space character : For all HTML elements except PRE , sequences of white space separate "words" (we use the term "word" here to mean "sequences of non-white space characters"). When formatting text, user agents should identify these words and lay them out according to the conventions of the particular written language (script) and target medium. So foo bar is displayed as foo bar But no-break space is always displayed. So foo&‍nbsp;&‍nbsp;&‍nbsp;bar is displayed as foo bar
