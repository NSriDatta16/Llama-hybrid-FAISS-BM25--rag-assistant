I don't think you must forfeit OOP when you program in JS ; I suggest you embrace OOP ! I prefer the ExtJS library which provides classes, encourages subclassing, and provides a very nice example of a well-defined class hierarchy. Douglas Crockford provides examples of making member data and member functions private (no protected). Many people use JavaScript's prototype as a vehicle to implement inheritence; again see Douglas Crockford . Polymorphism is easy as JS is not strongly typed. Also, many of the popular JavaScript libraries abstract browser differences from the developer; you will likely find few "ifs" in your code to compensate for differences in browsers should you choose to use a JS library. Finally, here are some other good resources from SO .
