I agree with user42628 that grouping doesn't help here much and that logistic regression sounds like a good idea with this data. In this approach you would predict if the project have active users by its size. It is better approach that correlation (that is problematic because one of your variables is binary), because it also gives you more information that just strength of relation between those variables. I personally wouldn't use t-test because it would only tell you if both groups differ, on average, in size - as for me it doesn't sound interesting. With logistic regression you would know how size (or its log) influences a probability of having active users. Also, form your plot I see that there is an outlier in your data (lower right corner of the plot), so you have to decide what to do with it. It will certainly influence your results. But this is a different topic.
