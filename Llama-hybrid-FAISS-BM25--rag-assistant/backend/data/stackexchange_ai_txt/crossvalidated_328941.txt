Partial residual plot not informative but transformations of predictor variables are required?

I have fitted a binary logistic regression model with two explanatory variables: $x_1,x_2$ using fractional polynomials (60k observations)( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mfp/vignettes/mfp_vignette.pdf ). The regression function and its transformation of the variables suggests $\text{logit}(p(x)) = -7\times10^{-6} x_1^2 + 6.3 x_2^{0.5} - 14.5 \log x_2$ With these transformation of $x_1,x_2$ I get a substantial decrease in residual deviance compared to keeping these as linear terms . (Null deviance: 13951(intercept) ,Residual deviance 13814(linear), residual deviance 12624 (transformation)) Keeping these variables linear gives: $\text{logit}(p(x)) = -0.0035x_1 - 0.0079x_2$ I would like to confirm that these transformations(fractional polynomials) seem reasonable using a partial residual plot ( crPlots ). But looking at the graphs the smoother (green line) suggests keeping $x_1,x_2$ linear. Why does the partial residual plot not suggest that I would transform the variables when such transformations lead to a substantial decrease in residual deviance? Here are plots of the(transformed) functional form of $x_1,x_2$:
