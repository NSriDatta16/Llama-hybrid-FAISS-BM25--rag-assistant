You need at least mod_proxy and mod_proxy_http which both are part of the distribution (yet not everytime built automatically). Then you can look here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html Simplest config in a virtualhost context is: ProxyPass /winapp http://127.0.0.1:8080/somedir/ ProxyPassReverse /winapp http://127.0.0.1:8080/somedir/ (Depending on your webapp, the actual config might become more sophisticated. ) That transparently redirects every request on the path winapp/ to the windows server and transfers the resulting output back to the client. Attention: Take care of the links in the delivered pages: they aren't rewritten, so you can save yourself lotsa hassle if you generally use relative links in your app, like instead of the usual integration nightmare of every link being absolute: THE LATTER IS BAD ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME! For rewriting links in pages there's mod_proxy_html (not to confuse with mod_proxy_http!) but that's another story and a cruel one as well.
