How do I toggle 'draggable' for Google Maps GMarker object?

I want to have draggable markers (already done), but I need to be able to turn off draggability in certain conditions. Marker is created like this; var Marker = new GMarker(center,{draggable:true}); ...which works fine. But I can't figure out how to make it undraggable.
