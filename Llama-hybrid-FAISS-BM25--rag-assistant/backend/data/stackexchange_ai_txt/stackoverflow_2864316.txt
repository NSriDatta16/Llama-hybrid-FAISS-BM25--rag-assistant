Can't write text into textbox in ASP.NET web app

I have an ASP.NET web application. In the codebehind for the .ascx page (which I embed as below), I attempt to write a string to a textbox in a method like this: Code for embedding control: Control ctrl = Page.LoadControl("/RackRecable.ascx"); PlaceHolder1.Controls.Add(ctrl); Method to make string for inserting into textbox: string AppendDetails() { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.Append("msg" + " " + textbox1.Text etc etc ); return sb.ToString(); } Called as (in codebehind event handler for button click): this.TextBox4.Text = AppendDetails(); I call it by using ATextBox.Text = AppendDetails (in the button click event handler). The textbox TextBox4 is in the designer file so I am confused why the text does not get written into this textbox (it is readonly and enabled). When stepping through, the textbox4 control will successfully show the text I want it to display in quick watch but not in the actual page, it won't. Any ideas? Thanks
