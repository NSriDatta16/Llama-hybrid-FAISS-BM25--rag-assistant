This is a typical feature for a mail server. So.. A. Another solution would be to just use a real mail system/server in the background. This is a little bit more complicated to setup (it would require that every user and every group on your site to have a real email address on your local server, that is only used internaly) and let the mail server handle multiple messages sent to groups, etc etc. Anyway, think on the fact that you must probably provide features like: message read, message unread, message mark (as important, etc), message delete. So, i believe there is no way you can escape having one record per message per user. Now, let's think how many messages can really be in that table on the DB. If one user has, on average, 100 messages in his inbox (btw which is huge, we are speaking about an average), this would mean (see APC's response ) a table with 2 columns (integers) having 5 milions rows, indexed on user_id. This is not an issue for any serious DB. B. Now, if you are really really concerned on performance, you can use a hash storage/DB (only for messages) like Memcached, Tokio Cabinet, CouchDB, MongoDB etc.
