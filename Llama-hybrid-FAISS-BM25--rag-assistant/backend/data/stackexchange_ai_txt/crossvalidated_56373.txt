Understanding the derivation of an equation in LDA modeling

When reading the derivation of LDA models, I usually get the following equations. I do not quite understand the second step, where $p(\mathbf{z}_{-i},\mathbf{w}|\alpha,\beta)$ was removed. Is that because it can be thought of as a constant when studying $z_{i}$. I know this is a common practice in Bayesian statistics, but I am not sure whether $p(\mathbf{z}_{-i},\mathbf{w}|\alpha,\beta)$ is a constant.
