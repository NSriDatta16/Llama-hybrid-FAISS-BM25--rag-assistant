Here is a solution: $.merge($header_elements, $footer_elements).css({color:"#ff0000"}); I tested it with JS Fiddle here : http://jsfiddle.net/bgLfz/1/ I tested using selector each time, variable for both selector, variables with $.merge() and using .add(). Each test was run 1000 times. Results on my side are as follow (from faster to slower): Using $.merge() (average of 7ms) Using both variable one after the other (average of 10ms but the code needs to be duplicated) Using .add() (average of 16ms) Using selectors each time (average of 295ms)
