How can I assign a quality to a regression based on the number of data points?

Let's say I want to create a line of best fit to approximate the relationship between years of golf experience, and average golf score. If I have only 4 data points, my line of best fit will have a lot of noise. Is there an equation I can use to say how good the line of best fit is based on the number of data points are used to create it? I guess we could say quality = theNumberOfDataPoints, but it doesn't seem like a linear relationship to me... Is it maybe the square root of the number of data points?
