WPF custom panel control doesn't respond to mouse events

I've created a custom panel control and would like to have it respond to a mouse move event, however, when I add an event handler like so: Private Sub FloatingPanel_MouseMove(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As MouseEventArgs) Handles Me.MouseMove End Sub It only responds when I move the mouse over one of the child controls within the panel. I need to have it respond whenever I move the mouse anywhere inside the custom panel. Update: I found the following question which gave me a clue: WPF - how to best implement a panel with draggable/zoomable children? I can get mouse events on the GraphCanvas itself only if it has a background at the point This led me to simply set the background which appears to have resolved the issue... My question now is, why? Why should I have to set the background in order to receive a mousemove event? Update 2: The following code is what ultimately solved the problem (See Kent's answer below). Protected Overrides Function HitTestCore(ByVal hitTestParameters As System.Windows.Media.PointHitTestParameters) As System.Windows.Media.HitTestResult Return New PointHitTestResult(Me, hitTestParameters.HitPoint) End Function Thank you, Matt
