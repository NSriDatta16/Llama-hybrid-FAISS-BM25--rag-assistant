This question is ambiguous. Does it mean You can play this game only once and you wish to maximize the expected difference between what you collect at the end and the cost of the rolls needed to get there? Or, You can play this game an unlimited number of times and you wish to maximize your expected profit per roll in the long run? The two interpretation lead to very different strategies , each of which would be exceptionally poor if applied in the other circumstance! First interpretation. Let $T\subset \{1,2,\ldots, 100\}$ be the set of values for which you intend to collect a reward and let $p=|T|/100$ be its size as a proportion of all outcomes. The expected number of rolls needed to observe an element of $T$ is (as is well known and intuitively obvious) equal to $1/p = 100/|T|.$ Moreover, the expected reward is the mean of $T$ (because, conditional on $T,$ the rolls are uniformly distributed among the values of $T$ ). Consequently, For any given value of $p$ you want to make the mean of $T$ as large as possible. Thus, $T = \{t, t+1, \ldots, 100\}$ must consist of the $100p$ highest possible values on the die. Its mean is $(100+t)/2$ and $p = (101-t)/100.$ Thus, your expected net profit is $(100+t)/2 - 100/(101-t).$ As a function of a real variable this rises smoothly to a maximum at $t = 101 - \sqrt{200} \approx 86.9$ and then falls rapidly, implying that as a function of an integral value it must be maximized either at $86$ or $87.$ It's almost a toss-up, but $t=87$ wins out by a tiny amount. Here is a plot of this function. And a closer look near the region of interest (notice the scale on the vertical axis): Second interpretation. You might as well ask what is the best way to pick up cash lying in the street: take it all! Imagine all future rolls laid out before you in order, like this randomly generated sequence: 86 91 100 8 100 66 87 9 71 44 24 94 57 2 68 62 59 93 97 15 ... You will pay $\$1$ for each of these rolls no matter what. You will receive, however, only those rewards where you choose to stop. I'm going to make your choice supremely easy: since you have committed to bet on each roll, I will let you peek at them all to decide which rewards to collect! Surely you cannot do better without peeking, so this provides an upper bound on what you might be able to achieve. For instance, if--according to some--you select any reward where the roll exceeds 49, your list of net returns (rewards minus the bets) begins 85 90 99 -1 99 65 86 -1 70 -1 -1 93 56 -1 67 61 58 92 96 -1 ... If instead--if you were relying on the results of the first interpretation of the question for guidance--you select only rewards where the roll exceeds 86, your list of net returns begins -1 90 99 -1 99 -1 86 -1 -1 -1 -1 93 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 92 96 -1 The more restrictive your stopping rule, the more times you will replace a positive number with a -1. In the long run, it just gets worse and worse for you as you hold back waiting for any set of special stopping numbers. This argument covers not only a threshold stopping rule, but even an arbitrary sequence of stopping rules of any complexity. Any rule that causes you not to collect a reward immediately reduces your total return. Wait, you might object: why can't I just decide not to bet on the next roll? Go right ahead. I will make the same offer as before, but you are not allowed to peek at the roll before deciding not to bet. Because that's the case, the list of the rolls that you do bet on will have exactly the same probabilistic characteristics as the list I began this answer with: it's a sequence of independent uniform outcomes. I said that peeking gives an upper bound on the possibilities. However, since the greatest total rewards can be obtained without peeking, the optimal strategy is to collect a reward on every turn regardless of the roll's outcome. Your expected value for each roll is $-1$ (for the cost of rolling) plus $101/2$ (the expected value on a d100 die), a net of $49.5.$ If you are believer in any other strategy, understand that by waiting until a high-ish value is observed, you will tend to pay for several rolls before seeing that number. For instance, if you wait to see a value exceeding 50, it is easy to establish (and intuitively obvious) that you will pay for two rolls on average for that to happen. You will collect an expected value of $(51+52+\cdots+100)/50 = 75.5$ but you will have paid $\$2$ for that privilege. The average rate of return on your investment is only $(75.5-2)/2 = 36.75,$ noticeably less than the ROI of $49.5/1 = 49.5$ achieved with the optimal strategy. Still unconvinced? For the 20 rolls shown at the outset, I will pay $20$ and collect $1233,$ leaving me up by $1213.$ You will pay the same $20$ and will collect only $1131,$ leaving you with $102$ less than me.
