As far as I am aware there are no approved API's to access a server based database. The way we do it in our organisation is pretty much the way you are suggesting. In some instances we are using SOAP but typically we just use a custom JSON or XML web service to access the data. With regards to ASP.NET are you talking about making native iPhone Apps with ASP.NET or getting a native iPhone App to talk to an ASP.NET web service? If its the first then have a look at monotouch (don't know much about it), if its the later then this shouldn't cause issues. Just use NSURLConnection and deal with the resource structure on the App (be it JSON or XML). The added advantage of using a web service rather than a straight database connection is that you get encryption for free using https. Hope that helps
