Confused with basic time series terminology

I am a bit confused with the basic time series terminology: Consider the following words: fitted values forecasted values in-sample forecasts out-of-sample forecasts in-sample fit I am using GARCH models in my thesis. So the equations have a lagged character. E.g. GARCH(1,1): $\sigma_t^2=\alpha_0+\alpha_1\epsilon^2_{t-1}+\beta_1\sigma_{t-1}^2$ My fitted values are the $\hat{\sigma}^2_{T+1|T}$ with using in-sample data, i.e. I have estimates of the alpha and beta (estimation using all in-sample data) and I plug in the in-sample data. Due to the lagged character of the equation this could also be called in-sample forecasts, right? This would be $\hat{\sigma}^2_{T+1|T}$, $\hat{\sigma}^2_{T+2|T}$, $\hat{\sigma}^2_{T+3|T}$, $\hat{\sigma}^2_{T+4|T}$.... Forecasted values in general means forecasting the volatility equation at the end of the time horizon, so this is out-of-sample, right? This would be out-of-sample forecasts? I am not sure about the meaning "in-sample fit". I mean, fit is always in-sample right? Or otherwise this would imply that there is an out-of-sample fit, which makes no sense? Does the word combination in-sample fit exists?? Is it right, that I can use fitted and forecasted values or in-sample forecasts and out-of sample forecasts? Because I think that fitted values is the same as in-sample forecasts and forecasted values is equal to out-of-sample forecasts
