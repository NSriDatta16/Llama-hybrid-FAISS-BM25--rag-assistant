I'm pretty good with TFS - but a dev not a network guy. I would GUESS that while the NETWORK SHARE itself allows 100 connections, is it possible the underlying server it is running on doesn't have some sort of limitation? Have you checked event logs? This problem seems specific enough I would encourage you to post to the official Microsoft forums.
