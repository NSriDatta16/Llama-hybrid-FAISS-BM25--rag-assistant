jquery layout and dynamic draggable div issue

I am using jquery layout plugin and have the following situation that I cannot find a solution. How do I make the center pane increase its size permanently by dragging the div beyond the bottom border. I have a left pane and a center pane. I dynamically generate div when the user clicks on the left pane. The divs are generated and dropped on the center pane. The divs are draggable and resizable. Everything works fine with dragging and resizing on the visible center area. The moment I drag the div beyond the bottom, the scroll bar on the center pane appears and it seems the center pane is extending to accommodate the new position of the dragged div. But the moment I try to resize the div or add another div, it jumps to the top section of the div and resets the scrollbars. I checked the center div height in firebug and it remains at the same height when initialized even after dragging the new div beyond the bottom. Here is the test page html code. Just copy/paste entirely into a html page. On the left pane, click on the "Add new" button will add new div that is draggable and resizable. Click on "Add new" Drag the newly added div beyond the bottom of the center pane. The center pane shows the scrollbar as it is suppose to. If you check the center div's height in firebug, it is not changing Now try resizing the newly added div by dragging its handle It jumps to the top and the center box loses its scrollbar. I could not paste the complete html page so here is the reference to the code at the bottom of this thread http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui-layout/browse_thread/thread/ca922aa44c0048ee And here is the test link http://jsfiddle.net/yZc63/
