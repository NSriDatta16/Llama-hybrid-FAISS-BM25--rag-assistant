You communicate with the web view server (the CCRC server) through requests, without having a full ClearCase client installed: it is a WAN-based solution. The differences in term of features between SCM adapter and CCRC are listed there and here . Again: The SCM adapater is an eclipse plugin allowing you to exploit the CC client without leaving eclipse. the CCRC is a RCP (Rich Client Platform) based on eclipse, replacing a CC client and communicating with a CCRC web view server.
