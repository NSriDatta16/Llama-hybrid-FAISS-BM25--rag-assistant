Here's my CSS: span.print_underline { display: inline-block; height: 1em; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; } So your HTML will look like: &nbsp; I left the width out, so I could reuse it as much as I want, but you can specify the width. As a sidenote, I tested the same concept with a div tag instead of span tag, and it did not work in some situations. This is probably because it is semantically incorrect to put a div within a paragraph tag (which is why I used a span), and I generally use paragraph tags instead of using table rows like you've used.
