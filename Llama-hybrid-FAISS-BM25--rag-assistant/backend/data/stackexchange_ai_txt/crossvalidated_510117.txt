Note # 1: Can you edit your R output to use English names for your variables? For those of us who don't speak German, it's impossible to reconcile your explanations (which use English names for the variables) and your R output (which uses German names for the variables). Having English names for variables (and their categories) will make it more likely that you will receive an answer to your question. (My tablet won't let me add this as a comment, so I have to add it as an answer for now.) Note #2: Thank you for the edits. You are not quite ready to interpret your output because you missed out on an important step prior to fitting your ordinal logistic regression model: arranging the levels of your ordinal response variable - Satisfaction with their living situation - in a way that reflects their natural ordering. Recall that you declared this variable to be: Satisfaction with their living situation (Ordinal). Levels: (Very) satisfied; neither, (Very) dissatisfied So its levels could be arranged, for example, from "low" to "high": (Very) dissatisfied in which case you would expect to see something like this in your model summary output: (Very) dissatisfied | Neither Neither | (Very) satisfied (Note that what you currently have in your output implies that your response categories are out of order .) With the ordering suggested above, you will be modelling the following as a function of the predictor variables in your model: Log odds of being (Very) dissatisfied versus being Neither or (Very) satisfied . Log odds of being (Very) dissatisfied or Neither versus being (Very) satisfied . The R command you need to order the levels of a response variable is the ordered() command. Something like this: data $response response, c("low", "medium", "high")) if the response variable has categories "low", "medium" and "high". See https://data.princeton.edu/wws509/r/c6s5 , https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-and-interpreting-ordinal-logistic-regression-1ee699274cf5 and https://rpubs.com/kaz_yos/polr . Once you re-order your response variable, you need to update your R output in your post above. Sorry for the extra homework! Note #3 How is your Housing variable represented in the data? Is it a variable with categories such as "Alone", "With partner and/or children", "Student hall of residence", etc. If yes, you will need to declare that variable as a factor in R prior to fitting your model: Wohnen_english_clean $Housing Housing) Note that R will arrange the levels of the Housing factor in alphabetical order: levels(Wohnen_english_clean$Housing) That is not always a good thing because it is an arbitrary arrangement. When R fits your model, it will set aside the first level of the factor: levels(Wohnen_english_clean$Housing)[1] and create dummy variables for all other levels. This will allow you to compare the log odds of interest for the second level of Housing relative to the first level, controlling for the effects of the Rent and Commuting_Time; the log odds of interest for the third level of Housing relative to the first level, controlling for the effects of the Rent and Commuting_Time; etc. The log odds of interest refer to (i) the log odds of being Very dissatisfied versus Neither or Very Satisfied and (ii) the log odds of being Very dissatisfied or Neither versus Very Satisfied . If you don't like R's default choice of first (or reference) level for Housing, you can change it like this: Wohnen_english_clean $Housing Housing, ref = "Alone") levels(Wohnen_english_clean$Housing)
