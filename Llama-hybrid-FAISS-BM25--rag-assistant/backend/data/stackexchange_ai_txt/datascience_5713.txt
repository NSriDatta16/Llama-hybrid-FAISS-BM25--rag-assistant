There are too many too general problems in your post. We're definitely in an AI summer era right now (as opposed to AI winter ), and the research on Semantic Web receives less attention. Still, there are many projects related to building ontologies. Google has Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Vault . Both of these are using Freebase (among other sources). There are dozens of links I can give you to answer some of your questions, but the best thing you can do is to browse W3C Semantic Web pages. Take a look at RDF, SPARQL, OWL, Virtuoso, Protege - these are de facto standards. In terms of extracting ontologies from textual corpora - there are various tools out there. Neither of them is perfect, so you really have to do some research and find something that suits your needs. For example, there's the OntoLearn Reloaded (this paper is relatively new, so you can check out the bibliography to seek out for other approaches).
