Should I deal with missing values first then transform the data or vice versa?

I am currently working on a project involving time series banking stock price data. I have around 3000 observations, some columns have a lot of missing values (null value); they can account for 5 to 50% of the total observations. I have no idea what is the proper order for handling missing values, outliers and take log transformation of the data. Should I impute the missing values first and take log transformation or vice versa. Thank you so much
