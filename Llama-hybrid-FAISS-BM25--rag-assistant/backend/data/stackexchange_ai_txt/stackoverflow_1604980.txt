SQL and Relational Theory - How to Write Accurate SQL Code , by Chris J. Date; from the Preface : SQL is ubiquitous. But SQL is hard to use: It's complicated, confusing, and error prone—much more so, I venture to suggest, than its apologists would have you believe. In order to have any hope of writing SQL code that you can be sure is accurate, therefore (meaning it does exactly what it's supposed to do, no more and no less), you must follow some appropriate discipline—and it's the thesis of this book that using SQL relationally is the discipline you need. But what does this mean? Isn't SQL relational anyway? Well, it's true that SQL is the standard language for use with relational databases—but that fact in itself doesn't make it relational. The sad truth is, SQL departs from relational theory in all too many ways; duplicate rows and nulls are two obvious examples, but they're not the only ones. As a consequence, it gives you rope to hang yourself with, as it were. So if you don't want to hang yourself, you need to understand relational theory (what it is and why); you need to know about SQL's departures from that theory; and you need to know how to avoid the problems they can cause. In a word, you need to use SQL relationally. Then you can behave as if SQL truly were relational, and you can enjoy the benefits of working with what is, in effect, a truly relational system. Now, a book like this wouldn't be needed if everyone was using SQL relationally already—but they aren't. On the contrary, I observe much bad practice in current SQL usage. I even observe such practice being recommended, in textbooks and similar publications, by writers who really ought to know better (no names, no pack drill); in fact, a review of the literature in this regard is a pretty dispiriting exercise. The relational model first saw the light of day in 1969, and yet here we are, almost 40 years on, and it still doesn't seem to be very well understood by the database community at large. Partly for such reasons, this book uses the relational model itself as an organizing principle; it explains various features of the model in depth, and shows in every case how best to use SQL to implement the feature in question. ... From there, if you want to deepen the subject, Applied Mathematics for Database Professionals , by Lex de Haan (RIP) and Toon Koppelaars; from the Forward , by Hugh Darwen and Chris J. Date (again): We welcome this contribution to the database literature. It is another book on the theory and practice of relational databases, but this one is interestingly different. The bulk of the book is devoted to a treatment of the theory. The treatment is not only rigorous and mathematical, but also rather more approachable than some other texts of this kind. The authors clearly recognize, as we do, the importance of logic and mathematics if database study is to be taken seriously. They have done a good job of describing a certain formalism developed by their former teachers, Bert de Brock and Frans Remmen. This formalism includes some ideas that will be novel to many readers, even those who already have a degree of familiarity with the subject. A particularly interesting novel idea, to us, is the formalization of updating and transactions in Chapter 10. ... Practical Issues in Database Management: A Reference for the Thinking Practitioner , by Fabian Pascal: Preface The computer industry —and its database sector in particular— resembles the fashion industry: it is driven by fads. And more often than not, vendors profit from accelerated obsolescence on which fads are predicated. It's the users , however, not the vendors, who pay trough the nose. The vendors, helped by the trade media, can profitably exploit ignorance and obscure serious product deficiencies and questionable practices they induce by simply luring users to the next fad—the Internet being just the latest one. ... [ My note: The book was published in 2000, but there is no sign that the WWW in particular is advanced beyond its fad functioning mode.] An Introduction to Relational Database Theory , by Hugh Darwen, this one is free , it can be downloaded directly from its site.
