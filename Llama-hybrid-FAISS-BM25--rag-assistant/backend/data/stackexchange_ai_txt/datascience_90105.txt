Information Gain of a Customer ID Attribute

Suppose I have a dataframe like the following CustID ... Class 1 ... C0 2 ... C1 3 ... C1 4 ... C0 5 ... C0 6 ... C1 I am trying to find the information gain, and I was wondering if this is the correct process? I began by finding the information gain of the parent node $$I(\mathrm{parent}) = -(3/6) log_2 (3/6) - (3/6) log_2 (3/6) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.$$ Then, the information of the children node, Customer ID. $$I(\mathrm{children}) = -(1/6) log_2 (1/6) - (1/6) log_2 (1/6) - (1/6) log_2 (1/6) - (1/6) log_2 (1/6) - (1/6) log_2 (1/6) - (1/6) log_2 (1/6) = 6 \times (- (1/6) log_2 (1/6)) = 2.584963$$ However, $$\Delta = 1 - 2.584963 = -1.584963.$$ Is it possible to have a negative information gain?
