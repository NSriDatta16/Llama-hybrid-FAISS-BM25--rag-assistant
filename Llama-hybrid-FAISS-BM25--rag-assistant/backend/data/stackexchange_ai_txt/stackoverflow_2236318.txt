See relevant section in "Resource Programming Guide": When you load a nib file that contains references to image and sound resources, the nib-loading code caches resources whenever possible for easy retrieval later. For example, after loading a nib file, you can retrieve an image associated with that nib file using the imageNamed: method of either NSImage or UIImage (depending on your platform). So it looks like it uses imageNamed: or some underlying internal routines. Edit: You may also be interested in this post about +imageNamed
