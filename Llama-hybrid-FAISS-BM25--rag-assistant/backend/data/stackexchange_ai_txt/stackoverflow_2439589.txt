Installing MonoTouch - ibtool not found error

[edit] Found the solution. Reinstall EVERYTHING - xcode, mono, monodevelop and monotouch. Now it works. yay. [/edit] I've had Xcode (3.2.1 - SnowLeopard, iphone 3.1.3) installed for a while, and I can run and build apps on it fine. I installed MonoTouch, as I want to leverage the 8+ years of .NET skills I have :) So I installed: Mono : MonoFramework-2.6.1_1.macos10.novell.x86 MonoTouch : monotouch-eval-1.5.0 MonoDevelop : MonoDevelop-2.2.1-r152508 (was 2.2.1, but when I started it up, it said there was an update, which I installed - thats the update version) If I make a new project and build it, I get any of the following errors: Build failed. Object reference not set to the instance of an object. Build failed: ibtool not found (btw, it's in /Developer/usr/bin/ibtool) or a similar one to the second one if I use the older (2.2.1 released) version of MonoTouch. I can't find any debug info anywhere. I could reinstall XCode/iPhone SDK, but as it already is installed and works (and no, this isn't a SL upgrade), it doesn't make sense. Anyone got any ideas? I SO want to use MonoTouch - Obj-C drives me up the wall! Console apps (mono ones) work fine. Mac OS X 10.6.2, Macbook Pro, clean install with old settings moved over.
