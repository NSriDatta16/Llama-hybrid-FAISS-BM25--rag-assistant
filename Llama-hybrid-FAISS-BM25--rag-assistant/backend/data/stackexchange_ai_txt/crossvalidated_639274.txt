I'm not a time series expert, but I don't think four time points is enough to estimate a AR(1) model. Usually, the label "time series" is for much longer time series. You could run correlations among the four time points, but I am not sure what that would do for you. Your concern seems to be about a practice effect or exposure effect. You could model this in a couple ways; I am not sure which is best (and there may be other ways as well). But this is quite different from correlation among the points or from the dependency you propose modeling with AR(1). You could look at the means at each time point and subtract the difference from the later time points. You could add a variable for "data set" which would take levels "single point set", "first observation" and so on, and add this as a covariate. But I would start with what is sometimes known as a "spaghetti plot" which each subject is a line, the y axis is the dependent variable, and the x-axis is time. This will show if there are strong patterns in the data and if the later time points are, somehow, biased.
