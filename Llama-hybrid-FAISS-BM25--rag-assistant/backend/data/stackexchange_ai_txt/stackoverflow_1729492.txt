Semantic code uses html elements for their given purpose. Well structured HTML will have semantic meaning for a wide range of users and user agents (browsers without style sheets, text browsers, PDAs, search engines etc.) Benefits The two points mentioned earlier are the basic benefits of using semantic code. If we use globally known tags, others understand without any additional effort. Any software program that uses the globally known tags will not be able to understand our page. A working example of this is that search engines weigh keyword importance according to what they are. For example, and article title enclosed in one of the headings (h1 and its hierarchy) would get higher importance and hence visibility than spans. Semantic HTML enables effective Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The semantic data extractor of W3C is a good demonstration of the possibilities of using Semantic HTML and software automation. A side effect of excluding presentational information from the semantic markup is that now data and its presentation can be decoupled in implementation. Which means that you can change presentation without touching the data, or apply the presentation to multiple types of data. This is exactly what technologies like CSS and XHTML together achieve. Of course Semantic HTML is not necessary for this decoupling, but provides for by being semantic it enforces exclusion of presentational information. http://www.seoblogger.co.uk/serps/the-benefits-of-using-semantic-code.html
