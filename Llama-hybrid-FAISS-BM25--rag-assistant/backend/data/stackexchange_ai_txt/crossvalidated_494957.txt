Bayesian time-to-event modelling which allows time-dependent covariates, time-dependent coefficients and imputed datasets

Looking for recommendations on approach to modelling a patient disease cohort with treatment data (differing durations and doses), follow-up and survival data. Each subject has several covariates, some of which also vary through the follow-up period - i.e. both treatment effect and covariates are time-dependent. The proportional hazards assumption seems to be violated for several covariates, hence I need an approach which does not rely on this. Ideally I like to do this in Bayesian framework, to estimate the association of treatment with survival in this cohort. [To round things off, there are missing data which I've imputed by multiple imputation. So modelling estimations in each imputed dataset would need to be pooled to give a final estimate, but I'm putting that aside for now...] Does anyone know of a Bayesian approach to this? Or is this a job for joint longitudinal and time-to-event modelling? I work primarily in R, so that would suit me best but interested in the approach primarily. Thank you in advance!
