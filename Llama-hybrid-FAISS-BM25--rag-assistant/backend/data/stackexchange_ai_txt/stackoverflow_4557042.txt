I think "MERGE" is not yet in Postgres but is suposed to be in 9.1. I like to use RULE s instead CREATE OR REPLACE RULE "insert_ignore" AS ON INSERT TO "table" WHERE NEW.id = OLD.id --whatever your conditions are DO INSTEAD NOTHING; What you have linked to ("Insert, on duplicate update (postgresql)") is basically some pgsql that you feed the data. I think the RULE is more elegant since you don't need to call them explicitly and they work transparent in the background without the need to call a procedure within your actual INSERT.
