A couple things to add to what B_Miner said: 1) You wrote that the models varied from "everything significant" to "nothing significant" but this is not a good way to compare models. Look, instead, at predicted values (as B_miner suggested) and effect sizes. 2) If 70% of the data are 0, I can't imagine that a model without 0 inflation is appropriate. 3) Even if you don't want to go Bayesian, you can use GLMMs in SAS (PROC GLIMMIX or NLMIXED) and in R (various packages). Ignoring the nested nature may mess everything up. 4) In general, deciding on which model is best is an art, not a science. There are statistics to use, but they are a guide to judgment. Just looking at what you wrote, I would say a ZINB model looks right
