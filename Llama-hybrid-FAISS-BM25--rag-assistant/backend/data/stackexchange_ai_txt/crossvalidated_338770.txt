Principal Component Analysis and Time Series

I'm a PhD student with a very superficial knowledge of statistics and econometrics. I am trying to build an index representing the intensity of rental regulation in my country from 1915 to the present. This index should "summarize" different detailed (numerical) indicators, each representing a very specific feature of the regulation (most of them will be dummies). I have read something about weighted indices, built through a Principal Component Analysis, but: - I wasn't able to understand if this method can be used with time series; the papers I read only used it with cross-sectional datasets. - Because of my very lacking knowledge of statistics, I'm not even sure this method would lead me to the index I am trying to build! Is there anyone who could help me? I appreciate every suggestion, warning or advice for further readings. If you need more info about the data and research question,just ask :) Thanks a lot!
