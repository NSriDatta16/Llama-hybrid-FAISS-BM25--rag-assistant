Taking the questions in order - These days I understand a fair bit of what's going on inside the framework - not something that was at all true when I began working with Rails (although I had been dabbling with Ruby for a few years previously) You don't have to understand Rails, but it really, really helps to understand the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. You can get a long way very quickly, but as with most things, producing something really high quality is going to require the hard work. There are substantial differences in philosophy between Ruby and PHP as languages (IMO). Ruby is more consistent in syntax but its strong OO background means there's a non-trivial learning curve to negotiate. I think it's worth it, YMMV , why not take it for a test drive?
