Textarea to paragraphs

When I have to render textarea content to the front end I usually pass it thru a function that converts newlines to tags and double newlines signal paragraph tags so blocks of text get surrounded by and tags. To save time I usually use a ready made PHP function from the wordpress codebase. You can get the link from the man himself: http://ma.tt/scripts/autop/ If you check it out you'll see it does some heavy lifting with about 20 regular expressions. I know I could use a wysiwyg editor (like TinyMCE or CKEditor) that can format the data on the client and then send it to the server (most of them add .. tags by default) but I want to know the experience of others in handling raw textarea input and then displaying it on the front end. EDIT : Wow, was expecting more responses to this. Either most people use wysiwyg editors and/or direct output to browser and/or use basic functions like nl2br. I'll give this question another day.
