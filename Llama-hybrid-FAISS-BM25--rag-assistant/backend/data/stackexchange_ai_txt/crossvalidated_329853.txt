(I must note that I have not read the book, and thus may be misinterpreting this passage, or criticizing it inappropriately. That said...) I don't think this is correct. The standard regression assumption of i.i.d. errors does not pertain to the population from which the data were drawn. It is about the data that you are using to fit the model. That is, no one should ever believe that all human adult female heights that have ever existed or will exist, are independent of each other. They cannot be, due to shared genes, among other reasons. However, it is certainly possible, and often quite reasonable (IMHO) to imagine that the data in your sample are independent, e.g., when you have a set of young women all of whom are unrelated to each other. In that case, fitting a model that assumes the data are independent can be just fine. The import of the assumption of independence is not for the shape of the population distribution. While it can depend on the nature of the nonindependence and the estimation of the model, it is often the case that the mean estimates are unbiased, even when the data are not independent. Instead, the concern is typically about the appropriate width of a confidence interval around that estimated mean (or in a different framing, about the correctness of the p-value from a test of that parameter). As excerpted, the comment seems to be off-base to me. I am not primarily a Bayesian, and am considerably less sophisticated with Bayesian statistics, so it is possible there is some alternative Bayesian framing or interpretation of this such that the iid assumption is only about the whole possible (infinite) population, and specifically about its shape. But I am not aware of this.
