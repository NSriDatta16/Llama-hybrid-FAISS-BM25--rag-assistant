Again, it depends on what you are using it for, but the sign of PCA scores is critical in understanding relationships between your observations (in this case, pixels). Highly negative PCA-scores would be extremely dissimilar from highly positive PCA-scores, while those clustered near any particular point would be more similar. Regarding your clarifying question (pixel scores of 700 and -700), the two would have contributed the same amount, just drawing the PC axis out in opposite directions. The signs could be switched in a PCA for any axis, and the interpretation would be the same, as certain observations would continue to cluster together.
