Headers missing from XMLHttpRequest on iOS UIWebView

I'm experincing an odd situation where I have some JavaScript code running in a UIWebView. That JS code creates and fires off an XMLHttpRequest to pull some data off a server. I listen for onreadystatechange and I have an event listener for the "progress" event. For some reason this XMLHttpRequest returns only a subset of the Response Headers when queried using request.getAllResponseHeaders() or request.getResponseHeader('whatever') . Note that I've tried GETting any number of different of URLs and they all exhibit the same partial lack of headers. The only headers returned are Pragma, Cache-Control, Expires & Content-Type , nothing else returns (content-length, encoding, various custom headers, etc). The odd thing is that the same JS code executed in Mobile-Safari will show all the headers, in strike contrast to how that code behaves when inside a UIWebView. Any idea what's going on here?
