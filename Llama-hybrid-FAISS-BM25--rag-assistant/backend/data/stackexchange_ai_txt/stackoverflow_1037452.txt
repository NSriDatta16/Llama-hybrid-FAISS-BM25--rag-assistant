Is there an easy way to embed a Javascript interpreter in a C# application?

Is there an easy way to embed Javascript in a C# application? I want to make my C# application scriptable. I have used Lua for this in the past but would like to use Javascript in this instance. LuaInterface is a nice C# wrapper for the C Lua API and it made it really easy to embed Lua in C# and a lot less painful than writing a Managed C++ wrapper for the Lua API (I have tried that as well). Are there any C# libraries around for embedding Javascript that are as easy to use as LuaInterface?
