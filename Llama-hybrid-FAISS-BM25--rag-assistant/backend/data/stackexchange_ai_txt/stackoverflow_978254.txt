.net durable resource manager for transactional filesystem access

I'm trying to wrap my head around the use of the System.Transactions namespace in C#. I've found some documentation on MSDN regarding using resource managers, but it only covers volatile, in-memory resource managers in any detail (like Transactional ). I'm basically looking for something that I can use inside of a TransactionScope, just like Transactional<> but use it for writing/modifying/deleting files on disk. Does something like this exist in the standard libs? I've read that NTFS has "TxF" now to allow transactional filesystem access - I was expecting to find something in .net that leverages that. Perhaps I need to implement my own?
