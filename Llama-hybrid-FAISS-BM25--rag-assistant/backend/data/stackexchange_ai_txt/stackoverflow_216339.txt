You should just pass the string through mysql_escape_string or mysql_real_escape_string . I'd be wary of accepting any old regex though - some of them can run for a long time and will tie up your DB server. From Pattern Syntax : Beware of patterns that contain nested indefinite repeats. These can take a long time to run when applied to a string that does not match. Consider the pattern fragment (a+)* This can match "aaaa" in 33 different ways, and this number increases very rapidly as the string gets longer.
