Fancy captcha jquery - drop event

I am trying to use the drop event of fancy captcha (http://www.webdesignbeach.com/beachbar/ajax-fancy-captcha-jquery-plugin) but it never fires. This is the code (without any change from the website: $("#ajax-fc-circle").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { $(".ajax-fc-" + rand).draggable("disable"); $("#" + options.formId).append(" "); }, tolerance: 'touch' }); }; The drop event is never fired. Has anyone had any experience with fancy captcha?
