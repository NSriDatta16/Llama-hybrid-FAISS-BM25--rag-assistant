Pre-trained RNN for removing seasonality like VGG16

In image classification there are Pre-trained networks like VGG16. Are there any such networks for time series operations like removing seasonality? Edit: I found the following paper TimeNet: Pre-trained deep recurrent neural network for time series classification , but is the implementation published? I'm planning to send the authors an email.
