If I understand correctly, you are looking more at organazing/managing photos than files in general and Coppermine is pretty much just does that. Coppermine gallery functionality. "Coppermine stores files inside of albums, so you'll need at least one album for your pictures/files to be placed in. Albums can be stored in categories (but they don't HAVE to be in a category, they can just as well go into the coppermine "root"). When you click on "albums" in the admin menu, you will see the Album Manager."
