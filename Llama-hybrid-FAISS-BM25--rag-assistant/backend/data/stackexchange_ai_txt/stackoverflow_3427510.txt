No. Your user defined class is garbaged collection when it is not referenced anywhere anymore. You can force this by just doing classObject = null . If that is the last part of the application that is currently referencing classObject then the garbage collection will clear its memory. IDisposable is mostly used so you can organize the garbage collection activities via the using() methods.
