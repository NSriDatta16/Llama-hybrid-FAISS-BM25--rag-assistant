Problems with JQuery's Droppable Tolerance 'fit' feature when using the same size divs

I'm just wondering if anybody else can manage to get the tolerance:'fit' option to work when using the 'droppable' feature in jQuery's UI? I want to call a function only when the draggable div is dropped perfectly onto a droppable div. Both divs are the same size and I'm using snapMode:outer to help the end user. I simply cannot get it to work with 'fit'. Works perfectly with 'intersect'. Would really appreciate some help. Thanks Chris
