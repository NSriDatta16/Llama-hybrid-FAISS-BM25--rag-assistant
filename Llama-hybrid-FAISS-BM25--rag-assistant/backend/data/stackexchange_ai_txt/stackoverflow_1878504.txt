Do .NET projects in Visual Studio always compile into a single file?

This is one of those things that is so simple that no one ever just comes out and says it in any of the tutorials I've read. I've been creating a few stand alone .NET applications as well as a few DLL based plug-ins for other programs. I've noticed that a project in Visual Studio, at least with Windows applications and class libraries, compile into a single file (EXE or DLL). Is this always the case? In terms of organizing a larger application should I always think of projects in Visual Studio as corresponding to a single file in the final program?
