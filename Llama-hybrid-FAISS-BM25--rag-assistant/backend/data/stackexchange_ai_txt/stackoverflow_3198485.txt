A redirect basically instructs the client to fire a new HTTP request to the server. The initial request (and response) will be garbaged, including all of the attributes set. So yes, you really need to pass a parameter along the redirect URL. response.sendRedirect("index.jsp?msg=" + URLEncoder.encode("worked ok!", "UTF-8")); and then in JSP Message: ${param.msg} Alternatively, you can instead also just forward to the resource in question, i.e. request.setAttribute("msg", "worked ok!"); request.getRequestDispatcher("/index.jsp").forward(request, response); and then in JSP (as a shorthand for the ugly and discouraged scriptlet with request.getAttribute("msg") ): Message: ${msg} With a forward, the initial request will still be available in the targeted resource.
