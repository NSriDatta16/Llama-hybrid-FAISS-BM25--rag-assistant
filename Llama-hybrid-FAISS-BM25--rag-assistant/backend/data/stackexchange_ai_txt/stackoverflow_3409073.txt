A lot depends on what you are building and your skill sets. I'm a JavaScriptMVC contributor, so I'm pretty biased, but I will try to give as far of an answer as possible. SproutCore is what I consider more of a 'top-down' framework. They've built a lot of the chrome / UI widgets for you. So, your time is spent customizing the widgets to meet your needs. If your needs can be readily met by sproutcore's widgets, I'd suggest using sproutcore. JavaScriptMVC is a very different type of JavaScript framework. It has no UI widgets. Instead it focuses on the lower-level tools needed to organize and build JavaScript applications. It's basically a layer above jQuery, and packages things like: Compression / building Testing Documentation Error reporting Client side views (templates) Special events 'Missing' DOM functionality (like compare) Dependency management It supports what we call "Middle-Out" development. It's controller is especially powerful at organizing a jQuery-like plugin. It will take care of event binding for you with a pretty awesome syntax while making the plugin extendable. So, if you are building a lot of custom controls, and know jQuery, take JavaScriptMVC for a spin. JavaScriptMVC actually came from Junction, but Junction isn't really under active development.
