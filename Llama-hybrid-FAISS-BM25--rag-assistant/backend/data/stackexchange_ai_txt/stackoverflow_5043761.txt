Intercepting PrintDialog to XPS Document Writer

Currently I am providing the user with two controls: Save and Print. When the user selects Save, a region of the WPF display is packaged up and sent through a XpsDocumentWriter and the user is prompted and encouraged to sign the new xps document. When the user selects Print, a PrintDialog.PrintVisual prints that same region to a user selected printer. All well and good, except that Microsoft XPS Document Writer is one of the choices for printers. Is there a way to prevent or intercept the user selection of XPS document writer and send them to the Save method so I can prompt the user to sign the xps document?
