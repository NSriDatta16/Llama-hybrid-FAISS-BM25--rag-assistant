These should be two posts since the questions are quite separate. I will attempt answering the first one. Specifying the frequency argument allows estimating seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models, for example. If you specify your time series to be seasonal (by setting frequency argument to be greater than 1), the function auto.arima will consider SARIMA models for your data, while if you specify frequency=1 (non-seasonal), only ARIMA models will be considered. SARIMA model is not the same as a regression with ARMA errors where the regressors are seasonal variables (dummies or Fourier terms); you get the latter if you use arima with the seasonal variables supplied as xreg . Also, frequency is used for setting the scale of the horizontal axis in the plots. For example, if your frequency is 4 (for quarterly data), you will get the horizontal axis in years and there will be four data point in one year; this is quite convenient. Also, it should be possible to combine SARIMA with exogenous regressors by having frequency greater than 1 and some regressors passed with xreg ; if I understand correctly, that would result in a regression with SARIMA errors.
