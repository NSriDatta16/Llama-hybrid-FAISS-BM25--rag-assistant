Turning off draggable

I'm currently trying to create a desktop like homepage where using can move around panels. I've initialized these panels as draggable items in jQuery but I want them to only be draggable when in "edit mode" which is a flag I keep track of. Since I can't seem to figure out how to turn off draggrable items ( disable isn't what I'm looking for, disable seems to disable the whole element) I just add and remove a class named ".on" which is used as the handle. Thing is, when I remove ".on" the whole element becomes the handle which kind of defeats the purpose of not being in edit mode :) The oddest thing is that this method worked perfectly when I used sortable items instead of draggable. And here's my javascript var edit_mode = false; $(document).ready(function() { $('.widget_panel').draggable( { handle: '.handle.on', stack: { group: '.widget_panel', min: 10 }, scroll: false }).disableSelection(); $('#test').click(function() { edit_mode = !edit_mode; if(edit_mode) { $('.handle').addClass('on'); } else { $('.handle').removeClass('on'); } }); }); and my HTML Widget Title So any tips on how I could achieve this? Any help is appreciated :)
