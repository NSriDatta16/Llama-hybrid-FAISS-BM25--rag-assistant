No there are no limitations. Feel free to use the VS2010 Express version for ASP.NET MVC development. The only thing is that you cannot use the MS Test framework for unit tests and you have to go for something like NUnit which is not necessary a bad thing :-) It's just that you would probably get a little less integration into the IDE with things like Unit Tests, Code Coverage, ... you will have to use third party tools. There's just one thing to consider and which is of utmost importance before starting a big project: is the time your developers spend on configuring third party tools cheaper than the paid versions of VS2010? In other words how much is your developers time worth? See point 9 of Joel's test .
