I think that feature has been ignored by most VB6 developers. Certainly I experimented with it once and never used it again. If you Google DataBindingBehavior or DataSourceBehavior there are relatively few hits. I think what John is trying to communicate in his answer is that VB6 is not a good choice for new development unless you have strong reasons to the contrary - for example if your organisation already has a lot of VB6 experience and a lot of VB6 code to maintain, and no experience of other desktop programming languages. That sounds unlikely in your case, otherwise you'd be asking your colleagues the question rather than posting on Stack Overflow!
