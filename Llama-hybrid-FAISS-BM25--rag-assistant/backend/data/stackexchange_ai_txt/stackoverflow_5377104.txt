How to extract a folder from JAR

I need to copy a folder, packed in a Jar on runtime. I want to do it by calling a function in a class which is also contained in the same folder. I've tried using getSystemResource : URL sourceDirUrl = ClassLoader.getSystemResource("sourceDirName"); File sourceDir = new File(sourceDirUrl.toURI()); but it doesn't work. I probably have to use getResourceAsStream function recursively. Is there a more elegant/strait-forward way to do this? In case I have to do it recursively: 1. I don't want to specify the files hard-coded, I want to do it dynamically 2. I don't want to create a separate archive. I want this resource to be in the same Jar as the classes dealing with it Thanks I ended up doing what Kozio≈Çek suggested below. Although I was hoping for a more elegant solution, but it looks like this is as good as it gets.
