The permutation importance test is to shuffle the feature values. It's not to shuffle the labels. The labels stay fixed all the time. It's to see how much score changed by shuffling the feature values. If the feature is irrelevant, the shuffling will not affect much on the score. But if the feature is important for the model, the shuffling of the feature values will have a big impact on the score. The score doesn't need to be the accuracy. Accuracy is the score with its own weak point. The function in sklearn, permutation_test_score is model agnostic. It doesn't depend on any model and it can be used with a deep learning model also. Actually, the test is model agnostic. You may check this example in sklearn documentation.
