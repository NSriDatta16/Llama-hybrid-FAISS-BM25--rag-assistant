If you make an assumption that $y$ follows a bounded distribution, it should be possible to devise an appropriate Gaussian Process that respects that assumption. If, for example, $y$ is Beta-distributed, see: Jensen, Bj√∏rn Sand, Jens Brehm Nielsen, and Jan Larsen. "Bounded gaussian process regression." 2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP). IEEE, 2013.
