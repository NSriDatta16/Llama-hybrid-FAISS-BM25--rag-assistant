Is there a distance metric between ordered vectors?

I am looking for a distance metric between vectors whose elements are ordered, i.e so the vectors: [1,5,0,0,0,0,1], [1,0,4,0,0,1,0] will be considered closer than [1,5,0,0,0,0,1], [1,0,0,1,5,0,0] for example if you perform pacf on a time series you get the importance of the lags on the time series, where the first elements represent 1 lag, the second element 2 lags etc. Naturally if for one time series lag 10 is important and for another it is 11, they are closer than 10 and 15 are... Is there a metric like that? are vectors like that still called vectors or do they have another name? edit: a simpler example: [1,0,0,0,0] should be closer to [0,1,0,0,0] than to [0,0,0,0,1] the index of the elements should be taken into account...
