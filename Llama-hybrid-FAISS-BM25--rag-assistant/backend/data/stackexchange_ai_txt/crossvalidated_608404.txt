We can use profile likelihood methods to construct a confidence interval for the maximum probability $\theta = \max_{j=1}^k p_k$ . Here $p_1, p_2, \dotsc, p_k$ represent the discrete distribution of dice rolls, where in your example $p_5$ is somewhat larger than the others. The results of $n$ dice rolls is given by the random variable $X=(X_1, \dotsc, X_k)$ where in the dice example $k=6$ . The likelihood function is then $$ L(p) = p_1^{X_1} p_2^{X_2} \dotsm p_k^{X_k} $$ and the loglikelihood is $$ \ell(p) =\sum_1^k x_j \log(p_j) $$ The profile likelihood function for $\theta$ as defined above is $$ \ell_P(\theta) = \max_{p \colon \max p_j = \theta} \ell(p) $$ With some simulated data we get the following profile log-likelihood function where the horizontal lines can be used to read off confidence intervals with confidence levels 0.95, 0.99 respectively. I will add the R code use at the end of the post. A paper using bootstrapping for estimating $\theta$ is Simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions But this is only a partial solution, in a comment you say @Dave No, I want to find the most probable outcome of the die. I read that as finding the maximum probability (done above), but also which of the sides of the dice correspond to the max probability. The Bayesian approach in the answer by user Henry is a direct answer to that. It is not so clear how to approach that in a frequentist way, maybe bootstrapping could be tried? One old approach is subset selection , choosing a subset of the sides of the coin which contains the side with max probability with a certain confidence level. Papers discussing such methods is A subset selection procedure for multinomial distributions and SELECTING A SUBSET CONTAINING ALL THE MULTINOMIAL CELLS BETTER THAN A STANDARD WITH INVERSE SAMPLING .
