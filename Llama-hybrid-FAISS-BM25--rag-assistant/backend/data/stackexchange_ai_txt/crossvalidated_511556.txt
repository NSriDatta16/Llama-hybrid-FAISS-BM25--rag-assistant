Normal Approximation Homework question

Use normal approximation to estimate the probability of passing a true/false test of 50 questions if the minimum passing grade is 70% and all responses are random guesses. I got that the average is equal to (50)(0.5) = 25 and the standard deviation is sqrt(npq) = sqrt(50 * 0.5 * 0.5) So P(X > 70) = 1 - P(z However, the answer that I got which is 0.02 is incorrect and Im not sure why.
