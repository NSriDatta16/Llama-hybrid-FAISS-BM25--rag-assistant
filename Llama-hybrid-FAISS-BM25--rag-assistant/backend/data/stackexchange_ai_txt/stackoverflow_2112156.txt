Another way to look at the problem would be to be able to disregard differences in the version of Ruby you're running. My backports gem brings Ruby 1.8.6 up to date in the 1.8.x line (including the upcoming 1.8.8) and much of 1.9: require "backports" Or instead, for the less courageous among us, you can require only 1.8.7's features: require "backports/1.8.7"
