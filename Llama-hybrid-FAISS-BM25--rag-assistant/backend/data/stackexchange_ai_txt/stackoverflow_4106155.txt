There are a bunch of details missing about what you are trying to accomplish, what the data looks like, so it's hard to make a specific recommendation. You may be able to create a database per user and copy items into each users database (for the DM use case you described). Each user would only be able to access their own database, and then you could have an admin user that could access all databases. If you need to later update those records copying them to multiple databases might not be a good idea, and then you might consider whether you want to control permissions at a different level from storage. For views that aggregate data from several databases, I recommend looking at lounge and bigcouch, which take different approaches. http://tilgovi.github.com/couchdb-lounge/ http://support.cloudant.com/faqs/views/chained-mapreduce-views
