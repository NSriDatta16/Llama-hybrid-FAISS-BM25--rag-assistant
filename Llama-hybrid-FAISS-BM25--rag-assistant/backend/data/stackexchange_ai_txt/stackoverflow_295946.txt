An updated link for Ganymede (Eclipse 3.4): http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cprbview.htm But I agree with the fundamental problem: the Problems view needs filtering by Resource, not just Description. In my case, I include generated jsp code in my source path, and there are all kinds of warning that occur in the *_jsp.java files (like unused application, page, out, config, page_context variables). So it would be nice to exclude them by the Resource pattern. (Or for jspc to not write unused code...but that's a different issue altogether).
