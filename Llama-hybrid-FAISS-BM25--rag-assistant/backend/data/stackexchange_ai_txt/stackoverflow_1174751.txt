The databases you mention are, at best, versioned record stores designed to store very large volumes of data across multiple servers. To call them a 'database' would be a stretch. The do not support joins, nor ACID transactions, rollbacks, etc. You can write applications without them but will often have to do more work to provide the functionality. For: contacts -- -- organizations You could deNormailize and store organizations in contacts and contacts in orgainizations. But you will have to enforce referential integrity in the application deal with simultaneous updated to both tables. A better solution would be to store the data in three tables and do the 'joins' yourself.
