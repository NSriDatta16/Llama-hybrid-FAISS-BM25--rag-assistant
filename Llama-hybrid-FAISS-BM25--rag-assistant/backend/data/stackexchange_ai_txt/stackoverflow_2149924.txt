The option helper: 'clone' will leave your original item in place, while creating a new DOM element that is actually dragged around by the mouse. (Additionally, you use the option opacity: 0.7 to create the "semi-transparent" effect on the helper.) I'm not sure if you'll need this, but if using a clone doesn't remove the item automatically from the list, you can then use the remove event to delete the item that was dragged out from the DOM entirely.
