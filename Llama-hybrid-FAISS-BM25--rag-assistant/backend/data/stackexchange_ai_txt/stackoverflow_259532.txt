IDataReader empties when viewing for a second time

I'm getting something pretty strange going on when trying to read some data using the MySql .net connector. Here's the code: IDataReader reader = null; using (MySqlConnection connection = new MySqlConnection(this.ConnectionString)) { String getSearch = "select * from organization"; MySqlCommand cmd = new MySqlCommand(getSearch, connection); cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text; connection.Open(); reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(); while (reader.Read()) { // response write some stuff to the screen (snipped for brevity) } } If I put a breakpoint after the ExecuteReader and expand the results view in Visual Studio (hovering over reader and expanding), I can see the rows returned by the query. If I then let that close and expand the results view again, I get the message 'Enumeration yielded no results'. It seems as if the contents of the reader are getting reset as soon as they're viewed. As for what we've tried: - the SQL runs fine directly on to DB - Binding the results of the query directly to a datagrid just returns an empty datagrid - got the latest version of the .net connector - tried on two different machines to rule out any local errors So far nothing's worked. If anyone could offer any ideas or suggestions they would be very much appreciated.
