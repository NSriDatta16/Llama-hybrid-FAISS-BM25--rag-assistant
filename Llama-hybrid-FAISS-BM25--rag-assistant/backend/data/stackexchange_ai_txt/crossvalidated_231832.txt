Ensure of features relevance / Ensure of feasablility of a prediction

I have a set of features and a target(labeled data). I want to classify this labeled data into several classes. I've used many algorithms in a benchmarking approach but none of them seems to give a good result. Knowing that I have used PCA/Factor to perform a features selection and as algorithms I used SVM , C5 , CHAID , Bayesian Net. and Xgboost . My question is: How can I be sure that the features I'm using can predict the target ? When can we stop and say: "it's not possible to separate the classes using these parameters/features ?
