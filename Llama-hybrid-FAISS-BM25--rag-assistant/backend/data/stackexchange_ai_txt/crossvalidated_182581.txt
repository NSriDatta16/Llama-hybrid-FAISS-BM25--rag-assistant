3 test groups, each group with different N of rats, Each rat with different n of D measurements...unsure which test to use to compare

Lets say I am trying to figure out a treatment that increases the thickness of a hair follicle. I have 3 groups: 7 Rats successfully treated with A, 3 Rats successfully treated with B and 5 healthy Rats as controls. I then measure hair follicles diameters (D) on each rat...the number of measurements may differ with each rat (some I've measure 100 hairs, others 500+ are measured) and I now want to figure out if the treatment had significant impact on the hair follicle diameter....what test do I use and how is best to group the data for analysis? ...The reason I ask is because I feel if I just take the aggregate number of the hairs from group A and compare it (via anova or welch?) to the aggregate number of hairs from group B and the controls then I lose the variability BETWEEN measurements obtained from different rats of the same group? Don't I? Or is it that it doesn't matter? But then if I take the average for each Rat in a group and so then I have N measurements per group (either 3, 7 or 5 for A, B and control respectively) then I lose the variability in measurements WITHIN one Rat. I'm sure the answer is obvious and I'm just a stats noob but clarification would be greatly appreciated.
