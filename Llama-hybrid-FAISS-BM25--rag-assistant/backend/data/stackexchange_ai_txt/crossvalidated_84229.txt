What is the difference between Inference and Machine Learning?

I have seen some classes in my University labeled as an "Inference class" and others as "Machine learning" classes, but I was not sure if appreciated the core difference between these two labelings? I normally think of machine learning as the study of systems/algorithms that are able tp extract information from data. It uses techiniques from a broad list subjects, like statistics, computer science, optimization, etc. However, I was not sure how statistical inference differed from Machine Learning. Thanks for the help in advance! :)
