Code coverage doesn't have a high correlation to application stability. Rate of influx of bug reports (and the bug's severity) does have a high correlation to application stability. When I talk about code coverage, I include absolutely everything and just assume 100% is unrealistic. There are probably many different opinions on the subject, so it seems pretty subjective to me. If I was in your position, I would be more worried about getting manual and automated regression test bases built before worrying about code coverage.
