Run python script using spark-submit on windows 7

I'm trying to submit a python script using spark-submit on windows 7. I'm using spark 2.3.0 built for hadoop 2.7 . The python script is supposed to read data from a csv file and plot graphs. is it possible to run such a script using spark-submit? In the python script I included this block of code for spark context. import findspark findspark.init() import pyspark from pyspark import SparkContext APP_NAME = 'kineticPCA' conf = SparkConf().setAppName(APP_NAME) conf = conf.setMaster('spark://192.168.xx.xxx:7077') sc = SparkContext(conf=conf) This is the how submit the job on command prompt, on the spark bin directory spark-submit G:/guru orders/pca kinetics/files/kineticPCA.py This is the error I get: Error: Cannot load main class from JAR G:/guru with URI G. Please s through --class. Run with --help for usage help or --verbose for debug output What could be the cause of this error?
