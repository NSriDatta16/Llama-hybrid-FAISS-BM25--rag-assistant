I tried the code you have posted. It works just fine. I think, either the domain name Python.org is not resolvable (possible if you are behind a firewall or are using a proxy server) or a firewall is blocking the connection or just that the request is going to the wrong computer. To verify that "python.org" is resolvable: open cmd prompt & type "ping 82.94.164.162". If it responds back, it is reachable. Then try ping -a 82.94.164.162. If it resolves to python.org than name is resolvable. Also check if Windows Firewall or third party firewall is blocking the communication. Also you can try connecting via IP. i.e. //TcpClient client = new TcpClient("python.org", 80); TcpClient client = new TcpClient("82.94.164.162", 80); EDIT: As per tommieb75's suggestion, using System; using System.IO; using System.Net.Sockets; namespace ConsoleApp01 { class Program { public static void Main(string[] args) { try { //TcpClient client = new TcpClient("python.org", 80); TcpClient client = new TcpClient("82.94.164.162", 80); NetworkStream ns = client.GetStream(); StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(ns); sw.Write("HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\n" + "User-Agent: Test\r\n" + "Host: www.python.org\r\n" + "Connection: Close\r\n"); sw.Flush(); } catch (SocketException ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex); } Console.ReadKey(true); } } }
