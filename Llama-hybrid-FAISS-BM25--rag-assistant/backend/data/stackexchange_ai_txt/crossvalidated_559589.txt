I would apply PCA to three series, then assess how much variance is explained by the first principal component. If it is very high, then use the PC1 as your signal. The PCA transforms your three signals into three orthogonal linear combinations of signals in decreasing order of variance. So, your first principal component can be seen as an average level of three signals. If PCA works very well, then PC1 will explain the most variance in the data You may need to mess with phase differences, depending on how the measurements were done. For instance, if it's three microphones picking up the source, then sound waves reach with a lag. This can easily be taken care of with coherence/phase shift analysis. Once you identify the phase shifts, it's still the same PCA but with appropriate lags
