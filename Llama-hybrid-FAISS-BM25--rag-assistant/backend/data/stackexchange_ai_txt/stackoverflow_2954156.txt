Simply drag the Contacts table and the BillingAddresses table into your DBML designer, so it imports the Contacts and BillingAddress objects properly, including the relations (I assume you actually already did this, but I mentioned it non the less). Next change the stored procedure/function in DBML to declare that it returns a Contacts type, see How to: Change the Return Type of a DataContext Method (O/R Designer) . Now the return of the procedure will be a 'live' Contacts object.
