This is a fairly common problem in time series analysis (multiple deterministic seasonalities) where observations are possibly/probably affected by deterministic factors such as hour-of-the-day , day-of-the-week, day-of-the-month , week-of-the-month, holiday-effects , particular months-of-the-year , level shifts , local time trends and memory affects (arima) in addition to user-specified predictor series like temperature or price. https://autobox.com/pdfs/SARMAX.pdf is the goal where the X's and the I's which are latent in the data can be identified and used to characterize the data for either forecasting or early-warning detection. Models like this are quite understandable and are quite flexible I have seen successful applications involving TACO-BELL 15-minute forecasts and call center-forecasts for HP https://demand-planning.com/2010/03/18/can-forecasting-help-me-staff-a-specific-hewlett-packard-call-center-at-1030-am-on-a-friday/ and a number of power consumption studies. Following are a couple of my posts on this subject. Forecasting data with multiple seasonality and Hidden markov model to detect Stock outs in Hourly sales Time series data and What model to fit given ACF and PACF (seasonal data) I would stay very clear of suggestions about fitting arima models with frequencies of 24x7=168 etc. as they miss the target by attempting to use memory as compared to identifying logical causal variables that can be found in the data. Finally the concern should be about the distribution of residuals from a model NOT the distribution of the original data as the distribution of errors is where the assumptions are placed. With just a few months of data it will be impossible to pick up a number of the possible predictors that I mentioned BUT maybe this response will motivate you to find more data . With just a few months of data , the best you might hope for are daily effects , hourly effects , possible anomalies and possibly level shifts. Perhaps your question should be "Incorporating" rather than "Removing" with both ending up in the same analytical place.
