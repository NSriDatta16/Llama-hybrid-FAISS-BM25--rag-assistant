Assuming you are going to average the first 12 months to form a baseline measure and the second 12 months to form as a follow-up measure, your problem reduces to a repeated measures t-test. G*Power You might want to check out the following menu in G*Power 3: Tests - Means - Two Dependent Groups (matched pairs) . Use A priori, $\alpha=.05$, Power = 0.90. Use the Determine button to determine effect size. This requires that you can estimate time 1 and 2 means, sds, and correlation between time points. If you know nothing about the domain, based on my experience in psychology, I'd start with something like M1 = 0, SD1 = 1, SD2 = 1 correlation = .60 This means that M2 is basically a between subjects cohen's d. You could then examine a few different values of M2 such as 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.5, ... 0.8, etc. Cohen's rules of thumb suggest 0.2 is small, 0.5 is medium, and 0.8 is large. R UCLA has a tutorial on doing a power analysis on a repeated measures t-test using R. Side point As a side point, you might want to consider having a control group.
