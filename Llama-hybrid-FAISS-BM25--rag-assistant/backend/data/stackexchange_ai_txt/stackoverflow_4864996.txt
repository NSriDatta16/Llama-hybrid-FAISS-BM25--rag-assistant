Which MySQL database tables contain the data for the stores in Magento 1.x?

I would like to retrieve the following data via MySQL for each store, so that I can build a data structure in my PHP code: READ in from MySQL: 3. all active stores: 3.1 store package (enterprise) 3.2 magento default theme (default) 3.3 store default theme 3.4 store layout 3.5 store templates I tried to do a diff before changing admin data for a store, but the memory limit was reached when comparing the 2 MySQL dump files before and after the change.
