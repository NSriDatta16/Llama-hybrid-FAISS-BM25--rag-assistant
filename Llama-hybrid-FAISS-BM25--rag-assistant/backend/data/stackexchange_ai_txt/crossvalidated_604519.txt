How to explain null hypothesis testing using Bayesian terms?

Imagine someone who knows Bayesian statistics but has never heard of null hypothesis significance testing. How would one best explain NHST by using Bayesian analogies? Searching through the archives I found a nice answer to a related question, which led me to the idea to describe NHST as something like a posterior predictive check, but with a "null hypothesis" pseudo-posterior that is a Dirac $\delta$ density about $H_0$ . Does that make sense, or does anyone have a better comparison?
