Applet failng on machines other than development machine

I'm developing a Java applet, and recently I tried to demonstrate the applet on a machine that did not belong to me. However I was unable to get the applet to run on that machine, as it kept failing with security exceptions. The applet can be found at http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~madiav/launch.html . Sadly I do not have access to this other machine to collect a stack trace or the output from the Java console. However I have noticed that the Java console on my computer spits out a lot of messages relating to classes not being found, however the appet still ran as expected so I ignored them. The entire output from the Java console can be found here http://pastebin.com/DjFAJgVW An example line of the class not found type is basic: JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: RhythmWheels.Open: try again .. Does anyone know how I can get rid of these and/or whether this is what is causing execution to fail on other machines?
