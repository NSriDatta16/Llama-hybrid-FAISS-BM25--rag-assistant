The state of Linux async IO?

I ask here since googling leads you on a merry trip around archives with no hint as to what the current state is. If you go by Google, it seems that async IO was all the rage in 2001 to 2003, and by 2006 some stuff like epoll and libaio was turning up; kevent appeared but seems to have disappeared, and as far as I can tell, there is still no good way to mix completion-based and ready-based signaling, async sendfile - is that even possible? - and everything else in a single-threaded event loop. So please tell me I'm wrong and it's all rosy! - and, importantly, what APIs to use. How does Linux compare to FreeBSD and other operating systems in this regard?
