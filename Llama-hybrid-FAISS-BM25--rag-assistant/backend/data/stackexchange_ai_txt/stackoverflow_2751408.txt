Procmail vs. Maildrop - which to use?

I need to do mail processing where I manipulate the contents of the mail or invoke a script on the receipt of email, supporting a number of email addresses as the access points. In reading through the MDA agents, procmail appears to be the standard standby, but maildrop has some following too. Wikipedia comments that anyone starting something new should consider maildrop because procmail hasn't been advanced in quite a while. Are there any solid reasons from features or capabilities that would indicate using one of these over the other?
