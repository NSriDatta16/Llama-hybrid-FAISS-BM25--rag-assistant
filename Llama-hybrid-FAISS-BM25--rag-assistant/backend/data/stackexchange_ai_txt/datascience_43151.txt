I highly suggest you to read this great book: hands on machine learning with Scikit and Tensorflow. Neural networks are presented succinctly in chapters 9 and 10. There are a lot of examples for you to practice. To effectively understand the script of examples you should have background of Python programming. Have a nice day!
