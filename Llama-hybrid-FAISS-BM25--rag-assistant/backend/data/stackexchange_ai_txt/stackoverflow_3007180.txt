jQuery background-position animation

I've created an image which is basically a CSS sprite of 3 images together. It's size is 278x123 so they are basically 3 images of 278x41. What I am trying to do is to make an animation of that by changing the background position. I've tried many things, one of my not very working solution is the following: var $slogan = $('#header h2 span'); $slogan.css({backgroundPosition: '0px 0px'}); function slogan_animation() { if ($slogan.css('background-position') == '0px 0px') { $slogan.fadeIn('slow').css('background-position', '0px -41px').fadeOut('slow'); } else if ($slogan.css('background-position') == '0px -41px') { $slogan.fadeIn('slow').css('background-position', '0px -82px').fadeOut('slow'); } else if ($slogan.css('background-position') == '0px -82px') { $slogan.fadeIn('slow').css('background-position', '0px 0px').fadeOut('slow'); } } setInterval(slogan_animation, 2000); Any ideas how could I do that? Basically I just need to: - set my background position to "0px 0px", then move it to "0px -41px", then "0px -82px" and then loop it again from "0px 0px". It would be also great to have fadeIn() effect between those. Any ideas? Thank you.
