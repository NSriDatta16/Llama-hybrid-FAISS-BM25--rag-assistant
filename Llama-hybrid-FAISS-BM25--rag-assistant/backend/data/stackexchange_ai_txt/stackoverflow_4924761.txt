Apache-ssl vs mod_ssl

I just purchased an SSL certificate and am considering options for its implementation on my Amazon Elastic Load Balancer, which will leverage Apache2. From what I understand I have two options for implementing an SSL certificate in Apache 2 --- either apache-ssl or mod_ssl. The purpose of this question is to collect benefits/drawbacks associated with going with one or the other.
