The point is that the Cox "model" is written simply as: $$ \log \lambda(t|X=x) = \log \lambda_0(t) + x^T\beta $$ where $\lambda_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function. It's like an intercept term in a linear model, except that it's an ancillary parameter. The Cox model only estimates the $\beta$ s but ignores the effect of time past the point that you can rank the failures and organize subjects in the analysis into a risk set. Presented with a particular dataset, I can come up with an estimate of that baseline hazard function, but technically this is the Cox model "plus something else". And you're right, once you have that baseline hazard function (or a suitable estimate thereof) you can begin to simulate failure times using the methods you describe. Having a general expression of the survivor function is equivalent to having a general expression of the CDF because $S(t) = 1-F(t)$ . Conversely, if you don't know the baseline hazard function, you have no idea what the survival curve looks like, and you consequently don't know the CDF nor how to simulate from it using PIT.
