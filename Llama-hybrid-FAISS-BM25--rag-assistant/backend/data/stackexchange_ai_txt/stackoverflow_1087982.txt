Single objects still limited to 2 GB in size in CLR 4.0?

As I understand it there's a 2 GB limit on single instances in .NET. I haven't paid a lot of attention to that since I have mainly worked on 32 bit OS so far. On 32 but it is more or less an artificial limitation anyway. However, I was quite surprised to learn that this limitation also applies on 64 bit .NET . Since collections such as List use an array to store items, that means that a .NET application running on 32 bit will be able to hold twice as many reference type items in a list compared to the same application running on 64 bit. That is quite surprising imo. Does anyone know if this limitation is addressed in CLR 4.0 (I don't have a 4.0 installation at hand at the moment).
