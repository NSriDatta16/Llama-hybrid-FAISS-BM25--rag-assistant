For skewed and heavy tailed data I use (and developed) the Lambert W x F distribution framework. Skewed and heavy-tailed Lambert W x F distributions are based on a non-linear transform of an input random variable (RV) $X \sim F$ to output $Y ~ Lambert W \times F$, which is similar to X but skewed and/or heavy tailed (see papers for detailed formulas). This works in general for any continuous RV, but in practice we are mostly interested in Gaussian $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. For heavy-tailed Lambert W x F distributions the inverse is bijective and can be estimated from the data using your favorite estimator for the parameter $\theta = (\mu_x, \sigma_x, \delta, \alpha)$ (MLE, methods of moments, Bayesian analysis, ...). For $\alpha \equiv 1$ and X being Gaussian it reduces to Tukey's h distribution. Now as a data transformation this becomes interesting as the transformation is bijective (almost bijective for skewed case) and can be obtained explicitly using Lambert's W function (hence the name Lambert W x F). This means we can remove skewness from data and also remove heavy tails (bijectively!). You can try it out using the LambertW R package, with the manual showing many examples of how to use it. For applications see these posts What's the distribution of these data? : this has a full illustration of how to transform data to normality in R using the LambertW package. Looking for a distribution where: Mean=0, variance is variable, Skew=0 and kurtosis is variable -
