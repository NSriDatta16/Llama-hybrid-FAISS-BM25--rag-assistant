How to interpret specific plot of logistic regression (LASSO)?

So I am fitting a logistic regression model to a training data set in R, more specifically a LASSO regression with an L1 penalty. The code for the model looks like this: t1 When I plot(glmnet_classifier) this is what I receive: Now my question: How do I interpret this plot? It shows AUC values across the range of different lambda. On top, I guess these are the dummy variables? So in my case, 24911 dummy variables were retained in the model? Is there a proper name for such a graph? Any help on naming the plot would be greatly appreciated! I know this is not a specific coding question, but it is coding related and I am in big need of a bright mind who could help with my question. Thank you
