How should the margin of error be calculated for the average of 5 star ratings?

I'm calculating the average rating from a selection of people where they rate something out of 5 stars. The mean is $4.73$ with a standard deviation of $0.55$. The breakdown is roughly: 5* | 4* | 3* | 2* | 1* 76% | 20% | 3% | 0% | 1% Am I correct in saying that the margin of error for the mean is $0.55$? Can the margin of error be communicated as $4.73 \pm 0.55$? Is calculating the margin of error relevant for an average of 5 star ratings? (Surely $\pm 0.55$ on a mean value of $4.73$ could mean that the error bounds take it beyond 5 out-of-five 5, for instance.) If I'm wrong, how would you calculate the margin of error for this type of data? What is the value of calculating the margin of error for this type of data?
