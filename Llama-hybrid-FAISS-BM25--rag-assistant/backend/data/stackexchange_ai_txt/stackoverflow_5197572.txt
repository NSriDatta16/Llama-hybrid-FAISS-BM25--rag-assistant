What is the <@ operator in PostgreSQL 8.4?

I am having trouble decyphering what this operator is doing. I know that it is somehow comparing the array's, but I can find no documentation on it. I also have tried >@ but that seems to error. Google yealded bad results ad when I search for "at operator" it isn't very specific. Any information would be much appreciated. I also have not (at least I don't think so) defined any new operators in the database. SELECT id FROM organizations WHERE ARRAY[56]
