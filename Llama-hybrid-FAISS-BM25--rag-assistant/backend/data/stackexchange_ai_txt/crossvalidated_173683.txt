Sorting products by reviews considering the number of reviews

I have a big amount of products and a lot of reviews for these products, including a rating of the product. My problem is that every product does not have the same amount of reviews. For example, one product can have 125 reviews with an average 4.2/5 ratings, whereas another one may have 1 review of 5/5. Is there any model or algorithm that can sort my products by best products, but considering the amount of reviews ? It is maybe a simple question, but I've never seen it posted this way. I suppose it is a common problem but I did not find a right title to search for solutions. Example (asked by RayVelcoro) Let's say I have 2 movies : A - rated 4.3/5 - 152 reviews B - rated 5/5 - 2 reviews Since B have been rated only two times, I cannot be sure that B is better than A : Maybe, when B will have more than 50 reviews, it will be rated only 3.8/5 How can I take that in account in a search that sorts results by best movie ?
