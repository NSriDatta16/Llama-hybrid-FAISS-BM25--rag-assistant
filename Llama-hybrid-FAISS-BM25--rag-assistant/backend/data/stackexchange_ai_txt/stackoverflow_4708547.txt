Are there more accurate terms for "class methods" in Ruby?

Is there really such a thing as a "class method" in Ruby (which is sometimes regarded as the equivalent of a static method in other languages), or is it merely something that just happens to be a singleton method of an object of class Class ? If the latter, are there any more accurate terms for such methods that would still be understandable by the average Ruby developer?
