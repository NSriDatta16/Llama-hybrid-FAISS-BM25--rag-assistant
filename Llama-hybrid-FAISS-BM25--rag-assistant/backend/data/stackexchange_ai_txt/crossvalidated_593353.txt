As said in the answer by Jacques, the distance between the vectors will depend on whether counts or proportions are used. I have not some across any reference that explicitly states which approach is the best or, more correctly, which is the most appropriate. A couple of observations may be able to guide you. Firstly, the distance for counts is strongly conditional (biased) on the total count of observations. It is possible to get a situation where the minimum values could be all represented in vector $\mathbf{A}$ with all the maximum values contained in vector $\mathbf{B}$ . For example, let $\mathbf{A}=(5,7,3,6,10)$ and $\mathbf{B}=(7,12,9,12,14)$ . [In a (multi)set theoretic sense, $A \subset B$ ]. The Soergel Distance for the count data between $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is 0.426 When converting to proportions, the Soergel Distance comes out to be 0.179. Given this distance has the bounds of $[0,1]$ , this is clearly a 'notable' difference. Also, from a set theoretic view, the proportional approach $A \not\subset B$ . Furthermore it seems counterintuitive that while the count data is a subset, it is 'further apart' than the proportions which have overlapping sets. In my view, I would choose the proportions approach as it is less influenced by the differences in the total counts of each vector. And proportions, being a proxy for probabilities, offer better comparability. The count approach is more applicable when the total counts of each vector are 'roughly similar'. However, as to what is accounts for 'roughly similar', that's were subjectivity and a good dose of pragmatism comes in, not to mention professional/academic judgement.
