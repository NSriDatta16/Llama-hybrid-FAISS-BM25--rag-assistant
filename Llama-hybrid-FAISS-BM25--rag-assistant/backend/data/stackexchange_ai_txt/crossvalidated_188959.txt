pre-whitening ARIMA order of integration

I am currently modelling a time series using an ARIMA model with transfer functions for the regressors. In order to get a stationary dependent variable I need to take seasonal differences (at lag 52). For my regressor on the other hand, I would need to take differences at lag 1. My question is now: Is is statistically valid that the order of integration differ between the two models?
