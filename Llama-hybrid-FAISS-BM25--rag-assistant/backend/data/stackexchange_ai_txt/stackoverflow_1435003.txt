Seems to depend on what browsers were capable of when you started designing. If you began back when only tables worked then that is what you will probably always want to use, because you know it. Or if that is what you liked to use even after browsers had advanced to be able to render CSS... I just don't like to keep doing the same things over and over because they are easy and I know how to do them.That is boring. I would much rather learn new techniques than dismiss something because I don't know how to use it or I think I don't have time to learn. I don't like to use tables, I don't understand them, they seem alien and offensive but that is because I began in 2005. I also don't use design programs to spit out templates because I prefer hand coding.
