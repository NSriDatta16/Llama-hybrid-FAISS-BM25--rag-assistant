I wouldn't have thought that using a web service would be a very fast solution either. The main benefit I would see in using a web service is that you wouldn't have to expose the SQL server directly to external networks. This would potentially make the web service option more secure. I think you need to ask yourself a couple of questions such as: Is the speed of data access actually a concern? Is the slowest part of the data retrieval operation the transfer of data between the SQL Server and the web server or is it actually the SQL query or the processing of the results by the webserver that is the slowest step?
