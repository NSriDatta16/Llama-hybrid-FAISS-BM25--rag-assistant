Implementing Gibbs sampler in R from posterior distribution

I am referencing a follow-up idea from something I posted earlier ( Zero-inflated Poisson and Gibbs sampling, proofs and sampling ). I want to implement the Gibbs sampler, by generating a large (dependent) sample from the posterior distribution and use that to construct 95% Bayesian confidence intervals for $p$ and $\lambda$ using the data I generated in the first question on this page ( Zero-inflated Poisson and Gibbs sampling, proofs and sampling ). Basically, I want to know how to do this in R, so that I can play around with different values of $a$ and $b$.
