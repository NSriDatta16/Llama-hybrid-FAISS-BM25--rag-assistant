I don't see how this is completely obvious given the plots. The control group on average necessarily has larger values (you can see the this clearly by where the data points are on the y-axis) but the difference is not extreme (on average a .4 difference). It also appears that the study sites don't vary much here. I will note that because your data has a time-series element to it, that it may be useful to check if there are some serious autocorrelation issues going on here (you'll want to check the normalized residuals in a mixed model). Run an ACF plot and see if the residuals have serious problems. You may need to switch to lme to model that as an ARIMA process. An example can be found here . Finally, I would advise against chasing statistical significance. You can look through some of my posts here to see why this can be problematic.
