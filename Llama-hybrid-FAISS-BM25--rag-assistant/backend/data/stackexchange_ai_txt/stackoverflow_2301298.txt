Greedy will consume as much as possible. From http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html we see the example of trying to match HTML tags with . Suppose you have the following: Hello World You may think that ( . means any non newline character and + means one or more ) would only match the and the , when in reality it will be very greedy, and go from the first to the last > . This means it will match Hello World instead of what you wanted. Making it lazy ( ) will prevent this. By adding the ? after the + , we tell it to repeat as few times as possible , so the first > it comes across, is where we want to stop the matching. I'd encourage you to download RegExr , a great tool that will help you explore Regular Expressions - I use it all the time.
