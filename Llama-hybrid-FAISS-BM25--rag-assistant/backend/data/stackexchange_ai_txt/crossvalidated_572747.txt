As you do not give a dataset, I will try to give you some guidance without having the possibility to test. I think you need to have a look at the lme4 and lmerTest packages for the mixed effect linear regressions. From what I understand, Industry and Region are your cluster variables. Your regression with random intercept would look like lmer(ROE~ESG+Leverage+Age+Size+(1|Industry)+(1|Region), data = Updated_Age_Data) For random slopes of your independent variable: lmer(ROE~ESG+Leverage+Age+Size+(1 + ESG|Industry) + (1 + ESG|Region), data = Updated_Age_Data) You could also want to use GEE from the gee package or geepack package, but these do not allow for 3 levels random models. If you want just 2 level random variable, gee would do the trick too (without estimating the variance of intercepts and slopes)
