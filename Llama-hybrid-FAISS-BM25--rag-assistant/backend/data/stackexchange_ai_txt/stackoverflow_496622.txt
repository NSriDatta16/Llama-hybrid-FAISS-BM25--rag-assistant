Normalize to model the concepts in your design, and their relationship. Think of what relationships can change, and what a change like that will mean in terms of your design. In the schema you posted, there is what looks to me like a glaring error (which may not be an error if you have a special case in terms of how your organization works) -- there is an implicit assumption that every department is in exactly one office, and that all the employees who are in the same department work at that office. What if the department occupies two offices? What if an employee nominally belongs to one department, but works out of a different office (assuming you are referring to physical offices)?
