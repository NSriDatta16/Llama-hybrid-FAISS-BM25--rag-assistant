Let me convert my earlier comment to an answer. Do you imagine rows in your data matrix to be the variables or the samples? I will assume they are samples: i.e. you have $n=32$ different time series (samples). Then, if all $n=32$ rows are identical, but only circularly shifted by $1$ position each, then the $n\times n$ Gram matrix of your data consisting of dot products between all pairs of rows will have Toeplitz structure: high values close to the diagonal and gradually decreasing to zero values away from it. Toeplitz matrices have consecutive Fourier modes as their eigenvectors (and eigenvectors of the Gram matrix are principal components, up to the scaling), so yes to your Q1: it is no surprise that you get sinusoidal waves of increasing frequencies as PCs. No idea if it can be useful (Q2). In my experience, it tends to appear as an annoying artifact. I.e. people have some data, get something resembling Fourier modes out of PCA and start wondering what they could mean, whereas they are simply due to some time shifts in the original time series.
