While I agree with everyone else, that a physical structure matching the logical structure is helpful, I have to say I also fight with Visual Studio's auto-naming. There are half a dozen reasons why I have to rename classes: I use a root "src" folder to visually separate my code from embedded resources I want different capitalization I'll organize my code into subfolders for organization within a namespace I like to separate interfaces from implementations and base classes I feel like it With thiose reasons, I've resigned myself to having to adjust those for every class I create. My strategy to avoid the issue is copying a file that has the namespace declaration I want, and then immediately delete the contents.
