Using 'Core Data' with Phonegap?

Does it make sense to use 'Core Data' for storage in a Phonegap-based hybrid iPhone/iPad app? Our app is mainly going to run inside a UIWebView, but the data-storage component is going to be central to the working of the app. I know Mobile Safari has offline storage capability which can be used via PhoneGap, but we already have an in-house data-storage solution build on top of Core Data that we would like to leverage. Thanks Kapil
