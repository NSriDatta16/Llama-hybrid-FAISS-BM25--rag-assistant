How do measure how different two policies are?

I have two agents that both follow a baseline behavioral policy pi(a|s). If I then modify the state-action distribution for the two agents (resulting in two new policies), is there a standard measure I can use to tell how "far" the policies are from the baseline policy, or each other? More generally, Is there a standard way to measure the difference between two policies that operate on the same state space? Divergence measures (like KL divergence) are useful, but are not actually distance metrics, so I'm wondering whether there's some known method I'm missing.
