As long as you are aware of the impact of doing so then yes, storing this data in memory would be fine (as long as you have enough to do so). Once you know what is appropriate for the current user then tossing it into memory would be fine. You might look at something like MemCached Win32 or Velocity though to offload the storage to another app server. Use this even on your local application for the time being that way when it is time to push this to another server or grow your app you have a clear separation of concerns defined at your caching layer. And keep in mind that the more languages you support the more stuff you are storing in memory. Keep an eye on the amount of data being stored in memory on your lone app server as this could become overwhelming in time. Also, make sure that the keys you are using are specific to the language. Otherwise you might find that you are storing a menu in german for an english user.
