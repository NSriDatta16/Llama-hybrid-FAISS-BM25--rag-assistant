I have written a pretty detailed blog post using TeamCity, and Web Deployment projects to automate build and deployment (local) here: http://www.diaryofaninja.com/blog/2010/05/09/automated-site-deployments-with-teamcity-deployment-projects-amp-svn I have then added to this to show FTP addition http://www.diaryofaninja.com/blog/2010/09/21/continuous-integration-tip-1-ndash-ftp-deployment Basically the process is like this: Using a teamcity build server i download from my SVN repo I build and deploy the site to a local folder on the build server I fire a command line FTP client that supports scripting called WinSCP using the MSBUILD Task EXEC ( http://winscp.net/ ) Upload all my sites content Have insert beverage of choice I then make sure that i only deploy the Trunk of my SVN repo, and develop and test everything in an branch before merging - this way only tested stuff gets deployed. Add Automated testing to your build cycle and you've got a match made in heaven.
