Users definitely care (after all, not only does space cost money, but affects program load time). However, the question becomes how much do you optimize. I suggest the 80/20 rule. 80% of your benefit comes from the first 20% of the effort. If you use a utility like TreePie you might be able to see what parts of a large application are consuming most of your resources. If you find it's just a few large images, or one big DLL with a bunch of embedded resources, it's probably worth taking a look at reducing the size, if it's easy. But there's a cost/benefit tradeoff. I just saw a terrabyte drive for $100 the other day. Saving the user 1 gig is about 10 cents in terms of storage space, and perhaps some hard to quantify amount of time spent loading every time they load. If you have 100,000 users, it probably worth your time to optimize a bit, but if you're writing custom software for one user it's probably not worth it unless they're complaining.
