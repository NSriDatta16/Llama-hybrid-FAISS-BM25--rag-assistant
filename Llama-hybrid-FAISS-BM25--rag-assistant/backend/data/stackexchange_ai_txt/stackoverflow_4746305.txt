I encountered similar confusion with a query against places. The "next" URL behaved exactly as you described it. I could query location information using a url like this: https://graph.facebook.com/search?access_token=INSERT_TOKEN&type=place&center=55.8660,-4.2715&distance=150&limit=10 And got back JSON with the first 10 places plus the following fragment which suggests the existence of paging params: "paging": { "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/search?access_token=INSERT_TOKEN&type=place&center=55.8660\u00252C-4.2715&distance=150&limit=10&offset=10" Hitting that URL doesn't work. But I did figure out a combination of limit and offset params that gave me effective paging. limit=10 & offset not defined => first 10 results limit=20 & offset=10 => next 10 results limit=30 & offset=20 => next 10 results limit=40 & offset=30 => last 8 results (can stop here because less than 10 back) limit=50 & offset=40 => confirmation that there are no more results I realise that I've got "limit" and "offset" rather than the "limit" and "until" params that you get, but, hopefully you could apply the same technique i.e. keep incrementing the limit and inc the date/time to that of your last result?
