Even though your objects are merely stack allocated, the class implementations may allocate memory in the heap. For example, std::string will do this. Allocating and deallocating memory in the heap can lead to fragmentation, which would explain the increased memory usage. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc#Heap-based Edit: Looking closer at your code, there are other problems -- as the others have pointed out.
