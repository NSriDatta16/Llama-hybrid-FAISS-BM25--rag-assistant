Gaussian mixture models with constrained mixing proportions

I am fitting a Gaussian mixture model to multivariate data and my application suggests constraining the mixing proportions to lie in a pre-determined sub-space. I am curious if such an approach has been tried in other application areas and if there is literature that discusses its pros and cons. I could find extensive literature on GMMs with means constrained to a pre-determined subspace but I couldn't find examples of GMMs with constrained mixing proportions. I would be grateful to know if there is a good reason why this isn't a commonly pursued modelling approach (or examples/articles of such an approach), given that the constrained parameter GMMs are common and well understood. A note on the EM procedure that I am currently using to fit the GMM with constrained mixing proportions: Let p = (p 1 , p 2 ...p K ) be the mixing proportions for the K clusters and $\frac{exp(P^T\mathbf{B_{i}})}{\sum_{k}exp(P^T\mathbf{B_{k}})}$ = p i define the constraint on p, where P ${\in}$ $\mathbb{R}^q$ is given, B ${\in}$ $\mathbb{R}^{qXK}$ is unknown 1) E-step: Compute responsibilities using current values of the parameters 2) M-step: Assign observations to clusters using max k q ik , the computed responsibilities for the observation i. Fit a multi response logistic regression (predictor P and cluster counts as the multinomial response) to obtain ${\hat{\mathbf{B}}}$. Set p n+1
