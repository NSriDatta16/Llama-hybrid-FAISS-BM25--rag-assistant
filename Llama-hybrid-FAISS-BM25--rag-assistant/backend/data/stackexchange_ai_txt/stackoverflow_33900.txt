"Educate your co-workers, or get better co-workers" works great for a small software startup, and it works great for the big guns like Google and Amazon. It's ridiculous to think that every lowly developer contracted in for some small medical charts application in a doctor's office in a minor city. I'm not saying we should build for the lowest common denominator, but we have to be realistic that there are lots of mediocre programmers out there who will pull in any library that gets the job done, paying no attention to security. How could they pay attention to security? Maybe the took an algorithms and data structures class. Maybe they took a compilers class. They almost certainly didn't take an encryption protocols class. They definitely haven't all read Schneier or any of the others out there who practically have to beg and plead with even very good programmers to consider security when building software. I'm not worried about this: require 'evil_cracker_lib_from_russian_pr0n_site' require 'awesome' I'm worried about awesome requiring foobar and fazbot , and foobar requiring has_gumption , and ... eventually two of these conflict in some obscure way that undoes an important security aspect. One important security principle is "defense in depth" -- adding these extra layers of security help you from accidentally shooting yourself in the foot. They can't completely prevent it; nothing can. But they help.
