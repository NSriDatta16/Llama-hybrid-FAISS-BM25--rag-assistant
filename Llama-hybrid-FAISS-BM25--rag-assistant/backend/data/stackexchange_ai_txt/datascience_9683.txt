How data representation affects neural networks?

Suppose A's possible values are ON or OFF. Suppose I represent it as: if A ON then feature f=1 else f=0 Or, suppose I represent it with 2 features, where: -if A is ON then f1=1 and f2=0 -if A is OFF then f1=0 and f2=1 How this kind of representation affects neural networks?
