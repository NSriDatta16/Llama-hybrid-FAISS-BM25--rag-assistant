Which Machine Learning algorithm should I use for a sports prediction study?

I am trying to choose a ML algorithm and use it in my final year project, the class I am in has just started and we are studying K-Means and DBSCAN. My supervisor for the project suggested a Neural Network algorithm but we are not studying this in the ML module I am enrolled in. I am wondering which Neutral Network model or other ML algorithm I should use for my project. The goal of the project is to predict soccer results there will be plenty of control variables (Home/Away: goals/for and against, wins,draws,loses, referee results, each teams starting 11 with plenty of stats for each player ....). I am wondering which model would be the best to use and is a Neutral Network model the best route to go?
