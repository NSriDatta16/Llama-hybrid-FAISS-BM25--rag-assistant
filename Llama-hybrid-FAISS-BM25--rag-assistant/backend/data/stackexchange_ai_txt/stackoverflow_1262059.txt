I would encourage you to look into UUCP locking. There should be a library on Linux that implements it, but if not, it's fairly easy to implement. I've used it extensively in similar situations where I don't want multiple instances of the same program to step on each other. As a side note, perhaps you should rethink the architecture of your solution. The process that accesses the LCD/ttyUSB0 could act as a server and handle messages from the client processes that need to write to the LCD. This would require some form of IPC. It may be overkill for your project. Keep in mind that any solution you come up with will only work if all processes that access the device conform to the protocol. If you are worried about a rogue process running as root then you may be stuck with hacking the kernel to get the solution you want.
