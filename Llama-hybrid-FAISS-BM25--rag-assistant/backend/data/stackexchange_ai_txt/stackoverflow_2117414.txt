After a question of databases with textual storage), I glanced at MongoDB and similar systems. If I understood correctly, they are supposed to be easier to use and setup, and much faster. Perhaps also more secure as the lack of SQL prevents SQL injection... Apparently, MongoDB is used mostly for Web applications. Basically, and they state that themselves, these databases aren't suited for complex queries, data-mining, etc. But they shine at retrieving quickly lot of flat data.
