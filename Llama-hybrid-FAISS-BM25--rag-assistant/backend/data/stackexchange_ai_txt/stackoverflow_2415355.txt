I doubt that you'll need such a big machine. This depends on a lot of different factors though, of which quality of code probably is the most important one. Regarding network usage, you should really come up with a number of KB an average attachment will have. For 10 KB attachments, 1400 TPS would mean 14,000 KB or 14 MB per second. For 1 MB it would be 1.4 GB per second - quite a difference, isn't it? For 1.4 GB per second, you could also get some serious problems to store it somewhere - if this is a requirement at all. The processing itself shouldn't be too much of a problem (but again, depends on a multitude of different factors). The best thing you could do is to use any free hardware (or virtual machine) you can grab and run some tests. Just see what numbers you get and decide where to go from there.
