For compatibility reasons they can't do that with the standard Java releases. There is so much Java software in production out there right now that you simply can't break it with a new release that removes all the cruft. However I do think that Sun could make a "Java X" release that removed everything that was crufty, and added all the good and useful APIs that are out there but not currently included (including replacing Java APIs that have better alternatives available, e.g., log4j, and let's not start on Date and Calendar). This release would not be designed to replace Java, but could exist as a target for new software projects. I guess they could also fix up the language to include features that are missing that make Java look a bit crufty in comparison to the latest versions of C#, etc. If they made a code porting tool as well that could fix up or at least add "FIXME" to all problem areas in a codebase ... Gotta admit, Microsoft does a good job of moving people on to newer versions of .NET when they come out. Sun has totally failed here, given the number of applications still running on 1.4, and the lethargic Java version policies of many companies (who seem happy to let their .NET people use the latest and greatest somehow). Given that it is simple to have multiple Java installs on a machine, I think that more should be done to encourage companies and software houses to upgrade sooner.
