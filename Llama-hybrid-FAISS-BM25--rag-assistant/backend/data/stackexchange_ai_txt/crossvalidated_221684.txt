Which test should I use

I am doing research on a specific test, which gives a result either positive or negative and then the positive results are further categorized into organism types. The positive results are either male or female. How can I test for significance? Also the test takes some time to become positive, known as time to positivity (TTP) which can be categorized as follows: 0-12 hrs, 12-24 hrs etc..... How can I test significance for these?
