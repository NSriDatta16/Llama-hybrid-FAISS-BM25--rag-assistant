Creating a New Predictor Variable From a "Lagged Response Variable"?

Our TA in our stats class told us that when working with regression models, it is generally unadvisable to create a new predictor variable from a "lagged regression variable" (unless you are ready to consider very complicated regression models like "dynamic regression models"). As an example, suppose there are some students - you have repeated measurements on these students (e.g. age, weight, height) and the results (e.g. pass/fail) from fitness test taken by these student. As an example - suppose here are the test results for the same student over a period of years: student_id age weight height fitness 1 1 20 186 1.76 PASS 2 1 21 187 1.76 FAIL 3 1 22 191 1.77 FAIL 4 1 23 188 1.78 PASS Suppose I wanted to add some new variables to this dataset (pass = 1, fail = 0): student_id age weight height fitness total_tests_taken result_previous_test cumulative_average 1 1 20 186 1.76 1 0 NA NA 2 1 21 187 1.76 0 1 1 1.00 3 1 22 191 1.77 0 2 0 0.50 4 1 23 188 1.78 1 3 0 0.33 Let's say that the goal is to build a model that models the relationship between passing the fitness test and historical results from students. Supposedly, these new variables that I have created are not to be inserted into a regression model due to assumption violations. However, I have the following question - suppose instead of a regression model, I decide to use a model like a "Decision Tree" (e.g. CART, C4.5, CHAID) which in theory has fewer assumption restrictions compared to a regression model. Using models such as Decision Trees, is it now "more permissible" to create new predictor variables based on "lagged values of the covariates" as compared to regression models?
