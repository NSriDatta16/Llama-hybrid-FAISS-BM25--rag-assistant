WPF TreeView Jumps Around

I have a TreeView with a few hundred leaves organized in a few dozen nodes... enough nodes to require scrolling to see them all. Usually all works fine, but when the expanded nodes would not all fit within the ScrollViewer, clicking on a node to expand it also scrolls the whole TreeView back up to the top (hiding the just-expanded leaves until you scroll back down manually). This is not the same issue as WPF TreeView with IsVirtualizing="true" jumps around when changing focus and scrolling because a) I'm not setting the vitualizing stack panel options; and b) This is .NET 4 (that link reports the issue only applied to 3.5).
