Well, the only they might differ is in the HTTP headers that get transmitted. In particular the User-Agent. Also, why are you using a WebProxy? That is not really necessary and it most likely is not used by your browser. The rest of your code is fine.. Just make sure you set up the HTTP headers correctly. Check this link out: I would suggest that you get yourself a copy of WireShark and examine the communication that happens between your browser and the server that you are trying to access. Doing so will be rather trivial using WireShark and it will show you the exact HTTP message that is being sent from the browser. Then take a look at the communication that goes on between your C# application and the server (again using WireShark) and then compare the two to find out what exactly is different. If the communication is a pure HTTP GET method (i.e. there is no HTTP message body involved), and the URL is correct then the only two things I could think of are: make sure that your are send the right protocol (i.e. HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 or whatever it is that you should be sending) make sure that you are sending all required HTTP headers correctly, and obviously that you are not sending any HTTP headers that you shouldn't be sending.
