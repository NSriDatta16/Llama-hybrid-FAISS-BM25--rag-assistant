As with any regression it is best to either be well versed in the subject matter or work with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to help determine which variables make sense. A significant step in the process is to look at the stepwise results and see when the point of diminishing returns is reached. In other words, look at the amount of variance explained at each step. At some point the variance explained with significantly diminish which should help you determine a stopping point. Of course, you should always look at the correlation between predictors and how coefficients change as new variables are added and of course consult with the SME to determine which variables make the most sense. Also, I would always recommend consulting with an experienced modeler and have them review the final product and the steps along the way, including any initial variable cleansing and transformations. BTW, I always recommend binning be considered with logistic regression. Other factors are how easy are the variables to monitor and implement, which should always be a practical consideration. BTW, I noticed the reference to the article on "Problems with stepwise.." and it is certainly valid; however, stepwise, used judiciously can yield effective, useful results. As with any modeling technique, the results should be tested on an independent (preferably out of time, if applicable) sample to validate the results.
