Dragon Dictation, as of the current version 2.0.4 , does not use a Custom URL Scheme. As far as accessing the clipboard, UIPasteBoard Class is a good place to start. And for launching the Dictation app (or any other app that does not have a custom url scheme) from yours, it's not possible unless there is a URL Scheme in place for the app you want to launch, which as I mentioned above, Dictation does not have.
