embedding web site in c# project

I am currently developing a C# application. I want to have a website as a help file that is loaded within the Windows form of the software. I have added the directory where the help site is stored inside with the rest of the project classes and folders and included it into the project. I have the following in the code string appPath = Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().CodeBase); string openPath = Path.Combine(appPath, "HelpFiles/Introduction/index.htm"); helpContent.Navigate(openPath); How can I reference the site directory from inside the main project. At the moment I can only get it to work if I can copy the directory into the bin/debug directory where the exe is located. I don't want this I want the HelpFiles directory to be embedded into the main part of the software.
