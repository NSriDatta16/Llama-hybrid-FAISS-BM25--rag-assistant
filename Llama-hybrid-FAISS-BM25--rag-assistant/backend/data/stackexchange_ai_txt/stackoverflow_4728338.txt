iphone UISearchBar Done button always enabled

I have a UIViewController with a UISearchBar . I have replaced the Search Button by a Done button. However, when one taps on the searchbar, the Done button is initially disabled . This occurs until one enters any character. What I want to do is to have this Done button always enabled , such that if i tap on it i can inmediately dismiss the keyboard. Any help? it would be highly appreciated. I have on my UIViewController -(BOOL)searchBarShouldBeginEditing:(UISearchBar *)searchBar { return YES; } -(void)searchBarSearchButtonClicked:(UISearchBar *)searchBar { [searchBar resignFirstResponder]; } -(void)searchBar:(UISearchBar *)searchBar textDidChange:(NSString *)searchText { if (searchBar.text.length == 0) { //[self fixOrientation]; [searchBar resignFirstResponder]; } else { NSLog(@"typed"); } } -(void)searchBarTextDidBeginEditing:(UISearchBar *)theSearchBar { NSLog(@"began"); // this executes as soon as i tap on the searchbar, so I'm guessing this is the place to put whatever solution is available }
