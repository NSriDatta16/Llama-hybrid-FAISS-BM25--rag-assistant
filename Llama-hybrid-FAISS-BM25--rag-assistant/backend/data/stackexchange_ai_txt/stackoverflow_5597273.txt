Yeah, that's the general idea. I'd pay special attention to any concerns related to using AcompServiceClient in a stateless web environment. It's hard to say whether you have to rethink how you're using that or not without knowing anything about what it is, how it works or how it's consumed. It doesn't look like you're doing anything else that relies on running in a stateful environment. You're just pulling string values from a variety of textboxes to create some XML and push it to a service. All of that should port over smoothly. You might want to look at adding some client side validation rules, but other than that it looks straight forward. You'll want to change how you're populating your DropDownList. Those work a little different between win and web forms. It wants to be bound to a datasource in webforms.
