Best Practices for onload Javascript

What is the best way to handle several different onload scripts spread across many pages? For example, I have 50 different pages, and on each page I want to set a different button click handler when the dom is ready. Is it best to set onclicks like this on each individual page, Or a very long document ready function in an external js file, Element.observe(window, 'load', function() { if ($('link1')) { // set click handler } if ($('link2')) { // set click hanlder } ... } Or split each if ($('link')) {} section into script tags and place them on appropriate pages, Or lastly, split each if ($('link')) {} section into its own separate js file and load appropriately per page? Solution 1 seems like the least elegant and is relatively obtrusive, solution 2 will lead to a very lengthy load function, solution 3 is less obtrusive then 1 but still not great, and solution 4 will load require the user to download a separate js file per page he visits. Are any of these best (or worst) or is there a solution 5 I'm not thinking of? Edit: I am asking about the design pattern, not which onload function is the proper one to use.
