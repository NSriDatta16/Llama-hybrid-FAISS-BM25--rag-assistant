You need to set the UISearchBar's frame at some point. e.x. UISearchBar *searchBar = [[UISearchBar alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 20)]; EDIT: Regarding the button-esque artifact under the UISearchBar The button-y thing that you see under the UISearchBar is actually a background element of the UISearchBar , not the result of the search bar overlapping a UIBarButtonItem . Since there doesn't seem to be a nice way to hide this (and I hope someone can come along and correct me), I can only point you in the direction of a hack that comes with the usual perils of SDK version dependence, inelegance, and potential for more headaches. EDIT 2: Another potential solution You could also set your UISearchBar's frame's height to 44 (the height of the navbar) and then the background should blend nicely with the navbar. Based off this SO post I recently saw.
