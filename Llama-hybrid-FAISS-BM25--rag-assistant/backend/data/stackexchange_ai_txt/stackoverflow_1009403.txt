Project Layout (on disk) in Visual Studio

What's the best way to manage the physical layout of a Visual Studio project on disk? I'm getting to the point where I have several folders but I can't really continue categorizing the way I am now. For example, I have several custom controls, but sometimes those controls have to do with application settings, so do they go into the Controls folder or Application Settings folder? I have many full-fledged forms that reside in the main source folder so that it's getting a bit daunting looking for the right source file. Are there any tips anyone can offer on how they organize their medium-sized projects into folder hierarchies so they don't go insane trying to locate something in the project?
