In machine learning, a model is an abstraction that can perform a prediction, (re-)action or transformation to or in respect of an instance of input values. A model could be a single number such as the mean value of a set of observations which is often used as a baseline model, a polynomial expression or a set of rules (e.g. decision tree) that define how to get to generate the output. In general, a model is defined by a set of rules and hyper-parameters that define the model's structure and capacity to be optimized to perform the task at hand. A hyper-parameter could be the degree of the polynomial or the depth of the decision tree. A model can be subjected to an optimization process where parameters are optimized against a certain objective. The optimization process is often referred to as training for fitting and results in a fitted model, which also can be simply referred to as model. If a model was trained or not often needs to be deduced from the context.
