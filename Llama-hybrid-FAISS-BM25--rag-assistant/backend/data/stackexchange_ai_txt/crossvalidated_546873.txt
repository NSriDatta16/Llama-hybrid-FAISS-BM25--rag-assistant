The answers so far address interpretations that implicitly ignore the multilevel nature of the model. They are all correct though, that you don't have interactions, so the interpretations hinge on the tricky issue of boys-only or girls-only schools not having the other sex. The R code is helpful but let's put this in terms of the coefficients and see where we're at: normexam ~ 1 + standlrt + schgend + sex + (standlrt | school) Level 1 (student): $$exam_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j}standlrt_{ij} + \beta_{2j}sex_{ij} + r_{ij}$$ Level 2 (school): $$\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}schgendboys_{j} + \gamma_{02}schgendgirls_{j} + u_{0j}$$ $$\beta_{1j} = \gamma_{10} + u_{1j}$$ $$\beta_{2j} = \gamma_{20}$$ Combined: $$exam_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}schgendboys_{j} + \gamma_{02}schgendgirls{j} + \gamma_{10}standlrt{ij} + \gamma_{20}sex_{ij} + u_{0j} + u_{1j}standlrt_{ij} + r_{ij}$$ Let's hold sex constant at male. In this model (with dummy coding), $\gamma_{00}$ (the intercept) is the grand mean exam score in mixed schools. $\gamma_{01}$ is the difference in school average between mixed and boys-only, $\gamma_{02}$ , difference in school average between mixed and girls only, $\gamma_{10}$ is the pooled estimate (average) standlrt slope across all schools, $\gamma_{20}$ is the overall difference between male and female students (non-random). It's easier to think about it in the following way: within each school we're supposedly estimating the standlrt slopes controlling for the sex of the student, and then between schools, we're examining the effect of school type (mixed, boys-only, girls-only) on the school's average exam scores, while controlling for the level-1 variables within a school. Within the single sex schools, obviously the effect of sex cannot be estimated, but we still get a coefficient $\gamma_{20}$ because we're actually estimating it using the entire sample, and not letting it vary across schools. This works because in arriving at MLM estimates, the individual school regressions are actually not performed. Instead, estimates of variance components (the r's and the u's) enable the fitting of the combined model. One can then obtain the school-level intercepts and slopes (you should try that to see if some are NA's). Hope this helps!
