Is the sparseness really the reason for models being so unstable and inconclusive? Yes. At 99% zeros, just about any time series method is going to fail, especially one as "data hungry" as RNN or LSTM. You're better off modeling it as a Poisson process. One way to deal with the sparseness is to make the data less granular by deriving time sequence using month and year or year instead of the actual date. Is this an approach worth trying? The granularity of your predictions is usually driven by your business objective, not just your data. Using Temporal aggregation to improve forecasts for intermittent demand was suggested by Petropoulos and Kourentzes in "Forecast combinations for intermittent demand" . In your case, that means that you have on average less than 1 non zero data point every 100 days, so you could aggregate up to a quarterly level (1 quarter = 3 months).
