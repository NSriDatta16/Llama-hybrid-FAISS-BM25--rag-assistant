Gmail doesn't use GWT, so I'm assuming you just want a high-level answer. Gmail uses the URL fragment (the part after the # ). As you navigate around in Gmail you'll notice that the fragment changes to a unique identifier for each "location" in Gmail's navigation. Using the fragment makes the browser do all the tracking for you without requiring page reloads. You then just monitor the fragment, and when it changes you navigate to the location it specifies.
