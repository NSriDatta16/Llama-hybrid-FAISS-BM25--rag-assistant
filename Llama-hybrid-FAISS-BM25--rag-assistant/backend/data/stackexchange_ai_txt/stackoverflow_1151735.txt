Generally, "ragged hierarchy" is an immediate translation to "parent-child" for me. You'd want it to go like so: ItemID ItemKey ParentID 1 Lvl0-1 null 2 Lvl1-1 1 3 Lvl2-1 2 4 Lvl2-2 2 5 Item1 3 6 Item2 3 7 Item3 4 8 Item4 1 SSAS will generate this Parent/Child for you once you tell it what the ParentID is. Rather automagic. Also, here I used ItemID as a surrogate key, and used the ParentID which pointed to that. There are a long list of reasons to use integers, but for Parent/Child, what you should do is use the ID as the Key column, and then add ItemKey as an attribute/relationship to said key column. You can then order Item (missing from this schema) by Attribute Key and select ItemKey . You can also choose whether or not to show that property to the user. SSAS, by default, assumes that a null or self-referential parent key is a root node. I generally use null because they're easier for me to see when I'm scrolling through records. But, this is a preference thing.
