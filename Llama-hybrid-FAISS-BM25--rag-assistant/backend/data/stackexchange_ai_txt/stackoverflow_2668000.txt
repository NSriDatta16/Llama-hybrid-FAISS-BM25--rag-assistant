You should have a look at JavaFX, which allows easier and nicer (than Swing) graphical interactions and animations and integrates nicely with swing. I don't have any personal experience with JavaFX but a colleague of mine is working on a project that shows the way to the different rooms and buildings in our organization on a map, using a touch screen for input. He uses JavaFX for the GUI and Java for the backend programming, and he is quite satisfied.
