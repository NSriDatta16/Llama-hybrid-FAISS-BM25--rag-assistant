The property of "consistency" of an estimator presupposes the existence of a common theoretical moment that is being estimated through a sample mean. In general, Sample means are consistent estimators of the corresponding theoretical moments, if the underlying population is stationary up to the corresponding moment (1st-order, second-order, etc) ergodic and it is so along the index over which we average . Note 1: the first condition is essentially a re-statement of the fact that we need the random variables to have common the moment we want to estimate. Note 2: in many cases, stationarity and ergodicity "go together" (need the same set of conditions), but not always . Ergodicity is a deep mathematical concept, and I do not know how to present it summarily. Note 3: Condition 3 relativizes the previous two conditions. Case in point : it appears that in the OP's case, we want to obtain an estimate of the "ensemble mean" (in time series terminology), or in panel-data terminology, to estimate the "cross-sectional" mean in each time period, and form a time series of these cross-sectional means. Looking at the conditions, we require $$E(X_{1t}) = ...= E(X_{Kt}) \;\;\; \forall \;t$$ but we can allow $$E(X_{1t}) = ...= E(X_{Kt}) \neq E(X_{1,t+j}) = ...= E(X_{K,t+j}),\;\;\; j\in \mathbf Z$$ If the second situation happens, we will obtain a non-stationary time series of averages, but that's life, and it does not affect the properties of each cross-sectional sample mean. Moreover, do we need the variances to be constant across time? NO, we do not "care" what happens across time, since what we want is to estimate the cross-sectional mean. Perhaps we need the variance to be common across "space"? Again, NO, since we are only estimating the first moment, the mean, and we do not "care" about its distribution . Essentially what we need is the conditions for a Law of Large Numbers(LLN) to hold, along the index we are averaging over. If the cross-sections are independent, the only thing we need is that they have a common mean (this is Khinchin's LLN ). Regarding the characteristic of independence, it can be relaxed up to a point, and we can start talking about martingales or mixing processes (here along the "space", cross sectional index ), and again we will obtain an LLN. Finally, there may be cases where, given the research purpose/goal it is meaningful to average over random variables that have different theoretical means. For example assume that we have the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of different countries. For our purposes we may want to calculate the "average GDP value per time-period", even though we know that most probably for each country the theoretical mean value of its DGP per time period is different (i.e. we do not argue that the DGP of China, viewed as a random variable in each time period, has the same distribution as the DGP of Panama, and that the two represent different realizations from the same distribution). Here, we have Chebyshev's LLN for independent rv's (that the sample average will converge to the average of the true expected values), and also Markov's LLN , which allows for a degree of stochastic dependence and still leads to convergence of the (here) cross-sectional sample average to the average of the true means.
