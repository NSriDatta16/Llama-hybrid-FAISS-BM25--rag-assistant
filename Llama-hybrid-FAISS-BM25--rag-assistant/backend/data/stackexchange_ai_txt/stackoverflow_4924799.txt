Encrypting data for storage in database

We have a site, where a user will be saving extremely personal and sensitive data in our database. We of course will need to be encrypting this data before it is stored in the database, and using SSL. It is an MVC application that will use form authentication. what is the best way to ensure that this data is encrypted from the time we save it until the time it is decrypted for display on their personal page. We need to also ensure that it will be secure from even our developers and dba's working on the app. What is the best way to handle this situation?
