Bear in mind: functional languages are Turing complete. Therefore, any useful task you would perform in an imperitive language can be done in a functional language. At the end of the day though, I think there's something to be said of a hybrid approach. Languages like F# and Clojure (and I'm sure others) encourage stateless design, but allow for mutability when necessary.
