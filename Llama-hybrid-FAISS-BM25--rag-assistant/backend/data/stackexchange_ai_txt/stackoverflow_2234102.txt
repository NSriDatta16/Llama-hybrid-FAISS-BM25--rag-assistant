How to Create a Virtual Network Adapter in .NET?

I would like to create/add a virtual network adapter to a client operating system at runtime (via code), preferably in C#. Something similar to that of what VirtualBox/VMware/Himachi creates when you install their software. I am guessing this will require some C/C++ shenanigans for the driver integration, but if it is doable with only C#, all the better. I am aware of OpenVPN, their stuff is primarily in C, and I am also aware of the TUN/TAP drivers floating around, I just didn't know if these were the only solutions not requiring me creating a fully loaded network driver for Windows.
