http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/performance-scale.aspx Please be more specific with your question if you need a detailed, situational analysis. The basic scalability/redundancy options included with SQL 2008 R2 Enterprise are: Clustering - Allows multiple nodes to work in conjunction, either Active/Active (both nodes serving traffic) or Active/Passive (one node in standby). However, it is important to point out that this clustering is available via the Windows OS and shared storage between multiple modes, so the hardware requirements on an active/active scenario can become significant. Here is a good explanation: http://www.mssqltips.com/tip.asp?tip=1541 Mirroring - Two databases are synchronously or asynchronously updated in conjunction; this provides high availability. Replication - full or partial duplication of data from one node to another node. Depending on how it is used, replication can give scale, redundancy, and even offline capability (for example, when used with a mobile device that is only occasionally connected). A simple Google search for any of these (or an MSDN search) will yield an abundance of results. You may also find these specific benchmarks interesting: http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/results/tpcc_perf_results.asp?resulttype=undefined&version=5%&currencyID=1 SQL Server presents a very cost-effective option.
