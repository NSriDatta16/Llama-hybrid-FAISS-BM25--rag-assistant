Best practice MLR vs GLM(M)

I am modelling timeseries of organism traits (7 different traits in total) using GLM(M)s in R. The data was collected at very irregular intervals and from 6 different locations. For every location 5-10 animals were sampled and some locations have been sampled multiple times whereas others just once or twice. I am interested to see if Trait significantly changes with Year . I decided to use Location as a random variable so that the model is of the form: glmer(Trait~ Year + Var1 + (1|Location), family=gaussian(link = "log"), data = data) The model diagnostics lock good and don't give any reasons for concerns to me. I did just for the sake of it model the same traits using multiple linear regression, this time having Location as a fixed term. This required the log transformation of Traits lm(log(Trait) ~ Year + Var1 + Location, data = data) Also for these models the diagnostics look good. Both models suggest the same trend in the data. Now the problem that I am facing is decide what model I should use? In the literature it is commonly mentioned that the simplest possible statistical tool should be favored over more complicated ones which suggests to me I should favor the linear regression but one is also discouraged to transform data to fit the model.
