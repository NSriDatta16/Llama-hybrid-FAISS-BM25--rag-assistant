Can bootstrap adjustment for $p$-value in AR model be applied to distributed lag model?

In Wang "Multiple testing correction in time series: rolling window analysis with applications of GWAS methods" (2022), the author mentioned that bootstrap minimum $p$ -value can be applied on the residuals of fitted AR model (p. 26). Is it possible to apply it on a DLM with daily death count as dependent variable and temperature with 21 lags as independent variables? The information about Bootstrap adjustment is as below: In step 1, n window will 21 lags in my question; $\hat{p} will be :$ The author applied the bootstrap adjustment to AR model instead of DLM, is it possible for me to apply the same technique to DLM? The equation will be: $$ Daily Death_t \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 Temp_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_{21} Temp_{t-21} + u_t $$ I would like to perform multiple corrections to all lagged variables of $Temp_{t-i}$ .
