I also battled with this for ages and could not get the Groovy documented samples to work with JUnit 4. This was my solution which was trivially simple in the end: Create a script called RunAllTestScripts.groovy: package com.mypackage import org.junit.runner.JUnitCore result = JUnitCore.runClasses MyGroovyTestClass, MyOtherGroovyTestClass, AnotherGroovyTestClass String message = "Ran: " + result.getRunCount() + ", Ignored: " + result.getIgnoreCount() + ", Failed: " + result.getFailureCount() if (result.wasSuccessful()) { println "SUCCESS! " + message } else { println "FAILURE! " + message result.getFailures().each { println it.toString() } } That's it. The JUnitCore (JUnit4) runner will run these test classes. There's probably a more elegant solution with TestSuites to be had but this is sufficient for my needs. The Result object contains the ran, ignored, failed counts as well as the detailed failure list which is easily interrogated.
