as3 + red5/fms: recording audio from soundmixer

i'm wondering if there's a way to record live audio from flash' SoundMixer (NOT from the microphone). Might be a simple question but i'm a noob with red5/fms technologies and can't find anything online that answers my question :\ TIA for your attention.
