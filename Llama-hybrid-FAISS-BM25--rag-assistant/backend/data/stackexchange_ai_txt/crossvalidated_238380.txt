I would suggest you to look at SVM from another point of view: It is minimizing hinge loss with L2 regularization. This interpretation works better than maximize the margin interpretation when data is not linearly separable. Increasing the regularization will increase number of the support vectors. library(kernlab) library(mlbench) set.seed(0) d=mlbench.2dnormals(100) svp1 In above simulation we are changing the regularization parameter $C$ to have different numbers of support vectors (shown in black in the plot) in a toy data set.
