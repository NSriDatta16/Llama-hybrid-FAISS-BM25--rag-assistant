TreeViewAdv seems to be pretty nice. It is described with the following features on SourceForge.net: Extensible advanced TreeView. 100% management C# code. Features: Model/View architecture. Multicolumns. Multiselection. Different controls for each node: CheckBox, Icon, Label ... Drag&Drop highlighting. Load on demand. Incremental search. We will most likely use this in one or two occasions in an upcoming project, IIRC. HTH
