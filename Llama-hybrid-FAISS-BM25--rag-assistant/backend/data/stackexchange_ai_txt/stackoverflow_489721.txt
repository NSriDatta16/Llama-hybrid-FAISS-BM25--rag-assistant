I needed exactly something like this some time ago, when PyDev still used an older version of coverage.py than the one accessible from the script creator's page. What I did was detecting where PyDev was saving his .coverage file. For me it was: C:\Users\Admin\workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.python.pydev.debug\.coverage Then I manually ran a new version of coverage.py from a separate script and told it to save its .coverage file in the place where PyDev saves its. I cannot remember if there is a command-line argument to coverage.py or if I simply copied the .coverage file with a script, but after that, if you simply open the Code Coverage Results View and click Refresh coverage information! , PyDev will nicely process the data as if it generated the file itself.
