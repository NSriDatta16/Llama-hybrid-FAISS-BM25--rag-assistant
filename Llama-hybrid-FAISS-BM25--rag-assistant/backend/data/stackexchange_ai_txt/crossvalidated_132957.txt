Intercept bias in logistic case-control regression: which is the reason?

I don't understand the reason why if I use case-control sampling in a logistic regression then the intercept is biased. The book Agresti 2007 (An introduction to categorical data analysis) says: "..the intercept term in the model is not meaningful, because it relates to the relative numbers of outcomes of $y=1$ and $y=0$. We don't estimate this, because the sample frequencies for $y=1$ and $y=0$ are fixed by the nature of case-control study". What I don't understand is the relation between the fact that in the case-control study I fix the sample frequencies for $y=1$ and $y=0$, and the fact that this is related on the intercept's bias. Could anyone explain this connection?
