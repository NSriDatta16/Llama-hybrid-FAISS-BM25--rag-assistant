Only recently has rudimentary user interaction been enabled in Core Plot graphs. To enable scrolling in any direction, you can set the allowsUserInteraction property of the plot space to YES. We currently have no means of locking that movement to one direction. The scrolling action takes place in the -pointingDeviceDraggedAtPoint: method on CPXYPlotSpace, so you could subclass CPXYPlotSpace, copy over its implementation of that method, and alter it to only allow movement in the X direction. Even better, we'd appreciate any contributions to extend the functionality of the CPXYPlotSpace to add support for unidirectional movement.
