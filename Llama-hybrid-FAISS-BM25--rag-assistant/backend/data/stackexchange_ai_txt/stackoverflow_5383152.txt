Should I add a common property of foreign keys to my table?

I have a database of test data that have been collected on behalf of agents. The test data are grouped together (after the fact) into result sets. As the tests come in, they are stored in the database with the ID of the corresponding agent: TEST_ID TEST_OWNER TIMESTAMP RESULT_ID 1 1 0 null 2 1 15 null 3 2 30 null 4 2 32 null 5 1 34 null The result sets are generated at a later time in such a way that groups tests that took place during a similar time frame. This judgment cannot be made as the tests come in. RESULT_ID 1 2 3 All of the tests in a result set must belong to the same owner. I can ensure this (in code) as I assign the result IDs to the tests in my later operation, but some things would be easier if I had a TEST_OWNER field in my result set table. Would adding this field be a violation of some normalization goal? The TEST_OWNER information will be duplicated, even though one instance of it is really implicit. I'm not a DBA, and I don't want to do things that are bad style.
