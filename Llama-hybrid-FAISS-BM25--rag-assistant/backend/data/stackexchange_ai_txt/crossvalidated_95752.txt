Does augmented Dicky-Fuller test test complex unit roots?

The augmented Dicky-Fuller test, as described in Tsay's Financial Time Series: The regression done in the test seems to only produce real value $\hat{\beta}$, so it seems to me the test only tests existence of root 1 or -1. (Am I missing something?) A AR(p) model can be nonstationary because it has a complex unit root, so I wonder if the augmented Dicky-Fuller test tests existence of all unit roots (including complex ones, i.e. non-real unit roots)?
