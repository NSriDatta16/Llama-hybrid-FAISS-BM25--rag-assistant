How to use R gbm with distribution = "adaboost"?

Documentation states that R gbm with distribution = "adaboost" can be used for 0-1 classification problem. Consider the following code fragment: gbm_algorithm It can be found in the documentation that predict.gbm Returns a vector of predictions. By default the predictions are on the scale of f(x). However the particular scale is not clear for the case of distribution = "adaboost". Could anyone help with the interpretation of predict.gbm return values and provide an idea of conversion to the 0-1 output?
