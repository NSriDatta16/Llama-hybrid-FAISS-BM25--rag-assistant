What you are reporting is a standardized score. It just isn't the standardized score most statisticians are familiar with. Likewise, the t-score you are talking about, isn't what most of the people answering the question think it is. I only ran into these issues before because I volunteered in a psychometric testing lab while in undergrad. Thanks go to my supervisor at the time for drilling these things into my head. Transformations like this are usually an attempt to solve a "what normal person wants to look at all of those decimal points anyway" sort of problem. Z-scores are what most people in statistics call "Standard Scores". When a score is at the mean, they have a value of 0, and for each standard deviation difference from the mean adjusts the score by 1. The "standard score" you are using has a mean of 100 and a difference of a standard deviation adjusts the score by 15. This sort of transformation is most familiar for its use on some intelligence tests. You probably ran into a t-score in your reading. That is yet another specialized term that has no relation (that I am aware of) to a t-test. t-scores represent the mean as 50 and each standard deviation difference as a 10 point change. Google found an example conversion sheet here: http://faculty.pepperdine.edu/shimels/Courses/Files/ConvTable.pdf A couple mentions of t-scores here supports my assertion regarding them: http://www.healthpsych.com/bhi/doublenorm.html http://www.psychometric-success.com/aptitude-tests/percentiles-and-norming.htm Chapter 5, pp 89, Murphy, K. R., & Davidshofer, C. O. (2001). Psychological testing: principles and applications . Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. A mention of standardized scores along my interpretation is here: http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/research/Normal/Interpret%20Raw%20Scores.html http://www.nfer.ac.uk/nfer/research/assessment/eleven-plus/standardised-scores.cfm This is an intro psych book, so it probably isn't particular official either. Chapter 8, pp 307 in Wade, C., & Tarvis, C. (1996). Psychology . New York: Harper Collins state in regards to IQ testing "the average is set arbitrarily at 100, and tests are constructed so that the standard deviation ... is always 15 or 16, depending on the test". So, now to directly address your questions: Yes, zscores and tscores are both types of "Standard scores". However, please note that your boss is right in calling the transformation you are doing a "standard score". I don't know of any standard abbreviation for standardized scores. As you can see above, I looked for a canonical source, but I was unable to find one. I think the best place to look for a citation people would believe is in the manual of the standardized test you are using. Good luck.
