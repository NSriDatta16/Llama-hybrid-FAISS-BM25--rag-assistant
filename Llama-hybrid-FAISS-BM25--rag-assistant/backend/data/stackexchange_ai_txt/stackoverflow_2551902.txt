The direction from a chosen baseline for each concept is different. Graceful degradation starts at an ideal user experience level and decreases depending on user agent capabilities down to a minimum level, catering for agents that don't support certain features used by the baseline. Progressive enhancement starts at a broad minimum user experience and increases depending on user agent capabilities up to a more capable level, catering for agents that support more advanced features than the baseline. I think that one could employ both concepts if time/budget permit. If not then graceful degradation would be preferred.
