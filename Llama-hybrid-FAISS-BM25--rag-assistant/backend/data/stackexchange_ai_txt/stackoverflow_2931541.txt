JQUERY, highlight text, and drag & drop it in a DIV which captures it

I'd like a user to be able to highlight a select of text and be able to drag and drop the text selection into a DIV. The DIV would be binded to be able to capture the text that was dropped. Any ideas on how to make this happen? Thanks
