There isn't much to go on here, but here are a few points: Your dependent variable is an ordered categorical variable. That suggests using ordered logistic regression. Logistic regression isn't appropriate, because the dependent variable isn't binary. Multinomial logistic regression is applicable, but ignores the ordering (presumably class A is more fit to work than class B, which is more fit to work than class C, and so forth), and will require many more parameters, with a corresponding loss of efficiency. Autoregressive isn't a bad thought, but it's not a time series. It's panel data. You'd probably want to use the previous year's Medical Class Type as a (categorical) independent variable. You have two goals here, as far as I can tell: inference (whether gender and age affect the class type) and prediction. The inference part is easier (test significance of the corresponding parameters). Predicting probabilities of each class a year out (i.e. for 2017) is also easy, once you have the parameter estimates. Predicting two years out is a little more difficult, but you can work it out using basic properties of conditional probabilities etc. Some references on ordered logistic regression are Paul Allison's Logistic Regression Using SAS , and Long and Freese's Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata .
