As a first step to get some understanding of where it's meaningful to start, I would suggest talking to some users. Interviews will only generate qualitative data, but sometimes that's the fastest way to know where to focus quantitative effort. I don't believe there's a useful answer to your question until you have that context. If you insist on a quantitative approach before you have enough information to embark on it, a start might be to focus on some of the most common tags and look at them individually against individual predictors. In other words, scatterplot whether a specific tag was used (0/1) against each of the predictors, one by one. If you find something useful, the next step might be logistic regression. There's a good book from Hosmer and Lemeshow on how to build logistic regression models -- the full method is a bit too much to describe in one answer here. Why model it as 0/1? If users don't affect each other's tags too much, then once we have the probability that a single user selects a tag, the number of users that select a tag are binomially distributed. But again, this is assuming users select tags somewhat independently -- talking to the users is a cheap way to avoid assuming!
