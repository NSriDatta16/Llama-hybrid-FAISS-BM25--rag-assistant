Option #1 is faster because if you look at the code for Enum.Parse , you'll see that it goes through each item one by one, looking for a match. In addition, there is less code to maintain and keep consistent. One word of caution is that you shouldn't use ToUpper , but rather ToUpperInvariant() because of Turkey Test issues. If you insist on Option #2, at least use the overload that allows you to specify to ignore case. This will be faster than converting to uppercase yourself. In addition, be advised that the Framework Design Guidelines encourage that all enum values be PascalCase instead of SCREAMING_CAPS.
