Turn drag and drop off for the datagrid. Write a custom renderer which listens to itself for the DragEnter / DragDrop events. In the handler for the drop event, add the item(s) to the data (at the variable referenced by that column). If your renderer is bound to the item, it will now update. ((Note that isn't best practice, you'd want to dispatch an event containing the renderer's data item, the variable it was representing and the item(s) dropped, and then manipulate the dataprovider outside of the renderer))
