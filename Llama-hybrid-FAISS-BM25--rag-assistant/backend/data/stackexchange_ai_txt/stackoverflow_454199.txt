You should be able to use HttpContext.Current.Session Edit While yes I agree you should not tightly couple your Business Logic DAL or etc assemblies to ASP.Net session. There are plenty of valid cases for accessing HTTP Context outside of a web project. Web Controls is probably one of the best examples, reusable HTTP modules, etc.. Now one option, if you want to have your DLL pull the stuff from Session, is to abstract out session. So you could define an interface like IStorage, that your library will know how to use. Then you can have a SessionStorage or MemoryStorage class and use IoC to inject the appropriate class into your library classes. This gives you the freedom to code it how you wanted it to be coded without tying your code to Session. Oh and one other benefit if done properly can be used to not tie your code to the session on the web either.
