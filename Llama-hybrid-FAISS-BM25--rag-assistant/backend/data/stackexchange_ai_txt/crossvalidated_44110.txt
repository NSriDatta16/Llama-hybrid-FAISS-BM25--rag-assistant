Rather than using a grid search, it may be easier to use something like the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (which I believe has an R implementation) and use that to minimise the model selection criterion, and then you don't need to worry about the limits at all. Do minimise a continuous criterion though, for example the hinge loss on the test examples or radius-margin bound, rather than the test error rate (as that will be rather noisy and hard to optimised. Don't optimise the hyper-parameters too much though as it is also possible to get overfitting in model selection as well as in fitting the SVM.
