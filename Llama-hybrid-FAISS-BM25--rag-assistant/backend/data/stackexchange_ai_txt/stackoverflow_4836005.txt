It looks like you need to read the documentation in more depth to get to the bottom of this. Specifically the iOS Event Handling Guide . From that document there are a few things which I would suggest you try: Override canBecomeFirstResponder: and return YES (as per Listing 4-1). Override viewDidAppear:animated: to become the first responder (as per Listing 4-1). Override both motionBegan:withEvent: and motionCancelled:withEvent: as they do this in the example which may be because the framework is testing your view controller class to see if it responds to these selectors (as per Listing 4-2). Look at the UIResponder Class Reference (from which UIViewController inherits) for more detail on the methods you are overriding. As someone who came from a Microsoft / VB / .NET and Android / Java background to Cocoa / Objective-C programming I would strongly suggest you invest the time in reading the documentation. Initially the Apple documents seem impenetrable but they're actually pretty good! I hope that helps.
