If you really want to do this the right way, the easy way, the complete way you'll buy Netrics. http://www.netrics.com/ We bought it, and wrapped an application around it that lets our employees match anything they want. The can configure confidence intervals for each column, build thesauri where you can map Robert to Bob, and John to Jack. It's amazing and used by some of the larger institutions in the country for scrubing various lists.
