I've read from some bug report comments that Chrome stores localStorage data in UTF-16, which effectively doubles the sized used, leaving you with something more like 2.5mb. I think this might also be the case for other webkit browsers as well, if they impose the 5mb limit. The fact that almost a year after this question was asked it still isn't easy to find the size limits (or even the key/value charset) is crazy.
