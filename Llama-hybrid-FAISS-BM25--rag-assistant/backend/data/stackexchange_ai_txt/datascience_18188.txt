The purpose of the encoder (green part) is to determine this document vector, so if you want to provide it yourself use the decoder and feed the embedding as the initial state. I suppose you could use your embedding as a prior for the encoder output. One alternative to your suggestion, which might work, is to use the embeddings as an MSE regularizer to the encoder output.
