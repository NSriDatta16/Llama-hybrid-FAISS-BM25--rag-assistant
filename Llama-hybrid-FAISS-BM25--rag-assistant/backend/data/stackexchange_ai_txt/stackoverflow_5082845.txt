From my experience building GWT apps, there's a few things to consider when deciding on whether you want multiple modules (with or without entry points), or all in one: download time (Javascript bundle size), compile time, navigation/url, and maintainability/re-usability. ...per download time, code splitting pretty much obviates the need to break into different modules for performance reasons. ...per compile time, even big apps are pretty quick to compile, but it might help breaking things up for huge apps. ...per navigation/url, it can be a pain to navigate from one module to another (assuming different EntryPoints), since each module has it's own client-side state...and navigation isn't seamless across modules. ...per maintainability/re-usability, it can be helpful from an organization/structure perspective to split into separate modules (even if there's only one EntryPoint). I wrote a blog post about using GWT Modules , in case it helps.
