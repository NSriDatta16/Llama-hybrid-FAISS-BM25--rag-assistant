If you're redirecting directly to the auto_form controller method you can setup an argument there to pass your data in: auto_form($quant) Then, depending assuming you have no routes, rewriting, or querystrings 'on' (basically a stock CI setup) to interfere, and you are using the URL helper to redirect, you would do your redirect something like this: redirect('/index.php/your_controller/auto_form/'. $quantity_from_form); More on passing URI segments to your functions here . Or if you're already using CI sessions in your application you can add the quantity value to a session variable for later retrieval inside of the auto_form controller method: // Set After Your Form Passed Validation $this->session->set_userdata('quant', $quantity_from_form); // Retrieve Later in Controller Method After Redirect $this->paypal_lib->add_field('quantity', $this->session->userdata('item')); More on CI sessions here .
