Build knowledge bot using deep learning

I'm going through this chatbot example, which uses the Cornell movie dialog corpus. Expanding this example, is it possible to build a "knowledge bot" (ie) a bot that can chat and be knowledgeable in a specific domain? So for example, I use the Bible to train the system. Then it should be able to answer questions on Bible. Or I use the wikia content of Star Wars and be able to answer all the questions related to Star Wars. Is such a system even possible, or is it still in the realm of scifi?
