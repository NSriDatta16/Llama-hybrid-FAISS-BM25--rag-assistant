How do I "require" a neighbour class in Java?

In Ruby I have often written a number of small classes, and had a main class organize the little guys to get work done. I do this by writing require "converter.rb" require "screenFixer.rb" . . . at the top of the main class. How do I do this in Java? Is it "import?" Also, could someone please come up with a better title for this question?
