Using .htaccess to change my website URLs

I have some pages organised like this: http://localhost/index.html http://localhost/download.html http://localhost/contact.html And I need them changed to suit the following URL structure: http://localhost/ http://localhost/download http://localhost/contact Without making sub directories and putting in pages as index.html . As far as I know .htaccess can be used for this, but I have no idea what I need to add to my .htaccess file to make this work. Can anyone provide some help? Thanks.
