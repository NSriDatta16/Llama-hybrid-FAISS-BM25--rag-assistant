I found an elegant solution for this problem from http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/7d0cbdf2-dea3-4dd4-a570-08aa6c78d911 . Here is recap: private void dg_LoadingRow(object sender, Microsoft.Windows.Controls.DataGridRowEventArgs e) { e.Row.Header = (e.Row.GetIndex() + 1).ToString(); } However, I couldn't make the number on the row header right aligned. Adding HorizontalAlignment="Right" to the TextBlock doesn't help. I also tried to wrap the TextBlock inside a StackPanel, and set this property, but it doesn't work either. Any idea?
