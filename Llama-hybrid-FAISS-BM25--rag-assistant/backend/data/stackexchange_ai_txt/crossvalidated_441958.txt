Let the dimension be denoted by $d$ . There are $d$ eigenvectors of dimension $d\times1$ . In PCA $k of them an obtain an underrepresentation. Typically, the data matrix, $X$ , as also in your case has dimension $n\times d$ , where $n$ is number of data points in the dataset. So, each row is a sample. In order to convert a sample, say $x$ of dimension $1\times d$ , to new coordinate system, we need project the sample onto the chosen set of eigenvectors, let them be denoted by $v_1,v_2...v_k$ . Projection means calculating dot product, and projecting $x$ onto each eigenvector is equivalent to calculating the dot product $v_i^Tx^T$ . So, the new coordinates for our sample will be the following: $$x_k=[v_1^Tx^T,\ v_2^Tx^T\dots v_k^Tx^T]=[v_1^T\dots v_k^T]x^T=V^Tx^T$$ If you do this for all the samples in the dataset, we have: $$X_k=V^T\begin{bmatrix}x_1^T\\x_2^T\\\vdots\\x_n^T\end{bmatrix}=V^TX^T$$
