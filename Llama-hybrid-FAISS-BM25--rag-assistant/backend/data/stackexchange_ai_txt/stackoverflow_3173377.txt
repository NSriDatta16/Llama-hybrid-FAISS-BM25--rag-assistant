I always use your preferred css convention - and have used jQuery on those elements without any issues. In terms of single/double quotes - I only use single quotes when the value contains HTML markup. i.e. $("#el").html(' Hey! '); I notice you updated your question after I answered it. For multi-library conflicts you can use the libraries in compatibility mode. For example: var $j = jQuery.noConflict(); $j(document).ready(function () { $j("body").css('background', 'red'); }); As for using single/multiple files it really comes down to tidyness vs performance. Each new .js file will require an extra request to the server, thus slowing down your site. But if you were to write 5000 lines of code that do many many different things, you could certainly consider organizing them in multiple files. In these cases though, what I prefer to do is keep my scripts separate in my development environment, then combine them into one global.js file which I then minify for production. HTH, Marko
