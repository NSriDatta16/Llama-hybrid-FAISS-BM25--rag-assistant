Open your favorite text editor Create a new file named whatever.h Put your function prototypes in it DONE. Example whatever.h #ifndef WHATEVER_H_INCLUDED #define WHATEVER_H_INCLUDED int f(int a); #endif Note: include guards (preprocessor commands) added thanks to luke. They avoid including the same header file twice in the same compilation. Another possibility (also mentioned on the comments) is to add #pragma once but it is not guaranteed to be supported on every compiler. Example whatever.c #include "whatever.h" int f(int a) { return a + 1; } And then you can include "whatever.h" into any other .c file, and link it with whatever.c's object file. Like this: sample.c #include "whatever.h" int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf("%d\n", f(2)); /* prints 3 */ return 0; } To compile it (if you use GCC): $ gcc -c whatever.c -o whatever.o $ gcc -c sample.c -o sample.o To link the files to create an executable file: $ gcc sample.o whatever.o -o sample You can test sample: $ ./sample 3 $
