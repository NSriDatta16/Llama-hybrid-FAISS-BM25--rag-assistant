probably yes, but you have to help compiler with some hints. __restrict__ placed on pointers tells compiler that there is no alias between two pointers. if you know alignment of your vectors, communicate that to compiler (Visual C++ may have some facility). I am not familiar with Visual C++ myself, but I have heard it is no good for vectorization. Consider using Intel compiler instead. Intel allows pretty fine-grained control over assembly generated: http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/docs/clin/main_cls/cref_cls/common/cppref_pragma_vector.htm
