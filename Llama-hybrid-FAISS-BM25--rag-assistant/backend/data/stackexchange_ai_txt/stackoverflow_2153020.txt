Alternative approach to user management in asp.net web application

I am using asp.net 2.0. I have been using asp.net membership provider for user management. But I think this would be more efficient if I could do this without using role and membership provider provided in asp.net. In fact I see bulky markups generated when I add login control, createuser control etc. in an asp.net web page. By saying user management, I am referring to the overall login, user activity tracking, password reset/retrieval, role management in an asp.net web application. And I want to implement efficient way to accomplish this. Any suggestion would be appreciated.
