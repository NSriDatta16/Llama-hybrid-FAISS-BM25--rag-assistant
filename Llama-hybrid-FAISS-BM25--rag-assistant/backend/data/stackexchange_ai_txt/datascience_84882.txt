Is it possible the model be better on a few epochs rather than hundreds of epochs?

I have very interesting experience in my CNN binary image classification. Do you think the result is by chance or there is a logic behind it? I used InceptionV3 transfer with softmax (I know you will say why not ReLU) but it is what I did. I trained on 100 epochs. But the result was terrible. from the training process I noticed in the 12-th epochs the result is excellent (both train accuracy and validation accuracy ). So I trained the model on 12-th epochs. and suprisely the result on the test data was also excellent. Does it mean on a few epoch the result is better?
