All Addtional Attributes for Grouped Products in Magento

Similar to the question asked at: Magento - Show Custom Attributes in Grouped Product table I'd like to display attributes of simple products in the grouped product page. However, I need it to work such that you do not explicitly specify which attributes get displayed. Instead, it displays all the attributes that would get displayed on the simple product view of that product. I've tried variations of: (from /template/catalog/product/view/type/grouped.phtml) htmlEscape($_item->getName()) ?> getAttributes() as $arr): ?> getData() ?> getPriceHtml($_item, true) ?> isSaleable()): ?> isSaleable()) : ?> getUrlPath() ?>">View __('Out of stock.') ?> And other variations, however, I cannot limit the attributes being displayed to just the ones I need (i.e. just the additional attributes displayed on the simple product view; those set as Viewable on Frontend). Any ideas?
