Generic and consistent confidence and credible regions. http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1528163 with code at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1528187 Provides a description of credible intervals and confidence intervals for set selection together with generic R code to calculate both given the likelihood function and some observed data. Further it proposes a test statistics that gives credible and confidence intervals of optimal size that are consistent with each other. In short and avoiding formulas. The Bayesian credible interval is based on the probability of the parameters given the data . It collects the parameters that have a high probability into the credible set/interval. The 95% credible interval contains parameters that together have a probability of 0.95 given the data. The frequentist confidence interval is based on the probability of the data given some parameters . For each (possibly infinitely many) parameter, It first generates the set of data that is likely to be observed given the parameter. It then checks for each parameter, whether the selected high probability data contains the observed data. If the high probability data contains the observed data, the corresponding parameter is added to the confidence interval. Thus, the confidence interval is the collection of parameters for which we cannot rule out the possibility that the parameter has generated the data. This gives a rule such that, if applied repeatedly to similar problems, the 95% confidence interval will contain the true parameter value in 95% of the cases. 95% credible set and 95% confidence set for an example from a negative binomial distribution
