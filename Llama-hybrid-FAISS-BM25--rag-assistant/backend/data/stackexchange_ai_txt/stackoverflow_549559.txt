It's difficult to be sure without seeing the rest of your code or the live site, but this looks like a classic containing-float problem. The simplest way to deal with this is to add overflow: auto to the box which contains your floats (I'm guessing that's .content , here). That should stretch the wallpaper to its proper height. Failing that, try adding the "clearfix" spacer that Logan suggested to the end of your .content div.
