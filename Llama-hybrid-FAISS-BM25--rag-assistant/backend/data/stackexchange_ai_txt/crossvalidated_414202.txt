I understand this question is about two years old, but it was recently poked by Community and so came to my attention. I'd solve this problem using the relationship between a survival function of a non-negative random variable and its expectation. Let $X$ be a non-negative random variable (here $X$ is total sales). Then $EX = \int_0^\infty (1-F(x))\ dx$ , where $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$ denotes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $X$ . From the data you have, we can see that $P(100 \leq X \leq 200) = 1$ (implying $X$ is non-negative). So, we have $$ \begin{aligned} EX &= \int_{0}^{\infty} (1-F(x)) \ dx \\ &= \int_{0}^{200} (1-F(x)) \ dx \qquad \text{(since } 1 - F(x) = P(X > x) = 0 \text{ for } x \geq 200) \\ &= (200 - 0) - \int_{100}^{200} F(x) \ dx \\ &= 200 - \left[\int_{100}^{105} F(x) \ dx + \int_{105}^{110} F(x) \ dx + \dots + \int_{171}^{200} F(x) \ dx \right] \end{aligned} $$ Since we don't know the CDF completely, all we can do is some approximation. A simple (albeit crude) approximation is given by the composite trapezoidal method. Here we approximate each of the above sub-integrals using the Trapezoidal rule , which says that the definite integral $$ \int_{a}^{b} F(x) \, dx \approx (b-a) \cdot \frac{F(a)+F(b)}{2}. $$ So, e.g., $\int_{100}^{105} F(x) \ dx \approx (105 - 100) [F(100) + F(105)]/2 = 5 * (0 + 0.05)/2 = 0.125$ . An R implementation of this approximation scheme is as follows: x Another approximation will be obtained by first linearly interpolating $F$ in $[100, 200]$ based on the data we have, and then doing a numerical integration over that interpolated function. Here is an R implementation based on this interpolation approach: Fx_smooth Edits: Grammar.
