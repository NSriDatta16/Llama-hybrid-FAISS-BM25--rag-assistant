My reading of the SAS text, corresponds with Hyndman and Athansopoulos. In short: Go with Hyndman and Athansopoulos. The first two paragraphs of the SAS text seem to just be talking about regression without any ARMA. The last paragraph of the SAS text seems to correspond to the last paragraph of Hyndman and Athansolpoulos. Regarding the comment: "unwarranted usage [of differencing] can create statistical/econometric nonsense" I am guessing that this is differencing when there is no unit root. Regarding the comment: "while the original series exhibit non-stationarity this does not necessarily imply that differencing is needed in a causal model." I think that this is in line with the second paragraph of Hyndman and Athansopoulos. Note that so far, we have just discussed non-seasonal differencing. There also exists seasonal differencing. There are tests for this such as OCSB, HEGY and Kunst (1997). I recall that D. Osborne once wrote that it is better to seasonally difference when a time series is "on the cusp". So in summary, this should be your approach: Are any of the variable co-integrated? If yes, then those ones should not be differenced Make the non co-integrated variables stationary.
