Model effect of intervention of continuous and cumulative variable

I have a dependent variable dv and an independent variable iv in a timeseries dataset. The iv varies independently from time. Instead, the dv varies not only in a cumulative way but is also equal to zero for a long period. I want to estimate the association between the two variables (and other control variables). I wonder if I can leverage the fact that there is a sort of intervention around 1992 even if the introduction of dv is progressive. What are my options?
