Show Javascript functions in real-time

Is there any tool or addon which can be used for testing or identifying Javascript functions in real time (i.e. on click or some events ).. e.g. on a website, I want to know after clicking on a link, which all JS functions are being called/executed..I know sometimes it is stragightforward from the code, but in case it uses JS libraries like jQuery, the actual function call is made from otside.. How can I do that? * I'll really appreciate if, alongwith the addon, you just write a short description as to where can I find the Javascript finction tracking in that * * Thank you.
