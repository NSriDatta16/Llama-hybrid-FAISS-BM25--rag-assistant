It depends on the problem you are trying to solve, more importantly what these features are representing. Let's say they are representing floors in a building it's okay to map it to [-1, 1] which will help in learning weights quickly. But, if they are representing days of a week then it's difficult for any model trained on this data to identify that 1st day(-1) comes after 7th day(1), and model won't perform well if this information is required to identify/calculate the output. In this case one hot encoder will help, it just gives the model to identify the pattern that event happened on a particular day. and if you pass it like an embedding layer, it might even find the relation b/n days in terms of output(large data required).
