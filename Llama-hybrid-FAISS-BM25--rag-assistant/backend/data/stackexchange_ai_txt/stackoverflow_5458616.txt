A few things come to mind. First, you have maintainAspectRatio to true. This means that the Image's aspect ratio will always be maintained; so even with height and width it may never fill the complete space that is allotted for i. So, an easy way to get the image to fill the whole space is to set maintainAspectRatio to false. I don't think that quite addresses your question, though. How do I get the image to sit on the bottom of the tag? I didn't think you could position the Image within an Image tag, although another poster mentioned using the verticalAlign style; which would be great if it worked. What I would do do is position the image inside a container. Conceptually something like this should work: But, be careful about using data binding inside a renderer. It often leads to a performance drag.
