Can I physically determine the number of factors in Factor Analysis?

I have completed a Factor Analysis on a around 180 responses for a questionnaire with 56 Variables. I got 15 factors using Oblique Rotation PCA. Some of the factors have only two variables of considerable loading. In Social Science - is there any considerations for such situations? Under some factors I have in fact got only 3 variables - this as I understood from reading is good to keep but I read some argue that when it is less than three you just remove such variables. Knowing that I have some factors with less than three variables, instead of removing the variables, can I perhaps determine the number of Factors I want? How to best approach this without compromising the integrity of the data? Any advice please? Please see a snapshot of my SPSS results - Underlined in bold are the variables under the factors in question.
