This isn't a technical answer but: The Daily WTF had a post a while back, describing a guy who wrote the exact type of thing that you are trying to create, the reason it was Daily WTF material is because the generator ended up spitting out things that sounded like curse words. From The Daily WTF - The Automated Curse Generator Markov chains!" he blurted. "We can use statistical textual analysis to generate random words built up from natural phonemic combinations. They won't be real words, but they will match expected English patterns, and people will be able to pronounce and read them completely naturally." I bet if you read that post you will get ideas about how to improve upon what you already have working.
