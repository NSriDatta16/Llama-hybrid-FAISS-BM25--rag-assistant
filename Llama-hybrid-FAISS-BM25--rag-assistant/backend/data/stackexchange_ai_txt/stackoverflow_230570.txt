Like others have said, I think using or not using such a tool is a neutral issue. More to the point: If a regular expression is so complicated that it needs inline comments, it is too complicated. I never comment my regexps. I approach large or complex matching problems by breaking it down into several steps of matching, either with multiple match statements (=~), or by building up a regexp with sub regexps. Having said all that, I think any developer worth his salt should be reasonably proficient in regular expression writing and reading. I've been using regular expressions for years and have never encountered a time where I needed to write or read one that was terrifically complex. But a moderately sized one may be the most elegant and concise way to do a validation or match, and regexps should not be shied away from only because an inexperienced developer may not be able to read it -- better to educate that developer.
