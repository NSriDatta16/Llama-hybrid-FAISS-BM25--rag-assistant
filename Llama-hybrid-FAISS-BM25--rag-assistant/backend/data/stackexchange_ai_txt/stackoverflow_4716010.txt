Dynamically re-reading a midi file

I am writing an app that dynamically creates a midi file which I then want to play. Each time I press a button in my app a new midi file is created and written to external storage. I then want the app to read that file and play it. I am using SoundPool to play the file. However, from the samples I have found, SoundPool is initialized during onCreate and therefore my file is only read once. Meaning the same file is played everytime I hit the button regardless of any changes I make to it. I have tried moving the SoundPool initialisation into my Audio1ButtonHandler method but then I get no sound or get a selection of “sample x not ready” errors. The relevant code from my app is here: public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { ………… soundPool = new SoundPool(1, AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC, 0); soundPoolMap = new HashMap (); soundPoolMap.put(SOUNDPOSITION, soundPool.load("/sdcard/test.mid", 1)); } public void Audio1ButtonHandler(View target) { ArrayList chord = new ArrayList (); chord = Chord.calculateChord(kSelection, cSelection); for (int i = 0; i As you can see I have tried to release the resources (within releaseSound) to try and force them to be re-read but to no avail. Any pointers would be greatly received. Thanks
