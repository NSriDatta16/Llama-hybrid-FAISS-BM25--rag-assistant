creating dojo charts dynamically

Hi I need to create dojo charts in such a manner that they take their series values from certain input boxes and the chart changes automatically.So with this concept I went ahead doing this:- var showChart= function(){ var thevalue=dijit.byId('myvalue').get('value');//gets thevalue from the dijit numbertextbox var chart1 = new dojox.charting.Chart2D("showgoals"); chart1.addPlot("default", {type: "Lines"}); chart1.addAxis("x"); chart1.addAxis("y", {vertical: true}); chart1.addSeries("Series 1", [thevalue, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7]); chart1.render();}; Then I call this function whenever the value changes:- dojo.connect(dojo.byId('myvalue'), "onchange",showChart);//whenever value changes the showChart function is called The html looks like this:- The below is the text box which changes value:- What I wanted was that whenever the value in this input box changes, the function showchart gets called and the present plot is automatically changed to show the new values, but what is happening is that I get a new chart totally, which seems quite natural.. Will I have to destroy the old chart and then recreate the new chart , if so please tell me how.
