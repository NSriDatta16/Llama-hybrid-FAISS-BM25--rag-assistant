Shifted intercepts in logistic regression

I have a question about the effects of shifting the intercept in a logistic fit on the mean of a particular transformation of the scores. Here is the notation I will be using for the question. The logistic regression model is $$ \begin{align} \mathbb{P}[Y_i =1 \mid \boldsymbol{X}_i] &= \dfrac{1}{1+\exp(-\boldsymbol{X}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta})} \\[1em] &\equiv p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \boldsymbol{\beta}) \end{align} $$ where $p$ is the score function. I estimate the parameters of the model, and denote them $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, so that the estimated scores of the model are $p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})$. I am interested in the sample mean of all the estimated scores that cross a certain threshold, $\delta$, say. That is, the quantity $$ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}}{\sum_{i=1}^n\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}} $$ Now suppose that I shift the estimated linear index for all observations by the same quantity $\alpha$, and denote the transformed scores as $$ \begin{align} q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) &= \dfrac{1}{1+\exp(-(\boldsymbol{X}_i'\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}+\alpha))} \\ &= \dfrac{\exp (\alpha)}{\exp (\alpha)+\exp(-\boldsymbol{X}_i'\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})} \end{align} $$ It is easy to see that if $$ \begin{alignat}{2} & \alpha &\geq& 0\\ \implies\,& \exp(\alpha) &\geq& 1\\ \implies\,& q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) &\geq& p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) \\ \implies\,& \sum_{i=1}^n q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\bf{1}_{\left[q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]} &\geq& \sum_{i=1}^n p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}\,\text{and also,}\\ \implies & \sum_{i=1}^n\bf{1}_{\left[q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]} &\geq& \sum_{i=1}^n\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]} \end{alignat} $$ However, since the denominator and the numerator both become larger for the $q$ function, it is hard to tell what will happen to the ratio, $$ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}}{\sum_{i=1}^n\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}} $$ that is $$ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\bf{1}_{\left[q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}}{\sum_{i=1}^n\bf{1}_{\left[q(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}}\overset{?}{\lesseqqgtr} \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}}{\sum_{i=1}^n\bf{1}_{\left[p(\boldsymbol{X}_i; \widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})\geq \delta\right]}}$$ I am pretty sure there is an example like this in Theory of Point Estimation by Lehmann and Casella, for the univariate (non-regression case), but I have been unable to find it. Simulations I decided to simulate the above scenario to see if I could get an intuition for this problem. The data generating process that I have used for generating the data is slightly non-standard, since I wanted to make sure that my simulations were robust to distributional assumptions. It might be useful to try different parameters configurations in choosing the fixed parameters. Here is the R code for the simulations (I would appreciate it if someone could confirm that this code is indeed doing what I think it is). # purpose: simulate logistic regression # date created: 27th October 2012 # comments: # author: # dependencies: faraway library(faraway) # simulation parameters vBeta =5) data sDelta]) # effect the logit transformation on the shifted linear index data$shiftedScores sDelta]) } # plot the two means across simulations matplot(y=mResults, type="l",ylim=c(0.2, 1), xlab="Simulation #", ylab="Estimated statistic") legend(1, 1, c("(mean) truncated scores", "(mean) shifted truncated scores"), cex=0.8, col=c("black","red"), lty=1:2) # count the number of times the shifted scores exceed the older means sum(mResults[,1] > mResults[,2]) This produces the following graph, which seems to indicate that the shifted truncated scores have a higher mean -- although this depends on the shift parameter. I would very much like a theoretical explanation to support these simulation results.
