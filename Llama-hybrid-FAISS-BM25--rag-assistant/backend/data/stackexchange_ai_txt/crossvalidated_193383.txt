How do I compute an average when one of the measurements couldn't be measured?

In my biology class we were doing a lab on respiration rates of peas. We used a respirometer with a small pipet tube (markings up to 1 mL) to measure the volume of gas; by immersing in water, the gas and water would remain separate and the level of water could be measured on the pipet, giving the amount of gas inside and therefore the respiration rates. However, at one point, the water level went beyond the highest mark on the pipet; the peas had used more than 1 mL of air for respiration. Now I'm supposed to find the average gas usage (other class groups did the same thing but none had peas use more than 1 mL of gas). How do I compute the class average? Do I exclude my data point for those trials? In short, I couldn't measure the amount of gas used by peas because they used more than the pipet could measure. Other groups doing the same experiment didn't have this problem, so how do I find the average gas usage?
