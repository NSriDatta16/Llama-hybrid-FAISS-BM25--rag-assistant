Backup Eclipse plugins and settings

I'm using Eclipse and have plenty of plugins installed and configured to my needs. Is there any good way to backup these plugins and the configuration of them. I want to be able to replay these plugins in futures eclipse version (as long as they are compatible) and on different PCs. I know I could simply archive the whole eclipse/ folder, but I find this a little inelegant.
