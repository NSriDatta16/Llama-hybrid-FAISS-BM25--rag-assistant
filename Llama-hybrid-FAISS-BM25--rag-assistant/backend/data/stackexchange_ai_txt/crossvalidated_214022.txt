Subselect Package R - The covariance/total matrix supplied is not symmetric?

I was trying out the Subselect R package to see how it worked and if it would be useful for a logistic regression problem I'm working on. Link to the package. I decided I would follow Example 4 on page 28 to see if I could perform the Anneal function on the glm I previously fit to my data. I used the helper function, glmHmat, to extract the required matrices in the same way sa done in example 4. Fullmodel I then tried the anneal function and got the following error. test Yet, I got this error. Error in validmat(mat, p, tolval, tolsym, allowsingular = FALSE, algorithm) : The covariance/total matrix supplied is not symmetric. Symmetric entries differ by up to 1.02445483207703e-07. So, I thought I would test if this were true: isSymmetric(Hmat$mat,tol=1e-09) [1] TRUE isSymmetric(Hmat$H,tol=1e-09) [1] TRUE So I can't make heads or tails of this error message. Any ideas?
