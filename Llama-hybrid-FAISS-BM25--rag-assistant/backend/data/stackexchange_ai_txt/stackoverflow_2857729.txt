You should take a look into e.AllowedEffect if DragDropEffects.Copy is within the list. Update Some time ago i also had some problems with getting the right format out of the GetDataPresent() . Due to this fact, i just looked directly into the list provided by GetFormats() and did it on myself. The code was something like that: private void OnItemDragEnter(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { //Get the first format out of the list and try to cast it into the //desired type. var list = e.Data.GetData(e.Data.GetFormats()[0]) as IEnumerable ; if (list != null) { e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy; } else { e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None; } } This simple solution works for me, but you could also walk all over the GetFormats() array with linq and try to find your desired type by IEnumerable .OfType () or something similar.
