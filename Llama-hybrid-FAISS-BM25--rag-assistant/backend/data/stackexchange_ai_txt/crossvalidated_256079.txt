If you're using word embeddings to encode the texual responses, you could simply encode the numerical responses as an additional feature. For example, instead of having a feature vector with dimension $d$, where $d$ is the dimension of each word vector, you would append the numerical response to make a new feature vector with dimension $d+1$.
