Please see the scoring documentation in Lucene's Similarity API . My bet is on the difference in idf between the two cases (both numDocs and docFreq are different). In order to know for sure, use the explain() function to debug the scores. Edit: A code fragment for getting explanations: TopDocs hits = searcher.search(query, searchFilter, max); ScoreDoc[] scoreDocs = hits.scoreDocs; for (ScoreDoc scoreDoc : scoreDocs) { String explanation = searcher.explain(query, scoreDoc.doc).toString(); Log.debug(explanation); }
