Xcode - No provisioned iOS device is connected

I was using Xcode this afternoon and debugging an app on my device just fine. When I got home from the office and plugged in my phone to keep working, XCode would no longer let me debug on my device. The error I received was: Error Starting Executable. No provisioned iOS device is connected. So I hopped over to the Organizer, and here is what I saw: So what gives? Anyone seen this before? Thanks!
