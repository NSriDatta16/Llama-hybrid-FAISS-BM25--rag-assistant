Increase the storage space in Android emulator? (Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE)

I am creating an Android application. My Application has audio and png files which i have saved in res/drawable folder. When I run the app , its giving error Installation error: INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE and in the logcat it says - ERROR/PackageManager(54): Couldn't copy package file to temp file. I tried creating new avd also.But i am getting the same error. I want all those png and audio files. I don't want to store them in sdcard.
