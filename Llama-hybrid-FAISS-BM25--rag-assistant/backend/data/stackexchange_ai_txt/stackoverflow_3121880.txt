If you average 5 drifting clocks, the only thing you get is another drifting clock that's harder to correct. It won't be more precise. NTP uses multiple servers to increase precision because it takes network latency into account. Since all your systems are on a fast local network, you just need one server. Set up two systems to be NTP server, one a primary, and if you feel the need, one a backup. Have all other systems synchronize to them. This will be significantly easier to set up than the clock-averaging solution, and you won't have to develop any crazy scripts.
