Essentially, no. It requires some sort of storage on the client side; you have no way to know who a client is without a cookie (or similar, like HTML 5 client-side storage). That is a trade-off you must decide. Minimum, the old password or some other form of confirmation (e-mail?) should be required to change it to a new one. You can't absolutely protect against cookie theft and subsequent impersonation unless you encrypt all the communications. That's the only secure method. Sure, associating an IP, user-agent etc. to the cookie might be helpful, but it's easier and much more secure to rely on encryption. (I misunderstood the point here -- what's important in the value of the cookie is that it's random, so you ought to change your generational method to be less predictable)
