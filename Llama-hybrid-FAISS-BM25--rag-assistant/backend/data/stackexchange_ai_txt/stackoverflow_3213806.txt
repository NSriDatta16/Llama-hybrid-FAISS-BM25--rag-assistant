I had the same issue and got some nice feedback in the developer forum. Quinn - The Eskimo from Apple: As an aside, cancelling a network small transfer because something has scrolled off the screen is probably a performance negative. For small transfers, it's usually more efficient to let it run to completion (and cache the results in case they're needed in the future). This is because of the way that NSURLConnection manages HTTP connection reuse. If you cancel a transfer, NSURLConnection has to either a) drop the underlying HTTP connection on the floor, which means it can't be reused, or b) continue reading and just junk the data. Neither of this is the best use of resources. Share and Enjoy -- Quinn "The Eskimo!" So, I'm not cancelling all the ImageDownload Operation, but rather only start them, when the user stops scrolling. Up to then only a placeholder is shown: - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UITableView *) tableView { self.dragging = TRUE; } - (void) scrollViewDidEndDragging: (UITableView *) tableView willDecelerate: (BOOL) decelerate { if(!decelerate && self.dragging) [self loadThumbsForVisibleCells]; else self.dragging = FALSE; } - (void) scrollViewDidEndDecelerating: (UITableView *) tableView { [self loadThumbsForVisibleCells]; } Hope this helps!
