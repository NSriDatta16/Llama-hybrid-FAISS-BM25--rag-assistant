What are Design patterns useful for Notification system?

Some explanation: there are several machines(hosts) that need to be notified about any changes of some data on certain resource machine. Resource machine all time checks data and if any changes were made it notified all listeners. As I understand I should use Observer pattern, May be Absrtact Factory for generalization, What else? As I understand Resource machine should use as server(java.net.serversocket) as client(java.net.socket) to sending special messages to listeners and getting request? And all other machines need to use as server(to recieving messages about any changes of data) as client(to sending request to get new data). Am I right? And may be you can explain me any other sides of realization notification systems? Probably it's useful using JMX, but I think it's too gargantuan for this problem?
