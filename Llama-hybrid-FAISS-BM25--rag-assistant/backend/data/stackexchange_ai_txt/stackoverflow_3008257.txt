This will do it. It can be made more elegant if there are more restrictions you can put on the variations. COMP = compiler OBJECTS = file1 \ file2 \ file3 \ file4 \ file5 \ file6 \ file7 \ file8 \ file9 \ file10 # This isn't terribly elegant, but it is quite general. # If the variations you have in mind are more regular, such as # changing only file5 and file9 for all executables, then there # are tidier ways to do it. OBJECTS1 := $(OBJECTS) OBJECTS1 := $(patsubst file5,file5_s1,$(OBJECTS1)) OBJECTS1 := $(patsubst file9,file9_s1,$(OBJECTS1)) OBJECTS2 := $(OBJECTS) OBJECTS2 := $(patsubst file5,file5_s2,$(OBJECTS2)) OBJECTS2 := $(patsubst file9,file9_s2,$(OBJECTS2)) all: bin/executable_s1 bin/executable_s2 # It looks a little clumsy to include the path in the target, # but the idea is that the target should be what it's actually making, # which is bin/executable_s1, not executable_s1. bin/executable_s1: $(OBJECTS1) bin/executable_s2: $(OBJECTS2) bin/executable_%: $(COMP) $^ -o $@
