Adding sub-directory to "View/Shared" folder in ASP.Net MVC and calling the view

I'm currently developing a site using ASP.Net MVC3 with Razor. Inside the "View/Shared" folder, I want to add a subfolder called "Partials" where I can place all of my partial views (for the sake of organizing the site better. I can do this without a problem as long as I always reference the "Partials" folder when calling the views (using Razor): @Html.Partial("Partials/{ViewName}") My question is if there is a way to add the "Partials" folder to the list that .Net goes through when searching for a view, this way I can call my view without having to reference the "Partials" folder, like so: @Html.Partial("{ViewName}") Thanks for the help!
