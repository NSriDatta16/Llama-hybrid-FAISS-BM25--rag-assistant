How can I create custom HTML5 video controls?

I'm interested in building a custom video player in HTML5. I have no problem embedding html5 video media utilizing the dual format of Ogg and h.264. My main issue is in referencing the API for the video tag element. What properties and event listeners do I have access to via javascript?
