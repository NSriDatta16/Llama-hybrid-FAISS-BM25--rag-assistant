Regression With ARMA Errors - Cochrane Orcutt Procedure

I am using the Cochrane.orcutt procedure to do a time series analysis. I did the initial regression with the lm function, and then past the result to Cochrane.orcutt . reg |t|) XB(Intercept) 0.39347 0.09500 4.142 0.00252 ** XBdata$Y_Lag1 1.05427 0.09556 11.033 1.57e-06 *** XBdata$X1 -3.16739 0.80754 -3.922 0.00350 ** XBdata$X2 -3.30504 0.86569 -3.818 0.00410 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.447 on 9 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.9451, Adjusted R-squared: 0.9208 F-statistic: 38.76 on 4 and 9 DF, p-value: 1.115e-05 $rho [1] -0.6855955 $number.interaction [1] 8 I am doing a time series with regressors. Y_t = a + b*Y_t-1 +c*X1_t +d*X2_t I just have a few questions. This Cochrane procedure looks like it gives back a list, not a lm. I want to plot the fitted vs actuals, and also use the predict function. The code below gives an error (whereas it works on stuff from "lm") plot(data$Y,col="red") lines(data$Y) lines(fitted(regfinal),col="blue") Is what I am doing with the regression correct for a theory point of view? That is, including in the lagged value of the response? I am new to Regression with ARMA errors. I have seen somewhere that you are supposed to run the standard regression with only the predictors (no Y_Lag1), and then you get the residuals and you build a model with it. The problem is, when I exclude Y_Lag1 from my lm, the significance of everything else drops away: Coefficients: Estimate Std.
