Not entirely sue what you mean. the FLOT Documentation states: The time series support in Flot is based on Javascript timestamps, i.e. everywhere a time value is expected or handed over, a Javascript timestamp number is used. This is a number, not a Date object. A Javascript timestamp is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC. This is almost the same as Unix timestamps, except it's in milliseconds, so remember to multiply by 1000! So, to get the weeks, divide the number by 604800000 (1000*60*60*24*7), and then round. If 1291590000000 is your starting point then substract it your current number (remembering to add 1 if you are treating this as week '1') var start = 1291590000000; var sometime = 1292590000000; var weekMillis = 604800000 var weeks = 1 + Math.round((sometime-start)/weekMillis); alert(weeks ); Mocked up at: http://jsfiddle.net/6XDKT/1/
