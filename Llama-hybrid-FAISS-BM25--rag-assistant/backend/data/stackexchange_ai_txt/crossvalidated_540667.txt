K-L divergence could indeed be used to compare the two distributions of values. However, I usually prefer the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which has nice properties. When you do that, you are taking the time out of the time series. It would not notice the relationship between these two: 1,1,2,1,2 3,3,4,3,4 but perhaps that is not what you care about.
