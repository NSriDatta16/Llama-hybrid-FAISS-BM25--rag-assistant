How can I get NSScrollView to respect a clipping path

I am trying to make a NSScrollView with clipped corners, similar to the Twitter app: I have a NSScrollView subclass which I added the following code: - (void)drawRect:(NSRect)dirtyRect { NSBezierPath *pcath = [NSBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:[self bounds] xRadius:kDefaultCornerRadius yRadius:kDefaultCornerRadius]; [path setClip]; [super drawRect:dirtyRect]; } I expected the content of the NSScrollView to have rounded corners, but it is not respecting the clipped path. How can I do this? UPDATE & CLARIFICATION I know how to make a custom NSScroller , I know how to make it transparent overlay. All I am asking is how to make the NSSCrollView clip its corners, including everything it contains. The NSScrollView is inside a NSView which has a background that could change, meaning a view overlay to fake the rounded corners is not an option.
