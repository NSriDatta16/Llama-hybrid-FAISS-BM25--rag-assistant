Linearity vs. nonlinearity might be a red herring. The actual problem might be with bounding the predictions to lie within $(0,1)$ . The nnet function of the nnet package uses a sigmoid transformation in the output layer by default; see the argument linout = FALSE of nnet . This is what you need for modelling probabilities, which is what people often do when using a neural network for binary classification. This makes the fitted values lie within $(0,1)$ . But you are doing regression, so you do not want that. Try supplying linout = TRUE as an additional argument to the nnet function. This will remove the sigmoid transformation from the output layer and thus allow for fitted values outside the $(0,1)$ range.
