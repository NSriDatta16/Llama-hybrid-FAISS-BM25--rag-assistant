I don't think the split half reliability is the best approach here. The problem with SHR is, as you say, that you can get a different value according to how you split. Coefficient (Cronbach's) alpha is the average of all the possible split half correlations (it's also a form of ICC). You can calculate the standard error and do a t-test, or you can use a bootstrap, to compare them.
