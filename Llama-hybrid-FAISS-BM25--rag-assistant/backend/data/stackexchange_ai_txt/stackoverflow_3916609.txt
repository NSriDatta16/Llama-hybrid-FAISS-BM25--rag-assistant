Generally, are string (or varchar) fields used as join fields?

We have two tables. The first contains a name (varchar) field. The second contains a field that references the name field from the first table. This foreign key in the second table will be repeated for every row associated with that name. Is it generally discouraged to use a varchar/string field as a join between two tables? When is the best case where a string field can be used as a join field?
