Bayesian Inference: Conceptual question to get evidence

currently I am trying to implement a prototype for the following problem. I have data for machines, which sends me how long they have operated in seconds. Further, they have one sensor, which might have a value. So it would look like this Duration Sensor Value 37 - - 31 se1 A 12 - - 29 se1 A 140 se1 A,B,C normally, I would expect the sensor to have small variation, but the longer the duration is, the more variation would be expected. In my toy example, I would expect my sensor se1 to have 1 value for average duration, but it would be ok to have 3 distinct values if the duration is significantly longer. Now, I would like to model it as a Bayesian problem X := number of distinct values for sensor se1 Y := duration length in seconds P(X = x | Y = y) would be my inference such as " how probable is it to get 3 distinct values for a duration of 140 seconds? " My approach is from the full dataset estimate P(X) e.g. via scipy.fit() from the full dataset estimate P(Y) e.g. via scipy.fit() now filter the dataset, such that only observations of se1 are in the filtered set. Consider it as evidence and estimate P(Y | X) from it. use Bayes Theorem to calculate P(X | Y) I am not so sure about the 3) Do I have to filter for "se1 present" or do I have to filter for "se1 has 1 distinct value" then fit, "se1 has 2 distinct values" and fit again, etc.? EDIT: Following the ideas from the answer below I have looked into the relationship of duration and occurrence of values: It is clear that a certain duration is required for higher count of distinct values, but it is not the linear relationship as proposed (I know only as example) in the answer. Any ideas how I could model this?
