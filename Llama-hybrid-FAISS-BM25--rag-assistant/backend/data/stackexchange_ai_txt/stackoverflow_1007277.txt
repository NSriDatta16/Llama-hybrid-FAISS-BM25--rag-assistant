.Net: Logical thread and Thread Local Storage?

I'm reading about the CallContext class ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.remoting.messaging.callcontext.aspx ). The documentation says something about "logical threads" and "Thread Local Storage". What's a logical thread, I didn't know that there existed multiple kinds of threads? What's a Thread Local Storage, is it a class or a principle of some kind? I have not been able to find it in on MSDN, but I'm sure it is there some place, so any links would be great :-)
