Design question: 'generic application/process' for multiple clients, which will turn out to be full of 'but's'

i'm about to create an app for my client. Multiple clients of him (of my client) will login to that app and do the same thing. So in that view, we have a 'generic app': written once, suits every clients needs. But, before the first line of code is written, we have offcourse the first exception: when client A does action A, you have to do the same as for clients B, C and D, but also..... And of course, we can wait for more of that kind of modifications of the first thought out 'one flow for all'. No problem, can't foresee all, and source code is flexible. But, i foresee my source code with all kinds of if statements: if (client == "a") { SetEndDate(+1); } else if (client == "b") { SetEndDate(+10); } else //no enddate modification needed for other clients if (client == "d" || client == "E" ) { DoExtraCheck1(); } else if (client = "b") { if ( DoExtraCheck1()) { DoExtraCheck2(); } } else //no checking needed for other clients and i'm getting scared of that! What could be a nice elegant solution to streamline this? Next thing to solve is of course if the UI also changes between clients, but that is for the V2 question :)
