Images in email: link or embed?

I noticed that almost all email messages I get do not embed images, but link them from the http instead (and they get blocked by default of course). I'm sending HTML email for my service and can easily embed images to create better visual experience. Is there particular reason not do so? Why everybody else is linking instead of embedding?
