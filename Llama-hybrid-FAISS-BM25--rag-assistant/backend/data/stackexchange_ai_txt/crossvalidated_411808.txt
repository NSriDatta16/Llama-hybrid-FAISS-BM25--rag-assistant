R: Finding average point and SD of intersection for multiple lines

I have a set of ~87 lines that are described by linear equations (y=ax+b). (These lines are fitted from OLS regression). I want to find the average point of intersection for the lines and (since there is no single point) the standard deviation of this point. So far I have used a brute-force approach: calculate all pairwise intersection points and calculate the mean. I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution.
