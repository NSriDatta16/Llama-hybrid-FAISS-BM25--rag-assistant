I assume from your question that you want some form of persistent storage to the local file system of the machine your application runs on. In addition to that, you need to decide on how the data in your application is to be used, and the volume of it. Do you need a database? Are you going to be searching the data different fields? Do you need a query language? Is the data small enough to fit in to a simple data structure in memory? How resilient does it need to be? The answers to these types of questions will help lead to the correct choice of storage. It could be that all you need is a simple CSV file, XML or similar. There are a host of lightweight databases such as SQLite, Berkelely DB, JavaDB etc - but whether or not you need the power of a database is up to your requirements.
