Regressing Logistic Regression Residuals on other Regressors

With OLS regression applied to continuous response, one can build up the multiple regression equation by sequentially running regressions of the residuals on each covariate. My question is, is there a way to do this with logistic regression via logistic regression residuals ? That is, if I want to estimate $\Pr(Y = 1 | x, z)$ using the standard generalized linear modeling approach, is there a way to run logistic regression against $x$ and get pseudo-residuals $R_1$ , then regress $R_1$ on $z$ to get an unbiased estimator of the logistic regression coefficients. References to textbooks or literature would be appreciated.
