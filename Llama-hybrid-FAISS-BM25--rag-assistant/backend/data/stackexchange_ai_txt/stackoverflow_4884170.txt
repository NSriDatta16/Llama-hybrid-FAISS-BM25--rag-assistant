First of all, I have to say that this is a very interesting question. As far as i know, it isn't a good idea loading data from migrations. Generally speaking you should use db/seeds.rb for data loading in your db and I think it could be a good idea to write a little class helper to put in your lib dir and then call it from db/seeds.rb. I image you could organize you files in the following way: lib/data_loader.rb lib/years/2009.rb lib/years/2010.rb Obviously, you should clear your migrations and write code for lib/data_loader.rb in the way you should prefer but I was only trying to offer a general idea of how I'd organize my code if I have to face a problem like that. I'm not sure I've replied to your question in a way that helps but I hope it does.
