What is a great deception? It could be defined as a believable set of information aiming to a final deceitful objective. Just like any RL model, you can maximize a score thanks to small rewards leading to bad directions, and a great reward if the final reward is reached (ex: great loss of money). As a consequence, you have to make sure that steps could be measured as much as possible, which is the case in NLP environment with positive or negative reactions. Then, you can have a negative reward if the user goes in the right direction, a positive reward if the user goes in the wrong one, a very negative reward if the user detect the deception and goes away, and a very positive one if the user falls in the trap. Like most RL applications, it could require some loss (ex. saying sometimes the truth in order to gain confidence), and then reach the best score (ex. big lie). Such behavior exists in war strategy or in finance, i.e. leading the ennemies to defeat thanks to a mix of true and false/partial information.
