Use cellular emulator with a REAL WinMo device?

I don't whether this is even possible which is obviously why I am asking this question :) Is it in any way possible to leverage functionality the Cellular Emulator on a REAL PHYSICAL device?? :) So when I test it on my device, I really do not have to send real SMS(s) to test my MessageInteceptor. On a sidenote, why does MessageInteceptor fails after several messages to intercept messages?? :( Thanx a lot in advance :)
