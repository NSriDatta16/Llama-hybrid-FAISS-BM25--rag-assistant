I think one of the main problems with PCA is the PC itself is a very abstract idea that doesn't map well to anything in the real world. To someone non-technical, it lacks a reference point and it does not generate an insight that is readily actionable (i.e.,"Sales would improve if we change the colour of the font to blue") As such, I'd suggest that you focus on the storytelling (e.g., the what?, so what?, and now what? framework, etc.), and only elaborate on what PCA is when asked. For instance: What: We build a prediction model based on web traffic to predict sales. So what: The model shows that, if we do xyz xyz and increase xyz by xyz, the sales could potentially increase by xyz. Now what: We should validate such hypothesis by running a controlled test, blah blah blah. If it works, we should adopt the new process.
