I have no experience with py2exe but a quick google search found this , if embedding icons in exe files was what you asked for. If you want to create .ico files, I'd really suggest you search for a icon designer or finished icons. Sure you can create a Win 3.x style icon fairly easy by creating a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 px image in paint, and rename it to .ico. But to create modern multi resolution icons for windows is a lot more complicated. (I was about to ask what OS you was compiling for, when I realized "exe" sounds very windows, and sure enough...)
