Machine learning usually uses sets of past data to create patterns and predictions on future data. For instance, manually categorizing previous letters that people have drawn in the training stage in order to detect what letter someone is drawing. As far as I know, maxmin doesn't have any sort of training based on past data, so wouldn't really fall into machine learning. (This sounds like a homework question though, you might want to check your text book's definition of machine learning to be sure).
