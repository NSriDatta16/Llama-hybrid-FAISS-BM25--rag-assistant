How would you calculate average time to make a breath?

Suppose I wanted to know a one minute average of the time it takes to make a breath. So basically I would record the number of times I made a breath during one minute (one inhale and one exhale) and divide by 60 seconds to get the 1 minute average time to make a single breath? Would this be a distribution with a standard deviation?
