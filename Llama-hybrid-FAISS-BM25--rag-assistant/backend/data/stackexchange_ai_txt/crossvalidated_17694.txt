I would suggest using random model in this case. In my opinion to allow for within and across subjects variability it is better to consider it as a hierarchical modelling. The first level allows for within subjects variation and the second level allows for across subjects variation. To clarify, in the first level you try to find the average for within subject variation and assume and the second level will detect the relationship across subject taking the within variation into account. Such that: level 1: (An average for A effect on x with within- x variation) xi|A ~ (x, var(within)) level 2: (The average effect of x on Y by taking within-subject variation into account) Y|x ~(Mean (x), var(across)+var(within))
