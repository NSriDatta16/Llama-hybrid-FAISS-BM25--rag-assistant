Showing the sample mean is a sufficient statistics from an exponential distribution

Suppose that the lifelengths ( in thousands of hours) of light bulbs are distributed Exponential( $\theta$ ), where $\theta>0$ is unknown. If we observe $\overline x = 5.2$ for a sample of $20$ light bulbs, record a representative likelihood function. Why is it that we only need to observe the sample average to obtain a representative likelihood? The likelihood is pretty straightforward to find: $$L(\theta \mid x_1,\ldots,x_{20})=\prod_{i=1}^{20}\theta e^{-\theta \overline x} = \theta^{20}e^{-20 \theta \overline x}$$ I am having an issue showing this is a sufficient statistic however, as I cannot seem to factor it in the form of $h(\overline x)g_\theta (T(\overline x))$
