This sounds like a reasonable application of Kendall's W. It's important to understand how the statistic works. It is related to Friedman's test, and sometimes the examples for Friedman's test you'll find are more useful than for Kendall's W. In the following example, the raters are labeled a thru h. The result is a small p-value (which should be the same as that for Friedman's test), and a large Kendall's W (0.599). This is because raters tended to rate Burning.man higher or equal than IKEA, and rated IKEA higher or equal to Disneyland. Note that the statistic treats the raters as blocks, so, essentially, what's important is the rating for each organization within each rater, (not the absolute scores for each organization as if you had independent observation as if you were using Kruskal-Wallis). A toy example in R: if(!require(DescTools)){install.packages("DescTools")} Input =(" Organization a b c d e f g h Disneyland 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 6 IKEA 2 3 4 5 6 6 6 6 Burning.man 3 4 5 6 6 6 6 6 ") Matrix = as.matrix(read.table(textConnection(Input), header=TRUE, row.names=1)) Matrix library(DescTools) KendallW(Matrix, correct=TRUE, test=TRUE) ### Kendall's coefficient of concordance Wt ### data: Matrix ### Kendall chi-squared = 9.5789, df = 2, subjects = 3, raters = 8, p-value = 0.008317 ### alternative hypothesis: Wt is greater 0 ### sample estimates: ### Wt ### 0.5986842
