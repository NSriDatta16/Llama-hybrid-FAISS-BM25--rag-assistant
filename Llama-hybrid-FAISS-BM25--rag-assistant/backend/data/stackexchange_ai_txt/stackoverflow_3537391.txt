C Queue programming problem

I'm learning queues from a book. The author explains the operation of inserting an element in queue using the following code. #define MAX 100 char *p[MAX]; int spos = 0; // spos: holds the index of the **next free** storage location int rpos = 0;// rpos: holds the index of the next item to retrieve void qstore(char *q) { if(spos==MAX) { printf("List Full\n"); return; } p[spos] = q; spos++; } So according to the above code, a queue is full if spos =100 i.e the last element in the array. Now, since spos holds the index of the next free storage location, then when spos =100, the last position in the array is empty. So why is it explained as List full ? Shouldn't this code be modified such that it allows the last position in the array to be filled or am I missing something very obvious? Thanks.
