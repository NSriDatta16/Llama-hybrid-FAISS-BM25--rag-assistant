Panel data OLS regression: plot and quadratic fitting line

I am conducting an OLS regression panel data analysis with package PLM in R. I use the following script to obtain a plot and fitting line of variables D and GDPCAP: yhat $fitted plot(mydata$ GDPCAP, mydata $D, pch=19, xlab="GDPCAP", ylab="D") abline(lm(mydata$ D~mydata$G),lwd=3, col="red") Is there any script that can fit a quadratic line as well as provide the quadratic equation coefficients of the line?
