openCV 2.2 createButton LNK 2019 error in Visual Studio 2010

I've been trying to use openCV 2.2's new Qt functions (See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/qt_new_functions.html#index-1384 ) for a project but I keep getting the error: 1> main.cpp 1>main.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "void __cdecl cv::displayStatusBar(class std::basic_string,class std::allocator > const &,class std::basic_string,class std::allocator > const &,int)" (?displayStatusBar@cv@@YAXABV?$basic_string@DU?$char_traits@D@std@@V?$allocator@D@2@@std@@0H@Z) referenced in function _main 1>C:\Documents and Settings\Orange\my documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\FYP\FYP.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals I'm using Visual Studio 2010, windows xp, qt 4.7.1 and openCV 2.2. I have already added the core lib files for both openCV and qt in my project settings under properties>Linker>Input. I have tried compiling and running openCV code without experiencing any problem except when I tried to use the new Qt functions such as displayStatusBar(...) and createButton(...). I've been searching for a solution for a couple of days now and I still could not find one possibly because openCV2.2 was released only recently. Has anyone tried and encountered this problem and have a solution? Btw the reason I want to use the openCV provided functions for creating simple windows and buttons instead of qt is because I wish to avoid having to convert between the Mat data type in openCV and QImage in Qt. Thanks in advance to any replies. Attached code: #include #include using namespace cv; int main() { namedWindow("Test", CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE); // ... // Code links without problem when the following line is commented out. displayStatusBar("Test", "Hello World", 5000); return 0; }
