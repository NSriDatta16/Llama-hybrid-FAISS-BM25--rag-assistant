You can also take a look at here for the labels in the imagenet. I guess you are right, there is no label for human in the data-set but there is something to notice. There are labels in imagenet like cowboy or some specific hats and other related things to human like shirt and t-shirt. You can take a look at here and also here . In the latter link Yosinski et al, has tried to show that the popular AlexNet has learned to recognize human faces although there is no label as human face in the imagenet data-set. In their paper, they have investigated that Convolutional neural networks may try to learn things that are distributed among layers or maybe not and they may not have special label in the training data. As an example, the face of cats and humans can be referred to. Moreover, as you can see here maybe the aim was attribute learning in large-scale datasets , as quoted in the last line of the page, as the reference.
