Unbalanced linear mixed effect modeling for longitudinal data with lme4

I'm new to longitudinal analyses, and I'm having trouble formulating a model that accurately reflects my study design. This study recruited subjects for two groups (dx vs. control), with measurements taken for each subject at three different timepoints. Age at baseline varied from subject to subject; from what I've read, this means the design is "unbalanced." My data frame is organized such that if row n reads: [subject_ID = x, baseline_age = y, Group = 1, Timepoint = 1, DV = k] then row n+1 reads: [subject_ID = x, baseline_age = y, Group = 1, Timepoint = 2, DV = m] I'm interested in relationships between baseline_age , timepoint , and Group . If baseline_age weren't a factor, I think the R code would be as follows: mod1 where (timepoint | subject_ID) reflects the fact that timepoint varies at the individual level. However, assuming the above is correct, my confusion arises when I try to model random effects with baseline_age entered into the equation. Since baseline_age and subject_ID are perfectly correlated, would it be possible to use baseline_age as proxy for subject_ID in lmer ? Or should I model a second random effect? Specifically, I'm considering the following three-way interaction model: mod2
