Detecting data on a stamp image is no easy tasks, they are designed to be at least complicated to fake and have a large variation. Problems are: Not all data will be available on the stamp; It might be in multiple languages (so you would need a multi-alphabet OCR algorithm); Cities on the world might have the same name; Currency might not be indicated. If you have a dataset with all possible stamps, that reduces to a image registration problem which can be solved with classical computer vision (no machine learning). ML can do it too, just using the same architectures used for facial recognition that accepts new registries.
