Yes, this is a bad idea. You want to alternate between social data and rating data examples. If you alternate the datasets instead of alternating each example, then the learned weights will probably not converge. You can imagine if you trained a neural network to classify dogs and cats, but fed all the dog images first, then all the cat images, then back to dog images, etc, then the network would go back and forth between classifying everything as dogs and classifying everything as cats. Same idea here.
