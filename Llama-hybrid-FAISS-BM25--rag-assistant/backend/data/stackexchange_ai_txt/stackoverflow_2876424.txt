HTML Double Click Selection Oddity

I didn't post this on DocType because it's not really a design thing, the visual representation isn't my problem, the behaviour is. I'm sorry if this is misplaced but I don't feel it's a designer issue. The following DOM: SKU: 123123 ILC: asdasdasdasd Or SKU: 123123 ILC: asdasdasdasd Or SKU: 123123 ILC: asdasdasdasd All present me an odd problem in IE 6 IE 7 Firefox 3.x Chrome But not in IE 8 When you double click '123123' after 'SKU:', it selects '123123' AND 'ILC:' from the next dom element. Take any text on this page (here in SO), double click a word, it only selects THAT WORD , even in the middle of a paragraph. These examples have dom elements closing them, anyone know why this is happening. My fellow employees use the 'double click' mechanism to select the relevant product ID's to do their job, and this dosen't make sense to me what soever.
