jQuery operates on client side, while session is a server-side construct. You'll need to check with your HTTP server (whatever technology you're using) for it. If you aren't posting it to the server, you can use cookies for persistent client-side storage. Or, if you're not reloading the page, you can store it in regular javascript variables.
