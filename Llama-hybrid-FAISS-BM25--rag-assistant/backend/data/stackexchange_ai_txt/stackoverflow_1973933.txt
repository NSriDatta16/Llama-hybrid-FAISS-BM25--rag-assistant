Opinions on MSDeploy

You know, the next "big" and "enterprisey" thing from Microsoft. Is it just me, or is it really hardly for humans? Main highlights are (IMO): Absolutely cryptic syntax ( -skip:objectName=filePath,absolutePath=App_Offline.* just for skipping App_Offline.html ) Manifest as an after thought Lack of thorough documentation Not a word about extensibility (except for several blog posts out there). Moreover, all these extensions developed in great pains have to be registered in GAC and registry Waaay too low-level (metadata/metakey; all this IIS jazz) No integration with MSBuild Granted, MSDeploy and MSDeployAgent are quite powerful, but do they really need to be that complex for relatively simple tasks?
