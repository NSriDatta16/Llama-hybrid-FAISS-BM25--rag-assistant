Embedding and Displaying chinese/japanese

I have been working on a subtitles engine for flash/flv video player. On my Mac everything is great, nice aliased glyphs, displaying all the characters, etc. Switch to windows, it all goes out the window. Some machines with Eastern Characters enabled display fine, but I can't guarantee all users will have this option selected. I am using the TLFTextField, I am pulling in UTF-8 XML with Chinese/Japanese characters. I have tried embedding the (required fonts/glyphs) but pushes the file size up massively. I have also tried changing it to unicode, with no joy. Has anyone got any experience with displaying these characters while maintaining a low file size.
