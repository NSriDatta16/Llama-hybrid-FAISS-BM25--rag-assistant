ToggleButton Control VisualStateManager: Handling Multiple Hover States

In reference to a previous question I had ( Silverlight MVVM Confusion: Updating Image Based on State ) I started with a new approach. I left the existing question because I didn't want to say for sure my new approach was the correct answer (I still welcome comments on my original problem). If you read my previous question, please feel free to skip this paragraph: I'm trying to build a control that provides functionality similar to an audio play button. When the app is in its "Play" mode, the app should display the "Pause.png" image. When it's paused, it should display the "Play.png" image. There are also two additional images to account for either state for when a user hovers over the control (e.g., "Play_Hover.png" and "Pause_Hover.png"). The state is determined by the an IsPlaying property in my view model. I decide to use a ToggleButton to determine which image to display based on the current status. Remember, when IsPlaying is false, the play button is displayed and when it's true, the pause button is displayed. As such, I came up with the following XAML. It works except for the hovers: Visible Collapsed Visible Collapsed How do you have different hover images for both states? If I add a Hover state to the CommonStates group, I'll be able to account for hover of only one of the states (checked or unchecked).
