The table on the page that Yoni references describes the various screen sizes and resolutions that are currently available. Check the best practices on the same page: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#screen-independence If you follow the steps mentioned there, you shouldn't have any trouble. If you have set the resources up correctly (i.e., using dip rather than px), resources will scale, so you do not necessarily require different size resources (though you may want them in order to keep things looking nice). I'd suggest using either mdpi/hdpi or normal/large for your resources - having both is overkill.
