My initial idea then is to use some sort of stacking to combine RF with some linear or polynomial model Random Forest is not a proper tool for this. I would try Gaussian Process, trying Neural Network and Squared Exponential kernels, modelling the mean as a linear function. See the lower three charts in an example from Golding & Purse 2016 : Surely there's much more you can achieve with Gaussian Processes, you can write any formula and design any kernel functions for your purpose and then test them. A second point is: Are there alternatives to this issue, maybe neural networks or different models that could extrapolate to a certain point, so then I could validate the behaviour and decide if it is realistic or not? In extrapolation, you are entering the territory which is totally uknown to you. You need to make some assumptions about it. You need to have a model of the data that will tell you what happens beyond the range of your data. The question then is how much that model is valid. You could do a crossvalidation by cutting of some of your data at the edges and using them as a validation data, and then assume that the data will behave the same outside of your data range. Of course, this assumption might be wrong, but you need to make some, when you are predicting about an unknown territory.
