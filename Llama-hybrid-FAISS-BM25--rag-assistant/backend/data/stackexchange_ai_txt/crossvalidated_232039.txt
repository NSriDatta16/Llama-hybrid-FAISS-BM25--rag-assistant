Binary logistic regression is a generalized linear model with the Bernoulli distribution. The Bernoulli distribution is just a special case of the binomial distribution. So they're not "the same" necessarily, but one is a special case of the other. This is why in R there is no Bernoulli option in the glm() function. You use binomial for both binary data and binomial count data.
