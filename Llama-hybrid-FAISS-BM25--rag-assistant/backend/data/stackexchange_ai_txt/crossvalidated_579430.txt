Splitting medical dataset by patient

I am currently trying to train a CNN model to classify CT-scans. I split the dataset using K-fold cross-validation and since the dataset I am using contains multiple slices per patient, I split the dataset by patient ID. The problem is that since the number of slices corresponding to each patient varies, spliting by patient creates folds that are not balanced. How can I deal with this problem? Is removing images so that all patients have the same number of images a good idea? Thank you in advance.
