Distance measure in KNN regression

I am currently reading up on KNN-regression. As I understand it the value of a given response variable $y_{i}$ at some point $(x_{1,i}, x_{2,i}, x_{3,i}...)$ is estimated as the average over the k-nearest neighbor values: $$ y_{i} = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j}^{k}y_{j} \ \ \ \ (1), $$ with the nearest neighbors determined as those with the smallest generalized euclidean distances to the query point, i.e. $$ D_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_{1,i} - x_{1,j})^2 + (x_{2,i} - x_{2,j})^2 + (x_{3,i} - x_{3,j})^2 + ...}. (2) $$ In a real world example the covariates might reflect different properties which are not equally important for explaining the value of the response variable. In the example of predicting a property price, where the covariates are location, building age, building size etc. I might for instance expect that the location should weight more heavily in the distance measure than the building size. Is there a generalized version of KNN, which takes this into account? I am thinking of something along the lines of each term in (2) being scales by some weight $w_{j}$ , which should be determined by the algorithm. I hope the question makes sense!
