According to http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/forms/file.html#filter , although there is support in the input tag to give the browser a hint for the type of file you want to upload in the form of the accept attribute, very few if any browsers actually pay attention to this attribute when presenting the upload dialog. It's sad, because this attribute's been around for quite a while. I agree with Sky Sanders on this one. Use a flash uploader if you want to provide a file filter.
