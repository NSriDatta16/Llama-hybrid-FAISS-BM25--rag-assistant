Yes, events generated by the SystemEvents class (SessionSwitch here) are apt to cause deadlock when a program is violating Windows threading rules. It isn't clear to me exactly how that came about in your case but it sounds to me that you've been battling threading issues for a while already. .NET 2.0 has built-in diagnostics for this. Be sure to leverage this, it only works in the debugger. Make sure you didn't set Control.CheckForIllegalCrossThreadCalls to false.
