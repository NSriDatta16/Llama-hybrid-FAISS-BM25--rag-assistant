Try to collect more information about environment when this exception happens and log it. Under normal conditions log byte array size and the "User-Agent" field from the HTTP request, and definitely log this information when exception is thrown. It may be that the byte array is too large to be written in a single pass and you may need to chop it up in a few chunks. Also, I recommend you to look at commons-fileupload . Even if you don't use it in your project, browse the source code and see how they download the file. They used to have a lot of IOExceptions during file upload, but those were fixed in later versions. You may try to figure out what exactly was fixed.
