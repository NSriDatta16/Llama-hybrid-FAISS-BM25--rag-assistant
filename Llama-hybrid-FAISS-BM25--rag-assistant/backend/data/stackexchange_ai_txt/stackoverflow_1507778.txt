It helps to think a bit about the capabilities of the computers that were available when, say c, was written. Main memory was measured in kilowords, and not necessarily very many of them. Disks were bigger, but not much. Serrious storage meant reel-to-reel tapes, mounted by hand, by grumpy operators, who really wanted you to go away so they could play hunt the wumpus. A 1 MIPS machine was screaming fast . And with all these limitation you had to share it. Possibly with a score of other users. Anything that reduced the space or time complexity of compilation was a big win. And headers do both.
