I would recommend using a continuous integration tool such as CruiseControl.NET or hudson and writing many JUnit tests (or the C# equivalent). This way even if you develop quickly and don't spend enough time working out all the pieces, the CI server should prevent you from producing bugs which will take you an extremely long time to find. That said, I agree with what the others stated, you write elegant code so you (or your teammates) will understand it and not so your client is satisfied.
