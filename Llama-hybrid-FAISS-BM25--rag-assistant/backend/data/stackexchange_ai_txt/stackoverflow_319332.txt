I advise you (really!) not to try (ever!) to save files as data in a database. You will quickly face critical space problems. Please think about creating folders for file storage. These will be used to save/archive your files. Folders paths can be stored in one of your tables ( Tbl_Folder , for example). You can then store your file names in a table (such as Tbl_File , where you'll have a ' filename ' field). You will be able to open it with the Access.followHyperlink method and to manage it (copy/delete/move) with the File Scripting Object (FSO).
