what are effects of working with categorical dataset

I am working on classification problem where the dataset contains 90% of features as categorical. It is binary classification problem, and the class is heavily imbalanced. I performed Smote over sample and created a model. I also tried similar approach with undersampling. Both the method with logistic regression performs mediocre. I want to know how having too many categorical variables impacts the model and possible efficient way to approach the problem feature1:1-3 feature2:0-1 feature3:0-3 feature4: 1-4 feature5: 0-2 feature6: 0-5 feature7: 1-4 feature8: continuous( max 10) feature9 continuous( max 10) class: 0-1
