wouldn't the spike be treated as a noise glitch in SNR, an outlier to be discarded, as it were? If it's clear from the time-domain data that there are such spikes, then they will certainly create a lot of noise in the frequency spectrum. Chosing to ignore them is a good idea, but unfortunately the FFT can't accept data with 'holes' in it where the spikes have been removed. There are two techniques to get around this. The 'dirty trick' method is to set the outlier sample to be the average of the two samples on either site, and compute the FFT with a full set of data. The harder but more-correct method is to use a Lomb Normalised Periodogram (see the book 'Numerical Recipes' by W.H.Press et al.), which does a similar job to the FFT but can cope with missing data properly.
