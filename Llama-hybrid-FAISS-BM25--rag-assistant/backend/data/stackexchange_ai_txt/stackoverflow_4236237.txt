I prefer to pour cold water all over this question. In principle, it's impossible to provide an auto-formatter for a whitespace-significant language. (Pragmatically, you could add a few small niceties to the editor, e.g. if you type a line of code that starts with if and ends with the matching then and press enter, the editor could get smart and also insert the next indent so you don't also have to press tab. But this is a far cry from auto-formatting, which I think would be wrong-headed to even attempt.)
