High Standard Deviation for Leave one out cross-validation?

I am using the leave one out cross-validation technique to evaluate my model. If the prediction on the test sample is right the output is 1 otherwise 0. So I have a array of N samples with 0's and 1's at the end of it. I then average these values to get the average prediction accuracy and calculate the Standard deviation. I am getting the Average as 0.6 but the standard deviation is 0.5 (which is large). But the Mean + Standard deviation is more than the range , is that normal or is it wrong ? I have read that leave one out tends to have high variance because of high correlation between models. The second question is there a significance test I can do on the cross validation results to evaluate them?
