If the state-space is small, you could indeed solve by dynamic programming (which would require visiting all the states, though). In exponentially large state-spaces (which are the ones you care about in AI), it would not work, and the objectives proposed in the paper are ways around that using the generalization power of deep learning or other ML approaches that can generalize thanks to inductive biases. In spirit, this is similar to how you solve the Bellman equation with TD-learning (which is a form of implicit -by opposition to explicit- dynamic programming), but where the fixed point is the flow-matching constraint rather than the Bellman equation.
