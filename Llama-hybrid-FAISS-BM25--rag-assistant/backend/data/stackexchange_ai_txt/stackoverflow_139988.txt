Advice for someone who wants to start in Business Intelligence?

What advice would you have for someone who wants to start in the BI (Business Intelligence) domain? I where and what I should start with: Books, Blogs, WebCasts... What I should pay attention to and what I should stay away from. Are the Microsoft technologies worth while ?
