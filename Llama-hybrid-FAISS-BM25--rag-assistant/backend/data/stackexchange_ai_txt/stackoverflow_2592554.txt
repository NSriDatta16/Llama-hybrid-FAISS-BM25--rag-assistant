Having looked at the documentation for localStorage, I think you need to be storing the relevant data as it's generated/modified rather than waiting for a close event. I realise this is probably more work than any of us would like but at least you can be sure that you are saving the current state at each point so that even a browser crash shouldn't kill your state.
