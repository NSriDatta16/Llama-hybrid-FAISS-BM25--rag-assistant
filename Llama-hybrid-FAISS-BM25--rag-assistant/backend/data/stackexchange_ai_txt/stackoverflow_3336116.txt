Fast search within XML files in a shared folder

I need to design a windows application that will reside within an organization's intranet. The application will be deployed on a user's machine and the user will be generating output within an XML file that has a predefined schema. This XML will be written out to a networked folder that will be accessible by other users. These files are named userid_output.xml. The "userid" is pulled from the application environment. While using the application a user should have the capability to search all the XMLs generated by the universe of users until that point. The information retrieved will drive the user to shape his/her application input. A very firm requirement is not to use any RDBMS(Oracle/Sql Server/MySql et al) to store the XML. The shared network folder is "THE REPOSITORY" and is only used for storing the XMLs.The machine hosting the shared folder may not run any services that may assist with indexing the XMLs or optimizing the data for search purposes. Given these limitations, does anybody know of any design techniques/tools/mechanisms to perform fast information retrieval from this "dataset"? Thanks
