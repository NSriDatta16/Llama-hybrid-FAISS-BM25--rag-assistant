How to generate and visualize results of all possible parameter values in Python?

I have two parameters: demand , ticket_qty . demand is an integer and can have a possible range of [100 - 200] ticket_qty is also an integer and can have a possible range of [0 - 200] I want to visualize how values for the above parameters affect the functions below: price = demand - tickets_qty revenue = price * ticket_qty In Excel I created two matrixes (price and revenue) with demand as row indexes and ticket_qty as column indexes and simply applied the formula for each cell based on the rules above. However, seeing as this is a Kaggle microchallenge, I'd like to perform this using Python so as to then be able to plot and show optimal levels of price/revenue and do all my work inside the Jupyter notebook. Questions: How would I go about doing this in Python? pandas? numpy? In statistics/data science, what is this "process" of mapping out possible values called? So as to facilitate further research
