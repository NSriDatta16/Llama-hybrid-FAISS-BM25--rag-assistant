It won't get you any particular benefit -- it'll actually probably be slower on the load -- serialization is serialization, and adding a hashmap wrapper around it just increases the amount of data that needs to be deserialized and populated. for retrievals, assuming that most lookups are desecrate by the key you want to use for your hashmap you'll have a much much slower retrieval time because you'll be pulling down the whole graph just to get to one of it's discreet member info. Of course if the data is entirely static and you're only using memcached to populate values in various JVM's you can do it that way and just hold onto the hashmap in a static... but then you're multiplying your memory consumption by the number of nodes in the cluster...
