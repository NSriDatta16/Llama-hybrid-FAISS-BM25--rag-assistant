You should do some research on the differences between OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) databases. In short, database systems which are concerned primarily with recording transactions (OLTP) are usually structured in a more normalized fashion, reducing data duplication and easing the creation and updating of records at the expense of optimized data retrieval. Database systems which are more concerned with data retrieval and analysis (OLAP) are usually structured in a less normalized fashion, sacrificing data storage optimization so to maximize querying and analysis speed. Database normalization and Denormalization are at the heart of this trade off.
