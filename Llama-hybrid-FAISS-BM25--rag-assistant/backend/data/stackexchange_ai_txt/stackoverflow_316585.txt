final has three good reasons: instance variables set by constructor only become immutable methods not to be overridden become final, use this with real reasons, not by default local variables or parameters to be used in anonimous classes inside a method need to be final Like methods, local variables and parameters need not to be declared final. As others said before, this clutters the code becoming less readable with very little efford for compiler performace optimisation, this is no real reason for most code fragments.
