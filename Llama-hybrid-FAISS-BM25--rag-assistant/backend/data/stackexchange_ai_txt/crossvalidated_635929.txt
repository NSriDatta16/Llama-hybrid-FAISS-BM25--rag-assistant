Take a look at zero-inflated lognormal (ziln) regression models. See https://github.com/google/lifetime_value for an application and implementation in neural networks, that estimate the distribution of the Y=0 and positive part jointly, rather than through 2 separate models. I have used this successfully on insurance claims data with excellent results. In particular it allows you to estimate / predict tail risk and expected shortfall of insurance claims accurately. For reference see Wang, Xiaojing, Liu, Tianqi, and Miao, Jingang. (2019). A Deep Probabilistic Model for Customer Lifetime Value Prediction. arXiv:1912.07753.
