Time series Analysis with Non Numerical data

I have a data over the 1 hour interval time stamp with 20 varible columns (sensor data), but it doesnt has any crisp value like 220.4 all the values are like signal strength Eg:" Good" or "bad" or "invalid" . I would like to identify pattern over the time it has occured. As I am new to the analytics , kindly help me how can i proceed .
