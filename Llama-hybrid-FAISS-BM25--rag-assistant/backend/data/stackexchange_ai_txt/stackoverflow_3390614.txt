Are there user agents that add whitespace to text sent over HTTP?

This is more of a technical question than a help question. I'm not interested in knowing if I should trim() my input. Are there any user agents (browsers) that add whitespace to text sent over HTTP? I'm wondering in some cases if trim() is necessary ( aside from users adding whitespace ) because I've never actually seen a browser add anything to a value it's sending (encoding changes aside). Was there a time in the past when user agents did this?
