PCA Transformed data and regression

Looking to train a linear regression model on PCA transformed data. While PCA helped reduced the # of predictors variables significantly from 307 to ~40 without compromising much of the variance, I am, however, losing interpretability of the variables. Now my variables are labeled as PC1,PC2...PCn. The question is two-fold: How can I use PCA transformed data to train my linear regression model and predict on new test data? While prediction accuracy is important in this case, I am also interested in variable importance for business purposes.
