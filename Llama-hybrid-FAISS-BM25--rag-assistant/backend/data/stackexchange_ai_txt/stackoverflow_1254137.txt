OSX Audio: use Garage Band Plug-ins in my own app

I'm writing a little app for the Mac, that involves recording a voice. In GarageBand, and in Logic for that matter, there is a plug-in called Speech Enhancer. Is there any way I can piggyback on this plug-in, offering those users that have GB or Logic installed the comfort of noise cancellation and equalizing the built-in mike of their Mac? The plug-in doesn't show up in the AULab, so I expect it to be an exclusive Apple-thingy (which is outrageous by the way). Any suggestions? Thanks Sjakelien
