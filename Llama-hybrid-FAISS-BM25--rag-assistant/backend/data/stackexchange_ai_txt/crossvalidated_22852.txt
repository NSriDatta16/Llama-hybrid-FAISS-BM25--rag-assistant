Bayesian updating using $n$ noisy observations of Brownian motion

I am very new to Bayesian inference and can't figure out what may be an elementary problem. Also, please forgive me if I am screwing up the notation -- this is my first foray into Bayesian statistics. Set-up: At time $i=0$ I start with a random variable $X_0\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0,\sigma^2_0)$. Over time I observe the Brownian motion process such that for $j>i$, $X_j-X_i\sim \mathcal{N}(0,(j-i)D)$. Starting at time 0, I collect a sequence of $n$ observations $\{Y_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ of $\{X_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$, which are subject to Gaussian noise such that $p(y_i|x_i)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi N_0}}e^{-\frac{(y_i-x_i)^2}{2N_0}}$. Noise is independent from observation to observation. I am interested in the mean and variance (of the estimator) of $X_{n-1}$ given $\{Y_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}$ in terms of $n$, $\mu_0$, $\sigma^2_0$, $D$, and $N_0$. What I've done: Using Bayes rule and the properties of Gaussian distribution, I've found that for the first observation ($n=0$): $$p(x_0|y_0)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi S}}e^{-\frac{(x_0-M)^2}{2S}}$$ where $M=\frac{y_0\sigma^2_0+\mu_0N_0}{\sigma^2_0+N_0}$ and $S=\frac{\sigma^2_0N_0}{\sigma^2_0+N_0}$. I am not completely sure if the above is correct, but I am pretty confident that it is, as it looks like the mean squared error of the estimate of $X_0$ has decreased with the observation. However, I am having trouble extending this to $n>0$ and would appreciate any guidance. EDIT: I've misspecified the Brownian motion process. I think it's correct now.
