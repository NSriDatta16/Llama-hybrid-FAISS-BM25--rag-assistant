what pattern to use for multi-argument method?

I have a method with the following signature: foo (Sample sample, Aliquot aliquot) "foo" needs to alter a Sample object, either the first argument or from the second argument it can extract its Sample. For example: foo (Sample sample, Aliquot aliquot) { Sample out = null; if (sample != null) out = sample else out = aliquot.getSample() return out; } But that is so un-elegant, other than reading the API a developer does not know the reference of the first argument overrides the Sample of the second argument. Now, I could change "foo" to foo (SomeMagicalObject bar) where SomeMagicalObject is a tuple for Sample and Aliquot and holds some logic ... etc. But I am wondering, are there some patterns for this question?
