When I started to learn statistics I found Gelman's book on Bayesian data analysis very difficult to understand , it may be a bit overwhelming for someone new to statistics !. I recommend you to start with Peter Hoff's book A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods . It is not a comprehensive book for advanced statistical topics but it contains a large number of statistical models and examples and R-codes are provided either throughout the text or from the website for this book.
