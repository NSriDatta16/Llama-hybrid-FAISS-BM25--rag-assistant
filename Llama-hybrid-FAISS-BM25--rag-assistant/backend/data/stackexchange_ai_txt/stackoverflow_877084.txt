This question got me asking whether you can definitively work this out without actually generating the trees. I managed to write an application which could calculate the answer to what the average height would be if you added every possible permutation of N unique numbers to a naively implemented binary tree. The answers I got are in this graph. (The X-axis is the number of items in the tree, the blue line is the average height, and the red line is the optimum possible height) N Average Height 2 2 16 7.039 32 9.280 64 11.679 256 16.783 343 17.896 Granitebolshevik is right: it's possible but statistically unlikely that a naively implemented tree will be the optimum height, without extra balancing functionality. The algorithm has a complexity of O(N^2), and it isn't fast enough to calculate really large numbers.
