Is there an implementation of Tom Kyte's STRAGG function supporting SQL Server?

STRAGG function implemention returns a result as a single column value. Implementation for Oracle seems pretty generic and can be consumed for different tables (and relationships). Could similar behavior be achieved for SQL Server. A search in the web, appears to return only hard coded implementations and not a generic one. Do we have any known solution for Sql server?
