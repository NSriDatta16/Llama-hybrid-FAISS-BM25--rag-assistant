To answer my own question. It seems that the margins package, in the polr example above, only shows the Average Marginal Effect (AME) for the first category. When running the margins command in Stata, the reason for the negative AME becomes clear (interpretation is very well explained in this video ). The marginal effects should be interpreted as follows: If crime dummy variable equals one, the percentage chance that the observation is in the first category, indeed goes down by about 15%. But looking at the other categories, their cumulative chance, increases by 15%. The chance that an observation is in the second category increases by 1.45%, the chance that an observation is in the third category increases by just under 4% and finally the chance that an observation is in the fourth category increases by just under 9.55%, which together makes 15%. ---------------------------------------------------------------- | Delta-method | Contrast Std.
