AIC and BIC come out as NA when running CFA in R

Does anyone have ideas why when running a CFA in R I'm getting most of my fit statistics to calculate, but AIC and BIC are both NA? I load lavaan, SEMplot, SEMtools, and haven; load the file (have tried as .sav and as .csv); define the models; then run the analysis. Here's a sample: Model1Fit It also seems to happen without the Satorra-Bentler correction. Everything gets run correctly except this section of output: Loglikelihood and Information Criteria: Loglikelihood user model ( $H_0$ ) NA Loglikelihood unrestricted model ( $H_1$ ) NA Number of free parameters 27 Akaike (AIC) NA Bayesian (BIC) NA Any ideas what's going wrong?
