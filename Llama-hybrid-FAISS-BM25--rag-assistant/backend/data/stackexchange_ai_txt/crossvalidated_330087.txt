In ML lingo a weight is a coefficient of a bona fide regression variable and bias is the intercept. Also, in regression language interaction has a specific meaning, not the same as used in the text quoted. In your text how variables interact means simply that there is a function that into translates inputs $x$ into output: $$a=f(b+wx)$$ So, the weight $w$ specifies how the variables $a$ and $x$ interact , using the language of the book. Now, the bias $b$ only controls an output $a$. In other words, they're saying that $x$ via $w$ impacts $a$, while $b$ impact $a$ directly, it doesn't need another variable. I wouldn't pay too much attention to this argument. It's too wobbly to me. What you need to understand is that if you set all weights $w=0$, the model will still somewhat work, because $b\ne 0$, and it will cause your layer to still produce the value that is around the mean. It will not be a very intelligent forecast, since it doesn't accept any inputs, but it will be showing some kind of an average output. If you set all $w=b=0$ this will not work well, since it'll be producing zero all the time.
