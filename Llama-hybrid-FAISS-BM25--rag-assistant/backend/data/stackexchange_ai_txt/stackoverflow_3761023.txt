The way this is being described sounds like you want to replicate/duplicate the first user's post for everyone who follows that user? That's going to be a data storage nightmare. You should look at it from the other point of view. Consider the following model: User A posts what he ate for breakfast. This is stored once in a table with his user id. User B looks at his "stream". This is a dynamically created list of posts. At this point User B is following 50 people. User B's script will get the first 50 most recent posts of whomever he is following and display them for him on his "stream" With this model, you never have more than one post per user per frivolous breakfast update. Also, the number of followers does not scale up the processing time needed to publish the twit. I mean tweet. Clarification You'll just need to do some normalization. So you'll have a users table, a users_following table, and a posts table. The query would look akin to: SELECT posts.* FROM users_following LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users_following.followed WHERE users_following.follower = $idOfUserB ORDER BY posts.created LIMIT 50;
