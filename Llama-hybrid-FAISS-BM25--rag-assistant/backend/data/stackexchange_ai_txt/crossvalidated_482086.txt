Multicollinearity has nothing to do with the response variable! (In fact, if Iâ€™m doing a linear regression, I hope for a strong linear relationship between the predictors and the response!) Think about variance inflation factor. At no point do you consider the response variable. If you know how to examine for multicollinearity in linear regression with one response variable, you know how to do it for multiple response variables. (Ditto for a binary response variable (e.g. logistic regression) or a count response variable (e.g. Poisson regression ), since only the predictors matter for this.)
