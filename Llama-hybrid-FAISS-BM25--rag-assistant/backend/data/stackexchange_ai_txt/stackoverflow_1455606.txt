I'd rethink using IPrincipal here--it is very handy and allows you to work your way into the rest of the .NET authentication bits very seamlessly. As for the problem at hand, perhaps the easiest clean course of action would be to wire them into a base controller class as protected properties. Slightly more elegant would be to create a user context class, that takes a reference to Session (or better yet, whatever base interfaces you are using in the session) and expose that class from the controller. The main advantage there is it makes it easier to change the backing store if need be and lets one encapsulate more behavior in general.
