Loading and querying a Spark machine learning model outside of Spark

I'm currently working on a project where we're building a data pipeline. We have spark setup and have generated models. Sadly, loading the model in Spark and querying it isn't fast enough for us. What's the most straightforward way of exporting a model and loading it into memory on a local server? I've researched PMML and some libraries and that appears to be one path.
