Retrieving information from a web page

My application is meant to speed up the retrieval of phone call information from our telephone system. The best way to get this information is to create a new search on the telephone system's web interface and export the results to an Excel spreadsheet which my application then imports into a DataSet. To get the export, from the login screen, the process goes as follows: Log in Navigate to Reports Page Click "Extension Detail" link Select "Extensions" CheckBox Select the extensions (typically all the ones currently being used) from the listbox Specify date range Click on Export button It's not a big job to do it manually every day, but, for reliability, it would be great if I can make my application do this automatically the first time it starts every day. Since more than 1 person in the company is going to use this application, having a Windows Service do it would be even better. I don't know if it'll help, but the system is Datatex Topaz Next Generation telephone management system: http://www.datatex.co.za/downloads/index.html#TNG Can anyone give me a basic idea how to do this? Also, can anyone post links (in comments if need be) to pages where I can learn more about how to do this?
