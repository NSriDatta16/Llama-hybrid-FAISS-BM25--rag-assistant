All of these programming questions ask for an interface based programming model, in which you implement the interface twice. One for the real code and one for the mockup. Instantiation is then the next issue. There are several design patterns that can be used for that. See for example the famous GangOfFour Creational patterns ( GOF ) or the Dependency Injection patterns. ASP.Net MVC is in fact using this interface-based approach and is therefore much more suitable for unit testing.
