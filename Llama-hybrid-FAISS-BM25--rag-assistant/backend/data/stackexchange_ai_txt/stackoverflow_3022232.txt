What's a better choice for SQL-backed number crunching - Ruby 1.9, Python 2, Python 3, or PHP 5.3?

Criteria for 'better': fast in math and simple (few fields, many records) db transactions, convenient to develop/read/extend, flexible, connectible. The task is to use a common web development scripting language to process and calculate long time series and multidimensional surfaces (mostly selecting/inserting sets of floats and doing maths with them). The choice is Ruby 1.9, Python 2, Python 3, PHP 5.3, Perl 5.12, or JavaScript (node.js). All the data is to be stored in a relational database (due to its heavily multidimensional nature); all the communication with outer world is to be done by means of web services.
