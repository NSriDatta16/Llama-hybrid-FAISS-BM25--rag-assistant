A couple of points regarding the Isolated shell. As you might know, there are two considerations when you use shell - Isolated Mode and Integrated Mode. ( Read more from MSDN ) Isolated Shell can be used by organizations, to build applications that run side by side with other editions of Visual Studio. Here are some points we learned, trying to use shell for some of our applications. If you are planning to use Isolated shell, you can't use Microsoft Language Packages like C# and VB.NET inside that. Creating a package for your shell is much like creating any other VS Package. You don't have support for Team Explorer and VS Built in Source Control access, in Isolated Shell ( See this post from Vin ) Though not directly related - If you are using VS SDK 1.1 to develop your packages - remember that the managed package framework is no longer available with the default distribution. So don't get surprised if your old packages can't load MPF files after moving to SDK 1.1. It has got moved to Codeplex as a separate download.
