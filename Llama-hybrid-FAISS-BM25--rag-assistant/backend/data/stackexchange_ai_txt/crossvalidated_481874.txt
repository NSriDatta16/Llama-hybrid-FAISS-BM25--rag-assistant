Proving Identifiability Using Law of Large Numbers?

Well normally proving identifiability follows by showing that $p_{\theta}(x)=p_{\theta'}(x)$ implies $\theta=\theta'$ . Usually this proceeds by showing that a function dependent on $\theta$ , such as log-likelihood (or conditional log-likelihood in the case of Logistic Regression) leading to equality implies the equality $\theta=\theta'$ . In that sense it is like showing the likelihood function is one-to-one when applied to a single data point. To be more precise for a dataset of size one $\mathcal{D}=\{X\}$ from Gaussian distribution, to show identifiability we write: $$nll_{\mu, \sigma}(\mathcal{D})=c + \log(\sigma) + \frac{1}{2{\sigma}^2}(X-\mu)^2=c + \log(\sigma') + \frac{1}{2{\sigma'}^2}(X-\mu')^2$$ . Now taking the derivative twice with respect to $X$ we get $$\frac{1}{\sigma^2}=\frac{1}{{\sigma'}^2}$$ which then implies $\sigma=\sigma'$ . Conclusion about $\mu=\mu'$ also follows with similar algebraic manipulations. My question is what if we imply identifiablity for the likelihood of a large set of points rather than one point only, and in doing so, we could incorporate limiting laws such as LLN. For example in the case of identifiability of Gaussian distribution we can do as follows. Again assume $X_i\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$ . Now if we have $$ nll_\mu(\mathcal{D})=c + N\log(\sigma) + \frac{1}{2{\sigma}^2}\sum_{i=1}(X_i-\mu)^2=c +N\log(\sigma')+ \frac{1}{2{\sigma'}^2}\sum_{i=1}(X_i-\mu')^2 =nll_{\mu'}(\mathcal{D})$$ dividing both sides with $N$ and taking the limit of $N\to\infty$ which implies using SLLN: $$\log(\sigma)+\frac{1}{2}\overset{P}{=} \log(\sigma')+\frac{1}{2}$$ which implies $\sigma=\sigma'$ . So rather than using a single point, I am using a large sample of points to show identifiability. Is this allowed? If so where can I find this formally written in a textbook? If not, why not? Isn't the point to show that when large enough sample is gathered we can identify the true parameter anyway?
