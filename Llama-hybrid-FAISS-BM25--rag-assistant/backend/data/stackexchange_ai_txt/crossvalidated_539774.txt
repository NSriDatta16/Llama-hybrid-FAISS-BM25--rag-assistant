Is there a way to use partial information about the distribution to estimate better?

I learned college statistics but only at the undergraduate level. I feel like it's hard to apply what I learned to real-life situations, unlike self-contained problem sets. Here's what I'm trying to do: I want to estimate the population's distribution with some pieces of information I gathered that are not sufficient to estimate the distribution perfectly. I took a test and I have some information like: There were 59 students. (n=59) Mean is 75 Top score was 96 The lowest was 48 There are 13 students within 60 There are 3 students under 60 (x If I assume a normal distribution for the population, I already have the mean so now have to know the standard deviation of the population to get the distribution. However, instead of standard deviation, I got these bunch of partial information that seem useful but don't know how to actually use them to calculate the population distribution. Is there a standardized way to update my knowledge of the population based on this little partial information? I feel like this should be related to Bayesian update but this seems totally different from what I read in the textbook.
