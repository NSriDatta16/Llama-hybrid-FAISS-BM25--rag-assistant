C tutorial question relating to calloc vs malloc

I am following this tutorial ( http://theocacao.com/document.page/234 ). I am confused about this paragraph, mainly the lines relating to calloc: We can also use a variation of the malloc function, called calloc. The calloc function takes two arguments, a value count and the base value size. It also clears the memory before returning a pointer, which is useful in avoiding unpredictable behavior and crashes in certain cases: That last line confuses me. What does it mean to clear the memory?
