I think it has to do with images - the underlying object of Image class is unmanaged, because of this memory consumed by them is not included in GC counters. They also require extra care about how you dispose of them - managed memory consumption of them is very low so GC does not really pay attention, but the unamanged memory - you can see it. The bottom line - it is not enough to let them go out of scope, you have to explicitly call dispose on them when you are done.
