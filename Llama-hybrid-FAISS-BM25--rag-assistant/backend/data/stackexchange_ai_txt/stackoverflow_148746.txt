It is a huge deal! The fact that MS is leveraging a technology that it didn't develop is a big step. Also, the fact they aren't buying it out or consuming it is a very big step as well. Personally, I have found using jQuery to be a big help while I've been developing ASP.NET MVC. It has helped me to simplify my Views where if I didn't have jQuery my Views would have been too complicated. I think this is a great stop in the right direction.
