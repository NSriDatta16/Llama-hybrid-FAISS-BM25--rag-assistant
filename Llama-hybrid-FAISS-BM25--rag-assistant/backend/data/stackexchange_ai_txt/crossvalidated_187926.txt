I don't know how to determine the P-value for my OR.

I'm new to logistic regression.suppose i have a binary outcome (Y) and categorical independent variable (X). when i run the test on spss, for every category there is a different P value. please i want to know which one to consider and also i read in some article the term (P for trend) is it different from the P-value??
