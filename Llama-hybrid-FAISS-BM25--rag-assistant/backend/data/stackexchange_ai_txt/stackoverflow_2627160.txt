You can leverage the syntax highlighter that is in use at StackOverflow . I mean the text area where you add the content to be posted to the site :) But for a more robust and configurable solution you could check out the syntax highlighter developed by Alex Gorbatchov ( link ). But well, installing it requires some knowledge of HTML and CSS. So, if I needed a quick solution to format my output, I would opt for planet.ca , as darlinton and ArunSaha .
