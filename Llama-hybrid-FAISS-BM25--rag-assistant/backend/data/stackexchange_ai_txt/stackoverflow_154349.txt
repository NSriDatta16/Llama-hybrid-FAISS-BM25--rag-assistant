Your primary data structure is one to contain the text. Rather than using a long buffer to contain the text, you'll probably want an array of lines because it's faster to insert a character into the middle of a line then it is to insert a character into the middle of a large buffer. You'll need to decide if your text editor should support embedded formatting. If, for example, you need to use fonts, bolding, underlining, etc, then your data structure will need to include ways of embedding formatting codes within your text. In the good old days of 8-bit characters we could use the upper 8-bits of an integer to store any formatting flags and the lower 8-bits to store the character itself. The actual code will depend on the language you're using. In C# or C++ you'll probably use an array of strings for the lines. In C you'll have an array of heap-based character arrays. Separate out the display code from the text handling code as much as possible. The center of your code will be a tight loop something like: while (editing) { GetCharacter(); ProcessCharacter(); UpdateDisplay(); } A more sophisticated editor will use separate threads for the character getting/processing and the display updating.
