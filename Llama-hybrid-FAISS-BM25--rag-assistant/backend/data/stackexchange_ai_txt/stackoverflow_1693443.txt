You need to know what the obfuscated name of the property ended up. That is very fragile as it may change from build to build. If you can tell which property is by other means (its type, custom attributes) it would be better. The obfuscated name will mostly likely be a few non-printable characters or probably just A . Dotfuscator renames something like 80% of the code to A .
