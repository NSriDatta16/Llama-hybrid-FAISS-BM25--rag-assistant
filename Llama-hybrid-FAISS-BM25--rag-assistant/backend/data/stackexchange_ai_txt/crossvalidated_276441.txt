Ok, so maybe no one else cares, but we went to a stats clinic and this is what they said. So we can do two GLMs for each of the variables we want to plot and plot them against each other, since they share the same covariates, so long as we only use that for visualisation and not for statistical inference. For the relationship we do a single GLM with the y-axis variable as the response variable and including the x-axis variable. PCA first to reduce dimensions is ok for non-explanatory variables we just want to model out. I'm sure you all knew that!
