Observe that for positive definite covariance matrix $\mathbf \Sigma = \mathbf{UDU}'$ the precision is $\boldsymbol \Sigma^{-1} = \mathbf {U D}^{-1} \mathbf U'$. So the eigenvectors stay the same, but the eigenvalues of the precision are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the covariance. That means the biggest eigenvalues of the covariance will be the smallest eigenvalues of the precision. As you have the inverse, positive definiteness guarantees all eigenvalues are greater than zero. Hence if you retain the eigenvectors relating to the $k$ smallest eigenvalues of the precision this corresponds to ordinary PCA. Since we have already taken reciprocals ($\bf D^{-1}$), only the square root of the precision eigenvalues should be used in order to complete the whitening of the transformed data.
