Stop event propagtion in your mouseover handler. $('selector').mouseover( function(e) { ... e.stopPropagation(); }); You also might want to think about using the hover() method or the hoverIntent() plugin. The latter will help to reduce any flashing as you simply drag your mouse across the page by enforcing a timed wait before the event handler is invoked.
