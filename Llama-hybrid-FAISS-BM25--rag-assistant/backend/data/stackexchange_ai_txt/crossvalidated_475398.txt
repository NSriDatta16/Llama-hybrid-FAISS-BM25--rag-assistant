Is the determinant of the correlation matrix << 0.00001 necessarily a problem for PCA?

I am running PCA on my data and my KMO value > 0.80 and p-value of Bartlett's test of sphericity However, the determinant of the correlation matrix ( around 10^-30) is very close to zero. I tried to remove some columns with high correlation coefficients, but the determinant still remained relatively very close to zero. Will the presence of linearly dependant variables hinder the reliability of PCA?
