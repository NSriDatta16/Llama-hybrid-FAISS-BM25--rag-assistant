Whenever I get these kinds of errors (working on local but not on server) I fire up IIS admin tool (or whatever you are using) and check that everything is EXACTLY the same. If not make them the same then change 1 little thing at a time. Depending on your role/organisation you might not have access to the server in this way but often these errors come down to the weirdest random checkbox on a tab you never look at. It is a long shot but can't help to try.
