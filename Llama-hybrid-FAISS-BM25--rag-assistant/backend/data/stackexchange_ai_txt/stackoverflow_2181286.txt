Problem appears to be your region setting is not "en-US" so the date formatter doesn't parse the string using the en-US format supplied. Although there may be a more elegant, general solution, doing a setLocale on originalDateFormatter to en_US can be used as a workaround to solve the problem. As you've already tried in your code: [originalDateFormatter setLocale:[[[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifier:@"en_US"] autorelease]];
