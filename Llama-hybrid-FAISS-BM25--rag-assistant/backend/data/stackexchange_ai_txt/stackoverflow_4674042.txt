Not initialized in user control?

Any ideas as to why AR isn't being properly initialized when being used inside a user control? My initialization is properly being executed AFAIK because my parent form is successfully able to query. However, when I try querying within my user controls I get Warning 1 An ActiveRecord class (Binder) was used but the framework seems not properly initialized. Did you forget about ActiveRecordStarter.Initialize() ? 0 0 . Which stops me from dragging my user control onto the form. If it helps, I initialize AR in Program.Main(). Here is the stacktrace: at Castle.ActiveRecord.ActiveRecordBase.EnsureInitialized(Type type) at Castle.ActiveRecord.ActiveRecordBase.FindAll(Type targetType, DetachedCriteria detachedCriteria, Order[] orders) at Castle.ActiveRecord.ActiveRecordBase.FindAll(Type targetType) at Castle.ActiveRecord.ActiveRecordBase`1.FindAll() at TxLocates.BinderTabReferenceControl.BinderTabReferenceControl_Load(Object sender, EventArgs e) in C:\dev\TxLocates\src\TxLocates\BinderTabReferenceControl.cs:line 56 at System.Windows.Forms.UserControl.OnLoad(EventArgs e) at System.Windows.Forms.UserControl.OnCreateControl() at System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateControl(Boolean fIgnoreVisible) at System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateControl() at System.Windows.Forms.Control.ControlCollection.Add(Control value) at System.Windows.Forms.Form.ControlCollection.Add(Control value) at System.Windows.Forms.Design.ControlDesigner.DesignerControlCollection.Add(Control c)
