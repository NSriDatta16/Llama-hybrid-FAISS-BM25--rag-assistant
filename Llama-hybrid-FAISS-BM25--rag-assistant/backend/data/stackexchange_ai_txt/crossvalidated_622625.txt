Properties of the inverse normal cdf and permutation probabilities as models for horse racing

Let $T_i$ be the running time of horse $i$ and $T_i \sim N(\theta_i,1)$ and the $T_i$ 's are independent. Then Henery (1981) showed that the probability $P(T_1 can be estimated as (taylor expansion to the first degree) $$P(T_1 It is a well known result that $P(T_1 by symmetry and that by some calculation that $$\sum_{i=1}^n\theta_i \cdot \frac{\partial P(T_1 where $\mu_{1:n}$ is the expected value of the $i$ -th standard normal order statistic in a sample of size $n$ . Hence $$P(T_1 Then Henery proceeds to say that the RHS or (*) is the same as $$\frac{1}{n!}+\frac{1}{n!}\sum_{i=1}^n\theta_i \mu_{1:n} = \Phi(\Phi^{-1}(\frac{1}{n!})+\frac{1}{n!\phi (\Phi^{-1}(\frac{1}{n!}))}\sum_{i=1}^n\theta_i \mu_{1:n})$$ (where $\phi$ and $\Phi$ are the normal pdf and cdf respectively) without any calculation and I am puzzled as to how he derived that. I tried to derive it myself but failed. Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance. Reference: Henery, Robert J. (1981), "Permutation Probabilities as Models for Horse Races." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B-Methodological 43 ; 86-91. EDIT: I have run some calculation and it seems that the two are not actually equal but an approximation, but still I have no idea how did Henery derive it.
