Is it cheaper to buy fixed amounts or amounts with fixed price of a fluctuating product?

Say the price of something fluctuates with time. From a statistical point of view, is it cheaper (in total cost after a long amount of time) to buy it in large constant amounts of variable quantities of the same price? I tried modelling this as the following: Spending a certain amount of money means buying in more increments, which is more sensitive to fluctuations (which can be thought of as random noise) -- this seems similar to a sine wave on a price against time plot. While buying in large amounts, may on average be modelled as a straight horizontal line on the same plot. Integrating the area under those curves on large amounts of time should give us the same answer. Is there anything else to think about that I'm missing, without going into non-statistical arguments?
