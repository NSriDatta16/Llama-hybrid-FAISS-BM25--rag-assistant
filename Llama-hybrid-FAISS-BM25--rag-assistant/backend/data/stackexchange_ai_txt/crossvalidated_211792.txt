Like Maarten said, Therneau's explanation is correct and probably the first book refers to what he mentioned. It is though an interesting thought experiment to see what would happen in the wrong model (with $T$ in it). If $T$ is indeed the final time, that is completely wrong, as the hazard at time $t But say you believe that what you estimate is indeed the hazard, and include $T$ in the expression for the hazard. We can agree that, on average, individuals who live longer (large $T$) are at a lower risk than individuals who live less (low $T$). So it is likely that $T$ itself will explain a large part of the randomness in the model which is in fact not explained. Imagine that the real hazard function is always increasing in time. Because those who die later have larger values of $T$, the estimated hazard will be "dragged down" towards 0. Now imagine a 0/1 covariate which increases the hazard (individuals with 1 are at a higher risk than those with 0). Since $T$ depends on this covariate, we can reverse this relationship and think that the covariate value depends on $T$. The effect of the two is then confounded, and it is likely that the regression coefficient for our covariate is biased towards 0. The fallacies of including covariates which depend on the future and treat them as known at $t=0$ are numerous. A popular term for this is immortality bias and there are many interesting reads out there about it.
