How to us Ajax Modalpopupextender in usercontrol?

Hi i am studying asp.net webforms and i am now creating usercontrols and trying to use ajaxtoolkit. On my user Control i copy this code from Ajax-MessageBox Dotnetgurus and i want to add Modalpopupextender in it but when i drag it to my btnD an error message box shows. The operation could not be completed. Invalid FORMATETC structure Warning 1 Generation of designer file failed: Unknown server tag 'AjaxControls:ModalPopupExtender'. There is no > symbol also when i drag new button on the form because of that i cant add extender. Thanks in Regards
