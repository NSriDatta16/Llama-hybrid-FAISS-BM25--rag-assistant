Can someone point me to a good example of using bayesian models for making marketing decisions?

I am tasked to build a bayesian model to support decision making for paid search marketing. I've researched online and found several scholarly articles on using Hierarchical Bayesian model or MCMC in estimating model parameters, but I still don't understand details. Is there a good example somewhere, which explains both the model, and how to use a software package to estimate the parameters step by step? Thank you!
