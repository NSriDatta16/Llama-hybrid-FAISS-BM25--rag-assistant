I eventually found an acceptable answer to my question. This may or may not be the best/most sophisticated way to handle this, but it enabled me to get what I was after. set.seed(1) intercept1 = -6.0 beta1 = 2.75 xtest1 = rnorm(1300, 1, 3) linpred1 = intercept1 + xtest1 * beta1 prob1 = exp(linpred1)/(1 + exp(linpred1)) runis1 = runif(1300, 0, 1) ytest1 = ifelse(runis1 I am now able to manipulate the data frame, perform logistic regression, and produce plots. Thank you to everybody who provided input.
