What have you tried? How many readings do you get per second? I would suggest something along the lines of an average of the last X number of readings to get rid of the "jiggles" and throw away any readings that are wildly different from the current direction to stop any crazy "jumping" of values. Depending on how many readings you are getting, and how much averaging you are doing, your app may lose responsiveness.
