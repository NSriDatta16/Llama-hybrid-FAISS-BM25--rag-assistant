Bash: Create a file if it does not exist, otherwise check to see if it is writeable

I have a bash program that will write to an output file. This file may or may not exist, but the script must check permissions and fail early. I can't find an elegant way to make this happen. Here's what I have tried. set +e touch $file set -e if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then exit;fi I keep set -e on for this script so it fails if there is ever an error on any line. Is there an easier way to do the above script?
