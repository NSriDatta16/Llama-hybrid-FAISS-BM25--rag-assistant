How can i use an ARIMA model to explain the an effect of news regarding COVID-19 on a stock market index?

My thoughts were to model the time series of the stock index up until the particular day for the news I am looking at and forecast using my model. Then I would compare the forecasted result to the actual observation, for example the effects 7 days after the news. Is this a proper approcah? And how far back do I need to go when i am looking at the daily returns? My problems so far are that when using R program and auto.arima funtion, I get an ARIMA(0,0,0) output. Also, the ACF and PACF of the time series give me the same results for order of p and q.
