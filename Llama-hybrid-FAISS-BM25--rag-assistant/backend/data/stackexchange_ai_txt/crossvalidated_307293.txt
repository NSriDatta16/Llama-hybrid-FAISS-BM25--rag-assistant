What is the physical intuition behind the equality $\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2 = \sum_i (x_i - \bar x) x_i$?

Suppose that $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are real numbers, and let $\bar x$ denote the average $\frac{\sum_i x_i}n.$ I know how to prove on paper that the equality $$\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2 = \sum_i (x_i - \bar x) x_i$$ holds true in general, but I do not have any intuition for why this should be the case. Similarly, I do not know how to rationalize with geometric intuition the identity $$\sum_i (x_i - \bar x) y_i=\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y) = \sum_ix_i (y_i - \bar y).$$ Do you have a way of visualizing what is going on in these equalities (e.g. in terms of weighted sums of data points)?
