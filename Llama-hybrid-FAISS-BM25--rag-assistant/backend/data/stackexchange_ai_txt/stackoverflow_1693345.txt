Tool for program statistics

Is there a tool which is able to parse my source code (fortran, C or C++) and return statistics such as the number of loops, the average loop size, the number of functions, the number of function calls, the number, size and type of arrays, variables, etc ? Something similar to this which does not run easily on my architecture
