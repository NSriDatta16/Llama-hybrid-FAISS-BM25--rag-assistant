How can I force an XSLT result tree to serialize with a particular default namespace?

I'm trying to strip the namespace qualifiers from a document, while retaining the document namespace as the default: To (I know, this is meaningless, but our client doesn't get XML and uses string comparisons to find information in the document.) I'm using Java's JAXP Transformer API to do my work here. I can strip out all namespace information with this stylesheet, but I want instead to force serialization without prefixes: How can I do this?
