Causality and Time series forecasting combined

Edit: I would like to refer you to my new and more specific question: Edited: Choice between forecasting models I'm researching forecasting models. Since I have data that has both a trend and seasionality and is caused by other variables, I would like to describe a model that combines Time Series Models and Causal Models. However, I can't seem to find models that combine those two. What are models for me to look at? The following models are models that I already described: Moving Average Weighted Moving Average Exponential smoothing Single lineair regression Method of Holt Method of Pegels Seasonal Na√Øve Method Method of Holt-Winters Multiple Lineair Regression
