constricting scrolling in core-plot

I would like to have my user scroll inside a CPXYGraph. I have a CPXYGraph as part of a CPHostingLayer, like in the tutorials. I enabled allowsUserInteraction, which is cool and allows scrolling. But I don't want to allow my user to scroll to 'infinity', which it seems like it allows-you can keep dragging further and further away from where the data is on a plot. How do I constrain this so that the user can only scroll within a certain bounds? I also enabled masksToBorder, and set the outerBorderPath and innerBorderPath to something arbitarily small, but I saw no changes, so I am not sure how those are supposed to work. I could not set maskingPath and subLayerMaskingPath because they seem to be read only(no setters), though i feel like these two properties might be what I am looking for. Anyone has run into this situation? Would be glad if someone could shed some light. Thanks!
