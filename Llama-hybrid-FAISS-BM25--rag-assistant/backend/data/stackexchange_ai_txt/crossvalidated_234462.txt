Validation of a random forest

I am a complete newbie in this area and I am probably doing something wrong. I am trying to use randomForest in R for a regression and I am using the iris dataset. I want predict the Sepal.Length from the Petal.Width and the Sepal.Length . I want to test it with cross validation and I got confused. Here is my example. data Questions Is the ROC a good choice for a regression model? How can I get the accuracies for every fold and for the entire model?
