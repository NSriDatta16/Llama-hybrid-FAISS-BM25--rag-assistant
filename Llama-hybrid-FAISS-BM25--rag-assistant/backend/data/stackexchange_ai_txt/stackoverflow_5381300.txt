A single big sql table or multiple small sql tables?

I'm currently working with MS SQL 2005, and have a table that has 17 columns, and the space that data in each row would take is only a bit less than what is allowed(per row/record) in MS SQL 2005. And it is for sure that I cannot break this up into smaller tables as the data stored in this table is input from excel sheets whose contents I'm not in control of. Now the point is, that for almost everything on the Website that uses this database, that main table is providing the result sets, and these result sets are previously known. So, which would be better of the two: a) I make use of the big table every time. b) I create smaller tables, and depopulate/populate them as soon as data is edited in the big table. For eg: Excel sheets containing details of products arrive(almost weekly) from various manufacturers, and they are stored in the PRODUCTS(big) table. Now there are queries like: SELECT DISTINCT Brand_name, Model_name FROM PRODUCTS and SELECT DISTINCT Brand_name, Model_name FROM PRODUCTS WHERE Price and about 10-15 like these. Now my question is: Should I build already aggregated tables for these things which amount to about 5 more other than the PRODUCTS table, and update them whenever a sheet comes in, or should I just execute all my retrieval queries on the PRODUCTS table? The PRODUCTS table would contain about 500,000 rows at the max at a time.
