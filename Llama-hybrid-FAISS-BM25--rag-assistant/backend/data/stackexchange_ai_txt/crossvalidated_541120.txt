Sensitivity Testing - Using Probit GLM to Infer Parameters of the Independent Variable

I am an engineer working with some sensitivity data. In this type of experiment, you test a device at a certain stimulus and observe whether or not it fails (binary outcome). For example, you might drop some parts from different heights and observe what heights cause the part to break. Because the strength of the part has some variability, there will be some heights that cause some parts to break but others survive from that same height. What I care about understanding is the distribution of failure strength of my part. I can assume that this distribution is normal from domain knowledge and previous work. I have seen others solve this problem using a GLM with probit link function as follows. Assume that 1 means "part broke under this stimulus" and 0 means "part survived the stimulus". #data x I see that this works (by comparing to results from commercial software) but don't know why and I can't find these formulas in any google searches. Why is -1 * (intercept / coefficient of x) equal to the mean of the distribution of the stimulus values that caused failure? Why is the standard deviation equal to 1 / (coefficient of x)? Are there any references that can provide some intuition behind this? For background: I am not a trained statistician but do my best to try to understand moderately complex methods. This is confusing to me because I have never used regression to understand things about the distribution of one of the independent variables...it's usually to view the coefficient of the variable. Thank you! Edit: after reviewing the first comment, I edited the question to clarify that it's not the distribution of heights that caused failure that I am interested in. This means the whole title of my post is sort of mis-specified and i may have to delete and re-post under a better title. It's the distribution of "failure strength" of the part. For example, I could drop the part from a height of 10000 and it would break, but that same part would have also broke at maybe 600. So we can't just average the heights that caused failure to find the mean failure strength of of the part. Just by typing this, I'm connecting some dots in my head and thinking maybe this is a latent variable problem, which I know probit regression has been used for.
