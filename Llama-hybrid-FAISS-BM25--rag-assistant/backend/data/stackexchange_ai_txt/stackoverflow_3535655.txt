Arithmetic with PowerShell Timespans

PowerShell Timespans are great for quickly displaying durations, as in: $starttime = $(get-date) { do some processing here } write-host "Duration: $((new-timespan $starttime $(get-date)).tostring())" But if I did $loopcount iterations of processing during that timeframe, how do I divide the duration by $loopcount to get the average duration per iteration?
