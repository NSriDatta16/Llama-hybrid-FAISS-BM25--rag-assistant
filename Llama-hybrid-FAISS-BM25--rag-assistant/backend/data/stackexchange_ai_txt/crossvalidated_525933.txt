Which variables should i convert for logistic regression?

I have the following variables: Income (int) 1 2 3 1 1 1 2 BodyMass (num) 30.2 26.3 33 34 32.1 EatingTimemain (int) 40 119 60 90 95 110 EatingTime secondary (int) 0 30 30 4 0 32 10 0 0 FizzyDrink (chr) 0 2 1 3 2 Exercise (int) 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 ExFrequency (chr) 5 4 4 6 0 FastFood (int) 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 FastFreq (chr) 0 2 2 1 1 2 2 DietPlan (int) 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 Obesity (chr) 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 I'm trying to fit Exfrequency, FastFreq, FizzyDrink, Eatingtimemain, EatingTime secondary, Dietplan and income into a logistic model with obesity as the response variable. I'm not sure which of the variables I should convert to numeric before applying the model to. I have done the following code: lr.model
