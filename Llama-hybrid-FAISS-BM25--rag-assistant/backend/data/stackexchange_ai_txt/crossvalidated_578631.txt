Yes, your model omits the first category of the categorical variable ("AS") and that's what Intercept is for; the other categories are compared to the first one, as you correctly guessed. Your response variable: if it is percentage, you probably need logistic regression (family binomial) with two response variables which create the ratio; or, use lm and normal regression, but certainly not the default family=poisson which you are using when you not specify the family parameter. Don't know about the nesting. It looks like R didn't accept the NA values and removed them.
