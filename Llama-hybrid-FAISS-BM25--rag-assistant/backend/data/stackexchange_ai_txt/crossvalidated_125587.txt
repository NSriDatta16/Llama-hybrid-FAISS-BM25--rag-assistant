How to predict the time series data

I have no background of advanced stats. I am an engineer and I have the following data. I am representing it as a decent graph for better understanding. I want to forecast the collision for the next hour with 95% confidence level in one hour interval. The x-axis is the time (total 7 hours) and the Y-axis is the number of collisions (in thousands). The unit time is 1hr. This is a time series data and the process is stochastic. The nature is somewhat random as there is a trend clearly be seen but sometime abrupt movement can also happen. I was wondering if I get the idea where to start to get a initial prediction. I was reading the Bayesian time series analysis and then moved to ARIMA model but I am confused. So, any help. I would also want to know the real research issues in these kind of data. The tool I will be using is R or might be Matlab.
