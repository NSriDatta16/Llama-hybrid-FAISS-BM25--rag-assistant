I don’t believe it is the intention of Scrum to define any reporting lines whatsoever, at least not in the formal context. It’s a software development methodology, not an organisational structure approach. Although I often play the role of a Scrum Master and my direct reports do the development, we could conceivably operate with one of the other guys playing the lead role and myself being a developer without it being contrary to the formal construct. Of course this could be interesting in the event of a dispute but for the most part I think Scrum and reporting lines are two independent concepts.
