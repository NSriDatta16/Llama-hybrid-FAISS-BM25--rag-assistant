Connect controls in Visual Studio 2010 UML Modeling Diagrams

I've tried to create UML diagram with MSVS 2010 b2 today and I've faced a problem. After I added controls from toolbox (such as Class, Interface) I could not connect these items! So connecting controls have been disabled on the toolbox when I tried to drag it on working area. How to connect UML controls? thx
