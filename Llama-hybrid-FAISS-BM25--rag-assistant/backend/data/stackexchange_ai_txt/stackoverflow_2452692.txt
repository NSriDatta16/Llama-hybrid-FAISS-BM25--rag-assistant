I did a bit of this a couple of years ago with my dd-wrt and looking at my old installation notes and scripts, I didn't have to put anything into promiscuous mode. I also didn't specify an interface for tcpdump. Here is the command I was using that was working for me: /opt/sbin/tcpdump -s 1024 'host 192.168.1.111 and ((greater 137 and less 139) or (greater 900 and less 1024))' -w `date +%Y.%m.%d-%H.%M`-tcp.dmp -n -U -C 1 What happens if you use: ./tcpdump -w /tmp/capture.pcap 'host 192.168.3.105 or host 192.168.3.136'
