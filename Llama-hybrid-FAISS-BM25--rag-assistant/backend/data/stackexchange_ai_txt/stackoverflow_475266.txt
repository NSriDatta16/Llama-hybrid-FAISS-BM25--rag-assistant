You need a controller that sits outside the display widget but has the state of the tree (in MFc there are CTreeView/CTreeCtrl classes - there is a similiar separation in Qt) the tree controller handles all the data storage and calls redraws on the tree widget. Changes in the tree widget get sent to the tree controller - so this controller needs to know about the gui functions. The model will need set/get functions for all the relevant parameters for the nodes. But these can return simple types so aren't dependent on the gui. Updating the view form the model requires sending a message, if you don't want the model to know about your gui messaging the best you can do is register a callback function (a void pointer to a function) from the tree controller - and call this to do an update. This update function can then query the model for the changes.
