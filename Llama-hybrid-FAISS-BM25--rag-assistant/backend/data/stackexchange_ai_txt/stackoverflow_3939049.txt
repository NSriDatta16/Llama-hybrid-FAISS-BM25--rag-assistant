iPhone -- renew team provisioning profile

In the provisioning portal, the "renew" button for my team provisioning profile is grayed out. And said profile is expired. How can I renew it? EDIT: I found the "automatic device provisioning" checkbox and "refresh" button in the organizer in Xcode. But when I select the team profile, check the checkbox, and push the refresh button, I get this message: An unexpected error occurred. Please try again. If the problem persists, please contact Apple Developer Support (http://developer.apple.com/support). I suppose I can go to support, but it would still be better to figure out what the problem is without involving them.
