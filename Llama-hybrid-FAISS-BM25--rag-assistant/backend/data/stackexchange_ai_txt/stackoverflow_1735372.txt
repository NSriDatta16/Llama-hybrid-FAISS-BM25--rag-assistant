jQuery Sortable List - scroll bar jumps up when sorting

I created a demo: http://pastebin.me/584b9a86d715c9ba85b7bebf0375e237 When the scroll bar is at the bottom and you drag items to sort them, it causes the scroll bar to jump up. It seems to do this in FF, Safari, Chrome, and IE (at least IE8). In Firefox on my Mac, it does the jump up when the scroll bar is at the bottom, but also adds a nice flash to the whole list. It just flashes the whole list right as it scrolls it up. I believe that if I figure out what is causing the scroll up (and if I can stop it), the flashing will stop as well. I don't like it jumping up like that b/c I find it jarring and confusing. I know this is a bit of a corner case, but I'd like to fix it if I could. So, is there any way to prevent it from scrolling up? Alternately, what is causing it to scroll up? Thanks
