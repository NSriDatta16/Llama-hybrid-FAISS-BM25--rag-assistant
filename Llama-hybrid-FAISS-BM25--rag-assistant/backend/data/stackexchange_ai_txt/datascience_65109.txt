TL;DR Theoretically it is possible, but it is unlikely. 1) Uncommon subwords word1 = 'iiii' word2 = 'jjjj' word1_subwords = [' '] word2_subwords = [' '] In this example, there are basically 6 subwords: [' ', 'jj>'] , but these are not common subwords in general. So, there is a possibility that the embedding for all the subwords is the same (e.g. [0,0,...,0,0] ), making their sum all the same. 2) Homographs word1 = 'lie' # meaning: tell something untruthful word2 = 'lie' # meaning: to rest on a horizontal position In this example, there are two homograph words. These are different words but they have the same spelling. Since FastText only take syntax into account, they will have the same subword embedding sum.
