When you send a Location: header, the user-agent stops loading the current page and loads whatever page you tell it to load, so you'll never see the output. However, your code may * continue to execute in the background, so usually you want to follow your header() with an exit; to prevent unwanted behavior. * Depends on server configuration and on ignore_user_abort . Also, header("Location: /{$rawdata['htmltitle']}"); will suffice. Since you are redirecting to the same server, an absolute path suffices. Don't overcomplicate your redirects for nothing with $_SERVER variables.
