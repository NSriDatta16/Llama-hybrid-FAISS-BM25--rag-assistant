ASP.NET AJAX AsyncFileUpload UploadedComplete not fires

Thanks for your attention in advance, I'm new to ASP.NET AJAX AsyncFileUpload so I've created an aspx page to test it but it seems there's some bug with that control because the server side UploadedComplete event does not fire. the aspx : and the code behind public partial class Tester : System.Web.UI.Page { protected void AsyncFileUpload1_UploadedComplete(object sender, AjaxControlToolkit.AsyncFileUploadEventArgs e) { this.Label1.Text = "OK"; } } would anyone please let me know why it does not work? Thanks a lot
