Get itemâ€™s metadata with Entity Framework?

I'm working with Sharepoint 2010. I need to know the date of creation/edition and the author/editor of items in my sharepoint's Lists, but I didn't find a solution to map these columns with Entity Framework. I tried this kind of code : [Microsoft.SharePoint.Linq.ColumnAttribute(Name = "tp_author", Storage = "_author", ReadOnly = true, FieldType = "User")] public SPUser Author { get { return this._author; } set { if (!value.Equals(this._author)) { this.OnPropertyChanging("Author", this._author); this._author = value; this.OnPropertyChanged("Author"); } } } But with that code, Sharepoint give me this error: Invalid transfer type Microsoft.SharePoint.SPUser I also tried with other types for _author, but it doesn't change anything. Is there a way to make this mapping?
