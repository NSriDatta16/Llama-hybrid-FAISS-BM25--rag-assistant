I looked at their API, and it looks like there's a lot of detail, but the complexity is a hurdle. For long-term use it'd be best to figure it out, but for quick and dirty, here's a way to get at the data. I'm using Nokogiri , which is a XML/HTML parser, and very flexible. For ease of use I'm using CSS accessors. #!/usr/bin/env ruby require 'open-uri' require 'nokogiri' require 'uri' URL = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company' doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(URL)) infobox = doc.at('table[class="infobox vcard"]') infobox_caption = infobox.at('caption').text uri = URI.parse(URL) infobox_agents = Hash[ *infobox.search('td.agent a').map{ |a| [ a.text, uri.merge(a['href']).to_s ] }.flatten ] require 'ap' ap infobox_caption ap infobox_agents The output looks like: "Ford Motor Company" { "Henry Ford" => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford", "William C. Ford, Jr." => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clay_Ford,_Jr.", "Executive Chairman" => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman", "Alan R. Mulally" => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally", "President" => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President", "CEO" => "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer" } So, it's pulled the text of the caption, and returned a hash of the people's names, where the keys are their names and the values are the URLs.
