New Access database, how can it be done?

I have a project in C# using Microsoft Office Access for storage. I can read and save to the database. Now I need to allow the user to use the new database project but structured like the working one, and also to implement Save As option. Besides I need to export to a text file/CSV. Any ideas or sample codes would be helpful.
