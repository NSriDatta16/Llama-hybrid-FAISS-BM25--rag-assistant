From MSDN: Link Since the first execution of the query is where the performance gain is, leveraging pre-generated views in at least two cases will be of significant value: the warm up of a system and the execution of infrequently run queries. The use of less memory is also advantageous and is due to no longer having the overhead of keeping and creating the views. Precompiled views improve the performance of queries the first time they are run. Subsequent executions gain no improvement because the query is then compiled. This means that the benefit of precompiling any given query is dependent on when and how often it is executed.
