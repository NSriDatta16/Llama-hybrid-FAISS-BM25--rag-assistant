there are several packages that you can use in R for mixed logit estimation. Some use frequentists approaches based on simulated ML, others Bayesian approaches based on Markov Chains. **** R packages based on S-ML 1) mlogit 2) gmnl **** R packages based on Bayesian estimation 1) RSGHB https://github.com/RSGInc/RSGHB_Examples https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSGHB/vignettes/RSGHB_HowTo.pdf https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSGHB/RSGHB.pdf http://help.statwizards.com/data-wizard/statistics_programs/r_-_rsghb_package.htm 2) RStan based: https://rawgit.com/rtrangucci/class_20170809/master/multinomial-logit/multinomial-logit-regression.html there was also a code based on mlogit by Daniel Guhl posted somewhere, which I found easy to implement at the time, but cannot find at the minute. ************ Stata the major players here are 1) Hong Il Yoo (Durham Business School for packages lclogit and lclogitml) and 2) especially Arne Hole (Sheffield for packages mixedlogit and mixedlogitwtp to get models in WTP-space as per Scarpa, Thiene and Train AJAE 2008, Train & Weeks 2005). Look them up on the web. Good luck
