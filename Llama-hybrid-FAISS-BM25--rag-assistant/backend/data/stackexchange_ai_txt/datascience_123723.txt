Classifier learn from model or data

I'm new in data science. I read context . It saids "The clf (for classifier) estimator instance is first fitted to the model; that is, it must learn from the model. ...." and example shows: >>>clf.fit(digits.data[:-1], digits.target[:-1]) I don't understand why clf classifier "learn from the model". As example shows, I think classifier should learn from data, since it fits data to the clf classifier.
