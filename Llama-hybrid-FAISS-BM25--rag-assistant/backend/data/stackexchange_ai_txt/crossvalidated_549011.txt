convert the ATE Average Treatment Effect from a doubly robust model into Risk Ratio

How would one convert the ATE Average Treatment Effect from a doubly robust model into Risk Ratio? Can this be done directly without having to convert to odds ratio first. If so, how is this done. Can the conversion be directly applied to the confidence intervals or would bootstrapping have to be done?
