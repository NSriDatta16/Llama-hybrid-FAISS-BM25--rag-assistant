A similar approach is dimensionality reduction . In MATLAB you can easily perform PCA or Factor analysis . Alternatively you can take a wrapper approach to feature selection . You would search through the space of features by taking a subset of features each time, and evaluating that subset using any classification algorithm you decide (LDA, Decision tree, SVM, ..). You can do this as an exhaustively or using some kind of heuristic to guide the search (greedy, GA, SA, ..) If you have access to the Bioinformatics Toolbox , it has a randfeatures function that does a similar thing. There's even a couple of cool demos of actual use cases.
