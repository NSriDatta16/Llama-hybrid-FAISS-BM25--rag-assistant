Bootstrapping is indeed attractive. This procedure consists of drawing with replacement from the data, fitting the logistic model to obtain a new parameter estimate $\hat\beta$, and using that to compute upper and lower prediction limits for the sum of new responses. Repeating it will produce the (bivariate) bootstrap distribution of the prediction limits. Obtaining the prediction limits itself requires some simulation. In this case, with three categorical regressors, that can be done efficiently by noting only eight combinations are possible, and therefore the $50$ new responses can be grouped into eight groups and summed within each group (to produce a Binomial response). Thus, simulating a single sum of all response requires summing just eight Binomial variates. Doing this enough times will pin down the prediction limits with sufficient precision. Here are some illustrations. The data consist of all eight possible combinations of $A$, $B$, and $C$ (binary coded), each repeated 24 times for a total of 192 observations. The true model is that the logit of the response equals $A-C$. Indeed, the coefficients of $A$ and $C$ are significant in the actual data while the other two coefficients (intercept and $B$) are not. For each of $500$ bootstrap iterations, $200$ sums-of-responses were obtained in order to estimate a $95\%$ two-sided prediction interval $(\text{LPL},\text{UPL}]$. The correct prediction interval, based on the true model, is $(18, 31]$. The histograms show the marginal distributions of the prediction limits: LPL in blue, UPL in red. The correct limits of $18$ and $31$ are marked by vertical colored lines. The scatterplot indicates the bivariate relationship of the prediction limits. The mean width $\text{UPL}-\text{LPL}$ is $12.2$, plotted as the dark red line. The agreement of these results with the true values is encouraging. Iteration of this short experiment (using varying random number seeds) provides some intuition about how much can be expected from a dataset like this. Change the datasets to study any other situation in the same manner. beta
