Binned residual plot not good - what to do now?

I'm using lme4 package to run a mixed-effects logistic regression. I have a glmer model, and to assess its goodness of fit I created the binned residual plot. Unfortunately, 95% of the bins are not within the +/- 2 limit lines. So what to do now? Here is the plot: I tried to use the influence.ME package to detect the influential cases but I'm not sure whether I'm on the right track (and I get a Hessian convergence warning with the influence function). Here is my model: model Time and condition are categorical. Age is continuous. Any suggestions? Thank you for your time.
