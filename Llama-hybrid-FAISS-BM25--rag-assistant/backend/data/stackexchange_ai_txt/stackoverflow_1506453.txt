It looks like you included SQLAlchemy into a previously existing script that didn't use SQLAlchemy. There are too many moving parts here that none of us apparently understand well enough. I would recommend starting from scratch. Don't use threading. Don't use sqlalchemy. To start maybe don't even use an SQL database. Write a script that collects the information you want in the simplist possible way into a simple data structure using simple loops and maybe a time.sleep(). Then when that works you can add in storage to an SQL database, and I really don't think writing SQL statements directly is much harder than using an ORM and it's easier to debug IMHO. There is a good chance you will never need to add threading. "If you think you are smart enough to write multi-threaded programs, you're not." -- James Ahlstrom.
