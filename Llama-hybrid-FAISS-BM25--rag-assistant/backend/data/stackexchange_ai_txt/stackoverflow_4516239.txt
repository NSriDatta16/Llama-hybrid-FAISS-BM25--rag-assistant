Could someone please tell what is current state of practical human-like AI development in the world? OpenCog immediately comes to mind. In order to put this architecture to work, we have crafted a roadmap based on roughly mimicking the environment and development of young human children. A series of child-level learning tasks has been carefully laid out, which may be manifested via either virtual world agents or physical robots, and which lead from infant-level capabilities up to the grade school level. These tasks cover all the major cognitive capabilities displayed by young humans, and involve the integration of all major aspects of human intelligence, including perception, action, cognition, learning, memory, creativity, socialization, language, self-modeling, etc. Edit: Not sure how you are misled and think it is about "pop robotics", this page might summarize the project better for a new comer: The Open Cognition Project
