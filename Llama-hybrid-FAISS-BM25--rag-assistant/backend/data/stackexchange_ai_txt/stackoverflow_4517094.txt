By your question I suspect that you do not understand how variables to classes work. You do not need a global variable to only have one copy of your object. All variables will point on exactly the same object unless you Clone it or create a new one with the old one as prototype. A global variable will in other words change nothing unless you explicitly create new copies as described in the previous paragraph. I do also wonder how heavy your class can be if you think that the performance would be hurt by creating copies of it? How many mb do it weight? Update This article series describes in great detail what the heap and stack is: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/rmcochran/csharp_memory01122006130034pm/csharp_memory.aspx
