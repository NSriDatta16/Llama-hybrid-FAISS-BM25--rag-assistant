Using a protected (or private) member is definitely the correct way to share objects between methods in a class. However, your member should not be static . Static means there is a single instance across multiple threads. Every copy of the page which is being executed for the different requests accessing that page are competing to read/write that member. Also, your class is marked "partial". That means there could be another class fragment in another file which has additional members and methods for the same BuildPage class. If you declare the same pageData member in both, they will conflict.
