Rave Reports Master Detail giving evariantoverflowerror

I have a report that uses a master and a child query - the master selects three fields in a group by: billstatus, oscategory(server or workstation) and groupname The child query selects a bunch of information from the same view with no group by. I used the rave wizard to create a master detail report, linking the parent and child on groupname and oscategory. I have done this for many reports in the past... but this one is giving me fits... The queries will open without a problem, I can preview the report in Rave using F9 - but when I try to RUN the program to generate the report, it gives me the following error: class EVariantOverflowError with message 'Overflow while converting variant of type (Decimal) into type (Currency). I have no decimal values in the select list, however, the queries do use a couple of parameters: groupname, DateStart, and DateEnd Any ideas would be helpful at this point as I can't even run the report with no fields when I set it up as master/detail with the two queries master: SELECT groupname, oscategory, billstatus FROM MyView WHERE groupname = :groupname AND lastcheckin >= :StartDate AND firstcheckin 'Do Not Bill' GROUP BY groupname, oscategory, billstatus child: SELECT machine_groupid, agentguid, machName, groupname, firstcheckin, lastcheckin, currentuser, lastloginname, lastreboot, agentversion, contactname, contactemail, contactphone, contactnotes, enabletickets, enableremotecontrol, enablechat, loginname, credentialname, primarykserver, secondarykserver, quickcheckinsecs, agenttempdir, manufacturer, productname, machineversion, sysserialnumber, chassisserialnumber, chassisassettag, busspeed, maxmemorysize, maxmemoryslots, chassismanufacturer, chassistype, chassisversion, motherboardmanufacturer, motherboardproductcode, motherboardversion, motherboardserialnumber, computername, subnetmask, defaultgateway, dnsserver1, dnsserver2, dnsserver3, dnsserver4, dhcpenabled, dhcpserver, winsenabled, primarywinsserver, secondarywinsserver, connectiongatewayip, ostype, osinfo, majorversion, minorversion, macaddr, loginnamemach, billstatus, oscategory, cpudesc, cpuspeed, cpucount, totalram, (manufacturer + ' ' + LTRIM(RTRIM(productname))) as displaypc, ('CPU/Memory: ' + CONVERT(varchar(10), cpuspeed) + ' MHZ x ' + CONVERT(varchar(10), cpucount) + ' / ' + CONVERT(varchar(10), totalram) + ' Mb') as cpuspecs, (ostype + ' ' + osinfo) as osdisplay, (cpudesc + '/' + maxmemorysize + ' x ' + maxmemoryslots) as memorydisplay, ('Ip Address: ' + ipaddress) as ipinformation FROM MyView WHERE groupname = :groupname and machName is not null AND lastcheckin >= :StartDate AND firstcheckin 'Do Not Bill'
