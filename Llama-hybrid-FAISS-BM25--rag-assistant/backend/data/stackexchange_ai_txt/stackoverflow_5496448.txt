You get the same behavior as auto increment in for instance MySQL with this one: http://software-lab.de/doc/refG.html#genKey I use it a lot in the VizReader code. I'm not so sure I would've used it much though if I had know about the (id) function from the start: http://software-lab.de/doc/refI.html#id In my case it's all about displaying a nice id that is easy to relate for humans and JavaScript in my non-traditional gui and as you can see both approaches accomplish that but that latter is imo more elegant. /Henrik Sarvell (Copied verbatim form Henrik Sarvells' answer.)
