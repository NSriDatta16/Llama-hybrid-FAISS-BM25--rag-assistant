The problem may have something to do with the function that runs when the ready event is called. If I paste this function into Firebug console and run it, the modal window is displayed: $(function () { var dlg = jQuery("#divPopup").dialog({ modal: true, draggable: true, resizable: false, show: 'Transfer', hide: 'Transfer', height: 400, width: 480, minHeight: 400, minWidth: 480, autoOpen: false }); dlg.parent().appendTo(jQuery("#form1:first")); }); This suggests that when this is called the first time, it's not being properly bound to the DOM elements. An HTML Validation error could be related, or the doctype. I'm seeing warnings in my HTML Validator whereby the system thinks it's a different doctype. Additionally, any use of elements in a nonstandard manner could contribute to such behavior. The solution to this problem is a step by step reduction of elements on the page until the problem disappears, then to slowly add elements back in until you've found the one that throws off the parser. Alternatively, fix the doctype so it matches the standard of HTML coding used.
