Personal GIT repository

I use BitKeeper at work, and I would like to have a basic code backup for myself at home (considering I back up very rarely) // I have never used git before so I need lots of help I thought it might be a good idea to have a git repository on my home server, and then as I write code for school, work or personally I could simply clone branches from my home server work on them then push them back when I am done my work. // Please correct me if this is not how git works, or how I should be doing this I have installed git on my home server and would now like to know the best way to set it up, over ssh, git deamon ?? My server's port for ssh is already forwarded must I add new ones for git? And finally does this organization make sense to use git or is there a better product for me Thanks
