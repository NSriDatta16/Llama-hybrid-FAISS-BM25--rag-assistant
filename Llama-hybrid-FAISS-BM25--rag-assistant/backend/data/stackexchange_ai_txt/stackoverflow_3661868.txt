ContentNegotiatingViewResolver doesn't seem to support such behaviour. For now, I think your best bet is to subclass it and override the getMediaTypeFromParameter() method to throw an exception if the media type is not supported. You can throw any RuntimeException from that method, and if you annotate the exception class with @ResponseStatus , you can control the HTTP response code, e.g. @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_ACCEPTABLE) public class FormatNotSupportedException extends RuntimeException { } In the longer term, I strongly encourage you to file an issue with http://jira.springsource.org , asking for such functionality to be added to ContentNegotiatingViewResolver . They should be able to add this as an optional behavioural parameter. It's requests like these that mean Spring keeps getting better.
