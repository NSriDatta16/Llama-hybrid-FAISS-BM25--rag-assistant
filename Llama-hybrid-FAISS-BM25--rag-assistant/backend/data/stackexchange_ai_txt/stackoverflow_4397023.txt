How to distinguish Views from Tables in the EF MetadataWorkspace?

I am trying to process the metadata information for an Entity Framework data model by using the MetadataWorkspace . I know how to extract all tables, but the following code will return me all views and all tables from the storage model. using ( NorthwindEntities dbContext = new NorthwindEntities() ) { MetadataWorkspace workspace = dbContext.MetadataWorkspace; string temp = ( dbContext.Categories as ObjectQuery ).ToTraceString(); IEnumerable tables = workspace.GetItems ( DataSpace.SSpace ); } When I take a look at the edmx file, I can see that there is an attribute named store:Type that describes which EntitySet is a table and which is a View. Such property is not esposed by the EntityType object: So my question is: Is there a way to recognize which EntitySet is a table and which is a View by using only the MetadataWorkspace (I mean without processing the XML ;)) Thanks in advance
