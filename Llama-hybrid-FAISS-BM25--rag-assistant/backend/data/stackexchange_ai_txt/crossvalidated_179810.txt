If you want to get a master degree and eventually go to industry, I don't think you need take real analysis course. It is kind of too theoretical and far away from practical data mining techniques. On the contrary, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, statistics and optimization knowledge of undergraduate level is more helpful to appreciate almost all algorithms. However, if someone wants to do Phd in related area, e.g., machine learning or learning theory, it is totally recommended, even necessary.
