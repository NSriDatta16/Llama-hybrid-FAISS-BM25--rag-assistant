Is it possible to predict sentiment of unlabelled dataset using BERT?

I have a large unlabeled dataset and I want to predict sentiment for each document in this dataset. I want to know, is it possible that I can use BERT for sentiment analysis of unlabeled data? I have seen so many tutorials and read the blog posts but I couldn't find one. All shows the use of BERT on datasets that are already labeled such as the IMDB review dataset or Yelp review.
