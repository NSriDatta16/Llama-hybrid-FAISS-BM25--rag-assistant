Which IDEs Provide a Visual Design View for JSF using JSP?

NetBeans used to do that but with the deprecation of Woodstock (rather merging with ICEFaces) and with ICEFaces not supporting Visual Web Project it is difficult to choose NetBeans now [1]. Eclipse (the J2EE version) has a very basic version that provides drag and drop etc. of JSF controls. So, I wanted to know which free IDEs (if any!) are there that provide good support for web development using JSF. [1] http://www.icefaces.org/JForum/posts/list/13622.page
