The answer from Robert Mearns works if there are no embedded quotation marks in the data you are exporting. This may be a fairly safe assumption if you are not experiencing any other troubles using CSV. (It gets more complicated if you need to protect literal commas, quotation marks, or newlines in the data.) If you are dying to impress the end user, there are packages for generating native Excel documents (.xls) programmatically. I don't use .NET myself, so I don't know if there are any free ones for .NET. I use xlwt for Python (hmm... this would presumably work in IronPython), and there are some for Java, PHP, and Perl as well.
