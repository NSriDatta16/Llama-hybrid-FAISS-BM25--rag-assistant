You can set the threshold as a parameter in your model . The model will have these components: (1) linear part up to the threshold, (2) exponential part above the threshold, (3) the condition that the value of the two "sub-models" is identical at the threshold. You can then find the parameter values by likelihood optimization, or by MCMC. Of course, in order to calculate the likelihood, you will need to come up with the appropriate error structure (the stochastic part of the model), which will depend on the nature of your data.
