Declaring a variable with html in it, and inserting the variable by using .insertAfter

I was wondering if I could declare html as a variable. In other words, something like this: $(document).ready(function(){ var Bold="Yes! There is bold in the text above!!"; var NoBold="No... There isn't any bolded text in the paragraph above.."; var BoldButton=" "; $(BoldButton) .insertAfter('#intro'); }); And then, using the .insertAfter action, place it into my page at different intervals: $(BoldButton).insertAfter(#'intro'); This doesn't appear to work, am I close to something though?
