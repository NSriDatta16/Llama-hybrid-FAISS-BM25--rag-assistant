measuring variance of differences between two sets of corresponding means with significance

I have a dataframe id, w, x, y1, y2 (two categorical variables, two dependent variables) id is the index which is not particularly informative w, x are categorical variables - w in {0,1}, x in {0,1,2,3} y1 is counts which I calculate rates from y2 is price data which I use for average price I want to ensure w and x are unrelated - with statistical significance. I think I should do this by comparing differences in y1, y2 in samples [w=0] to [w=1] for each x d0y1 [from w0x0 and w1x0] and d1y1 [from w0x1 and w1x1] and d2y1 [from w0x2 and w1x2] and d3y1 [from w0x3 and w1x3] where dn is the difference between group means x in {0,1,2,3} for metric y1 Questions: is this the correct approach? what's the best statistical test to use? can I generate confidence intervals? python packages/code to accomplish these would be greatly appreciated
