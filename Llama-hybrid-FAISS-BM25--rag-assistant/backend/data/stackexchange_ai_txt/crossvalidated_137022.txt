how does a linear svm classifer work

I have been checking about SVMs in particular linear SVMs throughout many questions here. However, one problem i faced is that there seems to be no indepth explanation on how does linear SVM works in terms of equations. I understand that a linear SVM is actually a set of super long equation. For this case. Simply consider a 2 class problem : A and B. Suppose my linear SVM would be an equation of y - 2x + 7 = 0 In which case do i assign the point (2,3) to class A or class B. What would be the determining factor. Or am i totally missing the point in the question. What i would like to see is how the scores are computed and which class would the data point fall into. Simple explainations would be to have -1 to class A and 1 to class B or vice versa. However, the values usually do not exactly come up to 1 or - 1 I am not a mathematically inclined person. So i do not understand the very confusing and difficult equations presented in the papers
