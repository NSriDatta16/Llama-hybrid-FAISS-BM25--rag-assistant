The autocovariance function of this time series is indeed $0$ for $j \neq 0$ as you have computed quite correctly. So, the question is why R is giving a nonzero value for the acf . Unfortunately, acf is also an initialism for a uto c orrelation f unction which is defined as the value of $E[Y_tY_{t-j}]$, not $\operatorname{cov}(Y_t,Y_{t-j})$, in the engineering literature, and possibly in some parts of the statistical literature, and perhaps even in R. So, check what R believes acf means. If R does define the acf as $\operatorname{cov}(Y_t.Y_{t-j})$, but you are doing a simulation of the time series, then it is almost surely the case that the time-average value that your simulation gives does not exactly equal the ensemble average value of $0$. As long as the time average is small, nothing has gone wrong.
