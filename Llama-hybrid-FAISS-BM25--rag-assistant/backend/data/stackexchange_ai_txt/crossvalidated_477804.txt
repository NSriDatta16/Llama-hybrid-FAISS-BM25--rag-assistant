For the most part, people use probability-symmetric confidence intervals (CIs). For example, a 95% confidence interval is made by cutting off probability 0.025 from each tail of the relevant distribution. For CIs based on the symmetrical normal and Student t distributions, the probability-symmetric interval is the shortest. However, notice that the usual phrase is to find " a 95% CI," not the 95% CI." This recognizes the possibility of alternatives to the probability-symmetric rule. CI for normal mean, SD known. Suppose you have a random sample of size $n=16$ from a normal population with unknown $\mu$ and known $\sigma=10.$ Then if $\bar X = 103.2$ the usual (probability-symmetric) CI for $\mu$ is $\bar X \pm 1.96(\sigma/\sqrt{n})$ or $(98.30, 108.10)$ of length $9.80.$ qz = qnorm(c(.025,.975)); qz [1] -1.959964 1.959964 103.2 + qz*10/sqrt(16) [1] 98.30009 108.09991 diff(103.2 + qz*10/sqrt(16)) [1] 9.79982 However, another possible 95% CI for $\mu$ is $(98.07, 107.90)$ of length $9.84.$ This interval also has 95% 'coverage probability'. This is very seldom done in practice because (a) it takes a little extra trouble, (b) for practical purposes the result is the same, and (c) the alternative interval is a little longer. qz = qnorm(c(.02,.97)); qz [1] -2.053749 1.880794 103.2 + qz*10/sqrt(16) [1] 98.06563 107.90198 diff(103.2 + qz*10/sqrt(16)) [1] 9.836356 CI for normal SD, mean unknown. Now suppose we hava a sample of size $n=16$ for a normal population with unknown $\mu$ and $\sigma$ and we want a 05% CI for $\sigma.$ If $S = 10.2$ then the probability-symmetric 95% CI for $\sigma,$ based on $\frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \mathsf{Chisq}(\nu=n-1=16),$ is of the form $\left(\sqrt{\frac{(n-1)S^2}{U}}, \sqrt{\frac{(n-1)S^2}{L}}\right),$ where $L$ and $U$ cut probability 0.025 from the lower and upper tails, respectively, of $\mathsf{Chisq}(15).$ For our data, this computes to $(7.53,15.79)$ of length $8.25.$ qc=qchisq(c(.975,.025),15); qc [1] 27.488393 6.262138 sqrt(15*10.2^2/qc) [1] 7.53479 15.78645 diff(sqrt(15*10.2^2/qc)) [1] 8.251661 However, this is clearly not the shortest 95% CI based on this chi-squared distribution. If we cut probability 0.03 from the lower tail of the distribution and probability 0.02 from its upper tail, we can get the 95% CI $(7.43, 15.49)$ of length $8.06.$ qc=qchisq(c(.98,.03),15); qc [1] 28.259496 6.503225 sqrt(15*10.2^2/qc) [1] 7.431279 15.491070 diff(sqrt(15*10.2^2/qc)) [1] 8.05979 Moreover, cutting probability $0.04$ from the lower tail $(0.01$ from the upper), we'd get a CI of width $7.88.$ But a 4.5%-0.5% split gives a slightly longer interval than that. By trial and error (or a grid search) one could find (nearly) the shortest possible 95% CI. In my experience, even though such intervals are shorter, this is not usually done because (a) it is extra trouble and (b) for practical purposes, the result may be about the same. [However, in a practical application, if we were to get too far from cutting equal probabilities from the two tails, one may wonder whether a one-sided confidence interval (giving an upper or lower confidence bound on $\sigma)$ might be more useful.] Addendum. A plot of lengths of 95% CIs for $\sigma$ against the probability cut from the lower tail of $\mathsf{Chisq}(15).$ The minimum length $7.879782$ occurs when probability $0.041$ is cut from the lower tail. lp = seq(0.001, .049, by=.001) m = length(lp); len=numeric(m) for(i in 1:m) { L = qchisq(lp[i], 15) U = qchisq(.95+lp[i], 15) lcl = sqrt(15*10.2^2/U) ucl = sqrt(15*10.2^2/L) len[i] = ucl-lcl } plot(lp, len, type="l", lwd=2) min(len) [1] 7.879782 lp[len==min(len)] [1] 0.041
