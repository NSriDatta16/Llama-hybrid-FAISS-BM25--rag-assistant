have you tried performing a scrolling window average of your values ? Basically you perform a window of, say 10 values (from 0 to 9), and calculate its average. then you scroll the window one point (from 1 to 10) and recalculate. This will smooth the values while keeping the number of points relatively unchanged. Larger windows give smoother data at the price of loosing more high-frequency information. You can use the median instead of the average if your data happen to present outlier spikes. You can also try with Autocorrelation .
