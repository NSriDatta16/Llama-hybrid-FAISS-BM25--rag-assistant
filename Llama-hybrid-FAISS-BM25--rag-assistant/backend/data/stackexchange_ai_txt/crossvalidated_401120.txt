Interpretation of logistic regression coefficients when there are multiple levels

Suppose that the model had the following output: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.07 0.33 0.21 0.829 x0_low 0.44 0.22 1.96 0.049 * x1_m -0.51 0.25 -1.98 0.047 * x1_l -0.05 0.22 -0.24 0.809 x2_no 0.51 0.26 1.94 0.051 . where x0 has levels hi, low x1 has levels s, m, l x2 has levels yes, no I'm wondering what an interpretation for the coefficient x1_m would be. It seems as though it could be: x1_m reduces the log(odds) by roughly 40% having adjusted for x0 and x2 But what I'm a bit confused about is whether this is actually what it's saying, because x1_m is simply a level within the factor x1 , so does that change its meaning?
