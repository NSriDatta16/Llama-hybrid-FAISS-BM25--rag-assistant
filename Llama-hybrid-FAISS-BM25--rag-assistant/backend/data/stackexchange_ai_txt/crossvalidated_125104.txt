This began as a comment but grew too long; I decided to make it into more of an answer. Alexis' fine answer deals with the immediate question (in short: i. that logically ${A\implies B}$ doesn't mean $B\implies A$ ; and ii. the reverse statement is actually false in general), and Silverfish gives counterexamples. I'd like to deal with some additional issues and point out some extensive answers already here which are related to some extent. The statement on the Wikipedia page that you quote is not strictly true either. Consider, for example, the Cauchy distribution, which is certainly symmetric about its median, but which doesn't have a mean. The statement needs a qualifier such as 'provided the mean and skewness are finite'. Even if we reduce it to the weaker statement in the first half of the first sentence, it still needs "provided the mean is finite". Your question partly conflates symmetry with zero skewness (I assume you intend third moment skewness, but a similar discussion could be written for other skewness measures). Having 0 skewness doesn't imply symmetry. The later part of your quote and the section from Wikipedia quoted by Alexis mention this, though the explanation given in the second quote could use some tweaking. This answer shows that the relationship between third moment skewness and the direction of the relationship between mean and median is weak (third moment skewness and second-Pearson skewness needn't correspond). Item 1. on this answer gives a discrete counterexample, similar to but different from the one given by Silverfish. Edit: I finally dug up the unimodal example I was actually looking for earlier. In this answer I mention the following family: $\frac{1}{24}\exp(-x^{1/4}) [1 -\alpha \sin(x^{1/4})]$ Taking two specific members (say the blue and green densities in the specific example at that linked answer, which have $\alpha=0$ , and $\alpha=\frac{_1}{^2}$ respectively), and flipping one about the x-axis and taking a 50-50 mixture of the two, we would get a unimodal asymmetric density with all odd moments zero: (grey lines show the blue density flipped about the x-axis to make the asymmetry plain) Whuber gives another example here with zero skewness that's continuous, unimodal and asymmetric. I've reproduced his diagram: which shows the example and the same flipped about the mean (to clearly show the asymmetry) but you should go read the original, which contains a lot of useful information. [Whuber's answer here gives another asymmetric continuous family of distributions with all the same moments. Doing the same "choose two, flip one and take a 50-50 mixture" trick has the same outcome of asymmetric with all odd moments zero, but I think it doesn't give unimodal results here (though perhaps there are some examples).] The answer here discusses the relationship between mean, median and mode. This answer discusses hypothesis tests of symmetry.
