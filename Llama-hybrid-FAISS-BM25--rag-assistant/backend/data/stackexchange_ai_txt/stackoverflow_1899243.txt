GLM with autoregressive term to correct for serial correlation

I have a stationary time series to which I want to fit a linear model with an autoregressive term to correct for serial correlation, i.e. using the formula At = c1*Bt + c2*Ct + ut, where ut = r*ut-1 + et (ut is an AR(1) term to correct for serial correlation in the error terms) Does anyone know what to use in R to model this? Thanks Karl
