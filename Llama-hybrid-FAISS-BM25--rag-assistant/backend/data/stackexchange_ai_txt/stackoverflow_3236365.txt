I would use a performance profiler first (like gDEBugger ), so you can figure out if you are vertex, fragment or bus limited, etc. It's hard to guess what optimizations to perform in such a particular case (Intel + open source drivers). Did you also try VA mode? Are you using glDrawElements ? glDrawArrays ? Is the data vertex-cache friendly (pre and post transform)?
