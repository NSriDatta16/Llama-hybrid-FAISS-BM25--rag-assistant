How do you organize your resource files?

We're looking to use resource files (.resx) in an ASP.NET app for storing localized values. There may be thousands of strings in total across the site which we'll want to store. Is there a best practice for organizing values in to one or more resource files? Do you keep all values in one file? Do you separate in to multiple resource files based on subject matter? Perhaps there's a common resource file for the site's common values i.e. "Ok", "Continue", etc? It seems storing all resources in a single file will be overbearing for maintaining. Any suggestions?
