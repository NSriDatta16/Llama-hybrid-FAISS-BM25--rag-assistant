If you are only considering what is provided by default by Windows Azure, then the answer is no: to add a single ASPX page you have to redeploy the entire Azure package. Then, if you are willing to consider more complex schemes, then, yes, it is possible . Basically, you need some bootstrap logic within your WebRole that retrieves files from the cloud storage and pastes them into a local file directory within the Web Role. By doing so, the usual IIS7 behavior happens, and newly added ASPX files become visible in your webapp. Somehow, we did end-up implementing a similar pattern for Worker Roles (not Web Roles) within Lokad.Cloud . You could probably get inspiration from this project to setup the scheme that I am suggesting here.
