Is my Sales growth dependent on Commissions/Discounts and how do I analyze this in R?

We are capturing sales data by time series (Month by month). Some of the items have commissions and some have discounts and others have both commissions and discounts. Is it commissions or discounts or commissions + discounts that have impact on my sales growth? Or is it that my sales are growing because of those commissions or discounts or discounts+commissions? Can you suggest me the best model to solve my use case? I am thinking about multiple regression. But I want to double check with experts like you. Sample Data set: (5 variables) Year-Month -Product -Sales -Commission -Discounts 2013-01 Milk 300 No Yes 2013-02 Milk 400 No Yes 2013-03 Milk 200 No Yes 2013-04 Milk 150 No Yes 2013-05 Milk 500 No Yes 2013-01 Bread 800 Yes No 2013-02 Bread 879 Yes No 2013-03 Bread 790 Yes No 2013-04 Bread 459 Yes No 2013-05 Bread 600 Yes No 2013-01 Cheese 400 Yes Yes 2013-02 Cheese 350 Yes Yes 2013-03 Cheese 600 Yes Yes 2013-04 Cheese 590 Yes Yes 2013-05 Cheese 720 Yes Yes
