So, the question is how to model the following problem: input a sub section of a sequence, then output the rest of the sequence. This is a sequence-to-sequence problem. For this, as Derek O has eluded to, I would suggest a encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder, you would encode your input sequence (using RNN/LSTM), which will give you a "hidden representation", then pass your hidden representation through a decoder (RNN/LSTM) to then decode the hidden representation into the resining sequence of integers. Here is an article that provides more detail around encoder-decoder models: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-encoder-decoder-sequence-to-sequence-model-679e04af4346
