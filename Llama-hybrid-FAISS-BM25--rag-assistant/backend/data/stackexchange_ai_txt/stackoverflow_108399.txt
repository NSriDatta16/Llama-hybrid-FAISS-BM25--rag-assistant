What embedded database with Isolated Storage support can you recommend?

I'm looking for embedded database engine supporting isolating storage . Currently I'm aware of VistaDB. What else you can recommend? Requirements are pretty simple: xcopy deployment support for isolated storage preferably free Note that you don't know exact path to the file when using IS.
