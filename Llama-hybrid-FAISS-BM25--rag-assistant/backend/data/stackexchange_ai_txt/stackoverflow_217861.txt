Imagine a neural network with parsing capabilities in each node or neuron. Depending on rules and parsing results, neurons fire. If certain neurons fire, you get a good idea about topic and semantic of the question and therefore can give a good answer. Memory is done by keeping topics talked about in a session, adding to the firing for the next question, and therefore guiding the selection process of possible answers at the end. Keep your rules and patterns in a knowledge base, but compile them into memory at start time, with a neuron per rule. You can engineer synapses using something like listeners or event functions.
