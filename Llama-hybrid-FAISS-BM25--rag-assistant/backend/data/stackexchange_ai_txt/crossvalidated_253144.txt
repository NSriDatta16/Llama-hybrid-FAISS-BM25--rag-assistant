Not a full answer but some potentially useful comments: This kind of experimental design is also known as paired comparisons and a popular and simple stochastic model for it is the Bradley-Terry model . This tries to recover a latent strength for each object in the comparison by fitting a logistic regression model. It is also applicable if the subjects that do the rating do not see all $n \choose 2$ possible pairs. However, I'm not sure whether there are results how you have to design the experiment in order to get the full vector of all $n$ strenghts if you limit the number of comparisons for each subject. As the model is a simple logistic regression there may be results for GLMs that could be leveraged, though. R packages implementing the Bradley-Terry and related models include: prefmod ( http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v048.i10 ), BradleyTerry2 ( http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v048.i09 ), eba , psychotools , among others. As for the application to color preferences: I would also doubt that you will get a winner (= color with the highest strength) whose strength significantly differs from the second- or third-ranked color in a design with 50 colors and only 100 judges. Also, one would have to keep in mind that the judges' preferences may vary or depend on further covariates etc.
