Here's the project done by students. It might work out as a good sample. Sqwarea, open source game on Windows Azure This project aim to be an in-browser, minimalistic, massively multiplayer strategy game. It is done as a part of the "GÃ©nie logiciel et Cloud Computing" course at the Ens. In the game you are a King battling over a gigantic map to conquer the world. Train soldiers, conquer new territories, and resist the assault from other kingdoms. You can read the rules here. It is a massively multiplayer online game: all the players are on the same map, which is an infinite 2D square matrix. Sqwarea is developed using Microsoft.NET technologies (Visual C#, ASP.NET MVC...) and will be hosted using the Windows Azure cloud services in order to be scalable. alt text http://vermorel.com/storage/thumbnails/5041097-6720829-thumbnail.jpg
