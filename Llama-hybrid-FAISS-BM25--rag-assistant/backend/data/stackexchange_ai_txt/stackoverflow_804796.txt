Note that: The restriction 1 is from the classical knapsack problem , which works on sets, as requested by restriction 2. Restriction 3 is rather vague. It is better to have higher value or higher coverage of the lifespan? If you don't specify a objective function to maximaze (or, to be precise, there are two: lifespan itself and rate), there are some pareto optimal solutions. Restriction 4 is implementable by making a map object -> last time selected., in the form of black list. Long story short: first I'd filter the set by blacklisting the object by restriction 4, and then apply a knapsack algorithm.
