If you intend to do a lot of Bayesian statistics you would find it helpful to learn the BUGS/JAGS language, which can be accessed in R via the R2OpenBUGS or R2WinBUGS packages. However, for the sake of a quick example that doesn't require understanding BUGS syntax, you could use the "bayesm" package which has the runiregGibbs function for sampling from the posterior distribution. Here is an example with data similar to that which you describe..... library(bayesm) podwt Extracts from the output are: Anova: Bayesian: Summary of Posterior Marginal Distributions Moments mean std dev num se rel eff sam size 1 2.18 0.40 0.0042 0.99 9000 2 -0.55 0.25 0.0025 0.87 9000 Quantiles 2.5% 5% 50% 95% 97.5% 1 1.4 1.51 2.18 2.83 2.976 2 -1.1 -0.97 -0.55 -0.13 -0.041 lm(): Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Of course it is also worth inspecting the MCMC diagnostic plots - posterior density, trace plot, auto correlation - that I also gave the code for above which (plots not shown).
