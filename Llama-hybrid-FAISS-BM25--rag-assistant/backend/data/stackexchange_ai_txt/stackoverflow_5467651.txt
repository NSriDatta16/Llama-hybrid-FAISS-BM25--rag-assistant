I would rather suggest to use as image, because you can later change whatever style you want to do, and have fun in inserting interesting variation of design, for your website. @Jeaffrey Gilbert has already give you the solution in simple html+css code, I will give you mine about CSS3 using multiple backgrounds. And you do not need to adding HTML (but it will work only or every decent browser and not for Internet Explorer) background: url(image_1.gif) top left no-repeat, url(image_2.gif) bottom right no-repeat;
