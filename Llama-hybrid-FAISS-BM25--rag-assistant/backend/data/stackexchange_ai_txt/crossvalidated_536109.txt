The downside of using XGBoost compared to a neural network, is that a neural network can be trained partially whereas an XGBoost regression model will have to be trained from scratch for every update. This is because an XGBoost model uses sequential trees fitted on the residuals of the previous trees so iterative updates to the model are not really possible. Someone did attempt this but didn't get very good results : but I don't see why it could not work in theory.
