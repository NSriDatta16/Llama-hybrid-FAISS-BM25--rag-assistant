Freeware similar to MS Access for SQL-less data mining, querying and reporting

I am looking for freeware similar to MS Access for data mining, querying and reporting without really writing SQL (which I know very well but sometimes I feel lazy and would rather just drag and drop). I had used MS Access with ODBC connections to all sorts of external RDBMSs that create an Access pseudo-table as a link that you can do everything with that you can with a regular Access table. Any suggestions? I use a OSX at work and Fedora Linux at home. I also use DBeaver as my multi database SQL client but that does not do GUI query building and reports.
