Why do we insist on any form of hypothesis test in statistics? In the wonderful book Statistics as Principled Argument Robert Abelson argues that statistical analysis is part of a principled argument about the subject in question. He says that, rather than be evaluated as hypotheses to be rejected or not rejected (or even accepted!?!) we should evaluate them based on what he calls the MAGIC criteria: Magnitude - how big is it? Articulation - Is it full of exceptions? Is it clear? Generality - How generally does it apply? Interestingness - Do we care about the result? Credibility - Can we believe it?
