Alternative XCode documentation readers

The XCode developer documentation manager is pretty good on the whole (search is speedy, formatting is good, organization is pretty good, etc), but there are a couple of things that I feel are missing including (or may just have missed): Fuzzier search: after typing "UITabelViwCell" a bunch of times, it would be nice to get some suggestions. Ability to view multiple docs (tabbing or multiple windows). History/frequency-aware suggestions (maybe project-aware too). Some links are missing. I can't remember exactly where, but I seem to think it's around typedefs or enums or other less object-oriented places. Back-button support can be flaky sometimes. So is there any kind of documentation tool that provides these kinds of features or am I somehow wrong for wanting them?
