MySQL: Do I have to purchase a license for InnoDB if I plan to use it in a for-profit setting (commercial use)?

If I plan to use MySQL on a web-development project (example.com) where my web application is a commercial product where I'm selling a service and it just so happens that MySQL, using the InnoDB engine, is the backend data storage for my web application ... do I have to purchase a commercial license to use MySQL/InnoDB? If I do have to purchase a commercial license, can anyone recommend a good alternative to MySQL that's free (no strings attached). Thanks
