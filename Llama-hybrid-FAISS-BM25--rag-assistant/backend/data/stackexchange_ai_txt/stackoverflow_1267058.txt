In order to respond to a custom multi-touch gesture such as a rotation, you'll need to subclass either the image view or the view containing it and build a custom implementation of the following methods: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void) touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; Essentially, think of the iPhone screen as a graph, and fingers as points. You use the above methods in a view to figure out how/where fingers are on the graph.
