My bet is, go for the entire list of classes whatever you can. Treat this as a multi-label classification approach. You can get more than one result. If you are using deep learning, you can opt for sigmoid as activation function in the output layer instead of softmax. Can't say for sure whether your accuracy will increase for the deep learning model, depends on the quality and quantity of data.
