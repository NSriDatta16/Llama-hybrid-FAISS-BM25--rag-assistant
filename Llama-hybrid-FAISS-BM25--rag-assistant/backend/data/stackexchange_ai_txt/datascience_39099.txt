What is an intuitive explanation for the Importance Weighted Autoencoder?

I have been reading a paper by Burda et al . on Importance Weighted Autoencoders(IWAE) but I can't quite grasp what they mean by sampling the terms h 1... h k. Do they mean you have separate models from which you sample and then average over?
