Swing: How can I prevent flickering and "vibrating" of a component, when restricting its movement?

I need to restrict movement of a component (JInternalFrame) inside a JPanel. More exact: a component should only move along one axis when dragged by the user. I tried to do it by adding a component listener and reset the position of one axis everytime the component moves. But it "vibrates" (moves rapidly during dragging). I even wrote a custom layout manager, it didn't help a little! I guess, the problem is: Both the layout manager and the listener handle the movement-event after the component is actually moved, right? Any suggestions? Should (can I) intercept some event, and modify it, before it's delivered?
