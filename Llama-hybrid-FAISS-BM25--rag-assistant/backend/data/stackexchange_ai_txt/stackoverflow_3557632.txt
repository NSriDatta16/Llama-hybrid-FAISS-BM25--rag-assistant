I've found a nice javascript example for drag and drop in a timetable , it should be possible to adapt that for my case. I'll just have to figure out how to best integrate it with Drupal. Edit: The script I've mentioned at the top of the answer did not work inside my Drupal installation so I switched to Jquery UI. I've implemented it now as a custom Drupal module that uses JQuery UI for Drag&Drop functionality. I've enabled Drag&Drop for a HTML table, to save the timetable the elements of the table are read out via Javascript and then sent to my custom Drupal module using ajax.
