Identify trends from thousands of time series plots

Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I have like 100s of thousands of time series data and their respective graphs. I want to be able to classify the general trend for all of these curves whether they are trending downwards or upwards or constant throughout. Not sure how to go about it. Maybe apply time series models but most data may not even meet stationarity conditions. Or maybe use GAMs? I don't know. I would really appreciate if someone can shed some light on this. I have attached 30 random sample plots. (Each pic has 15 random sample plots). Thanks
