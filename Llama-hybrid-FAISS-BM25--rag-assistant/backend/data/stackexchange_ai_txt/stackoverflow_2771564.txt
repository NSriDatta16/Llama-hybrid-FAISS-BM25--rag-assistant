I've used Krystalware's SlickUpload ASP.NET control in the past to take care of the uploading part for you (you can use the in built control if you want to but this has a lot of the nifty ajax-style features done for you and is quite cheap). Edit: [I would not advocate storing the music file itself in the database. Much better [in my humble opinion] only to store the location of the file in the database. If you use one of the cloud services listed below then the location might simply be an HTTP link] I'd also seriously consider using a cloud storage service for storing the music files. Something like Amazon S3 or Rackspace Cloud Files . CloudFiles is good because, if you wish, you can also enable CDN delivery (Content Delivery Network) which means your users can access the uploaded music tracks much faster than if served off your local web server, for instance. Hope this helps, Richard.
