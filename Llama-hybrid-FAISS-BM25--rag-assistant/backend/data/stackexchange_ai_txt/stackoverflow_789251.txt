Is there an easy to understand guide (new to Cocoa, Xcode, etc) for Interface Builder that talks about proxy objects?

Back in the day of C/C++, the part of the language that really hung me up was pointers. I understand them now, of course. Now, Interface Builder Proxy Objects or more importantly, how to use Interface Builder and what to put in the .XIB window (window that contains the File's Owner, First Responder, etc...) for a given XIB. I've gone through quite a few examples from books and samples found both in Xcodes examples and around the web. They have been helpful, but I still feel a little lost. I feel that understanding IB is very important to understanding how to write Mac/iPhone/iPod touch applications. I have gone through the following resources so far: Aaron Hillegass' Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X Pragmatic Programmer resources: Becoming Productive in Xcode (screencast) Cocoa Programming Coding in Objective-C 2.0 (screncast) Writing Your First iPhone Application (screencast) iPhone SDK Development I've also gone over the Interface Builder Users Guide PDF from Apple. Any suggested tips/resources will be appreciated!
