Semantic web efforts are still sputtering along. I've run across a couple of research efforts to use RDF triples including the Dublin Core... but nothing close to commercialization. However, as a general organizing principle for the world wild web? Don't bother. My guess is that folksonomies will deal with some metadata management, but that site tagging will need to be handled through ontological deduction of some sort. I get the same feeling around DC and RDF that I get around general-purpose globally open UDDI registries: nice idea, but that's not the way the world works. It would be kinda interesting to know whether DC tags increase your Google Page Rank (and how reliably): that could be a strong incitament for many!
