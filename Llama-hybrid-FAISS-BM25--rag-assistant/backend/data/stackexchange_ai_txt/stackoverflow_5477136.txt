I tend to favour the redirect. If someone is coming from somewhere they shouldn't be coming from, or doing something they shouldn't be doing - I just take them someplace else, silently and without fuss. If you fill in my form and it doesn't validate server side, I take you back to the form, point out your mistakes, pre-fill it with your values and encourage you to try again. If you don't fill in my form and it doesn't validate server side, I either do the same as above, or I just dump you on the form page as though it never happened. The important thing is that if you don't want people to be able to directly POST data to a page, that you stop them from doing so - its less important what you actually do with the user since they are clearly using your site in an unnatural way. They are probably automated bots and could not care less what happened to them anyway, especially if you're talking about some form that could be construed as something that might allow comments or otherwise publish some text to a site. The spammers just LOVE those. On that note - you should of course take care to protect your site from bots that can recognise what a valid POST looks like and spoof it. Something like ReCaptcha does the trick, but there are many ways to do it.
