Evaluating string templates

I have a string template as shown below template = ' #{content} ' I want to evaluate the template based on current value of the variable called content . html = my_eval(template, "Hello World") This is my current approach for this problem: def my_eval template, content "\"#{template.gsub('"', '\"')}\"" # gsub to escape the quotes end Is there a better approach to solving this problem? EDIT I used HTML fragment in the sample code above to demonstrate my scenario. My real scenario has set of XPATH templates in a configuration file. The bind variables in the template are substituted to get a valid XPATH string. I have thought about using ERB, but decided against as it might be a overkill.
