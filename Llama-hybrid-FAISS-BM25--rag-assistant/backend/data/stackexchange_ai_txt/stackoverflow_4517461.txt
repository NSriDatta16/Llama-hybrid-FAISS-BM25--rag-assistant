You could write your own Appender by extending the org.apache.log4j.AppenderSkeleton . You can make him configurable for several data storages and define how to split up the LoggingEvent where you can get the seperated informations as line-number, class-name, message, logger-severity etc. public class StorageBasedAppender extends AppenderSkeleton { [...] @Override protected void append(LoggingEvent event) { // Write to your database or other storages } } You could enhance this class by making it configurable and more. If you don't need somewhat specific, regardings to the other questions make use of the JDBCAppenderConfiguration . Which can be configured easily
