Dynamic Time Warping: Why does a Sakoe-Chiba band take much more time to calculate than no window?

I'm using dynamic time warping to calculate a distance matrix for a set of about 25 multivariate time series. Each individual time series has over 1000 timestamps, and they are all the same length. When I use a Sakoe-Chiba window of 50, it averages 3.78 seconds to calculate the distance between two multivariate time series. When I use a Sakoe-Chiba window of 10, it averages 3.32 seconds. As expected, the smaller window took less time, since there are fewer local and cumulative distances to calculate. However, if I use no window at all, it averages 0.29 seconds. That's over 10 times faster, but this makes no sense to me since it's essentially using the largest possible window. Why is this happening? What am I misunderstanding here? If it matters, I'm using the dtw-python package.
