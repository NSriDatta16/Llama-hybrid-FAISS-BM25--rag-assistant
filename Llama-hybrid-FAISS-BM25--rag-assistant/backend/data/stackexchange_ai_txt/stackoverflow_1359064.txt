The beauty of binary data is that its is generally of very fixed format. A typical method of parsing it is to declare a structure that maps onto the received packets, and then to just use type-casts to read the fields as structure elements. The beauty is that this requires no parsing. you have to be careful about structure packing rules, and endian-ness to make the structure map exactly the same way. Use of the C "offsetof" and "sizeof" macros is useful to emit some debug info to check that your structure is indeed mapping to what you think it is mapping. Packing rules can typically be altered either by directives (such as #pragma's) or command line options. Endian-ness you are stuck with. If its different from what your embedded system uses, declare all the fields as bytes, or use something like the "ntoh" macro to do the byte swapping.
