The web.config section is pretty useless as far as I can tell: I looked in IIS 7, and in the Authentication section it says: Anonymous Authentication = Enabled, ASP.NET Impersonation = Disabled, Basic Authentication = Disabled, Forms Authentication = Disabled. Also, I have made no changes to the code other than dragging a Login object onto the designer and changing the page it points at to index.html. Currently, the log in fails by displaying the log in failed text. EDIT: Earlier when I would try to navigate directly to a page that is restricted, I would receive a blue page saying that I had insufficient permissions. Now I can see the pages that are restricted without logging in even though I have anon access denied.
