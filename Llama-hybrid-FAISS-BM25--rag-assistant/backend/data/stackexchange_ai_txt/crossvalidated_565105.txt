I looked back at my time series notes in response to your question. I hope the points below on unit root tests are made relatively clear. In particular, I always found it best to understand the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) by first understanding the Dickey-Fuller (DF) test: The Dickey-Fuller Test: Suppose that we have an AR(1) unit root process: $$y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t, \qquad \epsilon_t \sim(0,\sigma^2) $$ The DF proceeds by taking advantage of the fact that a first-differenced random walk/unit root process is stationary. In other words, the first-differenced coefficient $\psi_1$ of a random walk should be zero; given the non-first differenced random walk coefficient is 1. The null and alternative hypothesis of the DF test are thus expressed: \begin{equation} \begin{split} H_0: & \psi_1 = 0 \\ H_A: & \psi_1 Upon which we test the first-differenced process: \begin{equation} \begin{split} y_t - y_{t-1} & = \phi_1 y_{t-1} - y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\ \Delta y_t & = (\phi_1 - 1)y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\ \Delta y_t & = \psi y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \end{split} \end{equation} The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test: Note that upon closer inspection of the the standard DF test, we required that $\epsilon_t$ is is a stationary white noise error term. \begin{equation} \Delta y_t = \psi y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \end{equation} Yet, the validity of the DF test is clearly undermined in the circumstances where the assumption regarding the error does not hold. The ADF test overcomes this problem by placing lags of the dependent variable on the right-hand side to ensure that the error is zero. \begin{equation} \Delta y_t = \alpha_0 + \psi_1 y_{t-i} + \gamma t \sum_{i=1}^{p-1} \delta_i\Delta y_{t-i} + \epsilon_t \end{equation} \begin{equation} \begin{split} H_0: & \psi_1 = 0\\ H_A: & \psi_1 The additional terms in the model such as $\alpha_0$ and $t$ express any additional deterministic terms required in the specification of the model. Overall, the ADF test generates a p-value where we would reject the null (unit root) if within the 0.05 rejection region.
