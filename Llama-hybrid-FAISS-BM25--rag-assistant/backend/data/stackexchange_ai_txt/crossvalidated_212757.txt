Probability of getting two components in a graph

The following problem is an excerpt from the book Introduction to Probability Models , 10th edition, by Sheldon Ross. The origin of this problem is from $\S3.6.2$ A Random Graph , specifically after Equation (3.23) on page 147. Here goes the problem: Some backgrounds: Let $C$ denote the number of connected components of our random graph, where each node has one arc emanating from it, and each component consist of several connected nodes. Let $$P_n(i) = P\{C = i\}$$ where we use the notation $P_n(i)$ to make explicit the dependence on $n$ , the number of nodes. For example, $P_k(1)$ denotes the probability that there exists a connected component consists of $k$ nodes. To obtain $P_n(2)$ , the probability of exactly two components in a graph with $n$ nodes, let us first fix attention on some particular node—say, node $1$ . In order that a given set of $k − 1$ other nodes—say, nodes $2, . . . , k$ —will along with node $1$ constitute one connected component, and the remaining $n − k$ a second connected component, we must have $X(i) \in \{1, 2, . . . , k\}$ , for all $i = 1, . . . , k$ . $X(i) \in \{k + 1, . . . , n\}$ , for all $i = k + 1, . . . , n$ . The nodes $1, 2, . . . , k$ form a connected subgraph. The nodes $k + 1, . . . , n$ form a connected subgraph. The probability of the preceding occurring is clearly $$ \left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^k \left(\frac{n-k}{n}\right)^{n-k} P_k(1)P_{n-k}(1) $$ and because there are ${n−1 \choose k−1}$ ways of choosing a set of $k−1$ nodes from the nodes $2$ through $n$ , we have: $$P_n(2) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{n−1 \choose k−1}\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^k \left(\frac{n-k}{n}\right)^{n-k} P_k(1)P_{n-k}(1) $$ . Here are my questions: Why is the probability of being in the first component as $\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)$ for each node in the second to last equation? It occurs to me the probability of two consecutive selections are dependent, i.e., if we have $k$ nodes in the first component, the probability of choosing one node, which happens to be in the component, is $\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)$ , then the next node being chosen will have a probability of $\left(\frac{k-1}{n-1}\right)$ to appear in the same component. Why in the last equation will we choose the $k$ nodes by first fix one and then choose the left $k-1$ ? Why don't we choose the $k$ nodes at once? i.e., $$P_n(2) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{n \choose k}\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)^k \left(\frac{n-k}{n}\right)^{n-k} P_k(1)P_{n-k}(1) $$ .
