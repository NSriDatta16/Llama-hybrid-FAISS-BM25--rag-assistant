Making the shift from writing tests for MVP to MVC

I'm migrating a webforms application written w/ MVP to leverage the MVC framework and wanted to know how I should be testing a simple controller action that returns a partialview. When using MVP i would assert true for each property on the view = the expected value. Controller action under test _ Function Edit(ByVal id As Integer) As ActionResult Dim Form As Form = mFormService.GetFormById(id) Return PartialView("Form", Form) End Function What I want to verify is the "Form" values show up correctly in the view (but is this what I should be testing as I did when using the MVP pattern?)
