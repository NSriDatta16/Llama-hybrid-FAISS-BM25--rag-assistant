This question essentially boils down to the difference between the effect size for a matched-pairs t-test and a 2 independent samples t-test (the former would be the correlated version in your example above). Simply put, these are different statistical tests asking different research questions under different assumptions on the data. For the matched-pairs approach, the bivariate data can be reasonably transformed into a univariate data set: the gain or difference scores for each individual. Thus, the question becomes a measure of how much each individual respondent gained (as opposed to where they actually ended up). Thus, the effect size is given by $$d = \frac{\overline{d}}{s_d}$$ where $\overline{d}$ is the average gain score (which is mathematically equivalent to the difference in the means) and $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the difference scores. (I didn't work it out, but I'm pretty sure this is equivalent to the formula you've provided in the OP.) For the 2 independent samples t-test, the effect size is calculated using the pooled standard deviation $$d = \frac{\overline{x}_1-\overline{x}_2}{s_\text{pooled}}$$ This will not give the exact same value of $d_\text{av}$ above, but it will be reasonably close. This is just a measure of how far part averages are in terms of the best measure of "communal" spread for the two groups, i.e., how many standard deviations away are the two means. Happy to clarify more if needed.
