You may want to look at this paper ! And other works by these authors. I can't remember exactly where, but I have seen your first graph in their papers, and some proofs along with it. I think this can be done by leveraging copulas (as Kendall tau and Spearman rho can be written as a function of the underlying copula between the two variables). Hope it helps. $C$ is the copula of $(X,Y). $ $$\tau(X,Y) = 4\int_0^1 \int_0^1 C(u,v) c(u,v)~\mathrm du\mathrm dv - 1$$ (Kendall correlation is the expectancy of the copula rescaled into $[0,1]$ ) $$\rho(X,Y) = 12 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 C(u,v) ~\mathrm du\mathrm dv- 3.$$ Then, $|\tau - \rho| \leq \ldots$
