Is the accuracy calculated enough to make a valid assumption?

We did an experiment with colors. We compared the value of the CMY of the output color of our experiment against the reference value. We calculated the percent error for each of the color values, and then calculated its accuracy. The percent error was calculated by getting the absolute value of the difference between each color value. The accuracy was calculated by getting the average of the three percent error values and then subtracting it from 1. Keep in mind that the values are in percentages in decimal form. The question is, is the value for the accuracy sufficient enough to create a valid assumption? For example, from the image below, can I safely conclude that there is no statistical difference between the output value and the reference value using the accuracy? Or is there another calculation to be done? If so, what are these tests?
