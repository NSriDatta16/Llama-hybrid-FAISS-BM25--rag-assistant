EDIT: an important warning about choosing the likelihood from the density plot of the data. In these cases, there is the risk of overfitting the data. Here a good answer about how to reduce this risk https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/20738/289381 (Gelman's advise is to use a leave-one-out cross-validation). From the density plot of the "volume" variable, its distribution is a mixture of two log-normal (notice the right shoulder "peak"): You can find some details about a mixture of two Gaussians here https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/474775/289381 This is how I fitted its parameters using a Bayesian approach using the R package brms library(brms) dat This is the plot of the posteriors (the names of the parameters are quite clear, $\theta$ represents the probability to belong to the first or the second component of the mixture): plot(mdl_1, N=6) This is the posterior predictive check that shows that the fitted distribution capture the data reasonably well: pp_check(mdl_1, nsamples = 50) duration The data looks highly skewed to the right. I am not sure if the outliers are expected or are the result of something that went wrong. The log-normal distribution seems to fit well the data as you can see here from the posterior predictive distribution These are the posterior for the mean and st.dev. of the log-normal distribution: This is the code (using brms ): mdl_ln
