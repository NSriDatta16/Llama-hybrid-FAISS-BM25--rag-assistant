Time series analysis VAR model: AIC and BIC test criteria

Consider two variables. Imagine you want to analyse the effects of the lags of variable A on variable B. The possiblity you see an effect of variable A on B is reasonable, but there is absolutely no way variable B is predictive of variable A. In this instance, when you construct the VAR model, do you care about AIC and BIC information criteria (since variable B doesn't help predict variable A)? Or would you consider a certain time-frame (for example 6 months or a year)?
