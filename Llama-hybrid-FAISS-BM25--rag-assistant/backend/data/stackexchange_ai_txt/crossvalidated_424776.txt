How to apply Bayesian learning to paired data

This might be a beginner's question, but I can't find a good answer elsewhere. Suppose I have some prior distribution $P(E|H)$ representing how likely a certain value $e \in E$ is, given some precondition $h \in H$ . I want to improve this distribution by making some observations $\{(h_0, e_0), (h_1, e_1), \dots\}$ . How do I update $P$ with these new observations?
