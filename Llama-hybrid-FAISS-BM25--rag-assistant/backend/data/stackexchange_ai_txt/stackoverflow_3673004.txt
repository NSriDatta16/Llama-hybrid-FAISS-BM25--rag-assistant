The do { x } while (y) construct runs x once, and then proceeds to run x continuously as long as y is true. You're not having any success because you seem to be structuring it like this: do { // This will just run over and over... } while (condition); // ...because this is always true. break; // This isn't even in the loop! In other words, the point where you're trying to add your break (based on a comment you left on another answer) is outside the loop, which is why your code is running indefinitely. Now, it sounds like you're really just trying to use a do / while to emulate an if statement, presumably as a challenge to yourself. If that is the case, do yourself a favor and give up on that idea. You cannot use a do / while loop to emulate an if condition, because do will always run at least once. The only way you could ensure that it runs exactly once under a specific condition (i.e., what if does) would be by embedding an if statement inside the do loop, which would defeat the purpose of the exercise. That said, you can emulate an if with a while : while (condition) { // Execute code once. break; // Then just quit. }
