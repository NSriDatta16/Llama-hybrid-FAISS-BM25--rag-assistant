As pointed by lukas , there is no Sivlerlight runtime for Windows Mobile. That being said, an application specifically targeting WP7 cannot run on WM due to lack of necessary resources and components. WM supports .NET Compact Framework and that's pretty much the extent of .NET development you can leverage on that platform.
