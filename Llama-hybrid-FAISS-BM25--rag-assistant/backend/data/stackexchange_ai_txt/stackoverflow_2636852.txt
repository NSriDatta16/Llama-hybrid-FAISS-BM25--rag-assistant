From the "manual" (.net framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation): Unlike the application programming interface (API) for files stored arbitrarily in the file system, the API for files in Isolated Storage does not support checking for the existence of a file directly like File.Exists does. Instead, you need to ask the store for a list of files that match a particular file mask. If it is found, you can open the file, as shown in this example string[] files = userStore.GetFileNames("UserSettings.set"); if (files.Length == 0) { Console.WriteLine("File not found"); } else { // ... }
