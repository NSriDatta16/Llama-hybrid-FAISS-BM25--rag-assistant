How to add extra classes to Wordpress's body element?

In the default Wordpress template, there is this in header.php . > This echos some useful hooks for CSS and JavaScript. Some example output is Is it possible, within the header.php even, to add my own classes in addition to what is there? Specifically, I'd like to do a quick strstr on $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and add a class if the device is an iDevice . I figure I could do it with JavaScript, but still being able to know how to add my own classes would be useful nevertheless.
