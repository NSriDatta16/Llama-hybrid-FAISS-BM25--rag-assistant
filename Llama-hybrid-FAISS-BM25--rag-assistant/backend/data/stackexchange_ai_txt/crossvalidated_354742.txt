Is there an algorithm or hyper-parameter that encourages a model to predict higher values? (regression task)

I have a simple linear regression model that is trying to predict the cost of houses. In my data the cost of houses is normally distributed. My model specifically has trouble accurately predicting the price of very expensive houses (but does fine with very cheap houses). Is there a way to essentially encourage the model to predict higher values? Or is there a different type of algorithm/model that sounds worth trying in this situation?
