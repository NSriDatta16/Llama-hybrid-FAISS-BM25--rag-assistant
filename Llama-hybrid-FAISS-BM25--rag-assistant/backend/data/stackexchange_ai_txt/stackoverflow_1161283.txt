Insert text after dynamically created table in word using VSTO

How using VSTO and Word 2003 can I insert text after a table I've created? I have code like bookmarkDescriptions = (object)"bookmarkDescriptions"; Word.Range rangeDescriptions = aDoc.Bookmarks.get_Item(ref bookmarkDescriptions).Range; foreach (var item in items) { //Add a paragraph with some text Table descTable = aDoc.Tables.Add(oSelection.Range, 1, 2, ref missing, ref missing); //Insert some text into the cells //Add a another paragraph with some text } when I add another paragraph of text it's added within the table but I want it after the table. Since I need to loop over all items and create some text - paragraph - some more text for each of them I don't see how I could make use of a bookmark to get a range after and outside the table.
