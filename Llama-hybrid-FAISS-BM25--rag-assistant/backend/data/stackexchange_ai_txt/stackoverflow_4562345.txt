The main point in any serious VCS is to keep the entire history of a project in a permanent and immutable way. So you can at anytime go to an arbitrary revision of your work. There is a special behavior of git when it comes to its storage, in that it can remove objects if there are no references to it. References are: each HEAD of a branch tags (I'm not sure if an unreferenced annotated tag still acts as an active reference) each commit which is referenced by another commit the content of a branch reflog This means that all commits, which are part of a branch are kept, also each object(=mostly commits) which are tagged. There is also a so called reflog on each branch(unless deactivated), where git keeps references to all objects you created in the last days. When an object is not referenced by any branch, tag or reflog, git gc removes it form the database. This is typical the case when you created a hacking branch, committed some stuff there, and removed this branch without merging it into another branch.
