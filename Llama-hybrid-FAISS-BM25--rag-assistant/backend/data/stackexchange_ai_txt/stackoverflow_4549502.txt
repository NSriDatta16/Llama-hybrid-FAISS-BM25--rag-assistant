I would likely change your design approach and create a controller that fetches and persists the data. Your are coupling your AppDelegate to your controller and making it responsible for the data retrieval. This doesn't necessarily fit the MVC approach that is baked into iOS. By creating a a data object class that is responsible for data retrieval (eg, calling/caching the web service data), you make your code more reusable and easier to use by the parts of your program.
