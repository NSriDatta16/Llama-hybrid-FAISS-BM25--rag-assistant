Learning a programming language will let you take you log analysis abilities to another level. Any dynamic or "scripting" language like Perl, Ruby or Python will do the job. What you should use really depends on external factors. Among the things you should consider: does work already use a suitable langauge? do you know anyone who can mentor you in a suitable language? try each language a little and see which language fits you better. Personally, for the above task I would use Perl. YMMV. Several reasons to like Perl: Powerful one-liners - if you need to do a real quick, one-off job, Perl offers some really great short-cuts. See perlrun -n for one example Multi-paradigm language - Perl has support for imperative, functional and object-oriented programming methodologies. Sigils - those leading punctuation characters on variables like $foo or @bar . They are a bit like hungarian notation without being so annoying. Moose - an incredible new OOP system that provides powerful new OO techniques for code composition and reuse. Strictures - the use strict pragma catches many errors that other dynamic languages gloss over at compile time. I miss it terribly when I use Python or PHP. Self-discipline - Perl gives you the freedom to write and do what you want, when you want. This means that you have to learn to write clean code or you will hurt. Fortunately, there are tools to help a beginner. Perl::Critic does lint-like analysis of code for best practices.
