Why doesn't iPhone ad hoc distribution in iOS 4 (Xcode 3.2.3) work?

Before iOS 4, I could successfully build my app using the ad hoc distribution profile and send it to my clients for testing. Now. under Xcode 3.2.3, when I (and my client) drag and drop the .app folder into iTunes, the app does not appear among the list of apps and no message (error, warning, etc) is displayed. Is there a known problem with ad hoc distribution in Xcode 3.2.3?
