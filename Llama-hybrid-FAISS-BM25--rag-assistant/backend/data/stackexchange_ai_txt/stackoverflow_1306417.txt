Save objects retrieved from web services

I am totaly new to SubSonic, and have never used any other tool like it. I am not sure if SubSonic would be the right tool, or if there are any other tool that could help. Maybe someone can clarify things for me. :) The scenario is this: I have a c# application that fetches data from a set of secured web services, secured through WSE 3.0. The web services expose product data, press releases related to products etc. The data is deserialized upon retrieval, so the result is a for example a 'Product' object. Now I want to save this data. There are dozens of different classes that needs to be saved to separate tables. I started out creating tables and data access logic manually but then I realized maybe this was something that a tool like SubSonic or NHibernate could help with? Could any of them use the schemas from the web services to create the data access layer and data tables? If so, how and where would I start? As I said, I have never used any tool like this before, so I am not sure this is something they could be useful for. Greateful for any feedback!
