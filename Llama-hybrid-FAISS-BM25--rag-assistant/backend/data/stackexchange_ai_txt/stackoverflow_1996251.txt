How do I create new directory asp.net in c++ for window form button click

I would like to know how to create folder in c++ for asp.net System::IO::IsolatedStorage::IsolatedStorageFile isoFile = IsolatedStorageFile::GetStore( static_cast (IsolatedStorageScope::User); isoFile->CreateDirectory() I have created windows form in c++ with a button. When I click on the button it should take a path as input and create a folder. eg. private: System::Void button2_Click(System::Object^ sender, System::EventArgs^ e) { } This is not working. I do not want to use . Please let me know how I could do this.
