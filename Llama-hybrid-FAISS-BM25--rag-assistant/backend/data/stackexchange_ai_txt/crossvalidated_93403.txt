Data mining techniques in R for advertising and sales data

I would like to apply one or more data mining techniques to a dataset, in order to see the effect advertising has on sales. I am working from this dataset . It has 36 consecutive entries of monthly data for both sales and advertising - it's very small. I exported the dataset to a ".csv". I deleted the date column, because I will use R's ts (time series object). The ".csv" now looks like this: Advertising,Sales 12,15 20.5,16 21,18 ..., ..., ... 23.4,17 16.4,1 The example coded below works. However, I had to split the matrix into two lists, because of the HoltWinters() function. I would prefer to analyse Advertising and Sales together at the latter stages. What other data mining techniques may be more beneficial? data Jan 2012 13 17.3 21 + Feb 2012 14 25.3 29 + ... + Nov 2013 35 23.4 17 + Dec 2013 36 16.4 1 plot(decompose(data_ts)) data_ts_ad Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug + 2014 18.52852 25.47521 27.16683 36.41340 38.14678 33.04452 33.22488 32.12758 Sep + 2014 32.58964 plot(data_ts_ad,xlim=c(2010,2014)) lines(predict(data_ts_ad.hw, n.ahead=24), col=2) #do HoltWinters for sales plot(HoltWinters(data_ts_sa)) data_ts_sa.hw Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug + 2014 11.05723 23.27877 50.06859 57.22696 61.50669 26.35195 62.26159 70.83347 Sep + 2014 23.18957 plot(data_ts_sa,xlim=c(2010,2014)) lines(predict(data_ts_sa.hw, n.ahead=24), col=2) I recently came across a book called R and data mining: Examples and Case Studies by Yanchang Zhao. It has excellent worked examples and this is where I have found inspiration. However, I can't get my small brain to think which techniques can be applied to this dataset. I am new to R, so please try dumb-down your answers slightly.
