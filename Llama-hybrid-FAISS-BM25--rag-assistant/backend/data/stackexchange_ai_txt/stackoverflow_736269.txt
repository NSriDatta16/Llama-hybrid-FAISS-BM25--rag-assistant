Have you seen recipe 2-8 "Swiping Views" in Erica Sadun's iPhone Developer's Cookbook ? She uses touchesBegan and touchesMoved to determine swipe direction, then sets the animation based on the direction in touchesEnded. You could extend or amend this to add tap detection in order to determine which view to transition to. The recipe is on or around page 69 if you'd like to have a look, anyway. There's also a video (mov) sample here and a code sample here.
