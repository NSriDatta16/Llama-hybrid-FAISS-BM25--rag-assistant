Classify ciphertext vs. plaintext

I'm attempting a rather simple exercise in machine learning and trying to classify samples of text as either plaintext or ciphertext (encrypted). Here are two samples: Plaintext: This is a sentence in plaintext which any human person can read Ciphertext: 5oXbLiEZbMUgOOdYy+q4+rsDaqUngBrrUbpVeuu2ggvP6hHObC4GgTLhq The specific encryption used doesn't have any special attributes I can use to classify (for example, the ciphertext isn't guaranteed to be significantly longer than plaintext), so the task is all about figuring out what text is indistinguishable from random characters and what text is readable plaintext. My current heuristic involves counting whitespaces and assuming anything with a whitespace ratio above a certain threshold is plaintext, but I'm trying to find a better robust algorithm.
