ASP>NET Page performance issue

I have an asp.net page which has 4 grid views connecting to mysql database for data population. The average response time for a round trip to the server is 20.55 seconds. That is way too much time. I have since applied the HTTP Compression GZip to improve the speed,I don't see any improvement in load time. Any suggestion, ideas will be greatly appreciated. Ive also used pagination, but no effect.
