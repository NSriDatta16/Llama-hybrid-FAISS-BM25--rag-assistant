Building a relatively secure but simple system for software licensing is far from easy. It goes without saying, that any system (other than hosting the code on secure servers) can be broken given enough resources and time. The best you can do is to make the effort necessary to do so greater than the average benefit. If you are serious about protecting your own software assets, you should consider using a commercially proven licensing technology, rather than rolling your own. That said, let's look at how you could consider protecting in the manner you describe. First, you should realize that in the age of virtual machines, any file or registry entry you create can be easily rolled back. Without an online component to the verification process you can't prevent this scenario. What you can do are things like: Store an encrypted value of the number of days the system has been used for - a value which can never step backwards. Store an encrypted counter which you decrement down towards zero each time the system is used. Store an encrypted value of the last date/time the software was launched. Store an encrypted hash for the other three values. Now you have a means to check that these values are consistent and limit the ability for someone to tamper with them. You should also SALT these values so that they can't be easily replayed.
