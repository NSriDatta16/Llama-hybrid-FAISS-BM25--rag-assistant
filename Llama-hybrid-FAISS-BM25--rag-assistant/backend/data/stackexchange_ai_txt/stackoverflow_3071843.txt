Ok - I think I've got it... My depth buffer didn't have the mipmap levels generated. I'm using multi-texturing, and during rendering, I am activating texture unit 0 for the color framebuffer texture, and texture unit 1 for the depth buffer texture. When I activate/bind the textures, I call glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D) as follows: glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE0_ARB); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, _color_texture); glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D); glActiveTextureARB(GL_TEXTURE1_ARB); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, _zbuffer_texture); glGenerateMipmap(GL_TEXTURE_2D); When this is done, increasing the bias in the texture2D(sampler, coord, bias) gives fragments from the mipmap level as expected.
