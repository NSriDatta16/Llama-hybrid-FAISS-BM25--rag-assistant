Linear regression for binary classification - a new classifier

I am new to classification, but not to regression. I already used regression to fit a linear combination of time varying signals to match two constant signals, -1 and 1, representing their classes. In order to decide which class the result belongs to, a standard way is to test if the average is positive or negative. I found a classifier that gives better results, which is computed by comparing the MSE between the prediction and the two constant signals -1 and 1. The smaller MSE decides the class. I am 100% sure other people have used this before (it seems pretty intuitive), but I can't find it anywhere (most likely, I'm not searching for the right words). Can any of you help me with the name of this classifier and/or where it was used? Thanks in advance.
