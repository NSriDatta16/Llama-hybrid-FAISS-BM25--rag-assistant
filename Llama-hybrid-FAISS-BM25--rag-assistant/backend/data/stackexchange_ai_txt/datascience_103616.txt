One way to interpert your question is matching two documents that have the similar semantic content but might not have the same exact words. Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD) could be useful. WMD is an algorithm for finding the distance between pairs of strings. It is based on word embeddings (e.g., word2vec) which encode the semantic meaning of words into dense vectors. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document.
