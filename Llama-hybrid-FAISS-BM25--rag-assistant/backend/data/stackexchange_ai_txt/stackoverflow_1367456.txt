Does gcov give code coverage analysis for assembly language code

I have an application which i build using gcc on linux host for ARM target processor. This generated arm executable i execute on a ARM development board i have. I want to do some code coverage analysis: Will gcov show code coverage if i have ARM assembly source files in my build environment? If my build environment has some X86 assembly source files, then will gcov show code coverage data? Thank you. -AD.
