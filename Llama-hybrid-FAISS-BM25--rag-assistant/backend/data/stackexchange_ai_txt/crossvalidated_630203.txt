Model is nearly unidentifiable: large eigenvalue ratio in mixed logistic model

I am investigating effect of various "treatments" on various disease outcomes with univariate mixed logistic regression models corrected for covariates: f1 where disease is binary age is continuous t is binary relatives is a factor (relatives have the same factor number) The code for the model is: glmer(f1, data = data, family = binomial, control=glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa", optCtrl=list( maxfun=2e5 ))) For some of the diseases / treatment combinations, I get the warning: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt$par, ctrl = control$checkConv, : Model is nearly unidentifiable: large eigenvalue ratio (and sometimes other convergence warnings). I don't think scaling age (my only continuous variable) would be of use. I've checked table(disease, t) and sorted data according to age and looked at disease but do not see perfect separation problems. Sometimes I notice correlation (>0.75) between (Intr) (intercept?) and some of the variables in the summary under Correlation of Fixed Effects: but then on other occasions, I have convergence warnings with the correlations around 0. Other things I've tried: Increasing tolerance Different optimizers Restarting from a previous fit as recommended here . None of these worked. I'm not comfortable with ignoring the warning for these instances as some of the coefficients, standard errors, and p-values are wild, making me distrust the results. I am thinking my only option might be to exclude combinations for which this is a problem but I think this doesn't really solve the problem and may lead to loss of information. Am I missing something? What could be causing these problems despite having an apparently simple model?
