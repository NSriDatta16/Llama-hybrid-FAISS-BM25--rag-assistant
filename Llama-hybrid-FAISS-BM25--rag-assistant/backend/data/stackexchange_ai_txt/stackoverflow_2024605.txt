Press enter in textbox when editing ListView causes exception (ASP.NET)

I used standard drag and drop to put in a ASP ListView with editing enabled. The table is two columns, a GUID primary key, and a text string name. Null is not allowed for either. When I edit a record (for the name column), I change its value (to a valid value) and press Enter , it crashes with a Cannot insert NULL into column named "Name". However, if I do exactly the same, but instead of pressing Enter I click update, it works fine. I am new to ASP.NET. What am I missing?
