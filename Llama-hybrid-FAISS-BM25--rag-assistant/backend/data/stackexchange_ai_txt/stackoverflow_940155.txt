An option for getting non-object data to the UI is to create one or more lookup classes that are a bucket or "service" for getting odd bits of data for things like drop down lists etc... Example: myDDL.DataSource = Lookup.GetAllCountries(); // GetAllCountries is a static method // set name/value fields etc... myDDL.DataBind(); Using this methodology, you can still support tier separation. It's not object oriented or elegant, but it is very practical.
