If you are posting your data and want to re-display it, you have to round-trip your data back to the view. To maintain multi-user data integrity, I typically save the data to the database, and then retrieve the data from the database again when passing it back to the view for redisplay. Potentially, you can do something AJAX-y in the view to add records, so that you don't have to continually round-trip the entire dataset each time a record is added. EDIT: Just noticed that you don't have a database. If your application is architected properly (i.e. you are using repositories), the method of backend storage shouldn't matter. For more info on general practices for adding records, see the NerdDinner tutorial.
