The action link will build you the proper URL based on the controller , action , areas , params , etc... It generates the URL based on the URL mapping rules defined in the your MVC routing system. It will map params to the correct url as well depending on if it needs to be included in the URL directly or via a querystring param. Yes you could do it on your own and just type it all out but it builds the URL for you and ensures the URL that is generate is correct. It's a helper function... it helps you produce valid links :) You should read Scott Guthrie's post and pay extra attention to the section " Constructing Outgoing URLs from the Routing System ". It gives the why and explains other helpers that leverage the routing system.
