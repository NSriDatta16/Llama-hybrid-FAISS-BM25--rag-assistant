I have a dataset with mostly financial variables (120 features, 4k examples) which are mostly highly correlated and very noisy (technical indicators, for example) so I would like to select about max 20-30 for later use with model training (binary classification - increase / decrease). 4k examples is really not enough to estimate anything very sophisticated - you need to use the simplest possible models ( linear /logistic regression, linear svm) and small number of variables Given that your data is noisy and correlated, PCA is probably your best bet [ it is effectively identifying the common signals averaging over the individual indicators] L2 regularisation (for a linear model) will also help averaging out the noise [eg if you have n noisy copies of the same signal, l2 regularisation will encourage weights to be same - averaging those n variables]
