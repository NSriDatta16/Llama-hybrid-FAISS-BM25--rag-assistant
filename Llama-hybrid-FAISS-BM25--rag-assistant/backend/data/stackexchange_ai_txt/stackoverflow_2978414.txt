You can also have a look at a service like GitHub* for actual git hosting. As git is entirely distributed, you can have multiple repositories. Use one for remote storage/project coordination and Heroku just for deployment. I use GitHub for my open source stuff and a commercial Unfuddle account for projects (Unfuddle gives you unlimited git repos and issue tracking).
