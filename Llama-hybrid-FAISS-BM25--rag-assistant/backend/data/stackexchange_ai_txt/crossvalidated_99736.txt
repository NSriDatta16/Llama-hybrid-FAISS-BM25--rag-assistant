Plotting a categorical response as a function of a continuous predictor using R

I would like to plot the relationship between a binary categorical response variable and a continuous predictor to study its shape. The goal is to prep a logistic regression. This image may clarify: I have access to Minitab and R and would greatly appreciate any insight on how to recreate this histogram or alternatives that may do just as well.
