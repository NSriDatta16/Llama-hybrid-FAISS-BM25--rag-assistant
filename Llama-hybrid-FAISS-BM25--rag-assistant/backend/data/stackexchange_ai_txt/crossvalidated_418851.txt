Finding the variables that explain a label through LDA and PCA

I have a dataset of about 200 continuous variables with an also continuous target variable. I want to find those predictors that explain target values that are below 50. To do that I create an additional variable in the dataset called "incident" whenever the target value is less than 50. dataframe['incident'] = np.where(dataframe['valueToPredict'] And then I perform PCA and LDA. With PCA I get the first two components which explain about 50% of the variance. Not much, but I want to visualise this components in a 2d plot. I actually plot the different rows of the dataset with the position given by these two first components and colour them by the variable "incident" As you can see there is a small cluster of incidents in the right. I also perform LDA to separate the two classes with only one component (there are only two clases: "yes" and "no") and plot an histogram of the LDA component. I want to know if I'm right with the following conclusions and I also have some questions: Since the incidents are well separated both in the LDA and PCA plot. Does this mean that I should be able to classify them correctly with the dataset I have?. In fact, my problem is not a classification one, but a regression one. The problem I have is that getting the right regressed values whenever there are this kind of abnormal values seems to be impossible with my prediction model. Does this mean that with a classification problem these situations are separable but not with a regression problem? How can I get the variables in this dataset of 200 features that work best to separate this abnormal or incident values?. I suppose that the best option is to look at the LDA component and not into PCA, as LDA is optimised to separate two classes. UPDATE: I attach one more image that could explain further details. There is a predictor that is highly correlated with the value to predict in those cases that are above 50 (blue color). However for those that are under 50 (orange), the same variable does not explain much of the valueToPredict. It is true that there are less samples below 50, but, Could this mean that we are missing a variable in the dataset that explains these kind of values (those
