At about the center of the top bar in the editor window is a drop-down listing all methods, functions and several other things. Some note-worthy things you can get into this list: A section header "Some Text": #pragma mark Some Text A line: #pragma mark - A bold "FIXME: Something to do" // FIXME: Something to do FIXME: and TODO: are magic strings here. It's not just any random string.
