BEST depends on balancing maintainability and performance and where your skillset is strongest. If performance is paramount, encode each color as RGB value #rrggbb and then each boot by its ID. Then name every image with the values, such as: 00FF00_42.jpg for the green boot of style #42 boot. If you need the green boot of ID #42, you just ask for images/00FF00_42.jpg and completely bypass PHP, database, and any other kind of lookup. This will scream for performance, but making sure you have all 28000 X 5000 images named correctly will require some infrastructure work. Another option, you could have a bitmask grayscale image for each boot style, and use http://php.net/gd or http://php.net/imagemagik to "colorize" it a la Ted Turner. There is still no DB, and you'd want to "cache" the images that are popular. The basic point is this: There is no real need to "store" colors. They are going to end up RGB in the end, and you can just use the hex color codes. (Unless these are destined for print media where it's not really RGB color model...) So you really just need a clear and simple way to organize your 5000 boots, which is pretty simple, really.
