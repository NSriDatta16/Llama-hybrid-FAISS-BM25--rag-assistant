Are you at liberty to make a change to your model? It would help to de-normalize and store the first hit information in the same model or as part of a different model. For e.g. class Hit(Model): image = ForeignKey(Image) user = ForeignKey(User) timestamp = DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True) is_first_hit = BooleanField(default = False) You can then override the save() method (or tap a signal) to set the is_first_hit explicitly on save. This would make inserts and updates a little more expensive but would make querying very easy.
