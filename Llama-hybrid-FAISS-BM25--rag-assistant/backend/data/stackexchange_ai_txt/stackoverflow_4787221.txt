http://phpketchup.isgreat.org/ PHPKetchup is a new project in planning stage. There isn't any code available for now (also seems intended commercial, not open source). It was announced as framework atop PHP-GTK. There is a conception document which explicitly lists the goal as designing a MVC framework. However it seems like they take inspiration from CodeIgniter and mostly the common PHP framework structure. The focus seems not to lie on integrating PHP-GTK with the application logic, but mostly to provide a database interface as model and a thin Gtk interface for the View. MVC Architecture: We will design and implement Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for the PHP-GTK framework. SQLite will be used for Model. PHP-GTK functions and Glade files will be integrated in View after removal of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Controller will be modified accordingly to work with the newly created View. So it might just be MVC in name and organization, but one of the diagrams mentions "PHP-GTK functions addition" and there are further hints of object-structured Gtk helpers.
