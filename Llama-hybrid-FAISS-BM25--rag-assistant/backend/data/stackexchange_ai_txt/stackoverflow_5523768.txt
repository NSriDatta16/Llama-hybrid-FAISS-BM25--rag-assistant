In .NET namespaces are used to organize types. You can access these types by using their full name in this case System.DllNotFoundException, or when using the using statement - in this case using System, you can then omit the System dot prefix for all top level System types. In answer to your question I think you should use using as it generally makes your code cleaner as it's less to type and read for types used. When using multiple usings there can be ambiguities of the types used for example if DllNotFoundException existed in System and Foo where using System and using Foo was typed.... When there are ambiguities (the compiler will complain) you can either specify the whole type name or add a using MyException = Foo.DllNotFoundException, then MyException can be used instead of Foo.DllNotFoundException bad name example I know :)
