An Outlook contact, when dropped, supports the following formats: (0): "RenPrivateSourceFolder" (1): "RenPrivateMessages" (2): "FileGroupDescriptor" (3): "FileGroupDescriptorW" (4): "FileContents" (5): "Object Descriptor" (6): "System.String" (7): "UnicodeText" (8): "Text" The most interesting looking one on that list (for me) is Object Descriptor, which then led me to someone with a similar sounding problem: http://bytes.com/topic/visual-basic-net/answers/527320-drag-drop-outlook-vb-net-richtextbox Where it looks like in that case, they detect that it's an Outlook drop, and then use the Outlook object model to detect what's currently selected, with the implication that that must be the current drop source.
