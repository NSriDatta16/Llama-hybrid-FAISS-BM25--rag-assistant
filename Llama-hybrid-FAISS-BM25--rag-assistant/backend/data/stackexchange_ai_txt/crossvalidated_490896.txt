The K&H method can also lead to a reduction in the SE. This happens when the outcomes are unusually homogeneous. Note that the Q-statistic is way below its degrees of freedom here (the expected value of Q under the null hypothesis of homogeneity is equal to its dfs), which indicates that this is such a case. When this happens, the correction factor that is applied to compute the SEs can be below 1. There is also an (undocumented) option to use an ad-hoc version of the K&H method where the correction factor is constrained to be $\ge$ 1. You can get this with: res_ah The SE will now be unchanged, but use of the t-distribution to construct the CI will lead to a wider CI. The K&H method has an approximately nominal Type I error rate and coverage, so using the ad-hoc version is actually overly conservative (i.e., the Type I error rate will be below $\alpha$ and the coverage above the nominal rate). However, one may not care about the performance of the method 'on average' and hence could still choose to use this ad-hoc correction.
