The threshold coefficients are similar to what the coefficient for the intercept would be in binary logistic regression but, since you have three levels of the dependent variable, there is a coefficient for each threshold. The 0.013 is the coefficient for age. The odds ratio for age would be $e^{0.013} = 1.013$ per year (don't rely on just adding 1 to the coefficient, that is only correct when the coefficient is close to 0). So, the odds increase by about 1.3\% for each year of age.
