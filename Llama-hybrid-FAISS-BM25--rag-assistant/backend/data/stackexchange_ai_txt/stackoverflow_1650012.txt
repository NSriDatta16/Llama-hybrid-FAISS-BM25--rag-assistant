The answer posted earlier is not a solution to the original question. The issue at play here is SecurityDomain, not ApplicationDomain. I think there is a way to use swf files external to the app:/ domain in an Air application, but the documentation is far from direct on this issue and the eventual solution will probably require some intervention by the end user. I was just trying to create a simple wysiwyg page editor and allow users to use images created as swf files as a source to mx:Image components. That worked! You can use swf files external to the app:/ domain as the source to an mx:Image. However, if you want to drag that around on a screen, as soon as you click on it you get the Sandbox violation and your mousedown event that starts the drag gets interupted. It seems that even if an swf file has no scripts in it, if any of the assets have been turned into movieClips (we're talking Flash here), then as soon as you click on them they try to reference the parent swf. The Air app interprets this as an external swf trying to script it and the Sandbox violation occurs. The solution to this specific problem is to put the mx:Image inside an mx:Canvas and set the mouseChildren property of the Canvas to false.
