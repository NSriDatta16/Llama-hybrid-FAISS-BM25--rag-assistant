What is the difference between using a probability distribution and using the mean of observations only as a measure to describe the data?

I am wondering using the mean only without a specific probability distribution to predict or infer an appropriate measure for the average height of female students. I ask this question because I usually see a probability distribution with the mean and the variance as the parameters of an assumed probability distribution. So, I wonder that if I want to calculate and use the mean as an approximation of the mean height of female students, Is it a must to assume a probability distribution? Can't I just use the mean as an approximation or a predicted value without assuming a specific probability distribution ? Can I still call using the mean only to approximate the mean height of femal students a statistical model? If I can't call it a stistical model, then what should I call the way I try to approximate the mean height?
