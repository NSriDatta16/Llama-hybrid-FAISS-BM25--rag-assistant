The standard way to monitor Tomcat (and many other Java apps, too) is JMX . After you start Tomcat with JMX enabled , launch jconsole and connect to Tomcat process. You should see loads of things; all of this data is accessible from within your webapp. In order to get response times, you need to look at Catalina → GlobalRequestProcessor → http- → Attributes section. It has processingTime and requestCount ; from these you can get the average if necessary. To get heap memory usage, look at java.lang → Memory → Attributes → HeapMemoryUsage and NonHeapMemoryUsage .
