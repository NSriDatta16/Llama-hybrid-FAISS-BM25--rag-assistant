Problems with matching emails with regex

I'm trying to match an email address here is what I've come up with so far : String text = "gandalf_storm@mymail.com"; String regex = "(\\w+)@{1}(\\w+){2,}\\.{1}\\w{2,4}"; This however works with following cases : gandalf_storm@mymail.com gandalfstorm@mymail.com gandalf2storm@mymail.com So it matches any alphanumeric character repeated once or more that comes before one @ followed by any alphanumeric character repeated at least two times(which is minimal characters for any domain name) followed by one .(dot) and followed by any alphanumeric character repeated at least 2 times and at most 4 times(because there are domains such as .us or .mobi). This expression however does not work with emails such as : gandalf.storm@mymail.com gandalf.storm@mydomain.me.uk gandalf.storm@mysubdomain.mydomain.me.uk gandalf.storm@mysubdomain.mysubdomain.mydomain.me.uk etc as many subdomains or gandalf.storm@mymail.com gandalf2storm@mydomain.me.uk gandalf_storm@mysubdomain.mydomain.me.uk gandalfstorm@mysubdomain.mysubdomain.mydomain.me.uk I've just started to learn regex and I found interesting to try to solve problems such as these by using regex .. not partially but for each case, any help would be much appriciated. Thank you
