The answer was MUCH more simple!!! A good friend of mine told me this is very simple! have a look at this sample! public enum State:byte { EmailNotValidated = 0x00, EmailValidated = 0x10, Admin_AcceptPending = 0x40, Active = 0x80, Admin_BlockedAccount = 0xff } Pay attention to the :BYTE part after the name of the Enum... there is the trick I was looking for! But thanks to everyone trying for me!
