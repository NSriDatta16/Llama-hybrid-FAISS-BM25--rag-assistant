The steps where the null hypothesis is rejected relates to the following processes: Step 1.1 is related to (iii) is stationary around a linear trend, Step 2.1 is related to (ii) is stationary around a non-zero mean, Step 3.1 is related to (i) is stationary around a zero mean. When the null is not rejected, then you may consider the processes (iv) a unit root with a zero drift, (v) a unit root with a non-zero drift or even a unit root with a linear trend. Be aware that the effect of an intercept or a linear trend in a random walk is not the same as in a stationary series. See this post for a graphical illustration of unit root processes with zero intercept (no drift), drift and trend. If the null of a unit root is rejected, then the the $t$-statistic for $\mu=0$ would follow the standard distribution and you could test that $\mu=0$ under a Gaussian or Student-$t$ distribution of the test statistic. Nevertheless, I think it is a better idea what you mention in the last point, i.e., using the KPSS test where the null hypothesis is stationarity. In this way, combining the ADF and the KPSS tests we may arrive to strong conclusions rejecting either a unit root or stationarity. In this post I summarize a sequential procedure of both tests and the conclusions that can be obtained in each case. In section 5 of this document we elaborate further on this approach in the context of seasonal time series (where the HEGY test plays the role of the ADF test and the CH test plays the role of the KPSS test).
