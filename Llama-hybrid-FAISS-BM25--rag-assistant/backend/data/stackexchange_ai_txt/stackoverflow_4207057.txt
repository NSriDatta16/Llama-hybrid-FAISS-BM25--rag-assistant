How to include words as numerical feature in classification

Whats the best method to use the words itself as the features in any machine learning algorithm ? The problem I have to extract word related feature from a particular paragraph. Should I use the index in the dictionary as the numerical feature ? If so, how will I normalize these ? In general, How are words itself used as features in NLP ?
