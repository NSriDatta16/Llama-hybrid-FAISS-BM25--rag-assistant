The problem here is that the object you are getting back from your loadFromWaypoints request is not populated with all the members that you are asking for in onGDirectionsLoad (). If you a look in your javascript error log you will see: Error: gdir.getRoute(0).getStartGeocode().AddressDetails.Country is undefined Ok, according to the Google Documention, the response from loadFromWaypoints and GClientGeodcoder should be identical. I took the liberty of doing some testing with your sample and it suddenly becomes obvious that the responses are not the same. If you have a look at http://www.cannonade.net/geo.js , you can see that I stringify the GClientGeocoder request and the response for the first marker and they are very different. So you need to do a couple of things: Check your responses to ensure that you don't get javascript errors for unpopulated results: if ('AddressDetails' in resp) Do a GClientGeocoder request for each marker point to get the full address information. My sample does this for the first marker.
