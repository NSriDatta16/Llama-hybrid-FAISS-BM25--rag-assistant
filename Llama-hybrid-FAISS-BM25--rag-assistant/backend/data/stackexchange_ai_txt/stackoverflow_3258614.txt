Using SQL 2008 ServiceBroker for high-volume threadsafe FIFO queue

I'm just starting to evaluate ServiceBroker to determine if it can perform as a reliable queue in a very specific context. Here is the scenario: (1) need to pre-calculate a large (several million) population of computationally expensive values and store in a queue. (2) multiple processes will attempt to read/dequeue these values at run time on an as-needed basis. could be several hundred + reads per second. (3) a monitor process will occasionally poll the queue and determine if the population minimum threshold has been reached, and will then re-populate the queue. Due to some infrastructure/cost constraints, an industrial strength Queue (websphere) might not be an option. What I have seen thus far of Service Broker is not encouraging because it seems to be isolated to a "conversation" with 2 endpoints and in my scenario, my reads happen completely independent of my writes. Does anyone have any insight as to whether this is possible with SQL Service Broker?
