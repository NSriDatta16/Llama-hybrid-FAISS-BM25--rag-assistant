The items in myDataArray are not property list objects, so they can't be automatically serialized to a plist. From the NSUserDefaults class reference for setObject:forKey: : The value parameter can be only property list objects: NSData, NSString, NSNumber, NSDate, NSArray, or NSDictionary. For NSArray and NSDictionary objects, their contents must be property list objects. See “What is a Property List?” in Property List Programming Guide. You may want to consider a mechanism other than user defaults for storing this data. From the Property List Programming Guide : Many applications require a mechanism for storing information that will be needed at a later time. For situations where you need to store small amounts of persistent data—say less than a few hundred kilobytes—property lists offer a uniform and convenient means of organizing, storing, and accessing the data. In some situations, the property-list architecture may prove insufficient. If you need a way to store large, complex graphs of objects, objects not supported by the property-list architecture, or objects whose mutability settings must be retained, use archiving. See Archives and Serializations Programming Guide for more information.
