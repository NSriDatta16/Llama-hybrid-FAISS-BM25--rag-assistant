C# Login detail storage

I have this login form on my program in C#, I will be matching the username and password in my website database then when i get a repsonse that says true, it will then store the user details inside the program, I don't want to use an external file to store the details, is it possible to be able to embed the user details inside the program. once the user uses the program again, it will check whether the user details are still embedded inside the program, which will then keep the user "logged" in. I have a gut feeling that embedded resources cannot be edited in realtime though. What's the best method to store username/password for future uses?
