Do you want to store the number this way, or present it? Store with the greatest precision you can and format it to #.000. Storing your numbers isn't likely to be a storage problem, so go ahead and use something that is too big. As noted integers can be appropriate for things that can be reduced to integer values. (display GB, store bytes as int or bigint; display days, store seconds as bigint)
