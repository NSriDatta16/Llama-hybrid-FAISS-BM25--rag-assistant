In short, yes, Spring.Net AOP can work in the way you describe using XML-based configuration: you do not have to use those initial two lines of code, in fact code-based configuration is discouraged. You can configure Spring.Net AOP using XML-based configuration only and this is in fact the recommended approach. There are several steps to this: Create your advices: BeforeAdvice, AroundAdvice, AfterReturningAdvice and ThrowsAdvice are the types of advice supported. AroundAdvice uses the AOPAlliance interface, the others use the Spring.AOP interfaces. Define your pointcuts Apply the pointcuts and advice Example configuration (generalized from a live configuration): *Command ... beforeAdvisor returnsAdvisor throwsAdvisor Weaving is performed at runtime and is pretty fast and unintrusive. Hope this is of use, Andrew
