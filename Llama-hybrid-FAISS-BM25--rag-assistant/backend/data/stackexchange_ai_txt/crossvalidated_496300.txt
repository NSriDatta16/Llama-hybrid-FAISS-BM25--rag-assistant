This is all philosophical (as it must be): When a probability is a frequency you will have difficulty applying it to something that can't happen more than once, like Thursday's match between Liverpool and Arsenal. The problem is that a frequency is of the form $k$ out of every $n$ . You could conceive of a class of Thursdays sufficiently similar to this one (weather, &c.) where Liverpool plays Arsenal in a sufficiently similar way (team compositions, &c.) that you would consider them (almost) repetitions of the same event and so have an idea of how this would go on average , though finding the data might be difficult. But never for a given match, which can only happen this once. Similarly, you can't assign a probability to the next coin toss, because there is only one, but you can say something about the class of sufficiently similar coin tosses. If a probability is a degree of belief , you can assign it to anything that you can have an opinion on if you follow the proper rules of such assignments. It is my belief that the next coin toss is about as probable to come up heads as it is to come up tails.
