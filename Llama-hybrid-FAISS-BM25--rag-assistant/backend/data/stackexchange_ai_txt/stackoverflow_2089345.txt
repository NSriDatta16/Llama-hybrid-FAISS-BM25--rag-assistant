Adobe Flash CS3: DataGrid component is broken?

My datagrid component appears to be broken. When I drag one out onto the stage, its just a square. Nothing in it. Just a square... Then, when I tried to programmatically add it to the stage, using an example straight off the docs, it throws some errors: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flash/9.0/ActionScriptLangRefV3/fl/controls/DataGrid.html import fl.controls.DataGrid; var myDataGrid:DataGrid = new DataGrid(); Errors: 1172: Definition fl.controls:DataGrid could not be found. 1046: Type was not found or was not a compile-time constant: DataGrid. 1180: Call to a possibly undefined method DataGrid. This sounds very bad, especially considering that I need to use the DataGrid to complete my program. What am I doing wrong and how can I fix it? This is AS3, right in frame 1 of the main timeline.
