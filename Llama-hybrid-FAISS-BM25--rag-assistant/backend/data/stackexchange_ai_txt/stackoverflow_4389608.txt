Solr schema setup help for complex data

I'm trying to setup fields in Solr to do a complex search. I want users to be able to find organizations based on their hours of operation and services offered during the day and time period. Example: Find all organizations open Monday at 3pm offering childcare service and Spanish speakers. The fields are: - day of week open (long) - open time (long) - close time (long) - services offered (long) - languages spoken (long) I know I can use the array field with a range query to search on any one field, but I'm not sure how to correlate the related data. If childcare service is only offered on Wednesday I don't want the organization showing up when searching for Monday.
