Anomaly detection with time series

I have to study the behavoiur of a machine during its works: I have available time series of pressure, temperature and other physical measures for each work it is performing, I would like to predict errors or failures but till now they have not been recorded yet. So I thought to using these time series to understand if there are abnormal behaviours (which could lead to a faillure), maybe clustering time series. Beacuse I suppose that the machine, in normal condition, has the same parameters for each work. Is there a procedure/documentation/ best practises in order to do anomaly detecion with time series? Thanks a lot!
