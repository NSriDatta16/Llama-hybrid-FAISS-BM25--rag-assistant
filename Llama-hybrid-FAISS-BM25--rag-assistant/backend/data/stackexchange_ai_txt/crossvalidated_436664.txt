Look at this the other way. The unlabelled data, you'll be working with in future, may come with missing features. To handle it, you'll be using your transformer. While training, you want to mimic this behaviour. That's exactly what will happend on prod. Why should you want to impute values of test set from itself? This experiment won't tell you anything about model's behaviour on prod.
