In your example, I would have just used a logistic regression. If there are more than two alternatives for the response, look into some variant of multinomial logistic regression (search this site). More than two alternatives for the predictor is no problem. But, for the general question. Chi-square analysis could be developed for multi-way contingency tables, but there would be very many different possibilities. A general framework is log-linear modeling , see this text by Fienberg which is accessible. Here is a web pdf with interesting examples. And here you can find good, detailed example with the inbuilt UCBAdmissions dataset from R, building on this well-known paper by P. J. Bickel, E. A. Hammel and J. W. O'Connell.
