You can always add a recursive function to your model: EDIT: Corrected according to SeomGi Han def get_all_children(self, include_self=True): r = [] if include_self: r.append(self) for c in Person.objects.filter(parent=self): _r = c.get_all_children(include_self=True) if 0 (Don't use this if you have a lot of recursion or data ...) Still recommending mptt as suggested by errx. EDIT: 2021 since this answer is still getting attention :/ Use django-tree-queries instead!
