The sum of Gaussians is Gaussian. That is why the average is normal. The distribution of any non-linear function of (finitely many) Gaussians need not be Gaussian, and it usually isn't. Such is the case of the maximum function. To approximate the maximum of a multivariate Gaussian, Hothorn is a good place to start.
