How to calculate the accuracy of a yes/no Monte Carlo simulation such as "throwing stones in a pond"?

I have a simulation that returns "yes" or "no" for each iteration, and I measure the average number of "hits" over many iterations to estimate the likelihood of "yes" occurring. I'd like to be able to say how accurate/trustworthy that estimate of the likelihood is, though. Monte Carlo integration explains a similar basic Monte Carlo simulation: Imagine that we want to measure the area of a pond with arbitrary shape. Suppose that this pond is in the middle of a field with known area $A$ . If we throw $N$ stones randomly, such that they land within the boundaries of the field, and we count the number of stones that fall in the pond $N_{in}$ , the area of the pond will be approximately proportional to the fraction of stones that make a splash, multiplied by $A$ : $$A_{pond}=\frac{N_{in}}{N}A.$$ That page then talks about a similar scenario, where you do integration of a function by checking whether random points are under it or not : imagine a rectangle of height $H$ in the integration interval $[a,b]$ , such that the function $f(x)$ is within its boundaries. … The fraction of points that fall within the area contained below $f(x)$ … is an estimate of the ratio of the integral of $f(x)$ and the area of the rectangle. But then it switches to a different method of integration, where instead of checking yes/no for whether your test points falls under the curve, you instead evaluate the curve itself: Another Monte Carlo procedure is based on the definition: $$\langle g \rangle=\frac{1}{(b-a)} \int_a^b{f(x)dx}.$$ In order to determine this average, we sample the value of $f(x)$ : $$\langle f \rangle \simeq \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}f(x_i),$$ And then it tells how to calculate the variance for that type of method: A possible measure of the error is the "variance" $\sigma^2$ defined by: $$\sigma ^2=\langle f^2 \rangle - \langle f \rangle ^2, $$ But I don't understand how to take this variance calculation and transfer it back to the original "number of hits" type of calculation. I'm not sure what function $f$ I'm evaluating or how to evaluate it.
