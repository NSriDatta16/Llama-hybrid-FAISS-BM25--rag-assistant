.NET is really not the technology to use to talk to JMX. JMX is a builtin standard that is part of Java but is pretty specific to running in Java. I would assume that you cannot control the application you are trying to consume since you indicate you are trying to use someone else's JMX agent. In that case, you might want to consider writing your application or part of it in Java. That is the best way to get access to the JMX. If that is not an option you do have a few things you could look into: 1) Check to see if the application you are connecting to can expose the data as something other than JMX. It is usually not hard to allow access via web services to the same data. 2) Write a small Java wrapper that talks to the JMX server and exposes web services. This allows you to query the web services which in turn go over JMX. 3) There are other agents that JMX has to allow it to talk with different technologies. You could use something like the SNMP agent and use SNMP traps from .NET. More information on that can be found here: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/snmp.html
