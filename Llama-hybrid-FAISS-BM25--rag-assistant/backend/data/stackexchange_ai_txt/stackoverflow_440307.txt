I like the idea in that it is much less code and more elegant, but I would be very worried about the fact that it becomes hard to look at it and tell what is going on. The only way I would consider it is to have a convention for variables set using the "lazy" way, and also to comment anywhere it is used. Now there isn't going to be a compiler or anything that will enforce those rules, so still YMMV. In the end, for me, decisions like this boil down to who is going to be looking at it and the quality of those programmers. If you can trust your fellow developers to use it right and comment well then go for it, but if not, you are better off doing it in a easily understood and followed way. /my 2cents
