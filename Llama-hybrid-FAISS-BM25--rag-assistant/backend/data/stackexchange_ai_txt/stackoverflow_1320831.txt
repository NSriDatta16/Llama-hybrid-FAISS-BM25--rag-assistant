Xdebug can trace your code and create code coverage statistics . There are additional tools like Spike PHPCoverage , which can generate nicely formatted reports, but since these are intended for test-coverage, it'll just give you a boolean result (eg. line of code is used or not used). You probably want a more detailed view (eg. how many times is it used). Another option is to use the function trace feature of Xdebug. This will give you a detailed report of the actual call graph. You can determine which files was used the most from this. You'll need to write a parser for the data manually, but that shouldn't be too hard. Finally, you could do the same thing with a static call graph. There are some tools available for php. Here are a few: http://www.doxygen.nl/ http://phpcallgraph.sourceforge.net/ http://www.bytekit.org/ Again, you probably need to do some additional manual parsing on the output from those tools, to get something that applies to your use case.
