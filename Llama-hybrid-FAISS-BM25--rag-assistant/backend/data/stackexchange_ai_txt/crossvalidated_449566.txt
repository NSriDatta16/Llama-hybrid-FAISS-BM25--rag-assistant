Propensity matching is designed to reduce the influence of variables you would normally adjust for. Propensity matching will "balance" variables exactly that were used for matching. Propensity matching will also approximately "balance" variables that were not matched for depending on how well they're predicted by the matching. Basically, there should be very little reason to perform further adjustment... Regardless, conditional logistic regression is a standard way of analyzing such data. Input the matched pair ID as a cluster variable and calculate the conditional OR of association for the appropriate exposure. You can further adjust for covariates if there's residual confounding to account for, but the tendency of the conditional logistic regression to behave erratically in finely stratified data is more nefarious than in standard logistic regression.
