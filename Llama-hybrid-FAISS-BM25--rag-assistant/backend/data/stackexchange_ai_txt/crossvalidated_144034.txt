statistical modelling for imbalanced data

I am dealing with a binary response (good/ bad) type data set of size 2153, which reflects a dependent variable. Out of these, only 67 are in favor of "bad" and the remaining are of "good". Also, i have 3 independent variables. How can i model my data set statistically? I tried the logistic regression, but the results are not satisfactory. Does SPSS have any solution for handling such types of imbalanced data?
