I think your confusion comes from the fact that the PCA truncation is going to reconstruct the full dimensions of the original matrix. If you want to only consider the first two columns of the data, then this has to be what you decompose with svd . The first example is a truncation of the iris data using all 4 columns (as in your example) and then truncating with one PC: dat The second example is an svd on only the first two columns of iris , thus the reconstruction is also only going to have two columns. The reconstruction again uses the single leading PC: dat
