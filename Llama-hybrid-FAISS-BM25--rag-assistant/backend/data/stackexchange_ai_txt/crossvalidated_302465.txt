Pros: If you can actually do it accurately, fast and secretly, for as long as the market assumptions stay stationary, you will get rich very quickly with relatively little labour input. Cons: Practically impossible to do at any retail level. Market assumptions change quickly over time so models can quickly go from good to useless. Highly competitive field so any relevant insights made will be made in the private space and will practically never be made public. Accurate data for training can be expensive to obtain, public data will pretty much be useless for anything serious. Literally thousands of covariates used in accurate models and need to be trained for efficient models. Generally noisy data with a lot of feedback, prices themselves by definition are essentially just agents decisions on prices being too high/too low, derived from models causing price action outside of predictors themselves creating a loop and breaking model covariate assumptions.
