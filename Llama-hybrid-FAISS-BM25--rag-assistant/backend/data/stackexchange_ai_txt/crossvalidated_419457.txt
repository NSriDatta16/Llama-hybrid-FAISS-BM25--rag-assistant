How to create word vectors from short sentences having mixed language (English and Hinglish)?

How do I create word vectors from a corpus where sentences are very short. e.g if the corpus contains messages from users - 'good morning', 'hello!', 'No, I can't.', 'Where?' etc. One way to resolve this might be to use pre-trained vectors, is there any other way? Also, the main problem is what if the short sentences are a mixture of two languages, English and Hindi (Hinglish - 'nahi aa sakta'). So the corpus would have sentences like - 'Yes', 'Hi! Meeting kab hai?' 'Location kya hai?' 'When will you reach?' (As I won't get pre-trained vectors for the Hinglish words, how do I deal with them in this situation?) How do I go about getting vectors for such sentences for any NLP task?
