Make text selectable in html pages looking like iPhone forms

I am working on an application than needs to create pages looking like this: http://iui-js.appspot.com/samples/music/music.html#_usage The problem I have is that, just like in the page linked above, the values are not selectable neither with iSafari nor with the desktop version of Safari. I need to be able to select and copy the values (in the example page these are '2', '8' and '27'). I would be fine simply knowing why the above text is not selectable in the first place, as this would probably be enough to find a workaround solution. Thanks everybody for the kind attention.
