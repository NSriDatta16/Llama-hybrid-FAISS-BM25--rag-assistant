This may not be the most elegant method, but one thing that you may be able to leverage is UINT_MAX defined in "limits.h". That is, ... if UINT_MAX == 65535, then you would know that sizeof (unsigned) = 2 if UINT_MAX == 4294967295, then you would know that sizeof (unsigned) = 4. and so on. As I said, not elegant, but it should provide some level of usability. Hope this helps.
