First, the p-value is not z or 2*z. P values range from 0 to 1, z scores can be any real number. But perhaps you mean how to look up p in a z table? I am not sure. Second, if the variable that $\mu$ is the average of is continuous, then $p(\mu \le 1.35) = p(\mu \lt 1.35)$ because the probability of any exact value of $\mu$ is infinitesimal.
