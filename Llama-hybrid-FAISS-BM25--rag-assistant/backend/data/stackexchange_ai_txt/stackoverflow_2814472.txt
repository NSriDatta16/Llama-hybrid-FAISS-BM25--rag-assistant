Your analysis of the problem ("it only work if the substring starts with the same letter of the string") is incorrect and so you are looking for the wrong problem. Since this appears to be homework, I'll just hint at the underlying problem. While it fails with Michigan and igan it will correctly work with Michigan and higan . Why does it work for higan and not igan ? What is the first letter of igan ? What is different about that when it comes to Michigan ?
