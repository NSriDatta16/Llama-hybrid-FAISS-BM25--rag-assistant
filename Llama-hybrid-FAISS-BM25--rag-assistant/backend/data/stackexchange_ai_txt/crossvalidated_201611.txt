If by "sub-dsitributions" in your question you mean marginals , then read about copulas . The idea's that if you know the marginal distributions, then for any joint distribution there's an object called copula , which links the marginals to the joint distribution. It's like a functional, whose inputs are marginal distributions, and the output is the joint. It's an elegant construct, the only issue is that you usually don't know which copula is the right one to use. So, you end up using the one you like and hope that it's the one.
