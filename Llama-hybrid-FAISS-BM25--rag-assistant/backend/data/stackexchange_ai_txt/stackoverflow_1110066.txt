WinForms UI responsiveness when dealing with "heavy" data

I'm modifying a windows form to allow data to be loaded in the background while the UI remains responsive. The data takes noticeable time to both retrieve and bind. Ideally, I would do both in the background, but there is some ambiguity about what kind of UI updates I should be doing in the background (as in outside the main thread). A solid example that shows data retrieval and data binding in the background would be very helpful.
