In Matlab 2014a yes, cross entropy is used for logistic regression (see line 282 in glmfit.m): % Define variance and deviance for binomial, now that N has NaNs removed. if isequal(distr, 'binomial') sqrtN = sqrt(N); sqrtvarFun = @(mu) sqrt(mu).*sqrt(1-mu) ./ sqrtN; devFun = @(mu,y) 2*N.*(y.*log((y+(y==0))./mu) + (1-y).*log((1-y+(y==1))./(1-mu))); end and I guess this is also the norm in the field and in other versions of matlab (but maybe there is someone more expert in the field with a different opinion), as there are good reasons to not use MSE (this is discussed for example here: Using MSE instead of log-loss in logistic regression or here why sum of squared errors for logistic regression not used and instead maximum likelihood estimation is used to fit the model? ).
