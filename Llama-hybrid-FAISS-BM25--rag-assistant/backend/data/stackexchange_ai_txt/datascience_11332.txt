Benchmarking Theano

I sometimes want to benchmark Theano, either to compare different versions of Theano, or to compare two different computing environment with the same version of Theano. Is there any Theano code I could use to benchmark the main functions of Theano? I plan to use Theano only for artificial neural networks (RNN and CNN).
