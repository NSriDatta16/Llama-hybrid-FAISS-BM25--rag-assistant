As you said, the p-value is uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. That is, if the null hypothesis is really true, then upon repeated experiments we expect to find a fully random, flat distribution of p-values between [0, 1]. Consequently, a frequentist p-value says nothing about how likely the null hypothesis is to be true, since any p-value is equally probable under the null. What you're looking at is the distribution of p-values under an alternative hypothesis. Depending on the formulation of this hypothesis, the resulting p-values can have any non-Uniform, positively skewed distribution between [0, 1]. But this doesn't tell you anything about the probability of the null. The reason is that the p-value expresses the probability of the evidence under the null hypothesis, i.e. $p(D|H_0)$ , whereas you want to know $p(H_0|D)$ . These two are related by Bayes' rule: $$ p(H_0|D) = \frac{p(D|H_0)p(H_0)}{p(D|H_0)p(H_0)+p(D|\neg H_0)p(\neg H_0)} $$ This means that in order to calculate the probability you're interested in, you need to know and take into account the prior probability of the null being true ( $p(H_0)$ ), the prior probability of the null being false ( $p(\neg H_0)$ ) and the probability of the data given that the null is false ( $p(D|\neg H_0)$ ). This is the purview of Bayesian, rather than frequentist statistics. As for the correlation you observed: as I said above the p-values will be positively skewed under the alternative hypothesis. How skewed depends what that alternative hypothesis is. In the case of a two-sample t-test, the more you increase the difference between your population means, the more skewed the p-values will become. This reflects the fact that you're making your samples increasingly more different from what is plausible under the null, and so by definition the resulting p-values (reflecting the probability of the data under the null) must decrease.
