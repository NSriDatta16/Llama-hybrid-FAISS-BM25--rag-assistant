What sort of bum writes a tutorial that doesn't work?! Take a look at your error message 2011-02-16T04:18:27+00:00 ERR (3): Warning: include(Alanstormdotcom\Weblog\Model\Blogpost.php) [function.include]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in E:\xampp\htdocs\magento\lib\Varien\Autoload.php on line 94 Magento is telling you it can't find your model file. Have you created the model named Blogpost.php? Is it in the right folder? It should be at app\code\local\Alanstormdotcom\Weblog\Model\Blogpost.php If Magento can't find it, that means it's not there. If it is there, than means someone's monkeied with your include path.
