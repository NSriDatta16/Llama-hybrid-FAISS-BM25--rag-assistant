CreateFileBasedResourceManager will only deal with binary .resources files (not .resx files). If you insist on loading resources from external file rather than embed the resources into the assembly, you will need to run the resgen command line utility to generate a .resources file. So if you haven't done that, generate one for each supported culture. Otherwise it looks OK. But if you would rather embed resources into assembly, in the properties window, set the Build Action to Embedded Resource. If you want also want a strongly typed class generated taking care of all the dirty work, set the Custom Tool on the base file only (the invariant one) to ResXFileCodeGenerator, or PublicResXFileCodeGenerator if you need that (good when creating satellite assemblies). Then you don't need to take care of loading the localized resources yourself. The generated class does all this for you. For each key in the resource, a static property is generated in the generated class, and you'll just invoke this property, it is very clean and by far the easiest way. Unless there are special reasons for loading resources from .resources files, i would always recommend embedding them into the (an) assembly.
