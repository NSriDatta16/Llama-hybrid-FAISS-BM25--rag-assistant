XML Parsing Error: SYSTEM or PUBLIC, the URI is missing

I am parsing an RSS feed from the following URL: http://rss.sciam.com/ScientificAmerican-Global?format=xml // $xml_text is filled with the contents read from the URL $xml_parser = xml_parser_create(); $res = xml_parse($xml_parser, $xml_text); if (!$res) { $error = xml_error_string(xml_get_error_code($xml_parser)). " at line ". xml_get_current_line_number($xml_parser); } // $error contains: "SYSTEM or PUBLIC, the URI is missing at line 1" FeedValidator.org says this is a good feed. How can I get PHP's XML parser to work around this error? EDIT : It looks like they are redirecting this feed to another location based on the user-agent. My PHP script is not getting the correct feed.
