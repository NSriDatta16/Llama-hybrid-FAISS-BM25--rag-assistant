Just curious why are you saving this in the base page constructor? You shouldn't be accessing the session from the constructor but the Page_Init instead. See the following post: http://weblogs.asp.net/anasghanem/archive/2008/05/07/avoid-using-the-session-in-the-page-constructor.aspx The session variable will be accessible at any time when implementing the page functionality so why not create a static class / method with functionality to grab all your session data? I don't see why you would want to duplicate storage of this data in your base class. You might want to check out this thread: ASP.Net Session
