How to interpret data not separated by PCA but by T-sne/UMAP

I have a classification problem, to have a first look at my data I do a PCA followed by TSNE and UMAP. My clusters are nicely separated by TSNE and UMAP but not by PCA. Does it have implication for the classification methods I'm going to use ? Does it mean my groups are not linearly differentiable ? Thank you
