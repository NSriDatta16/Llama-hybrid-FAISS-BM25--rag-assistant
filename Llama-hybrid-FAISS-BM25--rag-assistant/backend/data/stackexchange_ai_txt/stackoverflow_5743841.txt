basically html5 is just like html, with some extra tags added, like the canvas element for drawing, the video and audio elements for media playback, some new content specific elements, like article, footer, header, nav, section. it has also better support for local offline storage. and also some new form controls, like calendar, date, time, email, url and search So actually not much you couldn't do earlier with some JavaScript (or jquery, as some people like to call it now :p), but it's designed to make those (nowadays) common tasks a lot easier
