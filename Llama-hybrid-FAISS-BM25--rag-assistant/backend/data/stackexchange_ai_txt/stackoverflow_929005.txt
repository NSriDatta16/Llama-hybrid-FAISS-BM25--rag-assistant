These are some of the things I've seen that cause slow downs. I've only worked with one or two Flex developers, so I don't know if this is obvious, or helpful. Either way: Transparency: Whenever views have a lot of components with non-opaque transparency (i.e. alpha less than 1.0), these views tend to be extremely slow, especially on older machines. Object Creation: It seems that whenever there is a lot of object creation happening, the app slows to a crawl, even on newer machines. I worked on an app that created at least a few hundred objects when the application started. Data Fetching: Whenever data is loaded asynchronously, the app will take a performance hit depending on how much is loaded Lots of objects: When views have lots of objects in them, they tend to lag and generally drag ass. Those are the ones I remember the best, having not worked on a major Flex app in over a year.
