Mysql Selection

Hi good people once again While busy traversing, iterating and manipulating my arrays from a mysql database i have stumbled on a problem, which i know you will be able to help me with - fellow geeks. I have a COLUMN the contains city names and some cities appear several times on the COLUMN. I'm using the following query to retrieve that data: $query = "SELECT cities from info_table WHERE store='kfc' "; $result = mysql_query($query); while($city = mysql_fetch_array($result){ $total_cities_array[]=$city[0]; } the problem is that in $total_cities_array some cities are a entered several when i ony need a single storage for every city. is there some php or mysql that i can use to fix this. Thank you.
