Given your description of the problem, I don't think your assumption (that incorrect pictures are only "searched" once) sounds right. If you don't make that assumption, then the answer is as shown below. You'll see the answers are somewhat different from what you proposed. It is possible that you could be successful on the first attempt. Therefore, the first answer is 1. If you were unlucky, you could keep rolling the wrong number forever. So the second answer is infinity. The third question is less obvious. What is the average number of rolls? You need to be familiar with the Geometric Distribution : the number of trials needed to get a single success. Define p as the probability for a successful trial; p =0.01. Let Pr( x = k ) be the probability that the first successful trial being the k th. Then we're going to have to have ( k -1) failures and one success. So Pr(x=k) = (1- p )^( k -1) * p. Verify that this is the "probability mass function" on the wiki page (left column). The mean of the geometric distribution is 1/ p , which is therefore 100. This is the average number of rolls required to find the specific picture. (Note: We need to consider 1 as the lowest possible value, rather than 0, so use the left hand column of the table on the Wikipedia page.)
