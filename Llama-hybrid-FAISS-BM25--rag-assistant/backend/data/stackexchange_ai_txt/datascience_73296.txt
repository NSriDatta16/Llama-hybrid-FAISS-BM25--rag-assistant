Classification of OLS regression coefficients

A variable $A$ (reaction time) is log-normally distributed, i.e. $\log(A) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ and is linearly dependent of $n$ variables $X = (X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ , i.e. \begin{align} A &= \alpha_1 X_1 + \alpha_2 X_2 + \ldots + \alpha_n X_n + \epsilon, \end{align} where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\tau^2)$ . An observation of variable $A$ belongs either to class 1 or to class 0, denoted as $A^1$ or $A^0$ . I splitted my training observations on $A^1$ and $A^0$ (balanced ratio) and used an OLS model to find two sets of coefficients $\hat{\alpha}^1$ and $\hat{\alpha}^0$ such that $\hat{\alpha}^1 X$ and $\hat{\alpha}^0 X$ estimate $A^1$ and $A^0$ with minimal errors. Now, I want to make a class prediction for new observations $A,X$ . How to classify such an observation? One way forward could be a Bayesian approach, since I know the class priors $p(D^i)$ equal roughly $0.5$ . But how to compute the conditional class distributions $p(A|D^i,X)$ and the posterior $p(\hat{\alpha}^i|A,X)$ $i=0,1$ ? What would you suggest?
