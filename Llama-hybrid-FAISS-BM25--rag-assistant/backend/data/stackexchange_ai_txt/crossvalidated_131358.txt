Unless I completely misunderstood what you're trying to achieve, I would suggest to take a look at some probabilistic methods of dimensionality reduction , such as probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and probabilistic non-linear PCA with Gaussian process latent variable models . Finally, this excellent tutorial on dimensionality reduction by Christopher Burges (Microsoft Research) is rather comprehensive and contains description of PPCA . I hope that this is relevant and will be useful. UPDATE. Upon your mentioning, I became curious about weighted LDA approach and decided to read a bit on it. That resulted in finding the following papers on this topic, which I thought might be of your interest (based on your comment): first , second , third , fourth and fifth .
