Rasterize a fragment of HTML to PNG

I have a page with a series of divs. Each div represents a slide in a slide deck. I need a series of thumbnails, one for each slide. Ideally these thumbnails would be rasterized versions of the slides: a PNG data: url would be perfect. I'd like the work to be done in the browser, and I'm okay with things that only work in one of the modern browsers (e.g. chrome, or firefox). I suspect this is impossible, but would love to hear otherwise. The method toDataURL() on the canvas object is essentially what I want, but the divs in question aren't instances of canvas, so that won't work.
