See the comments on Justin Niessner's answer: you can't get back the return value. That may be OK for you if the service that you're calling is not critical (because, let's say, it just captures some usage statistics). If you need to have the return value in any case, and you expect the SL application to be used multiple times, you could write a memento to the IsolatedStorage (that is a synchronous operation) and post it to the server when the application starts the next time.
