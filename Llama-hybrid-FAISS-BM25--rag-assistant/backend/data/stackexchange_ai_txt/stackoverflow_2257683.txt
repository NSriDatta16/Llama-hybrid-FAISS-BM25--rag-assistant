[ Edit : OP updated his question to say this is specifically for user-generated content; the below won't (easily) work for that (you'd have to have your own hyphenation dictionary). Leaving it here, though, in case someone finds this question and needs an HTML option for doing this.] You can use a soft hyphen (aka optional hyphen; &shy; or &#173; ). It was defined way back in HTML4 . I've never used it, but I just tried and it works in: IE6, IE7, Chrome 4, FF 3.6, and Safari 4 for Windows at least. One could argue that the user-agent (browser) should handle this automatically (using a hyphenation dictionary for the language the document is in). In practice, I don't know of a single web browser that does it automatically. Apparently, modern browsers do if you tell them they can; see wsanville's answer for a CSS option.
