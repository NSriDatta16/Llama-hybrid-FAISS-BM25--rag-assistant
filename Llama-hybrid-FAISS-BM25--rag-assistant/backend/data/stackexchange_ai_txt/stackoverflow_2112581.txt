Edited for the url you added: that specific one is most likely being used with the BlueDragon system, a family of runtime server-side products for the deployment of CFML pages, deployed in possibly a j2ee environment. for instance you can google the site for references: http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anewatlanta.com+%22sd or see a servlet debug page: http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:yg7UIh6nRdIJ:www.lucasoil.com/landing_pages/14,3.html/+%22index.sd%22+bluedragon&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a or you may be referring to the TLD (top-level domain name). the TLD .sd belongs to country of Sudan which is managed by the Sudan Internet Society: http://www.isoc.sd/sudanic.isoc.sd/
