165 columns are too much for any model to run smoothly (quickly). In cases like this, feature selection methods are suggested to apply (for example, dimensionality reduction techniques). PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques. With the reduced number of features you are then welcome to apply different models and test their accuracy. Note 1: If you use R, you may read about PCA here . Note 2: If your categorical variables are not ordinal, it is suggested to convert them into dummy variables. To read why, please, refer to this question .
