Logistic regression in R returning NA values

First off, I'll say I am a biologist and new to the statistics side of things so excuse my ignorance I have a data set that consists of a binary outcome and then a bunch of trinary explanatory variables that looks something like this: head() Category block21_hap1 block21_hap2 block21_hap3 block21_check 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 0 0 2 3 1 1 0 1 2 4 1 1 0 1 2 5 1 1 1 0 2 6 1 1 1 0 2 A quick summary of the data summary() Category block21_hap1 block21_hap2 block21_hap3 block21_check 1:718 0:293 0:777 0:1026 2:1467 0:749 1:709 1:577 1: 390 2:465 2:113 2: 51 and another summary grouped by outcome levels by(hap.ped.final, hap.ped.final$Category, summary) hap.ped.final$Category: 1 block21_hap1 block21_hap2 block21_hap3 block21_check 0:146 0:374 0:518 2:718 1:336 1:286 1:174 2:236 2: 58 2: 26 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- hap.ped.final$Category: 0 block21_hap1 block21_hap2 block21_hap3 block21_check 0:147 0:403 0:508 2:749 1:373 1:291 1:216 2:229 2: 55 2: 25 So I am trying to run logistic regression on this data. When I do this: fit = glm(Category~ block21_hap1 + block21_hap2 + block21_hap3, data = hap.ped.final ,family = "binomial") summary(fit) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.301 -1.177 1.059 1.177 1.200 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.039221 0.280110 -0.140 0.889 hap.ped.final$block21_hap11 0.123555 0.183087 0.675 0.500 hap.ped.final$block21_hap12 0.009111 0.295069 0.031 0.975 hap.ped.final$block21_hap21 -0.084334 0.183087 -0.461 0.645 hap.ped.final$block21_hap22 -0.013889 0.337468 -0.041 0.967 hap.ped.final$block21_hap31 0.201113 0.183087 1.098 0.272 hap.ped.final$block21_hap32 NA NA NA NA (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 2033 on 1466 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 2028 on 1461 degrees of freedom AIC: 2040 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 3 So I don't really know what a singularity is or what's going wrong here that is throwing up NA's as a result of my analysis. Is it my data, or what I'm doing to it. I tried googling the warning (or whatever you might call it) and I got some pages talking about collinearity and multilinearity, which I do not understand at all. Again, sorry for lack of knowledge here. I wish I had done more maths in undergrad.
