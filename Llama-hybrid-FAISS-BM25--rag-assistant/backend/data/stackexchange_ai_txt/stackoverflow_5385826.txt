This is a dupe of a question asked previously on stackoverflow. Basically, gets() can be vulnerable to buffer overruns, so the compiler is suggesting you replace it with another method where you explicitly specify the maximum buffer length to read. This sort of warning is increasingly common in compilers to encourage folks to write code that is more secure (buffer overruns are a common source of security vulnerabilities). Your tutorial code was presumably written before this guidance became common practice.
