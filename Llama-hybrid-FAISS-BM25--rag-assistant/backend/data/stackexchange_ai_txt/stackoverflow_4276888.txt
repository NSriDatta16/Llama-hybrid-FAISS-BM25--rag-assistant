Proper way for timed redirects

I'm kind of confused... HTML redirects are discouraged, PHP header(); redirects are discouraged too (at least random user on PHP.net says so ), javascript redirects are good, but won't work if user has disabled it. Have to agree, that disabled javascript nowadays is pretty rare, but still. So in this case, what would be the best way to do timed redirects? Like, the one that could be considered valid, all platforms compatible etc. And, any references for W3 discouraged PHP header(); redirects? Or it's discouraged because of it acts exactly the same as redirect? P.S. Would love to see how you guys get your timed redirects done for the best accessibility. EDIT: It's needed for redirects after form submission. Thanks in advance!
