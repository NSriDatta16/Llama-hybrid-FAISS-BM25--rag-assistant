Fluent control writing like Telerik : Understanding the angle brackets translation

Here is a piece of class : public class OneControl { ... public OneControl Content(Action value) { ContentProperty = value; return this; } public void Render() { ContentProperty(); } ... } Then I got this in my view : { %> Some Mixed Stuff Euros I would like to use this syntax in my UI library, I know how to implement this but I don't know HOW it actually works ! I understand that somewhere and somewhat a delegate is created and provided as an argument of the method Content, but can't find any information about this mecanism or technic. Can you enlight me ? PS : I'll change the title according to the anwser I get. Assumed current correct answer : The compiler translates the aspx code below into (symbolic translation for comprehension) : { ViewPageInstance.Response.Write("Some Mixed Stuff "); ViewPageInstance.Response.Write(Example); ViewPageInstance.Response.Write(" Euros"); }).Render() %> Big thanks to Hogan !!
