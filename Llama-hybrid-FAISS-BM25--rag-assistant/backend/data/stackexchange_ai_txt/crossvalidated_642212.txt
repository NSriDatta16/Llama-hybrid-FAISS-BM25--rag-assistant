The two options that spring to mind first are chi-square and logistic regression. Chi-square looks at whether there is an association between the two variables. Logistic regression treats one variable as dependent and the other as independent. That seems more like what you've got (if your "for instance" reflect what you really did ... It's better to use your actual case, rather than "for instance"). However, there is also a t-test for proportions. This tests, not surprisingly, whether two proportions are equal. All of these are discussed in many books and websites, and right here on CrossValidated. If you have questions after doing some reading, feel free to ask a new question.
