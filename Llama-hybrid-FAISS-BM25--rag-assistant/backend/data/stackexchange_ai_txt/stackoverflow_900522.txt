I'm not sure I would handle "reporting" them to the BSA, because of cultural issues and because the BSA, like the RIAA, is doing evil under a legitimate cause. That being said, as a software developer I am perhaps more altruistic (or naive) and I am feeling more sensitive to software companies getting paid. More software piracy means less jobs and lower pay for a lot of us and indirectly myself. I feel that most business software that is used by software companies is fairly priced, and that large companies like MS have recently been more sensitive to the needs of small shops rather than huge enterprises in their licensing and pricing schemes. Licensing most typical software should cost a small fragments of what the employees cost. In addition, there are sufficient acceptable alternatives if one prefers not to use major products. If I ran a company doing .NET development, I'd expect to pay for .NET. There are also cheaper alternatives. I would argue that most PDFS that the average dev needs to generate can be created without adobe, there are cheaper alternatives. So maybe the solution is limiting the amount of available software and paying for it.
