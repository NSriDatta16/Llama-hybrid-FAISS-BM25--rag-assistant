The offset parent of an element is its nearest positioned ancestor. My guess is that in your experiments, none of the ancestors is positioned. An element is "positioned" if it has a position style property ( relative , absolute , fixed , ... I think that's all of them) that isn't static (which is the default), either in its style attribute or via a CSS selector. So for instance, here there are no positioned elements: Hi there, I'm some text in a span inside a paragraph ...and so the offsetParent of both the paragraph and the span is the document element. Here, we've made the paragraph positioned : Hi there, I'm some text in a span inside a paragraph ...and so the span 's offsetParent is the paragraph.
