Here is an example of a fragment of an XHTML document: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog There is an empty element with no attributes, but removing it will change the structure of the document. You can't remove empty elements as a generic process. You have to make the decision on a case by case basis. In your example it seems reasonable to remove it (actually, it seems somewhat unreasonable to have it in the first place as it seems to be saying that there is a middle name, but it has no data in it).
