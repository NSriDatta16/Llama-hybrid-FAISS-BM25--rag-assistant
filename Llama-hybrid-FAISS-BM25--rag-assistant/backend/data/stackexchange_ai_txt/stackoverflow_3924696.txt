Using the Seam framework without Stateful Session Beans?

Has anyone had success building a SEAM Application without using Stateful session beans? There is some confusion on a new project in which I think several stakeholders have essentially 'banned' stateful session beans... but some development is being done in SEAM. Most of the literature on SEAM encourages the use of Stateful Session Beans. Thoughts?
