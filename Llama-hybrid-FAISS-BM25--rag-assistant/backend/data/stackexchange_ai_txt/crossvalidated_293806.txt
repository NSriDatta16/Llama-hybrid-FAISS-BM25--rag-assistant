I don't really know if you want a power analysis (which would be estimating the probability of having a significant result given that there is a true effect of a certain size, and which is not really a legitimate thing to do based on observed sample statistics). In terms of power, you probably had low power to detect the real value of the interaction if there is a real interaction effect - as you had a non-significant result - (emphasis on probably, as you may have just gotten very unlucky, there is no actual way of figuring this out without knowing the true population effect). The smaller the effect, the lower the power, all else being equal, so unless you expect that the interaction to be quite a lot larger than it is estimated to be here, you had super low power to detect an effect of that magnitude. It certainly wouldn't be the same as for the main effects. In fact, it would have had to have been massively overestimated (given that the magnitude here is accurate - not a safe assumption) to be statistically significant in your dataset. Effect sizes are notoriously difficult to interpret for interaction terms in log reg- the coefficients tell you how much of a change there is in the log odds, not in terms of percentages, and as it's an interaction, it can only be interpreted in the context of the scales of the two independent variables - you may want to have a look at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/57052/163818 for a primer on how to interpret logistic regression interactions.
