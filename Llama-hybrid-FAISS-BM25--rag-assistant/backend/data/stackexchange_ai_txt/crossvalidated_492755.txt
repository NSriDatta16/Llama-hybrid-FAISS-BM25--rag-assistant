Overview The rules/formulae themselves have been published in several locations. Here's an accessible version (framed in terms of SAS, but the equations are under the heading "Combining Inferences from Imputed Data Sets" on page 5.) https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/multipleimputation.pdf Caveats As noted by Amparo, for logistic regression the calculations are all done on the log scale, then exponentiated to give odds ratios. As a reminder, one key point of multiple imputation (over single imputation) is to properly reflect the between-imputation variability into the overall precision of estimates (e.g. confidence intervals). This combination process is more complex than suggested in Amparo's answer. Annotation: $m$ is the number of imputed datasets; $\bar{Q_i}$ is the point estimate for a given parameter in imputation set i $\bar{U_i}$ is the variance for that estimate in imputation set i Calculations for point estimates and variance $\bar{Q}$ gives the point estimate across imputations: $$ \bar{Q} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\hat{Q_i} $$ Then $\bar{U}$ is the average variation in each imputation (called within-imputation variance) $$ \bar{U} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\hat{U_i} $$ And $B$ is the between-imputation variance: $$ B = \frac{1}{m-1}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\hat{Q_i} - \bar{Q})^2 $$ And then $T$ is the total variance (combined $\bar{U}$ and $B$ ) $$ T = \bar{U} + (1 + \frac{1}{m})B $$ One can then take $\sqrt{T}$ as the standard error, and derive a Wald confidence interval as follows: $$ Lower 95\% CI = \bar{Q} - 1.96 \times \sqrt{T} $$ $$ Upper 95\% CI = \bar{Q} - 1.96 \times \sqrt{T} $$ Final caveat on derivation of confidence interval Note that the 1.96 above is useful for large-scale datasets but approximate elsewhere -- this is ideally derived with a t-distribution based on degrees of freedom (see page 5 of the linked paper, as this gets a bit more complex... I may add the formulae later but have run out of time to typeset now!.) The recommended calculations for the degrees of freedom for this t-statistic depend on the number of imputations $m$ , the average within-imputation variation, $\bar{U}$ and the between imputation variance, $B$ .
