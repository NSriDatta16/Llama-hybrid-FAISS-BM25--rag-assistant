Fitting regression spline

I am reading the paper by Willemsen et al (2015), " A multivariate Bayesian model for embryonic growth ", Statistics in Medicine , 34 :8, 1351â€“1365 I have a model like $$y_{ij} = \gamma_{i2} + f((t_{ij} - \gamma_{i1}) / exp(-\gamma_{i3}) ) + \epsilon_{ij}$$ Here, $y_{ij}$ = response, for ith person at jth time point.suppose i= 1,2,3,4 and j= 1,2,3 here, $$\gamma \sim MVN(0,\Sigma)$$ and $$\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^{2})$$ Here, f() is a spline function. I am trying to fit this model in rjags or rstan. but the problem is I have to loop through the spline function.Because, $\gamma$ is a random effect and two gamma parameters are inside the spline function.Is it possible to loop through the spline function in rjags or rstan ? Note : Any kind of example for looping through the spline will be highly appreciated.
