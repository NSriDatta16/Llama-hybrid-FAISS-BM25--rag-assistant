$\newcommand{\pperp}{\perp\kern-5pt\perp}$ If, in a graph with $n$ nodes, we want to check all the conditional independencies (CIs) of the form $(X\pperp Y\;|\;S)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are single nodes and $S$ is a set of nodes not containing $X$ and $Y$ , we would have to check $\binom{n}{2}2^{n-2}$ possibilities, where the symmetry in $X$ and $Y$ would half the number. I.e., in this case with five nodes, we have to check 40 CIs. Let's start with the BN . Two nodes $X$ and $Y$ that are adjacent cannot be d-separated by any set. This leaves us with the five pairs $(A, D), (A, E), (B, C), (B, E), (C, E)$ . Those can be easily checked: $$ \begin{align} (A, D) &: (A \pperp D \;|\; B, C), \; (A \pperp D \; | \; B, C, E)\\ (A, E) &: (A \pperp E \;|\; B, C), \; (A \pperp E \; | \; D, S),\quad\mbox{with }S\;\mbox{any element of the powerset }\mathcal P^{\{B, C\}}\\ (B, C) &: (B \pperp C \;|\; A), \quad \mbox{(note the collider (and its child)),}\\ (B, E) &: (B \pperp E \;|\; D, S),\quad\mbox{with }S\;\mbox{any element of the powerset }\mathcal P^{\{A, C\}}\\ (C, E) &: (C \pperp E \;|\; D, S),\quad\mbox{with }S\;\mbox{any element of the powerset }\mathcal P^{\{A, B\}} \end{align} $$ Thus, we have (not counting the symmetric cases) 16 ICs. How can we check those ICs in general? I know of one function, the function dsep in the R package pcalg , that checks d-separation in BNs. You would have to wrap it with a loop that generates all possible triples $(X, Y, S)$ which should not be too difficult. Next, we consider the MN . Here, too, adjacent nodes cannot be separated, so the possibilities are reduced to the same pairs as with the BNs: $$ \begin{align} (A, D) &: (A \pperp D \;|\; B, C), \; (A \pperp D \; | \; B, C, E)\\ (A, E) &: (A \pperp E \;|\; B, C), \; (A \pperp E \; | \; D, S)\quad\mbox{with }S\;\mbox{any element of the powerset }\mathcal P^{\{B, C\}}\\ (B, C) &: (B \pperp C \;|\; A, D), \; (B \pperp C \;|\; A, D, E)\\ (B, E) &: (B \pperp E \;|\; D, S),\quad\mbox{with }S\;\mbox{any element of the powerset }\mathcal P^{\{A, C\}}\\ (C, E) &: (C \pperp E \;|\; D, S),\quad\mbox{with }S\;\mbox{any element of the powerset }\mathcal P^{\{A, B\}} \end{align} $$ Thus, we have 17 ICs. How can we check those ICs in general? To check for a path between two nodes in an MN conditioned on $S$ , just remove the nodes in $S$ from the graph, together with all the edges connected to nodes in $S$ , and then check whether they are in the same graph component or simply apply any of the many path-finding algorithms out there. Finally , comparing the two sets above, we find: $$ \begin{align} \mbox{in BN but not in MN} &: (B \pperp C \;|\; A)\\ \mbox{in MN but not in BN} &: (B \pperp C \;|\; A, D), \quad (B \pperp C \;|\; A, D, E).\\ \end{align} $$
