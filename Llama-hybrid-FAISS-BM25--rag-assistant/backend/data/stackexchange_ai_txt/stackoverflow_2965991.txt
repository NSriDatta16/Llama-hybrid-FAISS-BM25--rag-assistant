The problem is not with client_id from what I can see. It looks more like the problem is with the 4th column, sup_item_cat_id I would run sp_helpconstraint sup_item and pay attention to the constraint_keys column returned for the foreign key FK_Sup_Item_Sup_Item_Cat to confirm which column is the actual problem, but I am pretty sure it is not the one you are trying to fix. Besides '123123' looks suspect as well.
