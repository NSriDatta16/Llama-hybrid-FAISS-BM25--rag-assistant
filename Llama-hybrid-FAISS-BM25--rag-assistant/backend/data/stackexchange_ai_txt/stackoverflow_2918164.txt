Many ownership schemes are possible, but some are more maintainable than others. Whenever one object x contains another y by reference, I ask: Who creates y ? That party should also destroy y . The advantage of this approach is that it works just as well when one or both objects are statically allocated, while approaches in which ownership is transferred must either use shared_ptr<> or make an assumption about whether y was dynamically allocated or not. The former introduces overhead, while the latter is fragile. If more than one party could create the object, as your code currently does (it could be created either by the caller or by the constructor as a default argument), by far the simplest way is to use shared_ptr<> . But it's a good idea to avoid the situation where different parties could create a resource if you possibly can -- that is "shooting a mouse with an elephant gun".
