You can calculate whatever error metric you would like as long as you are using the posterior distribution to generate predictions. For example, if you have a matrix named "predictions" that consist of a sample of predicted values for each observation (columns=observations, rows=predicted values from posterior), then the "Bayesian RMSE" calculated in R from simulated data would look something like this: n Where the result is a vector of RMSE values equal to the number of predicted values sampled from the posterior predictions.
