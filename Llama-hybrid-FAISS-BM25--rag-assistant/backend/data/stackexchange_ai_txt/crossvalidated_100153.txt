Basic question on PCA: can it be used to divide original features into groups?

I know this is basic question, but I have trouble understanding principal component analysis (PCA). PCA can be used for dimensionality reduction. Let's assume we have 100 features that we think are redundant. After applying PCA, we find that 2 principal components explain 90% of the variance. How can we divide the 100 original features into two groups (corresponding to the 2 main PCs?). Can the eigenvectors associated to the main PCs be used as 'representatives' of these two groups?
