Can I use multiple linear regression with binary output?

I have a dataset with $10$ inputs containing real numbers and an output which is binary ( $0$ or $1$ ), and I need to make predictions. So, I thought of using multiple linear regression to predict an output. If the output is $\geq 0.5$ , we can assume the binary output is $1$ and if the output is $ , the binary output turns to $0$ . Can this thought stand from a mathematical point of view? Does it follow mathematics' rules? I searched in the Stack Exchange site, and people suggest logistic regression. However, I cannot understand why one would use such complicated mathematics when somebody can use easier formulas?
