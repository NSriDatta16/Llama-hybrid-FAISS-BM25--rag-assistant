In general, multiple imputation works by using all available information in the model to simulate the missing values: I use the word "simulate" because you're technically doing more than just prediction, which involves more parametric assumptions. I assume the outcomes are either jointly missing or jointly observed, there are no cases where outcome A is known when outcome B isn't, or vice versa. Collinearity is not an issue. If you are treating these outcomes as independent (reporting odds ratios from two logistic regression models with separate outcomes), then you don't even need to worry about whether contradictory outcomes are simulated: (e.g. patients both discharged living and died within 30 days -- I assume you wouldn't have observed that in the hospital). Two overall thoughts about the analysis: Why aren't you reporting a Cox proportional hazards model? Treating death/discharge as a 1/0 event indicator and time until the observed discharge or death as the time-to-event is a very similar, common, and preferred analysis. The hazard ratios approximate relative risks, just like odds ratios (for rare outcomes) and patients who are discharged should be censored . This way you use all available information about when patients were at risk for dying, it is a much more powerful analysis. I don't really agree with the need for missing data methods. Complete case analyses of data (where rows of missing data are dropped from the analysis) are unbiased and require little validation of assumptions, unlike Multiple Imputation which has caveats of estimating and validating parametric models. 13% is fairly negligible when $n$ is 150 or more. As a rule of thumb, having 20 events (these are deaths) per variable in the adjusted model is sufficient for power considerations.
