I don't think there is such a shortcut. I must admit I have never missed it myself - what would a "paragraph" in your code be defined as? BTW, are you aware that Ctrl+Down is used to go from one Cell to the next in MATLAB's cell mode ? Cells could be considered logical "paragraphs" of your code, and you set their limits themselves (with comment lines starting with a double %% ).
