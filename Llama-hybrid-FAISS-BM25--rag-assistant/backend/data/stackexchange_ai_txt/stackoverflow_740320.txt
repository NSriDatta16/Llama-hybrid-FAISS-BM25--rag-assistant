Spelling out Naveen's answer : string x = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"; cerr Note that if the underlying allocator allocates more than n bytes when constructing a string of length n (e.g. by rounding up to the nearest 32 as MSVC++ appears to do), there's no way to make it use fewer bytes . But you probably wouldn't want to do that anyway, as this "rounding up" is done to make the dynamic memory allocation process more efficient, and also has the side effect of making concatenation of short strings faster on average (since fewer reallocations need to occur).
