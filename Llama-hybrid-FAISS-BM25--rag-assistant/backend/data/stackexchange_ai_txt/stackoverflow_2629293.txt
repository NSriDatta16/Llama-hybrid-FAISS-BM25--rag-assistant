PLKs and Web Service Software Factory

We found a bug in Web Service Software Factory a description can be found here . There has been no updates on it so we decided to download the code and fix it ourself. Very simple bug and we patched it with maybe 3 lines of code. However* we have now tried to repackage it and use it and are finding that this is seemingly an impossible process. Can someone please explain to me the process of PLKs? I have read all about them but still don't understand what is really required to distribute a VS package. I was able to get it to load and run using a PLK obtained from here , but i am assuming that you have to be a partner to get a functional PLK that will be recognized on other peoples systems? Every time i try and install this on a different computer I get a "Package Load Failure". Is the reason I am getting errors because I am not using a partner key? Is there any other way around this? For instance is there any way we can have an "internal" VS package that we can distribute? Edit Files I had to change to get it to work. First run devenv PostInstall.proj Generate your plks and replace ##Package PLK## (.resx files) --Just note that package version is not the class name but is "Web Service Software Factory: Modeling Edition" -- And you need to remove the new lines from the key ProductDefinitionRegistryFragment.wxi line 1252(update version to whatever version you used in plk) Uncomment all // [VSShell::ProvideLoadKey("Standard", Constant in .tt files.
