It seems I've found the problem: MS Excel seems to be unable to use the data on the page if the HTTP headers of the page specify that it should not be cache and it is transfered via HTTPS (the same headers sent via HTTP seem to get ignored). So by not sending these headers, Excel was suddenly able to access the data: Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache
