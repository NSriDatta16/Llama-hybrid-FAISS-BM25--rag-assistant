Do CART trees capture interactions among predictors?

This paper claims that in CART, because a binary split is performed on a single covariate at each step, all splits are orthogonal and therefore interactions among covariates are not considered. However, a lot of very serious references claim, on the contrary, that the hierarchical structure of a tree guarantees that interactions between predictors are automatically modeled (e.g., this paper , and of course the book by Hastie Elements of Statistical Learning). Who's right? Do CART-grown trees capture interactions among input variables? References: Paper 1: Lee, Sun-Mi, and Patricia A. Abbott.
