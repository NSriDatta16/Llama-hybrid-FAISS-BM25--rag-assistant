A "surrogate" is just a stand-in or proxy. In data science the word "surrogate" is used in more than one way (Bayesian hyperparameter optimization comes to mind). For interpretability, it seems to be used mostly to mean a more-interpretable model (maybe linear/logistic regression) that is trained to approximate the main, usually black-box, model (maybe boosted trees or a neural network). See e.g. https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/global.html . (The author refers to LIME as a "local surrogate" method and differentiates the "global surrogate" method, but I'm used to hearing just "surrogate" as a global one.)
