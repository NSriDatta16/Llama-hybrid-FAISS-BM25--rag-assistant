Coding Social Influence Logistic Regression

I am fairly new to regression modeling and was hoping to get some help. Forgive me if this is has been asked before, but I couldn't find anything (maybe I was using the wrong keywords) I have a dataset where I am attempting to answer the question: How much do a Person A's friends behaviors influence Person A's willingness to do action X? The data from the friends (predictors) looks like: Does best friend do X? Yes/No Does second best friend do X? Yes/No Does third best friend do X? Yes/No The outcome is Person A performing the action (Yes/No) I was hoping to fit a logistic regression model, but I am having trouble coming up with a way to code the predictors, however. If I treat the predictors as separate variables, I get strange results (i.e. second friend is highly significant but not first.) I think this is probably because there is high correlation between them? Further, there is a fair number of observations that don't list 3 friends (~25%) which can't be used in such an analysis. If I collapse them into one proportion (What proportion of the friends do action X?) the results are pretty clean, but I lose information about the ranking. Does anybody have a suggestion of a way of coding that will preserve more information? I am hoping for something that will preserve the ranking of the friends. Thanks for the help!
