DOM manipulation

Im trying to use the DOM in PHP to do a pretty specific job and Ive got no luck so far, the objective is to take a string of HTML from a Wordpress blog post (from the DB, this is a wordpress plugin). And then out of that HTML replace old content " with new content " in its place. Saving anything above and below that div in its structure. Then save the HTML back into the DB, should be simple really, I have read that a regex wouldnt be the right way to go here so Ive turned to the DOM instead. The problem is I just cant get it to work, cant extract the div or anything. Help me!! UPDATE The HTML coming out of the wordpress table looks like: Congratulations on finding us here on the world wide web, we are on a mission to create a website that will show off your culinary skills better than any other website does. blah blah We want this website to be fun and easy to use, we strive for simple elegance and incredible functionality.We aim to provide a 'complete package'. By this we want to create a website where people can meet, share ideas and help each other out. After several different (incorrect) workings all Ive got below is: $content = ($wpdb->get_var( "SELECT `post_content` FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE ID = {$article[post_id]}" )); $doc = new DOMDocument(); $doc->validateOnParse = true; $doc->loadHTMLFile($content); $element = $doc->getElementById('do_not_edit'); echo $element;
