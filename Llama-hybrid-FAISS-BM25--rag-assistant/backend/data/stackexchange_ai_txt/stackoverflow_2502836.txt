Background existing state of packages has been discarded means, that your Package (or Body) had some sort of state, which was lost by a recompilation. This is caused by a global variable stored in your Package. Until 11.2.0.2, constants did also cause this behavior (see documentation ). Since the package had already been used in your session, Oracle assumes that this state is relevant for you. Some variables might have changed, and when you recompile, the values are reset. This exception is thrown, so that your clients know that they can't rely on those variables any more. Solutions Call again, being aware that the state has been reset Close your session and reconnect before calling the package again. Reset the state manually (see Paul James' answer ) Solutions (changing source) Remove all global variables (and constants before 11gR2) if possible Move them to the Package Header so at least a recompilation of the Body works Replace global variables by DETERMINISTIC functions (as suggested by this answer ) Defining packages with PRAGMA SERIALLY_REUSABLE causes Oracle to re-initialize the global variables with every call to the server.
