Web-CAT CxxTest Eclipse GUI for test results not showing up

I am trying to execute test cases using CxxTest framework on Eclipse. After following instructions on this website - http://web-cat.cs.vt.edu/eclipse/cxxtest/ I am able to build the test case, but when I run it, it doesn't show the GUI (green/red bar) as shown in the article. I checked CxxTest guide, it mentioned about this flag "--gui=Win32Gui"; can someone help me where can I enter this flag in Eclipse settings? I am using Eclipse CDT (3.6.2) with Web-CAT plug in for CxxTest. I have cygwin installed with make, gcc, g++, gdb. Here is the output of build: Building target: BankAccountTests.exe Invoking: Cygwin C++ Linker g++ -o"BankAccountTests.exe" ./BankAccount.o ./runAllTests.o -lbfd -lz -lintl -liberty Finished building target: BankAccountTests.exe
