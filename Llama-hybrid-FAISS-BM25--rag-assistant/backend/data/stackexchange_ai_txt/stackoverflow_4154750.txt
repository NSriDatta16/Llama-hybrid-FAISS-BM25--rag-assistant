how to put a banner with link in the company's emails

First, sorry but my English isn't good We need develop an app that lets an admin user manage banners, and these banners could be placed in the footer-body of the company's emails. In the company they use Outlook and we work with C# .NET 3.5 I think in something like a listener than could catch the emails in some event on the Exchange Server, or something like an agent that could be installed in the clients, but i don't know about the implementation possibilities. The banners' info could be stored in a DB and the admin could use a web interface. Thanks in advance!
