You can always update the points within a vertex buffer as long as you make the buffer dynamic (specify D3D10_USAGE_DYNAMIC and use ID3D10Device::CopySubresourceRegion to update only parts of the buffer efficiently). That should be more efficient than re-creating buffers too frequently. Having different sizes for each slice is bad, however. You could either implement some kind of memory manager to keep the overall fragmentation of your vertex buffers low or this is the point where using multiple vb's is unavoidable. One way would be to round all slices sizes up to a reasonable limit and have one vb for each size.
