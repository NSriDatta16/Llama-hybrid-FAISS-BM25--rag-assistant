Statistical test to know if there is a significant difference between 2 different time series models

Imagine that I am doing a Rolling Forecast on a time series. I use the same data for model 1 and model 2 (e.g. model 1 ARIMA, model 2 HoltWinter Expo smoothing). To measure quality I use the sMAPE. However, I would like to know if there is a statistical test to determine whether one model is better than another. Is that possible? To illustrate the problem, imagine Scenario 1: Model 1 gives a sMAPE of 2.2 Model 2 gives a sMAPE of 5.5 Now, imagine Scenario 2: Model 1 gives a sMAPE of 2.2 Model 2 gives a sMAPE of 2.22 Intuitively, one may wonder whether model 1 in scenario 2 is really better than model 2. It may be that if new data are used in the future, model 2 will give a better (or identical sMAPE...). However, for scenario 1 it seems obvious that model 1 is significantly better than model 2. [However, I am not sure that such comments are credible in a scientific article. This is why I look for a statistical test]. PS: I mention sMAPE as a measure, but of course I am also ready to perform a test with the predicted data (yhat) and the actual data (y) instead of sMAPE. PS2: I use different models, some are from statistical field (e.g. ARIMA) and others are from machine learning field (e.g. random forest...) PS3: I would like to make it clear that I am not a statistician or mathematician. I prefer to clarify this in case my question seems somewhat strange to the experts in the field.
