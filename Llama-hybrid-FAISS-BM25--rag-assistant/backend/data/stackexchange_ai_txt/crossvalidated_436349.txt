Is there a difference between a binomial test and a GLM with binomial errors and no explanatory terms other than an intercept?

I have collected data on population sex ratios i.e. sexes (male or female) at adult age; my sample size is ~1500. I want to see if my sex ratio (no. of males/(no. of males+no. of females) differs significantly from the theoetical expectation of 0.5. I was reading Box 3.3 and it says that there are two distinct questions to ask: "first, does the sex ratio differ from the assumed binomial distribution; and second does it differ from some expected value, e.g. 0.5" To see if it differed from a binomial distribution, I ran a null logistic regression model (e.g. glm(sex~1, family=binomial) and compared the null deviance to the chi-squared distribution with the null degrees of freedom. I also ran a binomial test e.g. binom.test(no. of males, no. of males and females, p=0.5); both were significant. But I don't understand why these tests are different (I get different p-values - much lower on the former). What is a null binomial model doing that a binomial test isn't? What would it mean if the GLM was non-siginficiant but the binomial test was? and vice-versa?
