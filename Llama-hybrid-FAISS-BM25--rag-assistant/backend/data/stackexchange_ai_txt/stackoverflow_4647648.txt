magento how to send order emails only to the admin (not to customer)

I want magento to send the order emails only to the admin not to the customer, because the customer gets an email from another system. It's possible to send an ordermail to the customer, or to the customer and admin but it seems to be impossible to send the mail only to the admin. If someone knows how to do it I would be very thankful. best regards nico
