The question is a good fit for this site. You can almost certainly use an ordinary multiple regression model to perform this task. It would be helpful if the continuous value you want to predict is normally distributed, but that's not really necessary. More important is that the examples are independent, and that the variance of the output is constant across the training examples. You will need some software to perform the model fit. Then you will need to organize the data into a matrix with one row for each example, with the output value in the first column, and the other values represented in subsequent individual columns. For example, imagine you have 5k examples and 24 Booleans, then you will have a 5k (row) by 26 (column) matrix for your data, with each case in it's own row, the output value for that case in the first column, the Boolean values that correspond to that case in the next 24 columns (in order), and the continuous value in the last column. Terminology for multiple regression varies widely, unfortunately, but the most generic would be to refer to the output as the response variable, and the others as covariates.
