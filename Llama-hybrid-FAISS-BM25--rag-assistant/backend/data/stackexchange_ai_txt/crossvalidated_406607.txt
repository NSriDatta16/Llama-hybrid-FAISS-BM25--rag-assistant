Preparing a GLM logistic regression: choosing the factors

I am researching the incidence of pain after an operation, according to anaesthetic type. Univariate analysis is inconclusive, but I would like to proceed to multivariate analysis. I have done some GLM on R before, but not for logistic regression. My main issues that the more I read, the more I think that I might be doing something stupid. So here it goes: I am starting with all factors included in the model, to predict pain (yes or no) Call: glm(formula = pain ~ age + bmi + sex + pain_physio + preWOMACpain + pain_rest + anaesthesia.F, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = clean) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.2311 -0.5124 -0.3949 -0.2876 2.5053 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.286136 2.965939 -0.434 0.6646 age -0.031257 0.035777 -0.874 0.3823 bmi -0.017274 0.040200 -0.430 0.6674 sexm 0.171867 0.553194 0.311 0.7560 pain_physio -0.008165 0.108246 -0.075 0.9399 preWOMACpain 0.171939 0.086763 1.982 0.0475 * pain_rest 0.162063 0.101212 1.601 0.1093 anaesthesia.FS -0.964222 0.570588 -1.690 0.0911 . --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 113.72 on 164 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 103.56 on 157 degrees of freedom (27 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 119.56 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 Now, I had been told to choose those factors with a high Pr(>|z|) value and eliminate them from the equation. In that case I end up with: glm(formula = pain ~ pain_rest + preWOMACpain + anaesthesia.F, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = clean) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0563 -0.5071 -0.4018 -0.2869 2.4211 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Choosing the Pr>z value OR according to deviance? IF the latter, what happens when one factor happens to influence the deviance a lot, but then has a high Pr>z value? sorry for the long post, thanks so much stephen
