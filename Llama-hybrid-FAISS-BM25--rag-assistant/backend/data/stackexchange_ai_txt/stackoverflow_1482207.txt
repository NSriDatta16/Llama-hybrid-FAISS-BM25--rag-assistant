Based on the code you've shared, it looks like your touchesMoved: method will only be called for gestures within the tile. At each touch, you move the tile to be centered on that touch, so slow movements will each give an update within the tile -- and the tile will "catch up" with the fingertip -- before the gesture exits the tile. When a gesture is faster, however, the (x,y) touchesMoved events will be farther apart, and you'll lose the gesture when one (x,y) point is far enough away from the last one that it is outside of the tile already. You can work around this by capturing the movements in a superview large enough to cover the whole draggable area, and controlling the movement of the tile from within that superview. By the way, is there a reason you're overriding the hitTest: method? It might be easier (and possibly more efficient?) to use the built-in implementation.
