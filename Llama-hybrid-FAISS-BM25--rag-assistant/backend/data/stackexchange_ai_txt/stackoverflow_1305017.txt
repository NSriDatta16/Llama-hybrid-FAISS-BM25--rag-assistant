The reason why they are a must-use feature for me is because I often have the same list deployed in many locations across a site. To make a change to the list columns I can just change the parent content type and all of the lists using that content type are updated. But also as Janis says it's about classifying your data. Think through the data structure and define it in a content type. That content type can then be deployed wherever required and always updated centrally. This makes management of the data structure consistent, predictable and repeatable. It's also a good sign that whoever developed the solution paid some attention to planning and matching business requirements with the product. Otherwise it can indicate there has been a tendency to create lists ad hoc which can often end up being a maintenance nightmare.
