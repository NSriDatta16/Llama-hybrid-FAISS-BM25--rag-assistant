When is a Naive Bayes Model not Bayesian?

I've been using Bayesian inference for a while and as far as I could tell, Naive Bayes was "Bayesian" since it has a prior and a posterior and follows the Bayes rule. I just read a topic on "Bayesian Naive Bayes" in Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning book and I'm having trouble understanding how we can have a 'non-Bayesian' Naive Bayes. They mention that the usual naive Bayes is not Bayesian since it uses Maximum Likelihood Estimate to set p(c) (where c is the class) whereas in the Bayesian version, we can use a, say, Dirichlet distribution for the prior. My question is on the distinction between the two. Aren't both priors? I have searched a while but that's the only explanation I've managed to gather.
