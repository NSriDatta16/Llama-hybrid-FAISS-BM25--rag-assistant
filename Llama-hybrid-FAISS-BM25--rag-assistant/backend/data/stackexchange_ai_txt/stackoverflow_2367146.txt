Is it possible to update tfs metics like code churn, code coverage, last to break the build with Team City?

We've been using Team City as our build deployment server. We'd like to now update the metrics in tfs like "Code Churn", "Code Coverage". Is it possible to do this with TeamCity or do we just need to start using the tfs build server?
