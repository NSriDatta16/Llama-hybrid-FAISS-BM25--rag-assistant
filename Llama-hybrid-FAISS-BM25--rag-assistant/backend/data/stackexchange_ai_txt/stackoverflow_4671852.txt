How to bind to localStorage change event using jQuery for all browsers?

How do I bind a function to the HTML5 localStorage change event using jQuery? $(function () { $(window).bind('storage', function (e) { alert('storage changed'); }); localStorage.setItem('a', 'test'); }); I've tried the above but the alert is not showing. Update : It works in Firefox 3.6 but it doesn't work in Chrome 8 or IE 8 so the question should be more 'How to bind to localStorage change event using jQuery for all browsers?'
