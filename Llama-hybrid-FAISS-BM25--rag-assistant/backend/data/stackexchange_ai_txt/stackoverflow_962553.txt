From a usability point of view, I wonder if it wouldn't be friendlier to manage editability in the UI. As a user, if I enter data and get slapped with a message that I don't have permission to make that entry, I am not going to be encouraged to continue participating in your website. If a user is not able to add any entries to the database, you could display a read-only page (or DIV). Users with permissions to save new entries would get an editable page/DIV. For a user who is permitted to save some categories of information, but not others, would it work to limit the entries in that category by using a drop-down list? For example, Bob's publisher drop-down list displays MSPress, and Jim's list includes O'Reilly. That way, they can see clearly from those lists what they are permitted to do before they attempt to add the data. Permissions aren't a secret, hidden from the user.
