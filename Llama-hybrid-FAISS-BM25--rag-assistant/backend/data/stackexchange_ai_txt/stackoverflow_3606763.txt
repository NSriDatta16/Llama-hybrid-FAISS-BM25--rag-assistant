The third obvious answer (apart from exec:java and antrun) is GMaven , which lets you execute Groovy code either from an external class or inline from your pom. So if you only need a one-liner, embedding it in your pom is a quick and easy way to implement things (otherwise you should use an external script). BTW: if you don't know groovy: it's basically java with some additional syntax sugaring. Here's a sample configuration (of course you have to replace the artifact and class you use): org.codehaus.groovy.maven gmaven-plugin your.library.com your-library 1.2.3 process-classes execute (By making the encryption artifact a plugin dependency, you keep it out of your deployed dependencies, but this holds true for antrun and exec:java also)
