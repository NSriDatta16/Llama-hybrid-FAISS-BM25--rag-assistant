Invertibility of a Moving Average Process (MA)

Let us consider a moving average process given by : $$X_t = \epsilon_t + \epsilon_{t-1}$$ Is it possible to show that this process is not invertible by expressing $\epsilon_t$ in terms of $X_t , X_{t−1}, X_{t−2}, \dots$ ? If so, how can this be shown? Any solutions would be vastly appreciated.
