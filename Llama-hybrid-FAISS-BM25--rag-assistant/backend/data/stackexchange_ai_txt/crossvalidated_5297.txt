As @fabians noted, this can be done with logistic regression. You should investigate the inclusion of your predictor as an ordinal variable (not categorical) because with 9 levels you likely could model it that way and gain power. Then you can test for a linear effect or a quadratic effect etc. instead of ignoring the ordering of the "categories".
