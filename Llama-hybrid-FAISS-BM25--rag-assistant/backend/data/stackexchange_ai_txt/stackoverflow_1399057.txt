It sounds like you update the players position (start of the animation) by changing the grid cell in which its contained. To be able to achieve the desired effect, the sprites render position should be independent of where the entity represented by that sprite is located on the grid. And allow the user to move inside that grid within a range of the cell's center without changing cells. If this range is not chosen correctly you may en up with the "doh! im in this (visually) cell but it says im in the future cell" problem, or the "my avatar is overlapping a wall". Dont change the players cell until he is within a range (lets say 1/3 of the bounding sphere of the sprite) from the limits/borders of the cell that contains him. You would also have to modify the animation process for it to be interruptible. This is independent of the degrees of liberty you give the player (like, it could only move up, down, left, right, and diagonals vs 360 degrees) Another thing you should watch out for is, if the sprite is larger than the cell size. For instance, a Fat monster, or a Snake boss which spans across X cells but not necessarily in rectangular form.
