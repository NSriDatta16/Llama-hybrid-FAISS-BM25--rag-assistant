James' approach looks good: each observation, according to your description, might have a Binomial(n[i], p[i]) distribution where n[i] is known and--to be fully general--p[i] is a completely unknown function that rises from near 0 to near 1 as i increases. A logistic regression (GLM with binomial response and logistic link) against X[i]==i alone as the explanatory variable might even work. If it's a poor fit, you can introduce additional terms, such as higher powers or (better yet, given the nonparametric spirit) splines. This readily allows for incorporating any covariates into the model, too. In effect, what appears to be an abrupt change in the response might really just be a natural linear (or nearly linear) progression of logit(p) on which is superimposed Binomial variability. It is this possibility that leads me slightly away from the direction indicated by Thylacoleo, whose approach clearly is valid and likely to be effective. I'm just suspecting (hoping?) that your situation might be amenable to this somewhat simpler analysis. A complicating possibility concerns the possible autocorrelation of the responses, but that would need to be investigated only if the logistic residuals look strongly over- or under-dispersed. As a matter of EDA, you could smooth successive observations in a natural way and plot their logits against i. For instance, to smooth observations y[i] and y[i+1] you would construct (n[i]*y[i] + n[i+1]*y[i+1])/(n[i] + n[i+1]), effectively pooling two successive batches; longer smoothing windows can be constructed the same way. (This would automatically cancel out any negative short-term temporal correlation, too.) The fit to the smooth wouldn't be quite right--it would be less steep than appropriate--but it would suggest choices for the general form of the covariates (i.e., functions of i) to use in the regression. This is, of course, only one of many possible models. For example, the observations at each time point might be a binomial mixture, which would allow both for overdispersion and another way of getting nonlinear fits on the logit scale.
