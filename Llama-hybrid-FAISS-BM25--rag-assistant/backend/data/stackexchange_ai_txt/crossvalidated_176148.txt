Why would you not use something like lavaan or MPlus to run two models (unidimensional model and a two dimension model aligned to your EFA results) and compare the relative and absolute fit indices of the different models (i.e., information criteria - AIC and BIC, RMSEA, SRMR, CFI/TLI)? Note that if you go down this road you would not want to use PCA for the EFA, but rather principal factors. Somebody really concerned with measurement would embed the CFA into a full structural equation model. Edit: The approach I'm asking you to consider is more about figuring out how many latent variables actually explain the set of items. If you want to get the best estimate of the larger factor, I would vote for using the factor scores from the CFA model with the better fit, whichever that is.
