Update: 2017-01-10 Data URIs are now supported by all major browsers. IE supports embedding images since version 8 as well. http://caniuse.com/#feat=datauri Data URIs are now supported by the following web browsers: Gecko-based, such as Firefox, SeaMonkey, XeroBank, Camino, Fennec and K-Meleon Konqueror, via KDE's KIO slaves input/output system Opera (including devices such as the Nintendo DSi or Wii) WebKit-based, such as Safari (including on iOS), Android's browser, Epiphany and Midori (WebKit is a derivative of Konqueror's KHTML engine, but Mac OS X does not share the KIO architecture so the implementations are different), as well as Webkit/Chromium-based, such as Chrome Trident Internet Explorer 8: Microsoft has limited its support to certain "non-navigable" content for security reasons, including concerns that JavaScript embedded in a data URI may not be interpretable by script filters such as those used by web-based email clients. Data URIs must be smaller than 32 KiB in Version 8[3]. Data URIs are supported only for the following elements and/or attributes[4]: object (images only) img input type=image link CSS declarations that accept a URL, such as background-image, background, list-style-type, list-style and similar. Internet Explorer 9: Internet Explorer 9 does not have 32KiB limitation and allowed in broader elements. TheWorld Browser: An IE shell browser which has a built-in support for Data URI scheme http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme#Web_browser_support
