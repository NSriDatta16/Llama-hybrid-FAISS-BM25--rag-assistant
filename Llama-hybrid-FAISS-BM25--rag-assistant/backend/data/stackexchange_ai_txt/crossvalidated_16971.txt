Searching on Google scholar for "Bayesian changepoint detection" will produce some useful references, such as Adams and MacKay , which looks very interesting and sounds the sort of thing you are looking for. There is also a good book on "Numerical Bayesian Methods Applied to Signal Processing" by O'Ruanaidh and Fitzgerald that I remember being very good on this sort of thing, but I don't have a copy anymore, so I can't check for relevant pages (but the index suggests there is a chapter on retrospective changepoint detection).
