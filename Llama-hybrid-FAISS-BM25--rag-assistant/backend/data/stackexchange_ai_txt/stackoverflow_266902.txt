Actually, in most implementation that I know of sizeof(bool) == sizeof(int). "int" is intended to be the data size that is most efficient for the CPU to work with. Hence things which do not have a specific size (like "char") are the same size as an int. If you had a large number of them per object, you may want to implement a means of packing them for storage, but during normal calculation, it should be left it's native size.
