How to embed gcc and gcov command in expect script

I wanted to embed gcc and gcov command as part of expect script.. I tried as.. #!/usr/bin/expect -f send ":gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage c.c\r" send ":gcov c.c\r" But it doesnt run and execute the commands. Any insights to this? Thanks. The problem I have is I am not sure how can I embed the command at the right place. All I know was there is a given test cases as below :- #!/usr/bin/expect -f spawn $env(SUBJECTS_SRC_DIR)/vim -u $env(HOME)/.vimrc $env(TESTS_SRC)/copy1 expect "copy1" sleep 1 send ":se lines=24\r" send ":se columns=80\r" send ":redir >> move_2.1.1.out\r" send "$" send "\007" send "5h" send "\007" send ":redir END\r" send ":wq\r" expect exit -onexit { interact } This is contained in a specific file named testfile. Once this testfile is executed in Perl script, an output is generated. Something like below: $IN_DIR/$SCRIPT_FILE; $outfile = "$OUT_DIR/t$scriptCounter"; I tried to put the expect command which you have suggested earlier in a separate file named and passed to a new variable named... $MY_FILE in $IN_DIR . And then, i passed $IN_DIR/$MY_FILE ; but it doesnt do anything. The .gcno files are not executed either so thus .gcov.
