In general random forest are able to dial with an high number of variables. I personally think that it is not required a dimensionality reduction step unless you are not in a particular situation. With the random forest function you can compute the importance of each variable and this could be a way to perform dimensionality reduction. If you are interested only in classification I suggest you to do PCA on your data and to use all the variables after PCA transformation.
