UL stands for unordered list . Use it for lists of items where order is irrelevant. DIV stands for division . Use it to group items. ULs are cleaner than divs--- IF you're doing a list. A menu is mostly a list of links. A gallery has a list of images. A forum has a list of messages, and a list of users. RE: rounded corners: There's HTML, and there's more semantical HTML. You could use for anything, and you'd hardly note a difference, but using the proper elements will make it easier to understand (both by you when putting the design together, by screen-scrapers trying to find the proper item in the page, and sufficiently-smart search engines identifying fragments of content and navigation elements). So, in order to do rounded corners, you should consider wether a corner deserves its own content-free div (which, sadly, due to today's rendering engines, it does), or if you can use a better solution (ie, if the sidebar is a fixed size, you can get by with a single background; if you need it to expand in one dimension, you can use two: a top-aligned ceiling, and a bottom-aligned floor on its own "mobile" div (theorically you could avoid the extra div by modifying the bottom element of the div)).
