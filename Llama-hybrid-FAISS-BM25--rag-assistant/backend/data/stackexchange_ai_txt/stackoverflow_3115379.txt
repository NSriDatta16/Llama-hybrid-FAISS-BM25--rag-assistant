Yes, it will work fine to deploy locally and for adhoc distribution, so that everyone has their own certificate and key and you register all of these in the dev program as "developers". To deploy to the App Store, Apple has restricted this to only one person, they call it the "team agent" or such. Technically, this means that there can be only one private key and certificate who can sign apps for app store distribution. But you can generate this in one computer and then use Keychain to export the key and import it into other computers so other people can sign apps with the same key. Just make sure that you understand the legal implication of doing this: whatever you do, there will be one person in the end who is responsible for everything in Apple's eyes.
