For encrypting, depending on your security demands, the mcrypt_encrypt ( https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-encrypt.php ) functions may be simple enough. Once you get it working, then, if you need more security you can change the encryption function as the rest of your program won't care. Once you encrypt you can use base-64 encoding ( https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.base64-encode.php ), which is a known pattern that is well-tested. Since you are encrypting an int , which is at most 8 bytes long, any length of key should be fine, in order to have a known size result your key needs to >= 8 bytes. I would suggest you don't write your own encryption algorithm, as it will be insecure, and there are many out there to meet your needs, depending on whatever other requirements you have. As was mentioned, you can work back and determine the size that you want the encoded string to be, that will tell you how many bytes the encrypted result can be. Then, you can work out the size of the key in order to get the size of the encrypted message. If you want to encrypt a string of arbitrary length, then the previous paragraph will be wrong, as the size of the encrypted message won't be known.
