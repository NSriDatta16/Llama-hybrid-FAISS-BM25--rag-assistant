Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) can be sensitive to the presence of stop words, which are common words that occur frequently in most documents and do not provide useful information. Because TF-IDF is based on the frequency of words in a document, it can give higher weights to stop words if they occur frequently in the document. This can result in stop words having a disproportionate influence on the overall representation of the document, which can be detrimental to the performance of the model. To mitigate this issue, it is common to remove stop words from the documents before calculating the TF-IDF vectors. This can help to reduce the influence of stop words on the vectors and improve the performance of the model. In some cases, it may also be useful to apply other techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors, such as singular value decomposition (SVD) or principal component analysis (PCA), to remove less important features and improve the quality of the vectors.
