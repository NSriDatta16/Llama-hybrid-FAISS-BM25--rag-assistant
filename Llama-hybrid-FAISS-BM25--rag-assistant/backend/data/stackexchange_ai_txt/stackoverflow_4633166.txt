Make sure you aren't trying to access the site via http://localhost as Magento has an issue with domains that don't have a DOT in them. Instead, use http://127.0.0.1 or use a real domain pointed at your local IP. You will need to update the core_config_data table to reflect the hostname you want to access Magento from.
