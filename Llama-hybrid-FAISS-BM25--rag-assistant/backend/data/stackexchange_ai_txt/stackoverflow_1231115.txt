OP: I really think you need to organize your thoughts and ask a single, coherent question that, at a minimum, gives an overview of what you're trying to accomplish. So far you have asked at least four questions that are all minor variations of each other. To other people answering this question: From the context of his other questions, he's trying to do some bignum crypto (ala RSA), or some other bignum number theory stuff (needs to do powermod() ). Again, based on the context of his other questions, what he's asking in this question is how to do floor(log2(X)) + 1 where X is an arbitrary data type (hence the NSString ).
