You shouldn't remove scrollbars. If I have my font setting insanely large and didn't know of other ways to scroll other than scrollbars, I won't be able to actually view the content of the popup. Same goes for overflow: hidden . Just don't do it, as there is no way to make sure the content of the page will fit in an exact size. Scrollbars don't appear by default if the page isn't overflowing, so your problem is most likely that your popup is too small for the page you're loading in it. Also, most people hate popups, so you may want to try a less-intrusive approach, such as small yet exuberantly colored box to grab the user's attention.
