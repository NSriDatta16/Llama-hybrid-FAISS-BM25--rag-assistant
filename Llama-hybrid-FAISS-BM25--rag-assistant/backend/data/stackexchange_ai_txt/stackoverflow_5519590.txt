How to write regex to extract single words from parentheses?

I have a long string that contains text. I want to extract every word in between parentheses (' ') , but only as long as there is no more than one word in between the parentheses (IE, no spaces). For example, in the below: 7-SPEED DOUBLE CLUTCH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (2TC) MOONLIGHT BLACK SOFT TOP (3YA) 8-WAY PWR FRONT BUCKET SEATS -inc: driver memory, 2-way adjustable headrests, exterior mirror memory (459) BLACK SAPPHIRE METALLIC (475) HEATED FRONT SEATS (494) GLACIER SILVER ALUMINUM TRIM (REQ: ZMP M Sport Pkg) (4MG) NAVIGATION SYSTEM -inc: hard drive, HD Radio, real-time traffic info, voice command, cupholders (609) ASSIST W/BLUETOOTH -inc: (4) year subscription (w/609 Navigation System-inc: Online info services) (639) IPOD & USB ADAPTER (6FL) M SPORT STEERING WHEEL-MOUNTED SHIFT PADDLES (REQ: ZSP Sport Pkg or ZMP M Sport Pkg & 205 Auto Trans) (7XA) BLACK, BOSTON LEATHER SEAT TRIM (LWSW) M SPORT PKG -inc: 18&quot; x 7.5&quot; front & 18&quot; x 8.5&quot; rear double-spoke light alloy wheels (style 261M), P215/40R18 front & 245/35R18 rear performance tires, 8-way manual front sport seats, M sport steering wheel, shadowline exterior trim, increased top speed limiter (w/205 Auto Trans REQ: 7XA Shift Paddles) (ZMP) PREMIUM PKG -inc: Boston leather seat trim, universal garage door opener, auto-dimming pwr folding exterior mirrors w/memory, auto-dimming rearview mirror w/digital compass, pwr front seats w/pwr lumbar support, Assist w/(4) year subscription, Bluetooth, illuminated exterior door handles, front/rear reading lights, front footwell illumination, driver/front passenger illuminated vanity mirrors, ambiance interior lighting (ZPP) VALUE PKG -inc: Boston leather seat trim, iPod and USB adapter (ZVP) I want to get as a result 2TC 3YA 459 475 494 4MG 609 639 6FL 7XA LWSW ZMP ZPP ZVP What is the best way to parse this? I'm implementing this in C# if it matters
