I agree that this sounds like a great idea. Indeed, some of my t-SNE plots have shown great separation of the data in just two dimensions. The trouble is that t-SNE gives no ability to map new points into the low-dimensional space, unlike, for instance, PCA, which gives you a linear transformation to apply to new points. Thus, you cannot make predictions on new data or even perform standard techniques like using test sets, cross validation, or bootstrap validation.
