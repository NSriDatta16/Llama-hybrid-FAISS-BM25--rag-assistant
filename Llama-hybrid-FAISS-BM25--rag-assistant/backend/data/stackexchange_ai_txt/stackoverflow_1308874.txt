There's the theoretical answer and the practical answer. In theory, setting a larger capacity may change the allocation and storage strategy for the array (although called "NSArray" internally the structure is a bit more complex than that). From a practical standpoint, the array will reallocate as needed and with the numbers you're talking about I doubt there would be any difference whatsoever. I might do an arrayWithCapacity if I knew I'd be putting thousands upon thousands of items in. 3 vs. 50 is essentially meaningless. The best use for the "withCapacity" from my perspective is just providing an obvious hook to hang your assumptions on, so you could (for example) have in-code documentation of something that you might later want to assert on. but it's by no means required. From a practical perspective, the best use of your time is to not even think about the issue.
