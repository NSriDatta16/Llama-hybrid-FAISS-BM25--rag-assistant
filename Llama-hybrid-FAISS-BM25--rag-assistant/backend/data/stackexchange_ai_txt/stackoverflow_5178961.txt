Magento - configuring memcached

I'm trying configure memcache using Magento. Looking around in the code, I see some configuration in local.xml.additional and I've also seen examples of putting cache configuration in the local.xml So, I left the local.xml.additional file alone and i put the following in local.xml File memcached localhost 11211 1 memcached localhost 11211 1 But running: telnet localhost 11211 Doesn't seem to be showing anything when I refresh the Magento pages. Do I need any further configuration? Thanks UPDATE: running: memcached -vv and refreshing the pages, gives me the following output: 31 END 31 NOT_FOUND Does this mean that memcache is working on my store? Thanks again
