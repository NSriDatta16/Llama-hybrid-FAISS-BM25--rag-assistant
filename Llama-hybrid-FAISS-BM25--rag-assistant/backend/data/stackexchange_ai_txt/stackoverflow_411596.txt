Not knowing the specifics of FogBugz, but... The most common reason for turning off DEP is programmatically generated thunks on the stack or the heap. The Windows Kernel emulates the most common ones but "most common" wasn't very good coverage. The second most common reason for turning off DEP is incorrectly linked code segments that appear to be data segments. The third most common reason is machine code in strings. In general, this is really bad style but sometimes on Windows it cannot be helped. The fourth most common reason is some algorithm in the code assumed the stack layout. DEP messes with that. Or perhaps the program really is running code on a heap buffer.
