I don't think you are going to be able to do this as an Applet. (There may be settings in the browser for how much memory to assign to applets, but I'm not aware of any.) If you can use Java webstart, I would use that. You can set the amount of memory required: The advantage with using webstart is that the user does not need to configure their browser. EDIT: The Java control panel does have memory settings for applets. See How can I start an Java applet with more memory? However, unless you have just a handful of clients who don't mind altering their java settings (and that they have appropriate permissions and skills), this is not a nice user experience. With web start,you can set all this up in the JNLP descriptor and you're all set to go.
