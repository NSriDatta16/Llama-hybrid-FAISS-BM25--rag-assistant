What is the difference between standard errors and residuals in OLS?

I'm trying to get a deeper understanding of how OLS works. One thing that I thought I understood is the difference between standard errors and residuals. Here are two definitions Standard errors: The average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line. Residuals: The difference between the actual value and the value predicted by the model ( $y_i - \hat y_i$ ) for any given point. Where I always assumed that number 2 was unobservable (Actually in this post they claim it's the other way around: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/232588/334202 ). But if I run a simple regression in R like this I get both! So how can I think about this? library(tidyverse) library(broom) mtsmall rownames_to_column(var="carnames") |> as_tibble() |> select(mpg,hp,wt) model1 rename(.mpg_hat = .fitted) mtsmall_predicted |> head(5) Output: mpg hp wt .mpg_…¹ .se.fit .resid .hat .sigma .cooksd 1 21 110 2.62 22.6 0.777 -1.59 0.0405 3.92 3.74e-3 2 21 110 2.88 22.6 0.777 -1.59 0.0405 3.92 3.74e-3 3 22.8 93 2.32 23.8 0.873 -0.954 0.0510 3.92 1.73e-3 4 21.4 110 3.22 22.6 0.777 -1.19 0.0405 3.92 2.10e-3 5 18.7 175 3.44 18.2 0.741 0.541 0.0368 3.93 3.89e-4
