No transformation is necessary to achieve linearity, because that isn't required. You simply have a curvilinear relationship between this variable and the outcome. So add a squared version of this variable in addition to the untransformed version. If you need a test of this variable, you would perform a simultaneous test of both terms. It may help you to see a couple of my previous answers where this is demonstrated (in R): CDF and logistic regression How to use boxplots to find the point where values are more likely to come from different conditions?
