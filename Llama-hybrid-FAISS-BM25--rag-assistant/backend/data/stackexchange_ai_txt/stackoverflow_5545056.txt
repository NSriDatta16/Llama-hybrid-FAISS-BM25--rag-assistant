File names not sorted

setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion set "var=xxxxxxxxxxx\" Test.txt echo !var! set "var1=$(LOCAL_PATH)/batch/" set "var2=:/data/local/12m/batch/" set "var3=$(LOCAL_PATH)/" set "var4=:/data/local/12m/" for %%a in (batch/*.bat) do ( >>Test.txt echo !var1!%%a!var2!%%a \ ) for %%a in (*.bmp) do ( >>Test.txt echo !var3!%%a!var4!%%a \ ) for %%a in (*.wav) do ( >>Test.txt echo !var3!%%a!var4!%%a \ ) for %%a in (*.cfg) do ( >>Test.txt echo !var3!%%a!var4!%%a \ ) problem : the filenames should be in sorted order in Test.txt but it is not(The .bat files should be in sorted order followed by .bmp files in sorted order etc). How to fix this? Note: There is a >> operator in front of Test.txt everywhere but for some reason this editor removed it... e.g it is >>test.txt echo !var1" EDIT by jeb: You should use code formatting and read the How to Format help at the right side. Thanks SSE @jeb : I noticed that the files are sorted if I run the batch file in my local drive/folder and the files are not sorted if I run the batch file in a mapped drive. I need this to work in my mapped drive. Copying contents to individual output files per file type and then copying all the contents to one single file also does not sort files in mapped drive. I am using windows 7. Is this a windows 7 issue? The mapped drive is a map of my local workspace on a linux server. I believe that it follows ext2 file system. @Niel @Robert Harvey : I tried for /F "delims=" %%a in ('dir /b /on batch\*.bat') do , but it does not copy any batch file at all... my output file is empty
