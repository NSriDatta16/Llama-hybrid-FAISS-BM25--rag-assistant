To answer the second question first, they are not. A corpus is simply a set of documents. The bag of words assumption means, loosely, that the order of words in a document doesn't matter. It's applied in many language models, just about any that disregards grammar but maintains a count of words used. To your primary question, I think you're interested in deriving predictive features for a particular class, and asking whether you can do that manually. (This seems to be how you're using the term "bag of words.") In principle sure, you could come up with a list of terms related to math or neurobiology and use those as features in a learning algorithm. But there are methods like supervised topic models to do that for you, though the only implementation I'm aware of is an academic one written in C++. This would be a more principled way of deriving what you're interested in, and would save you a thousand Google searches.
