ASP.NET MVC 2 Confused about Javascript

Hi I'm building my first MVC 2 app and I'm really confused by all the examples I'm reading. I am also using the Telerik MVC kit for their Grid, and other such controls. I've read many tutorials and watched videos but I can't quite grasp the pattern of where to place javascript and how to wrap blocks of code in the appropriate tags. For example I am trying to follow the task of associating a Client with a State via a DropDownList of states (AZ, CA, etc..): My ClientController looks like this: void PopulateStates() { var tempRepo = RepositoryFactory.CreateRepostiory (RepositoryType.Business); var states = tempRepo.QueryAll().ToList(); var svmList = states.Select(s => Mapper.Map (s)); ViewData["States"] = svmList; } public ActionResult Index() { PopulateStates(); return View(); } Index.aspx looks like this: " %> ClientGrid.ascx looks like this: " %> () .Name("ClientGrid") .EnableCustomBinding(true) .DataKeys(keys => { keys.Add(c => c.Id); }) .ToolBar(commands => commands.Insert().ButtonType(GridButtonType.Text)) .DataBinding(dataBinding => { dataBinding.Ajax() .Select("_Select", "Clients", new Telerik.Web.Mvc.GridState()) .Insert("_Insert", "Clients", new Telerik.Web.Mvc.GridState()) .Update("_Save", "Clients", new Telerik.Web.Mvc.GridState()) .Delete("_Delete", "Clients", new Telerik.Web.Mvc.GridState()); }) .Columns(columns => { columns.Bound(c => c.Id); ... And the ClientViewModel.ascx: " %> model.StateName) %> model.State) %> model.State) %> And finally the editor template /Shared/EditorTemplates/StateViewModel.ascx : " %> )ViewData["States"]) .Where(s => s.StateType == "State") .Select(s => new SelectListItem { Text = s.FormattedName, Value = s.Id.ToString(), Selected = (Model != null) ? (Model.Id == s.Id) : false }) ) %> In general, I don't understand which portion ends up at the client and which portion ends up compiled at the server. I'm also very confused by the different notations for lambdas and/or registering events. The lambda stuff is killing me. I spend a ton of time just trying to figure out when to use new {} and () => .... Where does javascript go in these 3 files, and do I need special tags for it? Where do I use tag versus and ? Why is it that sometimes inside it asks to terminate with semicolon like MyFunction(); and other times it's just MyFunction() ? Thank you!
