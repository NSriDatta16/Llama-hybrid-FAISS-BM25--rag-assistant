How to use the DragMoveBehaviorElement (drag) on a button in blend?

i'm trying to make a draggable button in blend. using the dragmovebehaviorelement on a button does nothing, and i think this is because a button already uses the LeftMouseButon_down event. using this behavior on a shape (exp: ellipse) works fine. is there a way to make a draggable button?
