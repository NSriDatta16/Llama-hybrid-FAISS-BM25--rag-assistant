Avoid things traditionally called "web services" in .NET (such as .asmx web services and WCF SOAP web services) for this type of task. You don't want to send a gigantic blob of Base64 encoded video down to the client. There are server products specifically designed for this kinda thing like Windows Media Services or IIS Smooth Streaming . Basically you'll want to have your videos encoded and ready to go on the server and then perhaps use a web service to provide the authenticated client with a direct link to those streams.
