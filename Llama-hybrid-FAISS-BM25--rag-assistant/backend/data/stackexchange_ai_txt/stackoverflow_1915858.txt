Can longitude and latitude change?

I'm working on a GeoTargeting application. I'm curious if longitude and latitude of a point on the earth can change? If you know the exact position of the statue of liberty how sure is it that longitude and latitude will stay the same. Does it change according to the season, time in the year, or slowly over time
