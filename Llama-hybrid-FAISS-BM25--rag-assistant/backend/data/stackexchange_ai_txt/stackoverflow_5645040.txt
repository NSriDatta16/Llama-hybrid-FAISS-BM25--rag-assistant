You shouldn't scrape Wikipedia when they offer the data freely for download: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download And tips on how to use it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download#Help_parsing_dumps_for_use_in_scripts Then you can simply use the tools that have already been made available to you: http://search.cpan.org/dist/MediaWiki-DumpFile Alternatively, if you really do want just a known, limited subset, there is an API available: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API To use that with perl you'd start looking at the LWP and JSON modules, or, again, leverage CPAN: http://search.cpan.org/dist/MediaWiki-API
