Cox models can be fit with the type of data you are using if your true underlying response is continuous. You might model the time to when they stopped taking their assigned medication (which could have occurred at week 5.1 or 5.5) and assume that your data are interval censored (you know that the event occurred between week 5 and 6 but you don’t know exactly when). See here for more information on interval censoring. You might also do pooled logistic regression for your analysis. In pooled logistic regression analysis of survival data, continuous time is discretized anyway, so the fact that your data are discrete wouldn’t be an issue.
