Obviously Mark's answer is correct and the way you need to go for this particular problem. However, in the future I suggest give the documentation a quick glance next time you have an issue. The View documentation in particular is often my go-to page for discovering new (to me) Android framework capabilities. In general, if you need something and think it might be too much effort to do but that it's common enough that it should've already been done by someone , I recommend these steps: Open the view docs and look under "Indirect Subclasses" for something that sounds what you need. Open up the API Demos sample app and see if you can find something that looks like what you're trying to achieve. It has quite good coverage of the API and you can easily find the code in the Sample Code section. Check out the other sample projects. There are some pretty involved ones in that directory. Of course, Stack Overflow is a great resource, but sometimes the answers are too specific and don't lend themselves to discovering new features.
