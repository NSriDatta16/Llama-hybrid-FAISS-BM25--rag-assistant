Logback natively implements the SLF4J API. This means that if you are using logback, you are actually using the SLF4J API. You could theoretically use the internals of the logback API directly for logging, but that is highly discouraged. All logback documentation and examples on loggers are written in terms of the SLF4J API. So by using logback, you'd be actually using SLF4J and if for any reason you wanted to switch back to log4j, you could do so within minutes by simply dropping slf4j-log4j12.jar onto your class path. When migrating from logback to log4j, logback specific parts, specifically those contained in logback.xml configuration file would still need to be migrated to its log4j equivalent, i.e. log4j.properties . When migrating in the other direction, log4j configuration, i.e. log4j.properties , would need to be converted to its logback equivalent. There is an on-line tool for that. The amount of work involved in migrating configuration files is much less than the work required to migrate logger calls disseminated throughout all your software's source code and its dependencies.
