The best thing to do is try to get a solid grasp on object-oriented programming, if you're struggling with the concept. It seems like you don't have a clear model of what state data you will need to store. Try diagramming the "state" of your game; think of it as a minimal snapshot of what objects exist in your game at a given time, and how they are organized. Something like player.canSee(otherPlayer) can be calculated, and doesn't necessarily need to be stored. Even though you probably will not use a database at all, you might find it helpful doing some reading and practice with relational database design. The concepts of relational design will help you organize your thoughts and store information in a clear, consistent way.
