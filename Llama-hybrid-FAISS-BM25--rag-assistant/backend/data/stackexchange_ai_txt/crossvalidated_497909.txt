How does self play work in RL?

I try to understand how self play worl in Reinforcement learning with ppo2. Do i have one model which predicts an action for both sides? If yes, do i Update the model with experiences from both sides? In this case Player A and B always belong to the same Model? Or do i have a copy of the agent which generates actions for the right player and is updated after same time with the weights of the left agent? Thanks!
