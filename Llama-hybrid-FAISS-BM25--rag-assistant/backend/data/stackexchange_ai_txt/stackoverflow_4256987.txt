How Do You Get The Store Secure URL in Magento?

I have a form in Magento that is displayed over the insecure URL (http) but I need it to submit to the secure URL (https). I display the URL I currently use the following code: Mage::getBaseUrl(Mage_Core_Model_Store::URL_TYPE_WEB) I am assuming I need to change the URL_TYPE_WEB to something else. Does anyone know what that something else is?
