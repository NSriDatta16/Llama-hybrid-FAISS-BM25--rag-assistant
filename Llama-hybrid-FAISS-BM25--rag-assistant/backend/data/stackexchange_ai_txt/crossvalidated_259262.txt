Yes, I've done this very same task. The OneVsRestClassifier in scikit-learn can be used for multi-class or multi-label classification. (when used in multi-label classification, this is the same as what's called Binary Relevance in the multi-label classification literature). This meta classifier takes on classifier as parameter (SVM is good) and runs it once for each label then outputs multiple labels depending upon how likely each one is (but does not take into account dependencies between them).
