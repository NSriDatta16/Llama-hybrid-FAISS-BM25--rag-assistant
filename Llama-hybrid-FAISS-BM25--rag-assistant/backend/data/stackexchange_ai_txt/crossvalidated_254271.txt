What you are calling "separation" (not 'seperation') covers two different situations that end up causing the same issue â€“ which I would not call, however, an issue of "instability" as you do. An illustration: Survival on the Titanic Let $DV \in (0, 1)$ be a binary dependent variable, and $SV$ a separating, independent variable. Let's suppose that $SV$ is the class of the passengers on the Titanic , and that $DV$ indicates whether they survived the wreckage, with $0$ indicating death and $1$ indicating survival. Complete separation is the situation where $SV$ predicts all values of $DV$. That would be the case if all first-class passengers on the Titanic had survived the wreckage, and none of the second-class passengers had survived. Quasi-complete separation is the situation where $SV$ predicts either all cases where $DV = 0$, or all cases where $DV = 1$, but not both. That would be the case if some first-class passengers on the Titanic had survived the wreckage, and none of the second-class passengers had survived. In that case, passenger class $SV$ predicts all cases where $DV = 1$, but not all cases where $DV = 0$. Reversely, if only some second-class passengers on the Titanic had died in the wreckage, then passenger class $SV$ predicts all cases where $DV = 0$, but not all cases where $DV = 1$, which includes both first-class and second-class passengers. What you are calling "well-separated classes" is the situation where a binary outcome variable $DV$ (e.g. survival on the Titanic ) can be completely or quasi-completely mapped to a predictor $SV$ (e.g. passenger class membership; $SV$ need not be binary as it is in my example). Why is logistic regression "unstable" in these cases? This is well explained in Rainey 2016 and Zorn 2005 . Under complete separation , your logistic model is going to look for a logistic curve that assigns, for example, all probabilities of $DV$ to $1$ when $SV = 1$, and all probabilities to $DV$ to $0$ when $SV = 0$. This corresponds to the aforementioned situation where only and all first-class passengers of the Titanic survive, with $SV = 1$ indicating first-class passenger membership. This is problematic because the logistic curve lies strictly between $0$ and $1$, which means that, to model the observed data, the maximisation is going to push some of its terms towards infinity, in order, if you like, to make $SV$ "infinitely" predictive of $DV$. The same problem arises under quasi-complete separation , as the logistic curve will still need to assign only values of either $0$ or $1$ to $DV$ in one of two cases, $SV = 0$ or $SV = 1$. In both cases, the likelihood function of your model will be unable to find a maximum likelihood estimate: it will only find an approximation of that value by approaching it asymptotically. What you are calling "instability" is the fact that, in cases of complete or quasi-complete separation, there is no finite likelihood for the logistic model to reach. I would not use that term, however: the likelihood function is, in fact, being pretty "stable" (monotonic) in its assignment of coefficient values towards infinity. Note: my example is fictional. Survival on the Titanic did not boil down just to passenger class membership. See Hall (1986) .
