Your best solution is to use polling like Kragen suggest's, it ensures your server doesn't get bogged down with idle sessions that only exist to send data in rare occasions. Polling gives you the same functionality however you don't have that constant load on your server, that in addition to needing one thread per client (assuming your server spawns a thread for each client like apache, etc). With a thin client (running within a browser) you could do it using AJAX to prevent constant reloading of the page. If within a thick client you could do the same thing but use a background timed event to send requests. If you still need to push data to your client from the server in a Fat Client scenario the best solution is to have the client open a listening socket, when a request from the server needs to be pushed to the client, the server connects to the client and sends the request (upon authentication the server records that users IP to initiate the connection). In a thin client scenario (via web browser) this is extremely harder to do if not impossible (when proper security policies are used). We would suggest a more detailed explanation of why you are trying to do this, that would allow us to give you a more 'targeted' solution that fits your needs.
