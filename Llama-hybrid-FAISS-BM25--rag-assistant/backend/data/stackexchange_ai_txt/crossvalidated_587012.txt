Multi-class image classification model has high test accuracy but low prediction confidence

TL;DR: Although my model is predicting correct classes, it is not very confident about those correct predictions. My dataset contains 32x32-sized images for 46 classes. I have trained a Deep Convolutional Neural Network which is giving me a high class prediction accuracy (~98.8%) and F1 score (also above 98%). However, when I observe the softmax probabilities that my model assigns to each of the 46 classes, I see that the correct class only has a probability of around 0.057 while the other 45 classes have a probability of around 0.02. Why this could be happening and how I can improve my model to predict with high confidence?
