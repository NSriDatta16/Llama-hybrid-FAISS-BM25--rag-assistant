What is randomized node optimization?

In this MS tech report at section 2.2.3 (p. 15) the authors talk about the randomness model in random forests. They say that the two most popular ways to inject randomness are bagging and randomized node optimization (RNO). However, I have trouble to understand the abstract definition of RNO given there. The paper says: If $\tau$ is the entire set of all possible parameters $\theta$ then when training the $j^{th}$ node we only make available a small subset $\tau_j \subset \tau$ of such values. I don't know to what the term parameters refers to in this context. My guesses for how RNO works are either randomly reduce the dimensionality of the feature space at each node by selecting $d$ out of $n$ features, so that $d or randomly reduce the number of values each feature can have by shrinking the training set at each node Can someone explain me what RNO is actually doing with the training set at a certain node?
