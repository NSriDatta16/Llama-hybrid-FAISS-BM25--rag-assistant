How can I stop crontab from messing up this simple BASH script (and why is it happening)?

I have a strange issue, relating to running a BASH script via cron (invoked via crontab -e). Here is the script: #!/bin/bash SIG1="$(iwconfig wlan0 | awk '/Quality=/ { print $2} ' | cut -c 9-10)" SIG2="$(iwconfig wlan0 | awk '/Quality=/ { print $2} ' | cut -c 12-13)" echo "$SIG1:$SIG2" >> test.txt exit When run from the commandline, I get the expected output of 45:70 echoed to the end of the text file. However, when I run the script via cron (using crontab -e) and the following entry: * * * * * bash /home/rupert/test.sh I just get the colon (:) echoed to the text file, the values SIG1 and SIG2 aren't created and I have no idea why. Why would running via cron mess up the script? FWIW, here is the output of iwconfig wlan0 with no additional processing: wlan0 IEEE 802.11abgn ESSID:"plumternet" Mode:Managed Frequency:2.452 GHz Access Point: 00:18:84:2A:68:AD Bit Rate=54 Mb/s Tx-Power=15 dBm Retry long limit:7 RTS thr:off Fragment thr:off Power Management:off Link Quality=46/70 Signal level=-64 dBm Rx invalid nwid:0 Rx invalid crypt:0 Rx invalid frag:0 Tx excessive retries:0 Invalid misc:0 Missed beacon:0 I am doing all this because I want to display the WiFi Link Quality value "46/70" on an LCD screen and the program I use does this by reading a text file. However, when run via cron, the values get lost...??? I am using cut -c 9-10 and cut -c 12-13 because I was thinking the "/" might be causing an issue in the script, I'd be happy to just use cut -c 9-13, but I thought it might fix the issue, but it didn't. Help!! Cool, thanks to you guys, I realised it was a PATH problem, simply giving the full path to iwconfig (/sbin/iwconfig) fixed it. Here is a pic of the LCD screen now showing all the correct info: http://img835.imageshack.us/img835/4175/20100825122413.jpg
