The issue for me isn't so much dealing with allocating some space, in concept we can do this: byte *pA = new byte[the size this time]; but rather what you do with these typeA objects. What does pA->getValue() return? Is the intent that it's always, say, a 32 bit numeric? Or do we really have pA->get16bitValue() in some cases and pA->get32bitValue() in others? I'd be seeking a way to encapsulate that difference first, and the way of doing that very much depends on how you use the values. The storage problem is probably solvable with a bit of dynamic allocation. It's the actual beahviour of typeA that I see as tricky.
