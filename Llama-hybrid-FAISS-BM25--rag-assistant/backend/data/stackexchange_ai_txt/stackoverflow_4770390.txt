jquery ui draggable stop function on clone

i have 2 lists, one draggable(#object) and one sortable(#target). i would like to drag a clone to the sortable list and then do some things to the clone once it is in the sortable list. i've got something up on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/d8nieldonaldson/smYeh/3/ here's some of the code: $("#object li").draggable({ connectToSortable: "#target", opacity: 0.5, helper: "clone", revert: "invalid", stop: function(e , ui) { ui.helper.css("width" , "140px"); } }); any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!
