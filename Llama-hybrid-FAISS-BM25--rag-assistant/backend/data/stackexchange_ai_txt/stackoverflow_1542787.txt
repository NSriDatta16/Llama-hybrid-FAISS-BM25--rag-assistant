A simple approach would be to store the filename, dates and sizes of a users uploads in the database too. Then you can easily reject an upload when it exceeds their total storage. This also makes it easy to show a list of files sorted in a variety of ways, allowing a user close to their limit to select some files for removal. You could even use the average size of the files the user uploads to warn them when they are getting close to using up all their space.
