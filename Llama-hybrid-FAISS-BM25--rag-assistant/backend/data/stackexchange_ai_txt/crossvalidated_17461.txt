Mismatch between significant variables from logistic regression and tree splits in R

I'm studying a data set in R using both regression trees (tree and rpart functions) and logistic regression. I'm finding explanatory variables in the regression which are significant, but when I fit a tree those variables are not used as splits. What does this imply about the predictive ability of the results?
