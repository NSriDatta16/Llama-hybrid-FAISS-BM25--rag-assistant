To answer you question very literally, MCEM and MCMC are algorithms used to solve different problems. MCEM maximizes a likelihood function (or posterior probability in the case of MAP estimates), while MCMC integrates over a posterior distribution. When you talk about variance, you are talking about the estimators, not algorithms. So your question should be rephrased as "which has lower variances, posterior means or MLE estimates?". That, of course, is a very vague question.
