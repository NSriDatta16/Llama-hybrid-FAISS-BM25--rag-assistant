As per V4Vendetta, you can disable ViewState on your controls, but then you would need to develop manually "ASP classic style" e.g. if you needed to keep the user on the page and if a form failed validation, you would then need to set the initial values back to whatever the user last set them at, otherwise the user data would be lost. The ASP Net controls handle this somewhat more elegantly by retaining this information in ViewState. But if you either never need to render the control again, or if you render the control data from fresh every time without needing its previous state (e.g. a paged grid), then disabling ViewState for the control will save you bandwidth. A good explanation of ViewState here .
