You mentioned CSRF in the title but didn't really cover it in your question. You can read about it in detail online , but CSRF is basically an attack that lets a legitimate user submit to a site unknowingly. For instance, if SO wasn't protecting against such attacks, I could craft a form that causes your SO profile information to be changed when you click on this bad form of mine, expecting something else to happen ("Win a Million bucks!! Click here!!"). This form would use your browser cookies to auth you with SO and make it appear to SO that you were legitimately submitting updates to your profile. To protect against this, you really want to do a couple of things: ensure that GETs don't cause updates (for instance, don't post a new status update to a user's profile using query params on a GET) ensure that all POSTs are accompanied by a hidden field that lets you validate that the form was generated by your service and not by someone else, and that it was for the intended user. So this hidden field must be generated by the server each time it sends down the html for the form, and should be unique for that user for that session. An alternative to that second item is to check that the referrer is always your site or a site you expect the POST from. I don't encourage this for non-HTTPS sites because some browsers/networking hardware strip out referrers, and it's not always reliable that a referrer exists.
