Some modified builds used to set the system property ro.modversion for this purpose. Things seem to have moved on; my build from TheDude a few months ago has this: cmb@apollo:~$ adb -d shell getprop |grep build [ro.build.id]: [CUPCAKE] [ro.build.display.id]: [htc_dream-eng 1.5 CUPCAKE eng.TheDudeAbides.20090427.235325 test-keys] [ro.build.version.incremental]: [eng.TheDude.2009027.235325] [ro.build.version.sdk]: [3] [ro.build.version.release]: [1.5] [ro.build.date]: [Mon Apr 20 01:42:32 CDT 2009] [ro.build.date.utc]: [1240209752] [ro.build.type]: [eng] [ro.build.user]: [TheDude] [ro.build.host]: [ender] [ro.build.tags]: [test-keys] [ro.build.product]: [dream] [ro.build.description]: [kila-user 1.1 PLAT-RC33 126986 ota-rel-keys,release-keys] [ro.build.fingerprint]: [tmobile/kila/dream/trout:1.1/PLAT-RC33/126986:user/ota-rel-keys,release-keys] [ro.build.changelist]: [17615# end build properties] The emulator from the 1.5 SDK on the other hand, running the 1.5 image, also has root, is probably similar to the Android Dev Phone 1 (which you presumably want to allow) and has this: cmb@apollo:~$ adb -e shell getprop |grep build [ro.build.id]: [CUPCAKE] [ro.build.display.id]: [sdk-eng 1.5 CUPCAKE 148875 test-keys] [ro.build.version.incremental]: [148875] [ro.build.version.sdk]: [3] [ro.build.version.release]: [1.5] [ro.build.date]: [Thu May 14 18:09:10 PDT 2009] [ro.build.date.utc]: [1242349750] [ro.build.type]: [eng] [ro.build.user]: [android-build] [ro.build.host]: [undroid16.mtv.corp.google.com] [ro.build.tags]: [test-keys] [ro.build.product]: [generic] [ro.build.description]: [sdk-eng 1.5 CUPCAKE 148875 test-keys] [ro.build.fingerprint]: [generic/sdk/generic/:1.5/CUPCAKE/148875:eng/test-keys] As for the retail builds, I don't have one to hand, but various searches under site:xda-developers.com are informative. Here is a G1 in the Netherlands , you can see that ro.build.tags does not have test-keys , and I think that's probably the most reliable property to use.
