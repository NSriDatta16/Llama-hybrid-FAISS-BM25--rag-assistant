I thought about adding something new to this answer, so I don't feel as bad... Here is a Swift answer: import Cocoa let paragraphStyle = NSMutableParagraphStyle() paragraphStyle.lineSpacing = 40 let attrString = NSMutableAttributedString(string: "Swift Answer") attrString.addAttribute(.paragraphStyle, value:paragraphStyle, range:NSMakeRange(0, attrString.length)) var tableViewCell = NSTableCellView() tableViewCell.textField.attributedStringValue = attrString "Short answer: you can't. To change the spacing between lines of text, you will have to subclass UILabel and roll your own drawTextInRect, or create multiple labels." See: Set UILabel line spacing This is a really old answer, and other have already addded the new and better way to handle this.. Please see the up to date answers provided below.
