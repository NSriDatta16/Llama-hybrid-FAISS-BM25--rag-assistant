Yes, NULL does indeed take up storage space. Usually the field uses one bit to store the NULL status, so all rows in the table uses this extra bit regardless of if they are NULL or not. This is the only way to differentiate between NULL and other values (e.g., between NULL and 0). If this is of concern to you, make sure to mark fields as NOT NULL where you don't need the extra functionality.
