Thanks for the great answers! I think I've got it, at least partially. If we do the same experiments as above, only using another prior – not the uniform p-distribution, but the delta-distribution $\delta(p-3/8)$ – one can reproduce the frequentists' result: var gamesPerExperiment = 1000000; var gamesConsidered = 0; var bobWins = 0; for (var game = 0; game threshold) alice++ else bob++ } if (alice == 5 && bob == 3) { // consider only these cases gamesConsidered++ for (var move = 0; move threshold) alice++ else bob++ } if (bob > alice) bobWins++ } } console.log("Bob's odds = " + bobWins/gamesConsidered) This outputs almost surely Bob's odds = 0.0526... . Lesson learned: When there is no reason to believe that the uniform p-distribution is more probable than the delta-distribution, Bayesians cannot claim that their result is more correct than the frequentists'.
