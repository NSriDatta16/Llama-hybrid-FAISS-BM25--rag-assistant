How to deal with the first categorical column when do PCA analysis in r?

I'm trying to do a PCA analysis with a dataset like: food var1 var2 var3 var4 ... var31 var32 foodtype1 0.0012 0.8820 0.7926 0.2633 ... 0.3215 0.5233 foodtype2 0.0012 0.8820 0.7926 0.2633 ... 0.3215 0.5233 foodtype3 0.0012 0.8820 0.7926 0.2633 ... 0.3215 0.5233 I followed the site PCA analysis with package "FactoMineR" , the example inside also has categorical column. The last column was removed during PCA analysis, but used for grouping plots later, while the first column was kept. I noticed that the first column without column name . However, when I did PCA by my data, the error showed: Error in PCA(Comp_fa2, scale.unit = T, graph = T) : The following variables are not quantitative: X My question is, how should deal with my own data with the first non-numeric column when doing PCA analysis? Thank you very much.
