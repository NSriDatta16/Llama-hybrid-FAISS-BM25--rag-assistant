Use MinMaxScaler , label encoder, one hot encoder , keras prediction file for later prediction

I'm new to neural networks and data science field. I have a dataset with over 90,000 rows. which Include 9 text columns & 29 Number Columns. after encoding with label encoder and one hot encoder It has over 10,000 columns. Now I like to save those scalers, encoders and prediction files for later use. But I have no Idea how to save and use them later for single prediction. Any help is appreciate. Thank You
