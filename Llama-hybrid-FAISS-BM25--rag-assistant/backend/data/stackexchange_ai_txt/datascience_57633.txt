How to normalize a position in 3d game?

I'm pretty new to anything and everything related to this kind of stuff, I was wondering how would I normalize the coordinates of a entity in my game for a nerual network? Would it just be the same normalizng everything else? I don't assume it'd be the same just because how big these numbers are, you'd have to have a BUNCH of date (I think?) Edit: also I'd like to know if this would be the proper way of giving your neural network entitie's position in a 3d game? here's an example of the coordinates, 235.56, -2332.93, -8.57
