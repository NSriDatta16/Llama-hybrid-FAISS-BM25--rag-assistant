How to associate file type with MacOS X App without launching it first?

I would like to associate the last installed version of my Mac OS X application with a certain type of file. A little experimentation shows that the info.plist file seems to be read and interpreted by the operating system when launching the application, not when dragging the application bundle to the disk. Apple's documentation on run-time configuration does not say much on that topic. Is there any way, using a simple .dmg image as installation medium, to make sure the system associates that particular file type with my newly installed app without having to launch it first? I should clarify that I want this to be done automatically during the installation (I don't want my users to have to do it themselves).
