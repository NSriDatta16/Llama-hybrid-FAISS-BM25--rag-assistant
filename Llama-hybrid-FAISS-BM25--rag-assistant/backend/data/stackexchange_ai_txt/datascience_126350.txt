Unfortunately, time series needs some data preprocessing in order to be efficient. Furthermore, some NN are more noise-sensitive than others. Others are more adapted to medium-term prediction or short-term prediction. My best advice is to understand your model's limits & behavior with docs or articles on the Internet. You can also detect the cycles: it is not necessarily 90 days. You can find it doing some genetic algorithm, using the time cycle as a variable. Then, you can compare 2 or 3 different models (e.g., Prophet, Mamba, LSTM, etc.). Meta's Prophet is the easiest one. Finally, if your signal has noise, reducing it with a smoothing algorithm could improve results. There is no easy solution: Trying many settings and methods is the best guarantee to get great results.
