Random Forest vs. RainForest

I have studied Random Forest and RainForest papers, but they are a bit confusing! In summary, I understand following steps for these algorithms. Could you help me to find out if I am right or not? I appreciate your help. In Random forest first: define number of trees partition data by bootstrapping on each partition construct trees (in each node a sub sample of features is selected) label leaf nodes for classifying a new instance vote over all trees. In RainForest: Partition dataset Build AVC-set of a partition Build tree over the partition by computing a purity criterion (like gini-index) over AVC-sets
