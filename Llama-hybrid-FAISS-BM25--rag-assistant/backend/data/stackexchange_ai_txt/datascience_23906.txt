What is the easiest way to scale a data science project based on scikit stack?

This is an issue for all Data Scientists who have worked with this stack: python scikit-learn scipy-stats matplotlib etc. We are looking for ways to have a project already implemented in the aforementioned stack scale for very large datasets by doing the minimum amount of work Counter examples would be to rewrite everything in Tensorflow framework or use industry tools that are unrelated with Python.
