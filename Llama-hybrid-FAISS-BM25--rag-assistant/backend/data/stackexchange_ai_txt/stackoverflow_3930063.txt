iPhone4, UIWebView and HTML5

is there any list which HTML5 features the UIWebView supports and which not? I am interested mainly in: 1) localStorage/sessionStorage 2) offline manifest 3) web sockets 4) web workers In pre-iOS4 there was not an offline manifest support, which was necessary to program in objective-C, which - when done broke the localStorage support, since the UIWebView does not allow sharing localStorage content between pages accessed online and pages manually downloaded and stored in the file system, because the URL was different Thanks a lot BR STeN
