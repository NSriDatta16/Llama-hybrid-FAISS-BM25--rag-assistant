Unless I'm mistaken, the units of the Mean Squared Errors of your imputations are expressed in your variables units-squared, not in percentage. Therefore, I believe it is yours to interpret whether a Root Mean Square Error of 0.02, 0.007 or 0.017 is acceptable or not with regards to the units of your variables (as I'm not a statistician, I would be glad if someone would tell me if I understood this right). Regarding the rest of your question, I do not know how Stekhoven & Buehlmann actually coded missForest() but, according to Wikipedia , Normalized RMSE is usually computed by dividing the RMSE by the observations mean or range. Consequently, the global NRMSE returned by missForest() is probably an aggregation (perhaps the average) of the NMRSE computed for each individual variable.
