Are there examples of quantization aware neural networks

I'm looking for examples of Machine Learning / Neural Networks examples that work with quantized weights, activation functions,.... The simple approach of training with floating point parameters and then quantizing does not give results. I'm working with pytorch now but can use other packages if necessary.
