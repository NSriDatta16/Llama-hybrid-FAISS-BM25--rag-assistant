I attempted that, but it doesn't actually free it right away.. Seems it holds onto it for a time. What did work.. I MOVEFILE the file to a junk location. Then I copyfile the new file into where the old file was. then I reboot the system.. Now the system loads the new file (accomplishing my goal) and I'm free to delete the old file when ever I like. It isn't the most elegant way, but it's simple and it works.
