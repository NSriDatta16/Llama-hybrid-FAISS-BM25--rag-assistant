As you can see there are many reasons why to use/why not to use the database for image storage. Personally I prefer not to use the database for storage of files (images, documents etc), except when I'm ordered to store them. -Sometimes you're tired and screw up a query, something like "SELECT * FROM images", this will kill the server if there are too many images with huge size (2MB and more) in the database. -The security issue: you can still save the files in the disk and still be secure, how? Well save the files outside the web directory, whenever the file is requested read the file and give it to the user. -If by any chance you are using MySQL: if your database has got to big (say 2-3 GB), and you are using a shared hosting, well good luck making that backup or trying to restore that image database. It's just my point of view
