It is generally a bad idea to average ratios that are formed with different numbers of units Consider the case where you have a set of ratios $R_i = X_i/U_i$ (which can be expressed in percentage terms if you like) formed from counting $R_i$ "successes" out of $U_i$ units. Suppose we have $n$ data points like this and we define the following quantities: $$\dot{X}_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \dot{U}_n = \sum_{i=1}^n U_i \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad w_i = \frac{\dot{U}_n}{n U_i}.$$ If we want to know how prevalent successes are in the units we will generally want to form the average $\dot{R}_n = \dot{X}_n/\dot{U}_n$ , which is the ratio of the total number of successes over the total number of units. However, if we were to take the average of the ratios $R_1,...,R_n$ we would get: $$\begin{align} \text{Average of } R_1,...,R_n \equiv \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n R_i &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i}{U_i} \\[6pt] &= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\dot{U}_n}{n U_i} \cdot \frac{X_i}{\dot{U}_n} \\[6pt] &= \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot \frac{X_i}{\dot{U}_n} \\[6pt] &\neq \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i}{\dot{U}_n} \\[6pt] &= \frac{\dot{X}_n}{\dot{U}_n} = \dot{R}_n. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ As you can see, the average of $R_1,...,R_n$ is (generally) not equal to the ratio $\dot{R}_n$ of the total number of successes over the total number of units. Instead, the numerator of this quantity is a weighted average of the number of successes, where each observation is inversely proportional to the number of units in that observation. That is, the observations with fewer units are weighted upward and the observations with more units are weighted downwards.
