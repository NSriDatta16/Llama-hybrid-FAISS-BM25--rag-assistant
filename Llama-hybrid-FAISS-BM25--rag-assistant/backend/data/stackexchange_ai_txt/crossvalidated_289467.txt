What is a manifold?

In dimensionality reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis, LDA etc often the term manifold is used. What is a manifold in non-technical term? If a point $x$ belongs to a sphere whose dimension I want to reduce, and if there is a noise $y$ and $x$ and $y$ are uncorrelated, then the actual points $x$ would be far separated from each other due to the noise. Therefore, noise filtering would be required. So, dimension reduction would be performed on $z = x+y$. Therefore, over here does $x$ and $y$ belong to different manifolds? I am working on point cloud data that is often used in robot vision; the point clouds are noisy due to noise in acquisition and I need to reduce the noise before dimension reduction. Otherwise, I will get incorrect dimension reduction. So, what is the manifold here and is noise a part of the same manifold to which $x$ belongs?
