I have used your exact strategy and our applications are currently running in production (but rails 2.2.2). I've kept a close eye on it and our load has been relatively low (Less than 20 emails sent per day average, with peaks of around 150/day). So far we have noticed no problems, and this appears to have resolved several performance issues we were having when using Google's mailserver. If you need something in a hurry then give it a shot, it has been working for us.
