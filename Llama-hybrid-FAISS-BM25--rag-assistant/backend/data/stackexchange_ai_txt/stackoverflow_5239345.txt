Management data collector upload to MDW on remote server

I am trying to setup data collection and upload to an MDW on a remote server. During the setup wizard i can connect with the sa account but the upload job seems to insist on using windows authentication and the account doesn't have permission on the remote server. This article states that i need to "make sure that the SQL Server Agent account will have access to the MDW database if it has been configured on a remote server. To ensure this access, you can create a SQL Server Agent proxy account and add it to the dc_proxy database role for the msdb database." However do i need to do this on the server where the data is collected or on the server to which the data is uploaded? Also it seems i have to use a credential to setup the proxy. What credential do i need to use? Thanks very much for all advice and tips.
