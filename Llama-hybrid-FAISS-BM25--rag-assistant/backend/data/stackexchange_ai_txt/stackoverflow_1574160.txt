The answer to my issue was #4 & #5 from this link: http://rc.crm.dynamics.com/rc/regcont/en_us/op/articles/secure_comm.aspx#ID0EFD For deployments that will not be used by external clients, which connect over the Internet, follow these steps: Obtain a certificate from a CA. To use certificates you will have set up a public key infrastructure (PKI), which consists of one or more CAs that are linked in a hierarchy. These CAs and the PKI are required to manage certificate issuance, validation, renewal, and revocation in one or more organizations. You can use a third-party PKI with Microsoft Windows Server 2003, or you can establish your own PKI, based on Windows Server 2003 Certificate Services. Make sure that there are no users accessing Internet Information Services (IIS) where the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web application is installed. To do this, stop the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site: right-click the Web site, and then click Stop. Configure the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site to use SSL. To do this, perform the following steps on the server running IIS where the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web application is installed: 1. Start Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager 2. Right-click the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site, and then click Properties. 3. Click the Directory Security tab, click Server Certificate, and then follow the instructions in the Web Server Certificate Wizard. 4. If you want clients to only use SSL when they connect to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM application, on the Directory Security tab in the Secure communications area, click Edit. 5. On the Secure Communications dialog box, click the Require secure channel (SSL) check box. 6. Close Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager. Important: You can apply only a single certificate to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site. Therefore, you if you have configured Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server for both internal and Internet-facing (external) access, you cannot configure SSL for both internal and external connections to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site. You must manually modify the following values in the configuration database. Warning: Incorrectly modifying the configuration database (MSCRM_CONFIG) can cause unexpected behavior in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM system or cause the system to stop working. We recommend that you back up the Microsoft Dynamics CRM system before you complete these steps. For information about how to back up the Microsoft Dynamics CRM system, see the Operating and Maintaining Guide that is part of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 Implementation Guide document set. 1. On the computer running Microsoft SQL Server, start SQL Server Management Studio. 2. Expand Databases, expand MSCRM_CONFIG, expand Tables, right-click dbo.DeploymentProperties, and then click Open Table. 3. In the dbo.DeploymentProperties table under the ColumnName column, in the ADRootDomainScheme row, change the NVarCharColumn column value from http to https. Note that this value must be in lower-case letters. 4. In the dbo.DeploymentProperties table, under the ColumnName column, in the ADSdkRootDomain row, change the NVarCharColumn column value by using the name of the certificate configured for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site. The name of the certificate can be found, in Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager, on the Directory Security tab of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site properties page. 5. Click View Certificate. 6. On the Certificate dialog box, click Details. 7. Click the Friendly Name field to locate the certificate name. If the certificate name is the same as the computer name, you can use the format ServerName:SSLPortNumber. By default, the TCP port for SSL connections is 443. 8. In the dbo.DeploymentProperties table, under the ColumnName column, in the ADWebApplicationRootDomain row, change the NVarCharColumn column value by using the name of the certificate configured for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site. If the certificate name is the same as the computer name, you can use the format ServerName:SSLPortNumber. By default, the TCP port for SSL connections is 443. 9. Make sure your modifications are saved and then close SQL Server Management Studio. Modify the LocalSDKPort Windows registry subkey value. To do this, complete the following steps. Warning: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating system and Microsoft Dynamics CRM. We cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk. 1. Start Registry Editor, and locate the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSCRM subkey. 2. Right-click LocalSdkPort, click Modify, and then click OK. 3. In the Base area, click Decimal, and then type the TCP port. 4. Click OK. 5. Close Registry Editor. Restart IIS. To do this, at the command line, run the iisreset command. Start the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site. To do this, right-click the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site, and then click Start. Restart the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Asynchronous Processing Service. To do this, click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Services. In the list of services, right-click Microsoft Dynamics CRM Asynchronous Processing Service, and then click Restart. Verify that you can successfully connect to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site. To do this, you must use a URL that begins with https. For example, in Internet Explorer the URL will appear similar to the following address: https://ServerName/OrganizationName/loader.aspx If the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Web site is not configured to require SSL connections, verify that you can successfully connect to the site by using an http connection, for example, http://ServerName/OrganizationName/loader.aspx .
