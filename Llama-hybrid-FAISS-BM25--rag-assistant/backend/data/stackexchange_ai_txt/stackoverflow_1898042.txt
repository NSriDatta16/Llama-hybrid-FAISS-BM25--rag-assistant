I have used sitefinity (community ed) on a couple of sites. It isn't brilliant (webforms instead of MVC) but for clients who are not programmers it is quite a nice backend management system. Drag and drop template driving page creation is quite good. I havent touched DNN for a couple of years, it was quite the resource hog last time i looked at it.
