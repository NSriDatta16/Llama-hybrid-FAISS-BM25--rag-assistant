You've identified the two options for maintaining user-specific state in a web application: store it in cookies/session, or pass it around on URLs. I don't believe there's a third "silver bullet" waiting in the wings to solve your problem. The URL query-string option has the advantage that a particular view state can be bookmarked, sent as an emailed URL, &c. It also may keep your view code a bit simpler, but at the cost of some extra template code to ensure the proper query-string always gets passed along on links. In part your preferred solution may depend on the behavior you want. For instance, if a user bookmarks (or emails to a friend) the URL for a detail view of an item, do you want that URL to simply refer to the item itself, or to always carry along information about what list that item came out of? If the former, use session data. If the latter, use URLs with query strings. In either case, I'm confident that the code that you find "cluttering all your views" can be refactored to be elegant, DRY, and as invisible as you want it to be. Decorators and/or class-based views might help.
