The answer from @juod gets to the essential point: calculations in Cox regressions are based on instantaneous values of covariates "just prior to" each event. Prior history is taken into account in the following way: each individual still at risk at an event time survived up until then, so those individuals' covariate values (potentially time-varying) at all earlier event times have already been incorporated into the regression. As the answer in the Cross Validated page to which you linked states, however, you may construct the instantaneous values of the time-dependent covariates in any way that makes sense. That question was posed specifically about a cumulative covariate, integrated over time, so that its value for an indivdual at each event time depended (in that particular way) on all previous values for that individual. If some way of treating your covariate values like that makes sense for your application, then do so. Think carefully about how you wish to proceed. Is the simple fact that an individual has survived up to a particular event time, given the individual's prior covariate values, enough of a way to incorporate history? Or do you need to add up or average or otherwise assess prior values over some period of time to find the best instantaneous relation between the covariate and outcome in Cox regression? That decision must be based on your understanding of the underlying subject matter.
