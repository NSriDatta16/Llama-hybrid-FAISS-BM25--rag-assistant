Can you give me some example of metrics that I could use to measure the quality and productivity of my team members. A few examples of metrics for an Agile Team to measure PRODUCTIVITY: Story Points / Velocity Points: This is a relatively sizable unit which can be used to measure complexity of the work to be done. Sprint Burndown : This can be used to measure progress in hours during an iteration or Sprint Release Burndown : This can be used to measure progress in story points during a release. A few examples of metrics for an Agile Team to measure QUALITY: Hudson CI : You could use a continuous integration tool which constantly keeps an eye on the code base for you automatically. Some plugins for quality checks that can be used could be: Corbertura PMD CheckStyle
