PCA graph of individuals from principal rather than PCA

I am trying to run PCA in R, I have to do it with rotation and without rotation. Then, I need to plot the individuals graph. Rotation is available in psych::principal ( documentation ), but there are no functions that create an individual graph from psych::principal output. On the other hand, I can create an individual plot with FactoMineR::PCA ( documentation ), but FactoMineR::PCA cannot perform rotation. Can I have something that combines both, rotation option vs not and graph of individuals?
