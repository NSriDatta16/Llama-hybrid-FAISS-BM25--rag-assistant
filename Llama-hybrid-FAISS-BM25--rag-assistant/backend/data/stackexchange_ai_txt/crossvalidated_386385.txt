Can I use PCA after lasso variable selection?

I have a data regarding life satisfaction, of more than 2000 observations and 265 variables (most are categorical variables). I want to build a model, estimating the effects of society problems on the life satisfaction in the USA. So firstly, I use lasso2 to choose the variables which are most suitable for the regression, as well as reduce the dimension. It then results in 98 selected variables, however this is still a very large number of variables for a regression. Therefore, should I use PCA or Factor Analysis to combine these 98 variables into some factors, and then use these factors to regress? Is it possible anyway? I am afraid that, PCA/ FA and LASSO do the same thing, which is dimension reduction, and we can not use them at the same time. If so, which methods should I use after LASSO, in order to create factors, and use the factors to build a model? Thank you very much!
