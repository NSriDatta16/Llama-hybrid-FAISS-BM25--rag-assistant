The fact that your first graph merely oscillates between two values suggests to me that you are resetting the prior each time you perform an iteration. So what you are seeing in the graph is a sequence of posteriors, each of which only take one data point into account. That is not the correct method for iterative Bayesian updating. Remember that when you do iterative Bayesian updating, the prior for each new iteration is the posterior from the last iteration. So your algorithm should be: Iterative Bayesian updating: Start with the prior mass function: $$\pi_0(\theta) = \frac{1}{11} \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } \theta = \tfrac{0}{10}, \tfrac{1}{10}, ..., \tfrac{10}{10}.$$ For $i=1,...,n$ and $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ , update your beliefs via the iteration: $$\pi_i(\theta) = \frac{\theta^{x_i} (1-\theta)^{1-x_i} \pi_{i-1}(\theta)}{\sum_\theta \theta^{x_i} (1-\theta)^{1-x_i} \pi_{i-1} (\theta)}$$ Notice that in each iteration the prior $\pi_{i-1}$ is the posterior from the previous iteration. The mass function $\pi_n$ is the posterior after incorporating all the data.
