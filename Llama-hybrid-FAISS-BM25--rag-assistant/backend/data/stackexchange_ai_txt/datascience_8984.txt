Lots of nice conferences already mentioned by the existing answers. Here are some which I think deserve a place in the top conferences list: MLConf : As the name puts: THE MACHINE LEARNING CONFERENCE . Purpose of the conference: MLconf gathers communities to discuss the recent research and application of Algorithms, Tools, and Platforms to solve the hard problems that exist within organizing and analyzing massive and noisy data sets. Videos link Baylearn : The Bay Area Machine Learning symposium. Purpose: The BayLearn Symposium aims at gathering scientists in machine learning from the San Francisco Bay Area. While it promotes community building between local researchers from academic and industrial institutions, it also welcomes visitors. This one-day event combines invited talks and posters to foster exchange of ideas.
