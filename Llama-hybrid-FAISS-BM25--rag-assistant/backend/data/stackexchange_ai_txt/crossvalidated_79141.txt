Project feature vectors into 2D plane for visualization

I would like to project my observations which consist of more than 2 variables into a scatter plot. Some time ago I saw an R package that does this by reducing the dimensions (possibly using PCA and other algorithms) and plots similar observations close to each other. I have been googling to find how to accomplish that but havenÂ´t found anything.
