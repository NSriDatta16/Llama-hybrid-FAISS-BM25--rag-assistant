Can it be said, that in case of non-proportional hazards, Cox returns average hazard ratio over the entire period?

I have read two opposite statements about the hazard ratios obtained from the Cox procedure in presence of non-proportional hazards. One is that the HR for a certain covariate, that fails this assumption, is averaged over the entire period. So, if initially it's 0.8 and then it grows to 2, we can say it's 1.4 in average. Which hides the fact, that the hazards were opposite and swapped. The others say, that it cannot be simply averaged and instead other measures should be used, like the restricted mean survival time. Can you name any source resolving or giving more insights on that? Or simply explain, how to interpret Cox in case of crossing curves (resulting in swapped hazards) or varying hazards in general?
