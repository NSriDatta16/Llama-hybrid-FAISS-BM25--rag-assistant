Changing an outlier doesn't change the median; as long as you have at least three data points, making an extremum more extreme doesn't change the median, but it does change the mean by the amount the outlier changes divided by n. Adding an outlier, or moving a "normal" point to an extreme value, can only move the median to an adjacent central point. For instance, if you start with the data [1,2,3,4,5], and change the first observation to 100 to get [100,2,3,4,5], the median goes from 3 to 4. So not only is the a maximum amount a single outlier can affect the median (the mean, on the other hand, can be affected an unlimited amount), the effect is to move to an adjacently ranked point in the middle of the data, and the data points tend to be more closely packed close to the median. So, for instance, if you have nine points evenly spaced in Gaussian percentile, such as [-1.28, -0.84, -0.52, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.52, 0.84, 1.28]. The average separation between observations is 0.32, but changing one observation can change the median by at most 0.25. The median of a bimodal distribution, on the other hand, could be very sensitive to change of one observation, if there are no observations between the modes.
