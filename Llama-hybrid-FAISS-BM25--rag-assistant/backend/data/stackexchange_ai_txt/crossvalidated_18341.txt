Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning by Rasmussen and Williams (MIT Press) is a must. Gaussian processes are a one of the hot algorithms for machine learning now that Expectation Propagation and variational inference algorithms are available. The book is very well written, has a free MATLAB toolbox (good bit of kit), and the book can be downloaded for free.
