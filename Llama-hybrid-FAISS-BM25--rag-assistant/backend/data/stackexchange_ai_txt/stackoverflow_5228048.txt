Anytime you BEGIN TRANSACTION then @@TRANCOUNT is incremented. So because you did increment it once, then it will always be >0 You probably mean to check IF ( @@ERROR > 0 ) ROLLBACK TRAN Also, I would encourage you to use named transactions so you know you're rolling back the right transaction (if for no other reason than traceability)
