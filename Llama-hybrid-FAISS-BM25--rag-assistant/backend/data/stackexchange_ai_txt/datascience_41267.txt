How to include class features to linear SVM

I am planning to do a simple classification with a linear SVM. One feature I have is another classification of some sort done previously. Can I just use this class feature as a 1-hot encoded array? So, e.g. for 3 different classes, I'd have 3 binary features being 0 or 1? The problem I see is that this feature is not linear but binary. Will this pose a problem? And if yes, how can I somehow transform a binary feature into a linear one?
