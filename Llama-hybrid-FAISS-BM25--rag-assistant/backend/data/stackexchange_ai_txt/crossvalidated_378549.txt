For each node in a tree, the random forest algorithm does not pick the best dimension to split on but the best dimension among a (small) sample of them in order to add variance in the prediction. Here, the column you add must be important and by adding it you make it appear more often in the sample of dimensions among which the random forest chooses. You make it more important in your prediction. And by doing so, you do not decrease too much the variability of your trees. This behavior could explain your findings PS: Indeed, ideally, it should be moved to stats.stackexchange
