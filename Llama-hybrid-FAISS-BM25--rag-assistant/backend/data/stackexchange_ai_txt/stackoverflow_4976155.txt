I have all my projects organized using the hierarchy \Projects\Language\SubProject, somewhat similar to what you have. There are pitfalls to this arrangement however, as sometimes a project will involve multiple components written in different languages, and moving between language folders becomes a pain. Based on my experience a better idea is to organize by project and then by subcomponents. It seems that a hierarchical arrangement (based on file system folders) is not the best in this case. Ideally each project would have metadata such as language used, so you can filter by the metadata to drill down. I think it's important to realize that once you get past a certain number of projects you will have to rely on search functionality to quickly get to what you need.
