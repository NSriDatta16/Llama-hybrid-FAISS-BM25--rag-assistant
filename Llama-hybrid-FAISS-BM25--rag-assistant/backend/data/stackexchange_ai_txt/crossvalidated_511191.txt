summary statistics of groups at different scales/units

I have these made up observations: dat There are 2 groups (there many more groups in the the actual data). The column achieved is a measurement of what was achieved at a point in time and the column aim is what was the aim at this time. If achieved is greater than aim, that's better. As you can see the groups have different scales (and possibly units in the actual data). Can one somehow summarise the average performance (residuals) per group to have a scale independent measure of performance per group? I tried z scoring each column as follows but maybe I should just calculate the median/mean percentage difference? dat $z_scored_achieved achieved, dat $group, FUN=scale) dat$ z_scored_aim $aim, dat$ group, FUN=scale) dat %>% mutate( z_scored_residual = z_scored_achieved - z_scored_aim ) %>% group_by( group ) %>% summarise( z_scored_median = median(z_scored_residual) , .groups = 'drop' ) What do you think? Is the above a valid approach or are there better approaches? Maybe this is actually a great use case for the geometric mean? Thanks.
