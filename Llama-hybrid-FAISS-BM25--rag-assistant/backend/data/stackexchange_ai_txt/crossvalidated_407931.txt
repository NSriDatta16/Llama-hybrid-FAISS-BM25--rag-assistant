Let me first introduce a standard discrete convolution: And a dilated convolution may look like this: When l=1, the receptive field is 3*3; when l=2, the receptive field is going to be 5*5. We could get a larger receptive field at no cost. And this method is not gonna make the kernel bigger, which means we don't need to make more efforts to observe these larger receptive fields.
