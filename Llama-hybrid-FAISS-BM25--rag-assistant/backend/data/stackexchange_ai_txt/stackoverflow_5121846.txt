This is a really good question. I'm glad to see some R folks weighing in. I too think R is the right tool for the job, although it's my main hammer so everything looks a bit like a nail to me. There are a handful of R concepts needed to tackle this challenge. As I see it, you need the following (references in parens) : Import data into R. ( R Import Export Guide ) Get the Data into an appropriate time series structure. ( XTS Vignette PDF ) A little bit of plotting. ( Quick-R intro to graphics ) Here's example code using 2mm points. If you notice, I don't illustrate plotting all 2mm points. It's slow and not that informative. But this should give you some ideas on getting started. Feel free to come back with more specific questions if you do decide to jump down the R rabbit hole! require( xts ) require( lubridate ) ## set up some example data dataLength The relationship between DD1 and DD2 kinda jumps out boxplot( oneDay ) Boxplot is the piechart of statistical graphics. The plot you love to hate. Might as well link to this while we're here. ## look at the max value of each variable every minute par(mfrow=c(4,1)) ## partitions the graph window ep Even at one minute resolution I'm not sure this is informative. Should probably subset.
