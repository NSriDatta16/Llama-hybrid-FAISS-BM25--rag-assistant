How to obtain positive predictive values from multinomial regression?

For a 2x2 scenario, to determine misclassification we can obtain positive and negative predictive values from a logistic regression model where the outcome is the true value and the exposure is the measured value. I can demonstrate what this might look like in R: set.seed(123) true My question is how can I extend these equations to obtain the predictive values in a 5x5 scenario. More specifically, the probability of being truly in category X given that you are categorized in category X. I imagine the model could either be specified as a multinomial model, where all levels of the true and measured exposure are taken into account. Or we could model the measured values separately for all levels of the true exposure. Here is an example in R. Say we have two variables with 5 levels each, from which we can create a 5x5 table and find out the probability of being in each true level given that you are categorized as a measured level set.seed(1234) measured So basically I'm trying to obtain each of the cells in the tab.prop table from a regression model. I'm not sure it's possible, any direction would be welcome :)
