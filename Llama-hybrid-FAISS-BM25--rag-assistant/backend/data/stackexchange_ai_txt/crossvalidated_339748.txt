Was logistic regression based on Boltzmann distribution from statistical mechanics?

Ever since seeing the logistic distribution for the first time many years ago, I always thought of it as an application of the Boltzmann distribution . Whoever developed it may had seen the Boltzmann distribution and applied it to economics or whatever the first application it was. Is this true in historical context? Was it developed this way? Here's the logistic equation as a log-linear model : $$\Pr(Y_i=c) = \frac{e^{\boldsymbol\beta_c \cdot \mathbf{X}_i}}{\sum_h e^{\boldsymbol\beta_h \cdot \mathbf{X}_i}}$$ Here's the Boltzmann distribution : $$p_i={\frac{e^{- {\varepsilon}_i / k T}}{\sum_{j=1}^{M}{e^{- {\varepsilon}_j / k T}}}} $$
