Welcome to Data Science! You're question needs a little more detail... there are many many ways to make an array into a single number. You should say a little more about what you mean by meaningful . Here are a few examples, using your example array, which may seem outrageously simple, but do indeed form the basis to many of the techniques used in modern research: In [1]: import numpy as np In [2]: x = np.array([[129, 155, 191], [123, 150, 185], [120, 149, 183]], dtype=np.float32) In [3]: x Out[3]: array([[129., 155., 191.], [123., 150., 185.], [120., 149., 183.]], dtype=float32) Now here are a few (randomly selected) ways to create a single number from your array: In [4]: np.mean(x) # the mean / average Out[4]: 153.88889 In [5]: np.sum(x) # the sum Out[5]: 1385.0 In [6]: np.std(x) # the standard deviation Out[6]: 25.722641 In [7]: np.linalg.norm(x) # the Frobius norm - a distance measure Out[7]: 468.07156 In [8]: np.max(x) Out[8]: 191.0 These might seem stupidly simple, but if we were to treat your array as a single block from a larger image-array, then these might represent pooling-layers that are used to down-sample arrays as they are passed through a neural network. Just have a look at the available pooling layers within the Keras library . Which method you might want to use will heavily depend on your use case, your dataset and your model.
