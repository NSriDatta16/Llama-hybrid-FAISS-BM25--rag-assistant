What I'd do is modify the link that is generated by the initial gallery of thumbnails. So, instead of just the single post's url, it would include another variable in it. So, for example: http://mydomain.com/category/single-post/?lightbox=true Then, in the single.php template file, you can check the url string to see if it contains that particular 'addition'. If it doesn't, then you should include the normal header/footer/sidebar shenanigans that a normal single post would use.
