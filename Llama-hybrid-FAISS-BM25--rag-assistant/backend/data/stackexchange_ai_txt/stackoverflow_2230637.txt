I'd argue that in many cases the best tools "money can buy" are actually the open source ones... but that aside, I have a few votes for good commercial tools: Java Profilers: JProfiler YourKit I've had licenses for both, and very slighly prefer JProfiler, but they're both very good, IMO. Code reviews: Code Collaborator Excellent for organizing and executing code reviews.
