Who controls the data model for the output of the sensors? If it's not you, do they know what they are doing? If they create new and inconsistent models every time they invent a new sensor, you are pretty much up the creek. If you can influence or control the evolution of the schemas for CSV files, try to come up with a top level data architecture. In the bad old days before there were databases, files made up of records often had, as the first field of each record, a "record type". CSV files could be organized the same way. The first field of every record could indicate what type of record you are dealing with. When you get an unknown type, put it in the "bad input file" until you can maintain your software. If that isn't dynamic enough for you, you may have to consider artificial intelligence, or looking for a different job.
