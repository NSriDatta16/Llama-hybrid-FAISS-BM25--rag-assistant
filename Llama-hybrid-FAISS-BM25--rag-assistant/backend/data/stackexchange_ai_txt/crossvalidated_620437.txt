Parameter estimation constrained by RMSE and variance

I have a time series y(t) of observations that can be approximated by the following linear model with unknown parameters: $$y(t) = \alpha*X_{1}(t) + \beta*X_{2}(t) +\gamma*X_{3}(t)$$ X1, X2 and X3 are in fact outputs of an ensemble model, thus average (and consequently the RMSE) and variance can be estimated. I want to optimize the parameters while keeping the ratio RMSE/Var approx. 1. Any tips on how I can approach the problem?
