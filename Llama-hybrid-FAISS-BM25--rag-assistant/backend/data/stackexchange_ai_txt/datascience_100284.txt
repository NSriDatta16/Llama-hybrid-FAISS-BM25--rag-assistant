How to choose the right predictors for a classfication model?

I am working on a classification problem. I have two models: Logistic regression model Random Forest model For the first model, if I choose the only predictors with p-values On the other hand, Random Forest does not give p-values, only importance metrics, which are similar the IV predictors. So, which methods should use to select the right predictors so I can compare the two models? Thanks for reading this and I hope you can help me. I will be glad to give more details.
