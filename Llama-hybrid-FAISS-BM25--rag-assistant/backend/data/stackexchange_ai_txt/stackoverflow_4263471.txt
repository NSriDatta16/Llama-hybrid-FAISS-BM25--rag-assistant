Linq Query ToList not putting data into a list, but rather a one element list

I have the following query (which is nested in a larger query): PaymentType = (from paymenttype in offer.Elements(myns + "paymentTypes") select paymenttype.Value).ToList() myns is an XNamespace type the XML tree looks like One String Another string PaymentType is defined as: List PaymentType = new List (); When my code executes, what I am seeing is a single item created: PaymentType[0] = "OneStringAnotherString" and not PaymentType[0] = "OneString" PaymentType[1] = "AnotherString" I can't sort out what I am doing wrong. Any ideas?
