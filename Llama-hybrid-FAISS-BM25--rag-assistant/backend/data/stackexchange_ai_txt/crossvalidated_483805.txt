If you want to do this to avoid overfitting, than standard, and less computationally demanding, approach would be to use early stopping , i.e. periodically check test error and stop training when it does not decrease anymore. All the major deep learning libraries have functionalities for enabling early stopping during training, but it is trivial to implement it from the scratch as well.
