Multiple paired T-tests after two-way repeated measure ANOVA?

I conducted an experiment to investigate the effects of musical complexity on visual attention and am now analyzing my data. I ran a two-way repeated measure ANOVA, with my two factors being Musical condition (control, simple, complex), and the second factor being flanker type (neutral, congruent, incongruent). Now the results indicate a significant difference for both factors but also their interaction (my DV is reaction time). Pairwise comparisons tell me which musical conditions are significantly different from each other, and the same goes for flanker type. But for the interaction between them, Musical Condition*Flanker Type (such that I want to know whether there were significant difference between Simple Music+neutral flankers vs. Complex Music+neutral flankers for example), am I correct in saying that I have to run a paired t-tests? If I want to compare each condition combination to each other, I would have to run 9 paired t-tests, correct? If I do that, would I have to divide my significance level of 0.05/9 to account for family wise error?
