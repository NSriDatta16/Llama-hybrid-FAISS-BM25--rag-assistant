Have a look at the Matthews Correlation Coefficient $$MCC = \frac{TP \cdot TN - FP \cdot FN}{\sqrt{ (TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN) }}$$ I have seen it pretty often as performance metrix in classification of SNPs dataset. Have a look at this link as well, they discuss the difference between AUC and MCC Otherwise you can just compute an average accuracy (average error rate), I have seen people using it in multiclass problems as well. $$AAcc = \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \frac{TP}{TP + FN} + \frac{TN}{TN + FP} \bigg) $$ Usually it is used in authentication systems under the form of Half Total Error Rate. E.g. here they provided a statistical test for that.
