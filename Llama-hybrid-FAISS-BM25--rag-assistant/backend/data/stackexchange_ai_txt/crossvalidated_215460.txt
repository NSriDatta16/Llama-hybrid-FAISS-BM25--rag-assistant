Options for PCA for ordinal data (in addition to CATPCA)?

When developing an instrument involving ordinal data (likert scale with 5-6 response levels), how does one reduce the initial item pool before completing the exploratory factor analysis? I have seen that categorical PCA (in SPSS) has been recommended here but what are additional options that are available outside of SPSS?
