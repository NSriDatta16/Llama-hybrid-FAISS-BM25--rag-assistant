To answer your question about how to rank the reviews, here is my thought: I don't share your unhappiness with using the mean. While your arguments may have some merit in principle, in practice I would expect that using the mean (average) rating of all reviews for an app is reasonable and pragmatic. To address the problem of some apps having very few ratings, you might use Bayesian rating, as explained in the following question: Sorting answers, given overvotes and undervotes . In other words, the corrected rating for an app is a weighted average of (a) the average rating of its reviews, and (b) the average rating taken over all apps. The weights are chosen based upon the number of reviews for this app, so the more reviews it has, the more heavily we weight factor (a). I would expect that the combination of these two mechanisms would lead to a simple way of ranking apps, that might work well in practice.
