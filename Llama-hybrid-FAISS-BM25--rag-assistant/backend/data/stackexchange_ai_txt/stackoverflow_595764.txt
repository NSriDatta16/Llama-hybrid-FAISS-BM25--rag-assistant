What is an elegant way to aggregate properties from subclasses in C#?

I have a situation where I am mapping classes that have an inheritance hierarchy. I have a list of items that each class knows that it needs. For example: public class PersonMapper { private string[] attributes = new[] {"firstName", "lastName"}; } public class UserMapper : PersonMapper { private string[] attributes = new[] {"username"}; } public class EmployeeMapper : PersonMapper { private string[] attributes = new[] {"employeeId"}; } I would like to make a method call that returns the aggregate of all of the super classes like this: EmployeeMapper mapper = new EmployeeMapper(); string[] attributes = mapper.GetAttributes(); Assert.That(attributes, Has.Member("firstname")); I can think of some solutions, but they seem overly complicated. I feel like there is an elegant solution to this that I am missing. Can anyone help? Thanks in advance!
