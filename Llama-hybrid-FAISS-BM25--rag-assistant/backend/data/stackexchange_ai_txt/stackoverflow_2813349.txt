Looking for libraries which implement sequential minimal optimization in C++

I want to use SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) in order to train an SVM (Support Vector Machine). Can anyone suggest existing C++ libraries which implement SMO? I plan to use this to train an SVM to find an object in a picture (probably a human).
