Why can't any browser understand this link? (exept firefox)

Hy people. I'm working on my webapp for the iphone. On some point you have the option to get a particular document from our appserver. It works on firefox, but safari just shows an empty download window. IE also can't get the file. Below is the example link. Is there something wrong with a link of this kind that Safari can't see? http://192.168.200.32:9999/USER_STORAGE?user=bt&token=bEVfjg%2FGHoHHU2CxmAWyiTXFUgN9kN2o8pEKgCFV5Fw%3D&nonce=9jJgj4qGXB4U7m%2FJXjjsmbfreH2J2nT8D789jHY6zro%3D&parent_session=cjDEN3PvltsAqjiagynS8mN6HKeAgqWv82WJqxWiXD8%3D&method=download&filename=Testdokument2
