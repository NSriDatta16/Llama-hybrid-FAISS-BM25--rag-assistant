You forgot at least one advantage of Rails -- enhanced testability via RSpec/Cucumber. Really, the main (additional) advantage is the attention to Ruby/Rails from the agile testing community. Using natural language testing should significantly enhance the ability to reason from your tests and promote understandability. In some respects this would offset the "magic" that you abhor by documenting it via easily readable tests. Beyond that, I would suggest that a new project that you are spending your friends' and family's money on is probably not the ideal situation in which to learn a new language/framework. Why add the additional risk to an already risky venture?
