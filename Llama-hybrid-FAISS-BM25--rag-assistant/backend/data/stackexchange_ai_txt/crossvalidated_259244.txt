Pattern Recognition Time Series via FFT

I came across this interesting article where the author used FFT to discover some patterns in a time series. I am new to this kind of analysis and have maybe some basic questions about it. How do you compute the Frequency when getting the FFT? I used the fft function in MATLAB with some data I have and then plot the absolute value and plot it. But the X-axis is time. I want to know how to transform that to a Frequency axis. Is it just 1/day ? I also have a 1-day granularity. In other words, how does he go from the 2nd to 3rd plot in the article or vice versa? Also, how would you compare lots of time series using this technique once at a time?
