If you're using NServiceBus.Host (and you most likely are), the NServiceBus profiles actually override the "Configure.With()" stuff. For example, when you fire up the host it is automatically configured to run with the NServiceBus.Lite profile. This means that it will be using an in-memory subscription storage instead of your database subscription storage-- even if you specify DBSubscriptionStorage() . The trick is to run the host using the NServiceBus.Production command-line parameter. Furthermore, there's one your IConfigureThisEndpoint implementation must also implement "AsA_Publisher". In other words, if you want NServiceBus to talk to your database subscription storage, it must running the NServiceBus.Production profile (or your own custom one) as well as be configured AsA_Publisher.
