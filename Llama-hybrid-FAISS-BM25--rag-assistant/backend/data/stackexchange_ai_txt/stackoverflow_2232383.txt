Are you saying you need to store the password for re-use in the silverlight app? If you are concerned about the password appearing in memory un-encrypted then Silverlight then I think you're in trouble. The .NET framework does have a SecureString class for exact purpose you outline. Unfortunately the Silverlight version of the framework does not have this class. Hence even if you were to keep the logical storage of the password encrypted at some point your code would need to decrypt it before using it. At the point there is memory allocated containing the string in unencrypted form. I don't know much about Forms authentication but if you can map the User principle to a domain user (which you seem to indicate you need) then you will want to use impersonation when running your code on the server. Alternatively stop using Forms authentication and use Windows integrated authentication where you definitely can use impersonation server-side.
