Azure Monitor lets you monitor your Azure-hosted applications in real-time. It includes a library for capturing runtime process information to cloud table storage; and also a desktop application for viewing the captured information in real-time: http://azuremonitor.codeplex.com/ Julien Brunet 'S "cloud4net" opensource project ( http://cloud4net.codeplex.com ) may interest you: it provides: azure api client call tracking (bytes sent/received, time spent per storage request) (*). It also calculates the bill for these calls (**) fetch azure diagnostic logs into a mssql database, for easier querying. These logs include the standard IIS W3C info (bytes sent/received and time taken), hence you can also built some measurements on top of that. (*) you don't need to rewrite your azure storage calls using the cloud4net abstraction api - the call tracking works at the socket level. (**) based on azure US pricing info at this stage. still in progress. If you intent to profile CPU usage that's something you could extract from azure performance diagnostics (perf counter data can be fetched to azure logs) -Julien Brunet From: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazure/thread/78391eb1-357d-4431-8a4b-7f2ba80db205/ Using the VS profiler to check for bottlenecks: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337887.aspx Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio 1.1 (February 2010): http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5664019e-6860-4c33-9843-4eb40b297ab6&displaylang=en
