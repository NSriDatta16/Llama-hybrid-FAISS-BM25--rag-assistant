Keep your business logic out of the DB. Or at a minimum, keep it very lean. Let the DB do what it's intended to do. Let code do what code is intended to do. Period. If you're a one man show (basically, arrogant & egotistical, not listening to the wisdom of others just because you're in control), do as you wish. I don't believe you're that way since you're asking to begin with. But I've met a few when it comes to this subject and felt the need to specify. If you work with DBA's but do your own DB work, keep clearly defined partitions between your business objects, the gateway between them and the DB, and the DB itself. If you work with DBA's and aren't allowed to do your DB work (either by policy or because they're premadonnas), you're very close to being a fool placing your reliance on them to get anything done by putting code-dependant business logic in your DB entities (sprocs, functions, etc.). If you're a DBA, make developers keep their DB entities clean & lean.
