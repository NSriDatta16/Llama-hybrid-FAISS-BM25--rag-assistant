It's better to create a function so you can reuse it elsewhere in your app, then if you decide to change the formatting or something later on you can do it easily in one place. I'm sure there's something more elegant out there, but for the sake of simplicity here's one I just whipped up: function pretty_size($bytes, $dec_places = 1) { $total = $bytes / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024; $unit = 'TB'; if( $total You can test it out using this: $numbers = array( 89743589734434, 39243243223, 3456544, 12342443, 324324, 4233, 2332, 32 ); foreach( $numbers as $n ) { $size = pretty_size($n); echo $size[0] . ' ' . $size[1] . ' '; } The above code will produce this: 81.6 TB 36.5 GB 3.3 MB 11.8 MB 316.7 KB 4.1 KB 2.3 KB 32.0 bytes Of course, if you really want to limit the display to just megabytes, you can alter the function accordingly. Easy enough :)
