We are using AmatersUML (but other tool/libraries from the same Takezoe author too: Mirage , AmatersERD , and ClickIDE Eclipse plug-in for Apache Click ) It can automatically create a sequence diagram by providing it a Stack Trace - you just need to copy and paste one. It also has a API that allows you to generate Sequence Diagrams (e.g. you can combine this API with a logging framework, or if you need sequence diagrams for unknown code, than you need to use the Java profiling API with it to instrumentate and output those names that are executed).
