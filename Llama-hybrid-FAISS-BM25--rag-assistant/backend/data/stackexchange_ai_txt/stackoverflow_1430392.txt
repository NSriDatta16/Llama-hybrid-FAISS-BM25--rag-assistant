First of all it's confusing which direction you're trying to translate. The tags say C# to VB, but the text says VB to C#. I'm assuming the latter. With that in mind, this: If Not IsPostBack Then and this: if (Page.IsPostBack != false) mean the exact opposite. Your C# should look like this: if (!IsPostBack) You also need to pay closure attention to the word "New" in the vb code. A full adaption looks like this: if (!IsPostBack) { DropDownList1.DataSource = System.Enum.GetValues(typeof (System.Drawing.KnownColor)); DropDownList1.DataBind(); } Finally, one more correction in your terminology: compile time errors are not exceptions. Excpetions are a run time construct.
