Statistics eduction in the US is in flux, in no small part because we now expect even grade school students (ages 5-12) to become proficient not only with fundamental concepts of statistical thinking, but also with techniques of data summary and presentation that many of their teachers do not even know! For an authoritative overview of efforts being made at both the K-12 and college levels , see the GAISE reports on the ASA Website. At a high level, these documents expect that all students graduating from U.S. high schools (age 18) will: formulate questions that can be addressed with data and collect, organize, and display relevant data to answer them; select and use appropriate statistical methods to analyze data; develop and evaluate inferences and predictions that are based on data; and understand and apply basic concepts of probability. Notably, in my opinion, is an insistence that by virtue of "variability in data," there is an important "difference between statistics and mathematics." The aim is to "develop statistical thinking" in students as opposed to teaching techniques or algorithms alone. For a college level approach, a good resource is CAUSEweb (Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education).
