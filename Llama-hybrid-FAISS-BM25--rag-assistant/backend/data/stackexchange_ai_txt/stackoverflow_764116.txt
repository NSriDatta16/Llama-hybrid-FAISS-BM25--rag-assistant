How do I get the Gallio MSBuild task to find my specific Gallio executables

I am trying to get Gallio to be called from MSBuild in a TeamCity build configuration. The Agent/Server for TeamCity does not have Gallio installed but I do have a distribution of Gallio in my source tree. I am using MSBuild to do the actual build of the project. How can I tell the Gallio task to use the Gallio executables that are in the source tree?
