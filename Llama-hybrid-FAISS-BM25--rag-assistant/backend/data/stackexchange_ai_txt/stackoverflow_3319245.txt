One factor I've not seen mentioned is what the routine is going to do with the passed-in value. Unless the routine is expanded inline, manipulating data which are passed by reference will require more code than manipulating data which are passed by value. If the fields of the passed-in structure will on average be accessed less than once each, this extra overhead will be small compared with the overhead of copying the structure. If they will on average be accessed many times each, it would likely be better to have them on the stack. If the interface is already set as pass-by-reference for a structure which is heavily accessed, it may make sense for the called routine to copy all parts that are of interest. On the other hand, if the called routine is going to copy much or all of a structure anyway, it may as well be passed by value.
