The only meaningful way to supply a default argument to a non-const reference is to declare a standalone object with static storage duration and use it as a default argument int dummy = 0; ... virtual int ExecNew(/* whatever */, int& iNewArgument = dummy) = 0; Whether it will work for you or not is for you to decide. Inside the function, if you'll need to detect whether the default argument was used, you may use address comparison if (&iNewArgument == &dummy) /* Default argument was used */
