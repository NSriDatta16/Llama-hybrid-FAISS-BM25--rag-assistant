Is there a NotIn("A","B") function in VBA?

I'm writing a function that requires input and my data validation looks very awkward. If InputFld isn't "A","B", or "C", then it's an error: If InputFld <>"A" and InputFld<>"B" and InputFld<>"C" then goto ErrorHandler This just looks ugly to me. Is there a more elegant solution? I'd like to just write something like: If InputFld not in ("A","B","C") then goto ErrorHandler See? Much easier to read and maintain this way. But I don't know how to do it.
