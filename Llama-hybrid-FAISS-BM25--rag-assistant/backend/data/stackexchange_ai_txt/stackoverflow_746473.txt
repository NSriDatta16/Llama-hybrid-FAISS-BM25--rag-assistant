I don't think there is an existing widget which will fit your need like a tree control would for a tree strcuture. that said I definitely recommand one of the yWorks products. Get a feel for what it can do, by trying out yEd, then check the documentation which seems very good. they also propose an ajax and flex fronted for their library, which will give you a web compatible representation, including google maps like drag and dropping see graph viewer demo: http://live.yworks.com/yfiles-ajax/Examples/Graph_Viewer.html ) I don't work for them, I am not even a paying customer, but I was very impressed by yEd.
