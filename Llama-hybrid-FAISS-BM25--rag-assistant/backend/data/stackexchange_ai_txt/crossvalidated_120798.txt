Examining the Win Probability of a Particular Play-style in a Set of Tournaments

Something I've been playing around with in my head, which I'd like some advice on. Assume you have a game with four different "play-styles" - this can be a particular strategy, different team compositions, etc. There is a series of tournaments with a variable number of players (and no fixed set of players) that you have results from, and you'd like to figure out the probability of a win, or at least a decent placing, for each play style to see if they are well balanced. So for an example data set: Style Place Tournament A 1 1 B 2 1 A 3 1 C 4 1 B 5 1 D 6 1 A 7 1 C 8 1 B 1 2 D 2 2 C 3 2 A 4 2 D 1 3 C 2 3 B 3 3 A 4 3 D 5 3 C 6 3 B 7 3 I've been considering using a logistic regression model with a new 0/1 variable for a "Top 5" placing - or it could equally be for the winner, and then using a model where the tournament is a random effect and the style is a fixed effect. But I am, admittedly, not terribly familiar with this type of problem, so I'd be interested to hear if people have other ideas or approaches that might work better.
