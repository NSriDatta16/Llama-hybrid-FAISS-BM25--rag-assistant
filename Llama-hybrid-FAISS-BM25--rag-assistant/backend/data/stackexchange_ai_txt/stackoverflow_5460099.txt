How to build a new NUnit constraint

I have an extension method that asserts a given value is one of the values in the list. public static void IsEither (this T value, params T[] allowedValues) { EqualConstraint isInAllowed = null; foreach (var allowed in allowedValues) isInAllowed = isInAllowed == null ? Is.EqualTo(allowed) : isInAllowed.Or.EqualTo(allowed); Assert.That(value, isInAllowed); } I wonder is there any other better/elegant way of doing this, particularly using NUnit's ConstraintBuilder, ConstraintExpression, ConstraintOperator etc
