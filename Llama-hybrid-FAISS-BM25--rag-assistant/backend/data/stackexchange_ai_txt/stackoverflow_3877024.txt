NHibernate: generic way of getting number of lines returned by arbitrary criteria query

I know about CriteriaTransformer.TransformToRowCount but according to link and my experience it doesn't work with aggregate functions (and they used quite often). Since I'm writing kinda paging framework for my app it would be very tedious to write "count" query for every data query. Any ideas how this can be optimized?
