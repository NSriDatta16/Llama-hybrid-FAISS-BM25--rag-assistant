Bad idea. NSArray is actually a class cluster (which is our word for [essentially] an abstract factory). This means that when you alloc / init an NSArray , you don't actually get an NSArray back. You get (usually) an NSCFArray , which is a private subclass. NSMutableArray is the same deal (it's abstract). When you alloc / init an NSMutableArray , you get an NSCFArray back that has a little internal mutable bit flipped. The upshot of this is that subclass a class cluster is generally discouraged, because it's a bit more complex than just creating a normal subclass. What I would recommend is to instead check out the CHDataStructures framework , which has a whole bunch of data structures that do what you're looking for already.
