Hoverable tooltips with AJAX-pulled content on Prototype/Scriptaculous (to act like Twitter's)`

Twitter recently added hoverable multi-media "tooltips" -- when you hover over a username or avatar on your feed, it pops up (in-place) more details on the user (tweets sent/received, location, last tweet). It also includes a "Follow" button. There's a 'more-info' link which will load some more details on-demand. I'd like to emulate how they're doing this-- which I think is a very elegant solution. There's a single empty/hidden div on the page, and on hover, that div is relocated to the appropriate place, display is set to "block" and populated with information (on-demand). If I'm on the prototype/scriptaculous framework, is there a straightforward way of doing this same implementation? I don't have the ability to use other frameworks. Thank you in advance! Screenshot:
