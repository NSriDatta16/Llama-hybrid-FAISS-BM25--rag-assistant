If you really have control on the client, then you may want to install some remote daemon service on the client side, like SSH. PS. Invoke it through your "server-code", however. Updated: Don't be discouraged. You can absolutely do that in safe manner. First you need a daemon service on the client that will handle the task of invoking your application. Personally, I'd rather build simple rpc-server as windows-service with C++ or Delphi; but many other kinds of server could also do the job (SSH, Apache, Telnet) Then make a web pages that allow the user to "register" their services with proper authentication to invoke that service (password, security key) When you want to invoke your application from web-page on the client that's already registered, make ajax call (xmlhttprequest) to your server. The server should validate the requesting IP address with registered information. Then make a remote command invokation to the client with the registered information. There can be some networking situation that this scheme might not work. However, if you really have control on the execution environment then there always be some workarounds.
