That's pretty normal. CFA is a much more stringent criterion than EFA. EFA attempts to describe your data, but CFA tests if the model is correct. One reason for non-convergence is low average correlations (but then I'd expect RMSEA to be better). The chi-square test is essentially a test that your residuals are equal to zero, and RMSEA, TLI and CFI are transformations of the test. Fit is always going to be better in a two factor solution than a one factor solution (they're nested). Some more questions: What was your sample size? What's the average correlation? What's chi-square and df, what's the chi-square of the null model? Should you add correlated errors? Perhaps, but when you do that you are introducing additional factors. With a fit like this you might need to add a lot, and then you end up with a mess - it's best if they are justified in some way. For example, your second and third items are about intrusive thoughts - that could be a justification.
