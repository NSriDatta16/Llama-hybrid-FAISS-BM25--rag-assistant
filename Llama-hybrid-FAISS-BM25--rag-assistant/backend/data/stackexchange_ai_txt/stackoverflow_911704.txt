Please see: http://bash-hackers.org/wiki/doku.php/commands/classictest#and_and_or and http://bash-hackers.org/wiki/doku.php/syntax/ccmd/conditional_expression Since you're just checking exit/return values with "if", you need to provide something, e.g. a command, that provides meaningful ones based on your tests. [ is such a command, another possibility is the [[ keyword. The actual correct examples already were mentioned by scragar above, I don't want to just repeat them :)
