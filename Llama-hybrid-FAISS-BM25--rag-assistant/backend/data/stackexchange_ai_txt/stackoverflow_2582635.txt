Flex 4 how to layout spark controls in an html table type way

I have a group of controls and I want to organize them in a table like fashion. I want 1 row and 6 columns. Col 1,3,4,5,6 should all auto size to the contents and col 2 should take up the remaining available space. When the size of the group changes, only col2 width should change. I also want to be able to set the alignment of each cell. How can I do this in flex 4? I found a reference to mx:constraintColumns but this seems to be used with the canvas and in flex 4 adobe suggests not using canvases. Is there something similar in flex 4? I'm looking for something along the lines of Grid/Grid.ColumnDefinitions in silverlight.
