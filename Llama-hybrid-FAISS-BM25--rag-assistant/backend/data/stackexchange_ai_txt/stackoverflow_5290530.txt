C# How do I do encryption?

I'm not asking for a tutorial with code, I'm trying to do the research, but I want to make sure I'm asking the right questions. What's the best form of encryption I can use out of the box with .NET? Public/Private key, where do I store these things securely? What tools should I have in order to do this properly? I started off with an AESCryptoServiceProvider, encrypted a string I passed in, I was happy. Tested that if I called it twice it would come out with the same value. Then realized I hadn't provided any form of key, so a second run of the app yielded different results. So I began reading up, seeing RSA Public/Private keys etc. etc. And just want make sure I'm going down the right path with the reading I'm doing. There's tons of examples out there, few mention where you put these keys or where you even get them from.
