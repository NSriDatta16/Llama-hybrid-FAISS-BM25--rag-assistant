I don't completely understand your question, but I'll take a stab at some parts. Can PCA scores be used as response variables against a categorical independent variable (treatment in your case)? Absolutely, that's very common. Can PCA scores be used as the response variable in different types of linear models? Yes, that's very common too. It's usually called principal components regression. I don't understand what you mean by "reducing the number of observations". Nothing else you discuss seems to deal with that. I would add that for further investigation, it sounds like you are dealing with the area of chemometrics (even if you are coming from a biology point of view). There is a package called chemometrics that can do some of what you seem to be considering.
