If you have set up a in your phpunit.xml configuration file you should see all the not covered files. It might an issue with the pathes, try absolute ones to see that it creates 0% coverage for some files and then make the relative pathses work. For combining the coverage there is not much you can to with phpunit that i know of. You could combine the coverage results (PHPUnit_Coverage package) by hand and then figure out how to render them but you'd need to do that by hand. At least i don't know of any project/tool/way that does that for you. The easiest way would be to run all your 3 testsuites in one phpunit run and have it generate the code coverage for the parts you are about.
