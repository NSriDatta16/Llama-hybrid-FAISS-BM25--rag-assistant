Average of the outside of a truncated normal distribution

I have a sample that is normally distributed ~ $N(\mu,\sigma)$ and truncated between $a,b$ such that $a . I saw a Wikipedia article that the average of the truncated part is $\mu + \frac{\phi(\alpha)-\phi(\beta)}{Z} \sigma$ where $\alpha = \frac{a-\mu}{\sigma}$ , $\beta = \frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}$ , and $Z = \Phi(\beta)-\Phi(\alpha)$ . Is there a formula that calculates the average of datapoints located outside of the truncated part (i.e., the average of datapoints that are located in the tail on the left and the tail on the right) as well?
