Start with this var bounds:Rectangle = new Rectangle( 0,0,this.width,this.height) this.dragBar.startDrag( false,bounds ); and remove all your overridesthat you added; I have a feeling your bounds are not correct and it is "jumping" away because the bounds are locking it there. You can not drag outside of the bounds. Another thing you can try is to drag it around after it "jumped" away. This will definitely tell you it is a bounds issue.
