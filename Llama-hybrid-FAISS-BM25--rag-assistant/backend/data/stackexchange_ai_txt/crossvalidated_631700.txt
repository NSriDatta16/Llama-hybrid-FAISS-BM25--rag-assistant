Help with Classification model for S&P500

I have started a project in order to develop my coding skills, where I am predicting next month's S&P500 return direction based on some macroeconomic and financial variables. These datasets have monthly data. I have downloaded the data, cleaned and applied some transformations: -For financial variables I have taken the pct change and for macro variables I have taken the diff or pct change. I added a screenshot of the distributions from my dataset. I split my returns into 2 categories which are the log diff from S&P 500 returns. Then I classified negative returns as 0 and positive returns as 1. I also create a variable, weight that it the absolute value of the return, which I would use as input for xgboost. It is my understanding the this weight variable will penalise my algorithm more for wrongly predicting these "large" movements. Is there a common approach in how to deal with these type of data transformation? Like, does it need to be standardised?
