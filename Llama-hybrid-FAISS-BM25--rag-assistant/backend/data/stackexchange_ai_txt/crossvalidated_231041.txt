The most obvious option is a multilevel logistic regression with $$\text{logit}(\pi_i) = u_i + \beta \times 1\{ i \text{ is warlock} \}$$ that was already mentioned as an option, but I thought I'd spell out the model in something other than R code. In this you can e.g. assume that $u_1 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ or that $\text{inverse-logit}(u_i) \sim \text{Beta}(a,b)$ with the latter option being attractive, because you can write the likelihood also in closed form as a beta-binomial model (see Kuss, O. "Statistical methods for meta‐analyses including information from studies without any events—add nothing to nothing and succeed nevertheless." Statistics in medicine 34.7 (2015): 1097-1116. ).
