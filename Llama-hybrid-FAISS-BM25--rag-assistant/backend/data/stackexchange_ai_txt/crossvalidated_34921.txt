Determine range that contains given ratio of data points

I'd like to determine the "representative" range for a series of data points. For example, I'd like to know the range where 98% (or any other given ratio) of points are located. I could have used the inter-quantile range (1%-99% in this case), but in case of seriously skewed distributions this gives "too much attention" to long tails of the distribution. I'd better consider the following idea: imagine a histogram built for that series of points. Maximum of the histogram is considered to be 100%. Now draw the horisontal line at 1% mark and find the leftmost and rightmost intersections of the histogram curve with this line. Those intersections would give the left and right boundaries of the scale that contain most of the points. Does this approach have a commonly defined name? Is this approach appropriate for determining the "proper" range of the data?
