How to apply neural networks on multi-label classification problems?

Description: Let the problem domain be document classification where there exists a set of feature vectors, each belonging to 1 or more classes. For example, a document doc_1 might belong to Sports and English categories. Question: Using neural network for classification, what would the label be for a feature vector? would it be a vector constituting of all the classes such that 0 value is given to non-relevant classes and 1 for relevant classes? So if the class labels' list is [Sports, News, Action, English, Japanese] , then for document doc_1 the label would be [1, 0, 0, 1, 0] ?
