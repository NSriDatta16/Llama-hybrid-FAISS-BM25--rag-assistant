I think you're looking for the IDataObject COM interface. If you expose your data as an OLE object, you can use IDataObject::DAdvise to notify Excel when the data in your application is changing. This takes some effort, as you have to implement the IDataObject interface (along with a few others) to allow Excel to properly display and host the information you are exposing. If this is what you're after, here are some links you may find helpful: http://winapi.freetechsecrets.com/ole/OLEIDataObjectDAdvise.htm http://www.catch22.net/tuts/dragdrop/1 (mostly deals with Drag/Drop) http://www.catch22.net/tuts/dragdrop/2 (mostly deals with Drag/Drop) http://www.catch22.net/tuts/dragdrop/3 (mostly deals with Drag/Drop) http://us.generation-nt.com/answer/support-iadvisesink-word-excel-powerpoint-help-26654252.html http://www.tenouk.com/visualcplusmfc/mfcsupp/ioleobject.html
