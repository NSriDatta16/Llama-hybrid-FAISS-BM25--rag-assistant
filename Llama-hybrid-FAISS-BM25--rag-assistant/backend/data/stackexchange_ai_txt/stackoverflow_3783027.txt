Actually, there are a lot of concepts here. Let's start with the basics. An interrupt is a mean to request attention from the CPU, to interrupt the current program flow, jump to an interrupt handler (ISR - Interrupt Service Routine), do some work (usually by the OS kernel or a device driver) and then return. What are some typical uses for interrupts? Hardware interrupts: A device requests attention from the CPU by issuing an interrupt request. CPU Exceptions: If some abnormal CPU condition happens, such as a division by zero, a page fault, ... the CPU jumps to the corresponding interrupt handler so the OS can do whatever it has to do (send a signal to a process, load a page from swap and update the TLB/page table, ...). Software interrupts: Since an interrupt ends up calling the OS kernel, a simple way to implement system calls is to use interrupts. But you don't need to, in x86 you could use a call instruction to some structure (some kind of TSS IIRC), and on newer x86 there are SYSCALL / SYSENTER intructions. CPUs decide where to jump to looking at a table (exception vectors, interrupt vectors, IVT in x86 real mode, IDT in x86 protected mode, ...). Some CPUs have a single vector for hardware interrupts, another one for exceptions and so on, and the ISR has to do some work to identify the originator of the interrupt. Others have lots of vectors, and jump directly to very specific ISRs. x86 has 256 interrupt vectors. On original PCs, these were divided into several groups: 00-04 CPU exceptions, including NMI. With later CPUs (80186, 286, ...), this range expanded, overlapping with the following ranges. 08-0F These are hardware interrupts, usually referred as IRQ0-7. The PC-AT added IRQ8-15 10-1F BIOS calls. Conceptually, these can be considered system calls, since the BIOS is the part of DOS that depends on the concrete machine (that's how it was defined in CP/M). 20-2F DOS calls. Some of these are multiplexed, and offer multitude of functions. The main one is INT 21h, which offers most of DOS services. 30-FF The rest, for use by external drivers and user programs.
