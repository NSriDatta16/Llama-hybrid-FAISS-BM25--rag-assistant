Have you considered partitioning your large tables by 'construction'? This could alleviate some of the growing pains by splitting the storage for the tables across files/physical devices without needing to change your application. Adding spindles (more drives) and performing a few hours of DBA work can often be cheaper than modifying/adapting software. Otherwise, I'd agree with @heikogerlach and these similar posts: How do I version my ms sql database Mechanisms for tracking DB schema changes How do you manage databases in development, test and production?
