Why white noise residuals are desired: It is a general principle of time series models (including ARMA) that you would like to capture all systematic dynamics in the data. This means, every variation that can be explained by input variables, auto-regression, moving-average etc. should be explained. If after your model building, the residuals are purely random, and are not correlated with each other i.e. show no systematic pattern, then you are generally satisfied, because you reached a point where you cannot go further. White noise is completely unpredictable. And a bit more pragmatic answer: The residuals of an ARMA process are by defintion white noise. If you fit your data to an ARMA model, and you see that residuals are white noise, then this indicates you that the model fits the data well.
