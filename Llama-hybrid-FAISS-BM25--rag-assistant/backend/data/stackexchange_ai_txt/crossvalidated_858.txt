I'm not sure why this doesn't work with lrm . However, R does Logistic Regression just fine with its own internal functions. See GLM. Here's your model, working... summary(glm(am~1, data = mtcars, family=binomial(link=logit))) So, unless you need something that lrm() from design provides, then use GLM with the binomial logit link.
