Is the whole process being closed, or just the form? If it's just the form, presumably you have some objects which are still "live" - the list should be there, basically. If the whole app is being closed down and then restarted, you'll need to save your data to persistent storage (e.g. with XML serialization) and then reload it on startup. If you could give more information about the scenario, that would really help.
