Bayesian concepts : multivariate mixed models

I am working with a multilevel multivariate mixed mode with 4 outcomes. I am having difficulties extracting the variances, coefficients of variations. Could anyone advise? I am new to bayesian statistics so it has been pretty rough. Thank you My example: bform_1 fit_2
