How to interpret an ACF plot of residuals time series?

I have a daily time series starting (01/11/2022) and ending (30/06/2022). I'm trying to make a model of my time series. First, I made: tsdata $`Gain per day`, start = 1, end = 171, frequency = 7) tsdata_decompose trend + tsdata_decompose $seasonal + tsdata_decompose$ random tsdata_error Using the checkresiduals() functions i get How can I interpret the ACF plot?
