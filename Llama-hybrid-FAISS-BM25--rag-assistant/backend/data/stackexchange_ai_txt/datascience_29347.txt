Data preparation for Regression Model

Hi I'm currently trying to predict if an item will be successful in my store, this means (How much is going to sale in USD) My training dataset contains many features: Item name Item weight Item category Item country of origin Item sales overall Item sales per store Item rating Item price Etc.... Since I will be introducing a new item for sale, I know very little about this new item: Item name Item weight Item category Item country of origin Item price Not all the features present in training data/test data will be present when I will be making predictions. Is this normal in ML ? What is the rule of thumb when doing feature engineering for this type of cases.
