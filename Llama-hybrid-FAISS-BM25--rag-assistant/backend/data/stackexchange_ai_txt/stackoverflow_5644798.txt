emacs like fill-paragraph option in textmate?

Is there an option to reformat lines/paragraphs/selected text to 80 cols in TextMate like in emacs (fill-paragraph bound to M-q)? If not, do you know of any option to add this to TextMate - a known plugin/macro? any help in writing such a macro is most welcome too. :)
