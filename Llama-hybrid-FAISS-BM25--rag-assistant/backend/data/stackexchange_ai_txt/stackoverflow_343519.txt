Things that we used to do before we moved to Hyper-V... Don't allocate too much RAM to the VPC, it will start to use the paging file too much. Make sure that the virtual hard drives and virtual memory files for the VPC are excluded from your antivirus program. Defrag the VPC, then defrag the host. Don't have your paging file on the same drive as your VPC. Fix the size of the paging file so that it doesn't fragment. Kill all background processes on your primary host that you don't have to have running for you to do your job... and for that matter tune Windows for best performance rather than best appearance. Run Virtual Server rather than Virtual PC, and use Remote desktop to access the VPC (I've found VS to be a bit better at managing machines, and remote desktop seems to be faster and allows for a nice full screen experience on a second monitor).
