logistic regression always yielding increasing f'n when should sometimes be decreasing (using R)

I'm modeling a set of outcome data the depends on two parameters: time, T -100 I've done logistic regression using R with the command: model My expectation (the only thing that makes sense) is that when A 0 it should be a decreasing function of time approaching 0.5. However, the fit I get is that A 0, and A = 0 all are increasing functions of time. They in fact appear to be the same curve just shifted (ie same "shape"). What am I doing incorrectly? Any suggestions?
