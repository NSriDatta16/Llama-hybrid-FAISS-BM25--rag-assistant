How can I add and remove a class on links using jQuery?

Let me give a better description of exactly what I'm wanting to do here. I'm using Wikispaces, and by default, when a user adds a new page link to the side navigation bar, wikispaces inserts either one of two classes: wiki_link or wiki_link_new . Here's what it looks like... Map Page Staff Olympics Staff Meetings I'd like to automatically remove both classes (wiki_link and wiki_link_new), and add a class to the link that better represents the page url. So, for /Map+Page url, a class would be added to the link that is the first 3 letters of the link title... map. And then, if the link url has two words (as in /Map+Page), the class would also add the first 3 letters of the second word in the url, preceded by a dash. So, for /Map+Page, the class to be added to this link would be class="map-pag" Or, if it was the /Staff+Olympics url, the class to be added would be... class="sta-oly" And I guess if there were more than 2 words within the a:link url, the excess words would be ignored in regards to applying a CSS class to the link, only paying attention to the first 3 letters of the first word, followed by a dash, and then followed by the first 3 letters of the second word. And on top of all of that, I'd like to remove all instances of , which are also inserted by default by wikispaces. So ideally, I'd like a jQuery solution that would change the 3 a:links above to this... Map Page Staff Olympics Staff Meetings Not sure if my class naming conventions are the best. So if you have a better suggestion, I'd love to hear it! :) Thanks for any help you can provide!
