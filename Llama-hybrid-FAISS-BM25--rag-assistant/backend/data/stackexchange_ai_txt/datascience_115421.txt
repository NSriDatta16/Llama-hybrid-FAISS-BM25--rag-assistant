Draw(by hand) the decision boundary of an neural network

I am doing an exam preparation and came across this question from previous exams: I cant wrap my head around how to set up the corresponding equations given the thresholds.. (x1 + x2) + (x1 - x2) + (-x1 + x2) but then we have the thresholds... can someone help my thoughtprocess on how to tackle this? Note that i dont want the drawing, just an systematic way on how to tackle this so i understand the thoughtprocess. another similar problem but now with an bias(what i assume the value attached to the "pass through" node is):
