so I am having the sam problem here Everything gets executed expect for executing `deploy:start' [DEPRECATED] `deploy:start` is going to be removed after 2.5.9 - see http://is.gd/2BPeA * executing "cd /srv/www/domain.com/domain/current && nohup script/spin" servers: ["domain.com"] [domain.com] executing command ** [out :: domain.com] nohup: ignoring input and appending output to `nohup.out' ** [out :: domain.com] nohup: cannot run command `script/spin': No such file or directory command finished failed: "sh -c 'cd /srv/www/domain.com/domain/current && nohup script/spin'" on domain.com here is my deploy file don't see any problems as is set :application, "domain" set :repository, "git@git.assembla.com:domain.git" set :user, "blitz" set :use_sudo, false set :scm, :git # Or: `accurev`, `bzr`, `cvs`, `darcs`, `git`, `mercurial`, `perforce`, `subversion` or `none` set :deploy_to, "/srv/www/domain.com/#{application}" #set :git_enable_submodules, 1 # Make sure git submodules are populated set :port, 3002 # The port you've setup in the SSH setup section #set :ssh_options, { :forward_agent => true } default_run_options[:pty] = true role :web, "domain.com" # Your HTTP server, Apache/etc role :app, "domain.com" # This may be the same as your `Web` server role :db, "domain.com", :primary => true # This is where Rails migrations will run #role :db, "domain.com" # for slave db # If you are using Passenger mod_rails uncomment this: # if you're still using the script/reapear helper you will need # these http://github.com/rails/irs_process_scripts namespace :deploy do desc "Restarting mod_rails with restart.txt" # task :start do ; end # task :stop do ; end task :restart, :roles => :app, :except => { :no_release => true } do run "#{try_sudo} touch #{File.join(current_path,'tmp','restart.txt')}" end desc "Make symlink for database.yml" task :symlink_dbyaml do run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/config/database.yml #{release_path}/config/database.yml" end desc "Create empty database.yml in shared path" task :create_dbyaml do run "mkdir -p #{shared_path}/config" put '', "#{shared_path}/config/database.yml" end end after 'deploy:setup', 'deploy:create_dbyaml' after 'deploy:update_code', 'deploy:symlink_dbyaml' after "deploy", "deploy:cleanup" edit: never-mind found the ans was using passenger and needed this in the deploy.rb [:start, :stop].each do |t| desc "ignore #{t} since we are using passenger" task t do ; end end
