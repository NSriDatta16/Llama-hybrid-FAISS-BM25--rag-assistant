You need a second working copy at the old revision(It is sufficient to copy the directory and update the single file only). Then you need to perform the following steps: In the HEAD working copy Choose rename from the svn context menu to rename the file go to the OLD working copy and drag the old file to the HEAD working copy with the right mouse button chose svn copy versioned items here from the appearing menu commit (make sure the text status says "replaced(+)" for the old file and "added(+)" for the new file)
