I disagree. Deep neural networks, about as “machine learning” as one can get, are just functions of the features. You might have a big (huge) equation with millions or billions or parameters, but it’s just an equation, and a small neural network has a small equation that you can fit on a notebook page. Frank Harrell’s blog has some interesting posts on statistical modeling vs machine learning. https://www.fharrell.com/post/stat-ml/
