Ripped from my blog: keithdonegan.com The Equality Operator (==) The equality operator (==) checks whether two operands are the same and returns true if they are the same and false if they are different. The Identity Operator (===) The identity operator checks whether two operands are “identical”. These rules determine whether two values are identical: They have to have the same type. If number values have the same value they are identical, unless one or both are NaN. If string values have the same value they are identical, unless the strings differ in length or content. If both values refer to the same object, array or function they are identical. If both values are null or undefined they are identical.
