R: CoxPH model with a categorical variable that has too many levels

I have dataset df consist of 8000 observations org_id property1 property2 property3 uptimeDay event and org_id is a categorical variable with 1199 different levels. The other two variables or properties of an organization and are numerical. coxp_1 I am planning to run the following cox model in R but I keep getting this error msg which I am guessing is caused due to the fact that my categorical variable (org_id) has to many different levels. Error in fitter(X, Y, strats, offset, init, control, weights = weights, : NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 6) Does anybody know what could be a potential solution for this problem?
