It seems that "IE=EmulateIE7" will also make " " be true?

It seems that when the webpage has so that IE 8 will emulate IE 7, then later in the webpage, when there is then it will also be loading ie.css ? That is, it is IE 8, emulating IE 7, and so the lt IE 8 will be true ? Update: but then, the server side variable HTTP_USER_AGENT will be still saying IE 8? Because the browser goes to the server as IE 8, gives IE 8 as the string of HTTP_USER_AGENT, and then the server replies with wanting to emulate IE 7. So if the server language such as PHP detects HTTP_USER_AGENT, it will still be IE 8 in the compatibility mode (IE 7 emulation mode)?
