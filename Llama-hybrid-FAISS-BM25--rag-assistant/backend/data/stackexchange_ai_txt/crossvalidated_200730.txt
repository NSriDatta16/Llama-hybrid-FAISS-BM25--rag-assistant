What survfit() does if you do not specify a newdata argument is to try to give you a survival curve of an "average" individual. This is usually a bad idea because it is not obvious what you get out of it. In your case you should specify this way: plot(survfit(model, newdata = data.frame("group" = c("group1", "group2"))) and in that case you will get two survival curves, one for an individual with group = "group1" and one for an individual with group = "group2". For example I generated some data: times Then I fit the Cox model and i try to get the survival plots: mod1
