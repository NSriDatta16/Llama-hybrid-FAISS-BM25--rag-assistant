You have the following basic operations on layers: tf.keras.layers.Lambda so you can multiply each of your 3 layers with a simple lambda operation layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x * weight1)(layer1) layer2 = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x * weight2)(layer2) layer3 = tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x * weight3)(layer3) then there is the tf.keras.layers.Average that allows to average layers: average_layer = tf.keras.layers.Average()([layer1, layer2, layer3]) It's a bit awkward, I think a weighted average would be the best thing here but it does not seem to be available in Keras yet (as far as I know)
