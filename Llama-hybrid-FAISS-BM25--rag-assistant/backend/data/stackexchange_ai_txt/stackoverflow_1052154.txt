C# ID3 Library is a .Net class library for editing id3 tags (v1-2.4). I would store the ratings directly into the comments section of the mp3 since id3v1 does not have many of the storage features that id3v2 does. If you want to store additional information for each mp3, what about placing a unique identifier on the mp3 and then having that do a database lookup? I would be cautious about adding custom tags to mp3s as it is an easy way to ruin a large library. Also, I have gone down this road before and while I enjoyed the programming knowledge that came out of it, trying something like the iTunes SDK or Last FM might be a better route.
