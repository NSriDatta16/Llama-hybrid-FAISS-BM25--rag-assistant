What matters most if all data will fit simultaneously into memory. From the size that you give, it seems that this is easily the case (a few megabytes at worst). If so, I would discourage using a relational database, and do all operations directly in Python. Depending on what other processing you need, I would probably rather use binary pickles, than CSV.
