How to explain these statistical results in layman terms?

Overall, the evidence that subjects rate qualifications differently according to handicap status is moderately strong and is statistically significant at the α = 0.05 level (F = 2.862, p = 0.03). The data also provide sufficient evidence to suggest that there is a systematic difference between the average qualification scores given to the crutches candidate and to the hearing-impaired candidate. The difference is estimated to be 1.87 points higher for the crutches handicap, with a 95% confidence interval from 0.14 to 3.60 points based on the Tukey’s HSD. In addition, we find evidence of a significant difference between the average scores given to the wheelchair and crutches handicaps compared to the average scores given to the amputee and hearing handicaps (t = 3.19, p = 0.002, for a linear contrast). Notably, none of the average qualification scores from the four physical handicap groups differ significantly from the no-handicap control.
