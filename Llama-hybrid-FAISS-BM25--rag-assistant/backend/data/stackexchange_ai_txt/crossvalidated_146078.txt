How to perform a test for trend on an ordinal variable in logistic regression?

I have a dichotomous outcome (gallstones/no gallstones) and an ordinal predictor variable consisting of four classes (body mass index R . When running the glm function only the bmi 35-45 is significantly associated with the outcome (gallstones): glm(formula = gallstones ~ bmi, family = binomial, data = m) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.9282 -0.4058 -0.3624 -0.3624 2.3477 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.6902 0.1476 -18.223 To examine if there is a dose-response relationship with a linear trend with rising bmi I perform the analysis of variance with the chi-square test: anova(inc_test_3, test="Chisq") Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: gallstones Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid. Df Resid. Dev Pr(>Chi) NULL 1489 810.05 bmi 3 15.892 1486 794.16 0.001193 ** There is a significant difference between the obtained estimates from the ordinal bmi predictor. Is this the correct way to test for a trend on an ordinal variable?
