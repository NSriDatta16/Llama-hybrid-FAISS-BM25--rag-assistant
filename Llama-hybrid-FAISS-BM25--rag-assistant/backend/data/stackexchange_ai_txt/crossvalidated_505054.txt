I'm going to assume that you are running a series of simple mediation models -- one for each of your predictor variable (X1-X6). If so, then you could present the result of your mediation analyses in a single table and write about them in the results section one predictor at a time. For example: "The indirect effect of X1 via Mediator is statistically significant ( ab = 0.##, 95% CI [0.##, 0.##])." The direct effect is also significant ( b = 0.##, SE = 0.##). It would look something like Table 4 in Ma and Grogan-Kaylor (2017) except you would be grouping by independent variables as opposed to dependent variables. Alternatively, I suppose you could show your findings in a series of figures like Stellar et al. (2018) - Figure 2. However, since you have so many X variables, I think this would be less efficient than putting everything into one table. References Ma, J., & Grogan-Kaylor, A. (2017).
