Have them read http://www.cis.temple.edu/~ingargio/cis71/software/roberts/documents/loopexit.txt and see if it will change their minds. (There is history to their idea, but I side with you.) Edit: Here are the critical points from the article. The principle of single exits from control structures was adopted on principle, not observational data. But observational data says that allowing multiple ways of exiting control structures makes certain problems easier to solve accurately, and does not hurt readability. Disallowing it makes code harder and more likely to be buggy. This holds across a wide variety of programmers, from students to textbook writers. Therefore we should allow and use multiple exits where appropriate.
