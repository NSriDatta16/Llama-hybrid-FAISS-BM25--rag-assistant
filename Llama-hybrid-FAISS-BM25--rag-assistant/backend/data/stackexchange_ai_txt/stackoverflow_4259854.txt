Is there any reason to ditch javascript flash embedding methods in 2011?

The benefits of embedding flash with JS to my knowledge: ability to query navigator object and see what flash versions are installed, possibly branch out on that and feed different content based on this consistent method of attaching flash, as the script keeps the markup and usually you just need to specify the src , flashvars , dimensions save time by relying on helper utilities to embed the swf and not worry about intricate details ability to provide consistent fallback if embedding multiple objects per site. The disadvantages: devices with no flash but JS enabled will completely fail people get lazy and don't provide fallback content code is a mess if it needs to be cross-browser compatible. there are various bugs with common embed ( even youtube's ) and the "best" cross-browser seems to be nesting an object in an object per this . I realize though, I can use a server-side method and define the embedding code once and change it in one area, but this makes it not embeddable/usable in CMS textareas. The pros seem to outweigh the cons. I haven't really worked enough with mobile content to get an accurate opinion. Can anyone think of reasons why/why not?
