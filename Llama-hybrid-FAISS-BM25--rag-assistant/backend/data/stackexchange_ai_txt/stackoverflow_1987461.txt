This seems more logical, but at the same time it seems it allocates more memory because I am creating more classes. Creating new classes doesn't use a significant amount of memory. It's creating instances that uses memory - but again, the amount will be negligible compared to the memory used by loading in your graphics etc. Don't worry about memory. Your only concern at this stage should be good code organisation. You should have separate classes when they have different behaviour. If they have the same behaviour but different properties, then you use the same class and set the properties accordingly. In this case, you don't appear to have significantly different behaviour, but if separating it into Tree, Building, and House makes life easier for you when managing which items can be included in others etc, do it.
