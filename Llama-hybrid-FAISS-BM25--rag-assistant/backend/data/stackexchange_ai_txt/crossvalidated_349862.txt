ARMA and differencing time series, Theory questions

True/False Statements, if false make them true: 1.The model Y t = Y t-1 + u t , where u t is a white noise process, is a process whose logarithm is stationary. My idea: So the model itself is not stationary since its a random walk, but if i take the logarithm that should change right? 2. The model Y t = Y t-1 +δ+ u t , where u t is a stationary ARMA(1,1) process with E(u t )=0, models a time series where the growth rates ∇Y t are uncorrelated No idea if the second one is true.
