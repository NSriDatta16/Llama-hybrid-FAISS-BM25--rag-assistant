What is the relationship between NFS and caching?

This seems like it should be blindingly obvious, but I cannot see the answer. Does NFS have caching? How does it work? Does it simply leverage your operating system/filesystem caching? Does it depend on the client or server you are using? I'm using NFS as a client on Solaris with no special mount options.
