Personally option 2 make me shudder as I'm sure it does to your dbas. Entity value tables are the worst way to store data if you need to query on it. This is not generally the "Small" performance hit you envision but the "big" performance hit your dbas envision. DBAs are always getting stuck fixing the poorly performing systems people designed this way because it looks more object-oriented and understandable to them. That's why we hate it when people suggest these types of designs. Designing database storage for ease of programmers is short-sighted and unprofessional. Databases must be designed for integrity, performance and security. Time to develop against it is a distant, distant fourth. Databases don't refactor as easily as application code, you may be stuck with this design for the next twenty years. Now the real question is do you need to query on this data (Other than returning the values in an query based on someother criteria)? If you do not need to query or query very infrequently, then just put all the extra data into a varchar(max) field and be done with it.
