Can jsp:param store a collection?

Greetings, here is the problem. I have a page called entList.jsp , that works with a collection: Everything works great, and the parameter packingList is passed as an attribute of the request by the action handler that calls this page. Actually packingList is of type Collection . It turned out that this page (the fragment it stores) is actually pretty useful, and can be used in many places with different collections. So I tried to include this page like this (in another page): However, now this fragment does not see the argument packingList . I tried to rewrite the fragment like this (since now it's a parameter): But now it generates an exception, since it treats packingList as a string and not a collection. So right now the solution is like this - set the required collection as an attribute in the action handler code: // This is the original instance set by the action request.setAttribute("traffic", traffic); // And this is the additional one, to be used by entList.jsp request.setAttribute("packingList", traffic.getPackingList()); So the question is - can jsp:param tag receive a collection as it's value? I read the documentation for the JSP tags and it remains unclear - it seems like the only thing you can pass in such a way it's string parameters (or something that can be converted to string), but no complicated objects.
