Statistical Test for Embedding?

I have a bunch of labeled objects. Let's say there are K classes altogether. Now suppose every object is mapped to a data point in R^n, or in other words, is embedded in R^n. Ideally a good embedding means objects with the same class label should be close to each other. Is there any statistical test I can use here?
