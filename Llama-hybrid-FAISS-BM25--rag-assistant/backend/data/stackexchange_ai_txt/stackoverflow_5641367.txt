how to know when the image was loaded if I change the src with js

I change the src of an img tag with javascript is there a way to determine when the browser has fully loaded the image ? I use this here: http://mrgsp.md:8080/prodinner/Meal if you click on a change picture link, and than drag and drop an image from your desktop/other dir to the big button on that popup the src of the center image is going to be changed
