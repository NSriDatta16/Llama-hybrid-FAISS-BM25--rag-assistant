AjaxJspTag is not defined

I'm trying to use AjaxTags, especially the htmlContent tag. The jsp looks as follow: HtmlContent Tag Demo The ajax:htmlContent tag fills a content area (e.g., DIV tag) with an HTML fragment from another resource. You may find this tag useful for including blocks of information in a sidebar when the user clicks a link or form field. This tag is a more simplified approach to the ajax:portlet and ajax:tabPanel tags. Shown below are three different ways of executing the AJAX event: link, radio button, and select field. HtmlContent in Action Select by ANCHOR link. Ford Honda Mazda Select by RADIO option. Ford Honda Mazda Select by SELECT option. Select one Ford Honda Mazda Loading... The htmlcontent.htm is produced by another jsp, which contains only "HalloText" as string, nothing else (no html tags or similar). And this page can be loaded in the browser. When i load the first jsp, then i get following as output: HtmlContent Tag Demo The ajax:htmlContent tag fills a content area (e.g., DIV tag) with an HTML fragment from another resource.
