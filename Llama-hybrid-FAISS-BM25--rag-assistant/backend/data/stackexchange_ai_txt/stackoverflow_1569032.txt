How can I reorder columns in a listview with the same result as drag and drop

How do I reorder the column headers in code AS IF I have clicked and dragged them around? When AllowColumnReorder is true on a ListView you can drag around the columns, and the display index is changed. When you add new items to the listview, you don't have to worry about how the columns were rearranged, it lines up the incoming data with the original column order. Basically I am looking for an easy way to save the display indexes, and then restore them when the listview is used again. But I prefer to keep my original column order for inserting data.
