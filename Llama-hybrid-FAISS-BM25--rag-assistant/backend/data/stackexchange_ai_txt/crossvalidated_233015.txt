Linear regression assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between a predictor variable $X$ and a quantitative response $Y$. Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as $Y ≈ β_0 + β_1X$. In many situations, the response variable $Y$ is instead qualitative (e.g. categorical ). Predicting a qualitative response for an can be referred to as classifying. Logistic regression is one of classifiers. Logistic regression models the probability that $Y$ belongs to a particular category. Mathematically, we can write logistic relationship as $P(X) ≈ β_0 + β_1X$. In both cases $X$ is liner variable.
