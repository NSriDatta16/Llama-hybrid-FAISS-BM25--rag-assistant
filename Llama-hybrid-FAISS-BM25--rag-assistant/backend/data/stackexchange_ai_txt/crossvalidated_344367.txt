Interesting problem. If I understand this correctly, participants can choose one of the following: - A single behaviour; - Two behaviours; - Three behaviours; - Four behaviours; - Five behaviours. If my counting is correct, participants can choose one behaviour in 5 different ways, 2 behaviours in 10 different ways, 3 behaviours in 10 different ways, 4 behaviours in 5 different ways and 5 behaviours in a single way - that means a total of 31 possibilities. It's possible that some of these possibilities are not represented in the data, so you have less than 31 possibilities - even so, that's a lot of possibilities! If you didn't have so many possibilities, I guess you could have defined your outcome variable as "possibility selected by participant" (e.g., participant # 1 selected behaviours 1 and 2), in which case a multinomial logistic regression might have helped. So it looks like you might have no option but to collapse information across all these possibilities. Maybe there is a natural ranking of these behaviours whereby behaviour 5 is the best and behaviour 1 is the worst. Then you could assign ranks to each behaviour (e.g., behaviour 5 receives 5 points and behaviour 1 receives 1 point) and define your outcome variable as the sum of the ranks corresponding to the selected behaviours. Then, in your modelling of this summated rank, you can control for the number of questions selected by the participants by including number of questions as a covariate in your model. Or maybe you can single out two of the behaviours you think are most important (e.g., behaviours 1 and 2) and then define your outcome variable to have the categories: "behaviour 1 (by itself or in conjunction with any or all of the behaviours 3, 4 or 5 but not in conjunction with behaviour 2)", "behaviour 2 (by itself or in conjunction with any or all of the behaviours 3, 4 or 5 but not in conjunction with behaviour 1)", "behaviours 1 and 2 together (by themselves or in conjunction with any or all of the behaviours 3, 4 or 5), "all other sets of behaviours". Then you have a more maneageable number of mutually exclusive categories which you can model via multinomial regression. I guess you have to define your outcome variable in a way that reflects your research question while acknowledging the challenges involved in the data. I just wanted to share some ideas in case they might prompt you to think differently about your problem.
