Multivariate (5 dependent 1 independent variable) and paired data, multiple samples used. Which statistical test?

My data has 5 dependent variables (measured amount of oxygen, halides, nitrogen, sulfur, and organic) and one independent variable with 2 "treatments (flow rate, 1 Lpm or 2 Lpm). The catch is: I have multiple pairs of data for 2 treatments, which are not for the same sample (each pair is its own sample, taken at a different date - see attached picture below). I would like to evaluate if the flow rate treatment had a significant influence on the results of 5 dependent variables. Would be a classic MANOVA test if not for the fact that I want to know that across all pairs of data. Performing multiple MANOVAs for each pair is not useful because there is not enough measurements for each independent variable (i.e. 2-3 for each dependent variable for each treatment and date). Any help would be greatly appreciated.
