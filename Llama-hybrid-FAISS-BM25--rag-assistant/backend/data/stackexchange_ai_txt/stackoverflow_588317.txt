One option is to return multiple values. In Python, it's simple and considered idiomatic: isOK, reason = foo.is_something_ok_to_do() The topic of multiple return values---and how to use them in different contexts---has come on SO several times: Elegant ways to return multiple values from a function Is it pythonic for a function to return multiple values? Command-query separation can be trivially enforced, by adding state to the object recording the results of an action. However, there can be negative side effects such as concurrency problems (see the Wikipedia page on this). For example: foo.do_something() is_ok = foo.did_something_succeed() reason = foo.something_success_reason() Each of these is either a command that does not return a value, or a query that returns a value and does not modify state.
