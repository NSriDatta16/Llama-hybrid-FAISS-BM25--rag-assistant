Methods of fitting a dynamic linear model

I'm taking a time series course and am learning about exchangeable time series form of dynamic linear models (DLMs). This is given by: \begin{align*} \mathbf{y}_t' &= \mathbf{F}_t'\boldsymbol{\Theta}_t + \boldsymbol{\nu}_t', \qquad \boldsymbol{\nu}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, v_t\mathbf{V})\\ \boldsymbol{\Theta}_t &= \mathbf{G}_t\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{t-1} + \boldsymbol{\Omega}_t, \qquad \boldsymbol{\Omega}_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{W}_t, \mathbf{V}) \end{align*} $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_t$ comes from a matrix-variate normal distribution. All parameters except $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ can be fit using forward filtering backward sampling (FFBS). In order to fit $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$, we must do a Gibbs sampling step. My question is: what is the difference between FFBS and the Kalman filter? What other ways are there to fit DLMs? For example, I have heard of the particle filter - is this something that can be used in this context? And finally, is it always possible to do Gibbs sampling (perhaps with Metropolis-Hastings if prior distributions are not conjugate) to fit a DLM?
