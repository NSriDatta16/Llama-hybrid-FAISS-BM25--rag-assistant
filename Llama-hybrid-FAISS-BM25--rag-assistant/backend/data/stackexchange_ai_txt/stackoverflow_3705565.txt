PHP-driven exhaustive stats - server-side text files or MySQL tables?

I've got a gaming-oriented website with 200+ users. The site has a large database tracking user plays, and one of the motivations for continued participation is the extensive statistics and rankings ( S&R ) with which the site provides the user. As the list of S&Rs tracked has grown, some of the more intricate calculations have been moved to tables within the database, rather than be generated on-the-fly in order to improve page loading speed. However, I plan to move from extensive to exhaustive S&Rs by the end of the year, increasing the overall number of datapoints available to the user by a factor of 10. I've already decided to stop doing on-the-fly queries and to move all the calculations to a cron job, but I'm unsure where to store the data. Given a user base These are the main pros and cons in my mind: Storing S&Rs in the Database + cross-user comparisons are easy and fast + faster cron jobs because there's no need to write to many, many files - database table count will jump from ~50 to 200+ (at least) - one point of failure (database corruption) for all site data - modifying S&R structure requires modifying database as well Storing S&Rs in Text Files + neatly organized and distributes data corruption risk + database is easier to navigate + redesigning S&R structure is done by simply modifying script and overwriting all text files, rather than adjusting database tables - cron job will have to read/update XXX files each time - cross-user comparisons are difficult and time-consuming But I've never done something of this magnitude before, so I'm not really sure (for example) if a 200+ table MySQL database is even really a problem? I'd appreciate any suggestions you can provide! :-)
