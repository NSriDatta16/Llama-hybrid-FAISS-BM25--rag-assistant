Incorporating Prior Class Probability Distribution in Logistic Regression

I am amazed that I can not find any articles / lectures about how one can incorporate Prior Class Probability Distributions in classifiers like Logistic Regression or Random Forest. So my question is: How can incorporate Prior Class Probability Distribution in Logistic Regression or Random Forests? Does Incorporating Prior Class Probability Distribution imply that I should use Bayesian machinery? I am facing a classification task where I know that class a is much more likely than class b. An adhoc solution would be to just include more samples for class a in the training set, but are there any theoretical results on this? One thing I thought about was to change the decision threshold from 0.5 to a value taking into account this prior imbalance. But I am not even sure if that makes theoretically sense, because at the point where I am ready to make a decision I already looked at all the feature values so I should not care about the prior probability but the class conditional probability.
