Incremental .NET code coverage tool?

I'm looking for a tool (preferably free) that analyzes incremental code coverage of our C# solution. What I mean by this is that I don't want to know what the total code coverage is for all code or even for a namespace, but only new lines of code or perhaps lines of code that changed since the last checkin. (We use subversion for source control.) I would like to call this tool as part of our automated build process and report back when someone checks in new code with less than X% code coverage. Does anyone know of a tool that accomplishes this? Thanks.
