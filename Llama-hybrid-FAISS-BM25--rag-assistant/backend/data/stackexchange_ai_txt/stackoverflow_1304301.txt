WAIT: Apple has implemented the Search Display Controller in the iPhone SDK 3.0. You can drag that to the header of your tableView, or programmatically set that as headerView. You only have to set a few simple parameters (like the dataSource, which is just an UITableViewDatasource and a viewController, where the results have to been showed in). This gives you exactly the same look as the contacts-application and all other Apple-applications (you can also set 'scopes' like the Mail-app)
