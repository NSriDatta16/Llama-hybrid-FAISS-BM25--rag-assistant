In some sense I guess it depends on how important that performance is to your application and how much of a performance gain you really see by using coding practices that you may not think of as 'good'. But that being said, I always encourage developers to not cling to dogma and keep writing code the same old way because it was the way you were taught was "right". If you document the code well and use consistent and explainable coding practices, then I think it's perfectly fine to do something that may not fit into the "OOP paradigm". In the end, it's about working code that's maintainable.
