There is the concept of PSObject and Add-Member that you could use. $contact = New-Object PSObject $contact | Add-Member -memberType NoteProperty -name "First" -value "John" $contact | Add-Member -memberType NoteProperty -name "Last" -value "Doe" $contact | Add-Member -memberType NoteProperty -name "Phone" -value "123-4567" This outputs like: [8] Â» $contact First Last Phone ----- ---- ----- John Doe 123-4567 The other alternative (that I'm aware of) is to define a type in C#/VB.NET and load that assembly into PowerShell for use directly. This behavior is definitely encouraged because it allows other scripts or sections of your script work with an actual object.
