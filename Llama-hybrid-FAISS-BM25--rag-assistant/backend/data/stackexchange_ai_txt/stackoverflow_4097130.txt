At what point (percentage of the total records involved, or absolute number of records), should i consider dropping the indexes ? I cannot tell, but with such large amounts of data it mostly yields benefits to drop the indexes and recreate them later on, when the transactions have been finished. The only way to get a good answer is to measure the performance empirically for your scenario. IMHO, your main problem is the the limit clause to display progress to the user. I would not do that. If left out it could yield a significant performance bonus. Furthermore, If I were a user, I'd rather have the job done as fast as possible than knowing the progress. You can use a marquee to display there's an action going on. You can also measure the average time per record (or the formula depending on the amount of data) and display an educated guess about the progress. Measure with every run, save it somewhere and build an average from the last 10 runs or so to calculate the progress. Or you can part the logic into different steps and display a step number for the query that is currently executing. If you really need to display the progress, try using and exists statement instead of the in clause. It could be faster.
