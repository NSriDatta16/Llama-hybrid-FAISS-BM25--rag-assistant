I had a similar issue, where I need to adjust the size of the font to keep the name of my object within the boundaries of rectangles, not circles. I used a while loop, and kept checking the text extent size of the string, decreasing the font size until it fit. Here what I did: (this is using C++ under Kylix, a Delphi derivative). double fontSize = 20.0; bool bFontFits = false; while (bFontFits == false) { m_pCanvas->Font->Size = (int)fontSize; TSize te = m_pCanvas->TextExtent(m_name.c_str()); if (te.cx Of course, this doesn't show error checking. If the rectangle (or your circle) is too small, you'll have to break out of the loop.
