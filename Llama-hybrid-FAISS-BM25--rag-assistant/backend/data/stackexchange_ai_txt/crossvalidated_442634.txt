Binary logistic interpretation (spss)

I'm trying to conduct a binary logistic regression to see how each feature of male crabs contributes to being selected by females. the dependent variable is being selected or not selected which is dichotomous and I have 4 independent variables. I originally had 5 variables but 3 of them have really high correlations so I removed 1 of them from the test. Right now I'm facing several issues in interpretation of the results. 1- I only have 24 cases for the test the other cases have missing variables is that enough for the test? 2- While the Omnibus test is significant (0.047) the Hosmer and Lemeshow test is also significant (0.009) which is contradicting the Omnibus test. 3- None of the variables in the equation are significant should I still interpret B and exp(B) and the results? 4- The constant is a high negative number is that an issue? because I think its messing with the probabilities
