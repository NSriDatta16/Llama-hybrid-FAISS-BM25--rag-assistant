Mediation analysis in mixed model ordinal logistic regression

For my thesis i want to perform a mediation analysis in a mixed model ordinal logistic regression. y = survey data (ordinal variable) x = year (2021 data compared to 2020 data) mediator (m) = discrete count data Data is clustered per school, and individual I have looked into andrew hayes process macro, but this is not suitable for clustered/multi-level data. Are there any options for SPSS to run this analysis? Thank you for reading my question! kind regards, E
