How can I ensure good test-coverage of my big Python proejct

I have a very large python project with a very large test suite. Recently we have decided to quantify the quality of our test-coverage. I'm looking for a tool to automate the test coverage report generation. Ideally I'd like to have attractive, easy to read reports but I'd settle for less attractive reports if I could make it work quickly. I've tried Nose, which is not good enough: It is incompatible with distribute / setuptools' namespace package feature. Unfortunately nose coverage will never work for us since we make abundant use of this feature. That's a real shame because Nose seems to work really nicely in Hudson (mostly) As an alternative, I've heard that there's a way to do a Python coverage analysis in Eclipse, but I've not quite locked-down the perfect technique. Any suggestions welcome! FYI we use Python 2.4.4 on Windows XP 32bit
