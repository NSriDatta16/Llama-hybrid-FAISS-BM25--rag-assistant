Based on your answer to my question, I think you can construct an additional variable nComp in the dataset equal to the number of competitors associated with each observation. You probably should throw out the first few observations because you can expect there were competing agents active at the beginning that are not accounted for. Then you can construct a scatterplot of LengthOfRun versus nComp . If it looks reasonably linear, then a simple linear regression should help you make an inference about the effect of number of competitors. If it's nonlinear, or the variability changes, you need a fancier regression model. In addition, you could plot nComp versus other variables -- e.g. vs. StartTime to see if there is a trend.
