How to plot angular time series?

I am trying to inspect a circular time series (a long time series of angular measures in 0-360Â°). The main aim would be to identify abrupt changes in the time series, but as a start I would like to plot it and visually inspect it. What is the best way? I am aware of the Fisher & Lee 1994 paper, but I found it difficult to implement in R . REFERENCE Fisher, N. I., and A. Lee. "Time series analysis of circular data." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological) 56.2 (1994): 327-339.
