Blackberry: Important differences between WebWorks and Java Development

I'm doing some research on blackberry development and I've been looking at the documents on the Blackberry website for both the Webworks development solution and Java based development. THey both seem to support important features such as Push Local Storage Geolocation But I guess I'm missing why one would pick one method over the other. Are there key features missing from the Webworks side that are only available to native, javabased apps? I'm hoping someone experienced with blackberry development can enlighten me.
