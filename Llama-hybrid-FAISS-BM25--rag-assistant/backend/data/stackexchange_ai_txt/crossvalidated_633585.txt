warning: variance matrix is nonsymmetric or highly singular

I get the above warning when running a 2SLS regression in Stata with robust standard errors. Specifically, I get this for the first stage, where in addition the first stage has no F-statistic, p-value, standard errors, t-values or confidence interval. To give more context, my instrument is random assignment of treatment while my endogenous variable is whether the subject complied with the treatment (i.e. completed the intended treatment). What could be the cause of this? Is there a fundamental problem with using assigned treatment as an instrument? Is there a more elaborate method to obtain Complier Average Causal Effect?
