I would like to predict the probabilities of 7 classes: $$C = {c_1, ...., c_7}$$ I do not have a single model which outputs the 7 probabilities, but I have several mini-models pre-trained on different subsets of C (subsets can be disjoint or overlap). For example: $M_1$ trained on classes ${1, 3, 4}$ $M_2$ trained on classes ${3, 5, 6}$ $M_3$ trained on classes ${2, 5, 7}$ ... How can I average the results meaningfully in order to get the prediction of the 7 classes? Further info: I know the size of the dataset and the number of examples of each class
