Average and SD for not paired and different number replicates

mydf I want to calculate the average ratio and SD for aow2/fow1, I can not calculate it for each single replicate because they are not paired and different number. I could calculate average and SD for each column fow1 and aow but how can I calculate the aow2/fow1 average and SD? What scripts should I use?
