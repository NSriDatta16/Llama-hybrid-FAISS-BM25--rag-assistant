RDA and CCA output- unconstrained inertia 0.00 rank 0

I get an ouput for RDA and for CCA that says that my unconstrained inertia is 0, rank 0. I thought that would be a good thing, meaning that all the variance in the data is explained by my (constrained) variables. But the Anova method doesnÂ´t work, because the residuals are missing. So in the case the result is not significant, do I have to discard the results or can I work with it? I already looked at the following questions: CCA inertia in vegan , cca vegan output and rda or cca . An excerpt of the summary of the CCA: > anova.cca(cil.rda,step=1000) No residual component Model: rda(formula = cil.hel ~ Dino + Abun + Chla + Salinity + Cond + Temp + Depth + MaxD + Syn + Pro1 + Pro2 + Pk + Nk + Cryp + Auto + Heter + HF + bac, data = envm) Df Variance F Pr(>F) Model 15 0.45721 Residual 0 0.00000
