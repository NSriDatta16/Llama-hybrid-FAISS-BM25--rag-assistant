What is the least dangerous way to allow users to enter code samples?

I'm implementing a Rails application in which users will be able to store snippets of code for later reference. I'm planning to use Markdown for text entry and will probably use the wmd markdown editor . (The very one Stackoverflow uses.) I'm a little concerned about the idea of people entering code into the edit box. From what I understand, there's a danger of entering SQL that could screw up my DB, or of entering JavaScript that would get run later and do mischief. Ordinarily, Rails has functionality to guard against this, but am I in a special situation here because my users will be encouraged to enter snippets of code? Are there any extra precautions I should be aware of?
