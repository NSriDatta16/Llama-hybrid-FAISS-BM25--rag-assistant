That's a good list covering a lot. I've used some of these methods since before anything was called machine learning, and I think you will see some of the methods you list coming in and out of use over time. If a method has been out of favour for too long, it might be time for a revisit. Some methods can obfuscate behind different names resulting from different fields of study. One of the main areas I have used these methods is in mineral potential modelling, which is geospatial and to support that you could add some additional categories relating to spatial and oriented data methods. Taking your broad question to specific fields will probably be where you find more examples of methods not in your comprehensive list. For example, two methods I've seen in mineral potential have been backward stepwise regression and weights of evidence modelling. I'm not a statistician; perhaps these would be considered covered in the list under linear regression and Bayesian methods.
