Voice recording spectrogram

I am creating a voice recording app wherein I have displayed a decibel meter. However, I would like to include a voice spectrogram on the lines of what is found in Dragon Dictate or Google Search applications. Any suggestions on where I can start in this regard. I am a complete dummy when it comes to FFT or spectrogram analysis. Look forward to any suggestions.
