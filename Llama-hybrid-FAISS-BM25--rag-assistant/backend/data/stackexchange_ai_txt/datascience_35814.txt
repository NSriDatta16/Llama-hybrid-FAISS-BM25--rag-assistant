Confusion about neural network architecture for the actor critic reinforcement learning algorithm

I am trying to understand the implementation of the actor critic reinforcement learning algorithm. According to this , there should be just one neural network with two heads for the action probabilities and the state values. It is also true in their tensorflow implementation here . However, if I refer to the tensorflow implementations such as this and this , they use two nn and update them separately. So, my question is what is the correct way to go about the neural network for the actor critic algorithm?
