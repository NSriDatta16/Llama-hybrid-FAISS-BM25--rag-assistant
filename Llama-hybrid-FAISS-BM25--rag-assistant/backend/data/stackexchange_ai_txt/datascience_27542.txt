Find the order of importance of random variables in their ability to explain a variance of Y

Problem statement: Given a set of random variables Xs, give the order of importance of their ability to explain variance in target variable Y. Assumes all Xs are normalised to have 0 mean and std dev of 1. Can treat this as regression problem(normal or ordinal) Solution for 2 cases: Case 1: When the calculated covariance matrix is diagonal, I know that random variables Xs are independent wrt each other. Then I can fit a linear regression model and order Xs by their weights. Case 2: Or If I know that Xs are independent( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory) even though their covariance in non zero, I can fit linear regression model and order Xs by weights. How do I solve this problem when I know that random variable Xs are not independent and have non zero covariance? Also how can I use a non linear model such as random forest to get variable importance? scikit provides feature_importances_ api for random forest.... Is there an gotcha with this api such as results are not meaningful when variables are dependent or covariant?
