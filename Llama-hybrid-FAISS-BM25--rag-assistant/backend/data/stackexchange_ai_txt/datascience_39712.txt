I would use absolute temperatures. Knowing it's 37.2C, I'm more likely to say the temperature will decrease just from the context. This context would be lost if you only use the differences. But like most data science questions, the proof is in the pudding. Try both and see what works best for you. You may even try using both absolute and difference as two feature columns.
