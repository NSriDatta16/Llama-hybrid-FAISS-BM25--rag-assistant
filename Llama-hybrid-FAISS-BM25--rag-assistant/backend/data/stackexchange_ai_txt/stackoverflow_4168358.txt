If you are arranging data using XML, you will need to: Persist the data Query the data There are various ways to do both 1 and 2. Databases designed for XML storage as you have read about for 1, and XQuery for 2. Probably more popular than XQuery is XPath which is the basis of XSL transform. And probably more popular for storage is just the plain old file system, but this leads to generally only using XML for fairly static data. So to the point of your question... I use XML all the time, but not XQuery, nor an XML database.
