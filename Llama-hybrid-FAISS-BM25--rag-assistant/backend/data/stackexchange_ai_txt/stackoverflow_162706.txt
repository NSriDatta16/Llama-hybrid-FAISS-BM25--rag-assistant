First off, I'm assuming that the second example's declaration for IInterface2 is a typo and should be IInterface2 = interface(Interface1) because inheriting from itself is nonsensical (even if the compiler accepted it). And "inheriting" is the key word there for answering your question. In example 1 the two interfaces are completely independent and you can implement one, the other, or both without problems. In example 2, you are correct that you can't implement interface2 without also implementing interface1, but the reason why that's so is because it makes interface1 a part of interface2. The difference, then, is primarily structural and organizational, not just readability.
