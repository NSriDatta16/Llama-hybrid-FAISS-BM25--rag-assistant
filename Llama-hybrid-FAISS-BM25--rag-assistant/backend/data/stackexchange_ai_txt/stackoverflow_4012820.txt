You need to create a new module (referred as 'backend' in the plugin), Technoweenie::AttachmentFu::Backends.const_get('YourChosenBackend') . The contract for this backend is, i am afraid, implicitly defined in other backend modules. You can refer to s3 , file_system or db . By contract I mean that there are some methods that you need to override / define. A few examples (i took them from file_sysyem_backend.rb : full_filename(thumbnail = nil) base_path attachment_path_id partitioned_path(*args) public_filename(thumbnail = nil) filename=(value) create_temp_file destroy_file rename_file save_to_storage current_data Once you have defined your backend, you can then pass the option :storage => :your_chosen to has_attachment .
