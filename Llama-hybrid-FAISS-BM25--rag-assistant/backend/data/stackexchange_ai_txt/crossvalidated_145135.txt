What will Multi-variate Gaussian Distribution become when the quadratic form in the exponent is constant

I'm reading the chapter 2 of PRML( Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning ) and I don't understand the following statement in the first paragraph in page 80: The Gaussian distribution will be constant on surfaces in $x$-space for which this quadratic form is constant. My understanding is that the Gaussian will become an uniform distribution when the quadratic form is constant but I'm not sure. And when will the quadratic form be constant? The quadratic form is: $$ \Delta^2=(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu) $$ And the Multi-variate Gaussian is : $$ N(x|\mu,\Sigma)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{(D/2)}}\frac{1}{|\Sigma|^{1/2}}\exp\lbrace -\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu) \rbrace $$
