There a whole bunch of ways you could go about this. Overfitting is definitely a danger if you have too many features. A few suggestions: Rather than using all of the other stocks in the sector and potentially exploding the number of features in your dataset, try constructing some indicator features (e.g. average historic returns in sector, average volatility in sector, average historic returns of all stocks, fraction of stocks with positive returns). Hand crafting these will probably be your best return on investment in terms of performance. Clustering approaches (kmeans etc.) are good too, they can help you find clusters of stocks which are positively (or negatively) correlated with the stock you want to predict.
