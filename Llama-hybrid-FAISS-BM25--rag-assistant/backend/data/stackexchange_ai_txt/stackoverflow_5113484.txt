Traditionally there has been HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) for this, but the web page says HAL is in maintenance mode - no new features are added. All future development focuses on udisks, UPower and other parts of the stack. See Software/DeviceKit for more information. and the DeviceKit page lists udisks, a D-Bus interface for dealing with storage devices So udisks should probably be what you are asking for.
