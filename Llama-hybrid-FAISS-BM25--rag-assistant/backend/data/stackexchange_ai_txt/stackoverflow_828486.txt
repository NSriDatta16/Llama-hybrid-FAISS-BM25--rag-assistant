Neural Net Optimize w/ Genetic Algorithm

Is a genetic algorithm the most efficient way to optimize the number of hidden nodes and the amount of training done on an artificial neural network? I am coding neural networks using the NNToolbox in Matlab. I am open to any other suggestions of optimization techniques, but I'm most familiar with GA's.
