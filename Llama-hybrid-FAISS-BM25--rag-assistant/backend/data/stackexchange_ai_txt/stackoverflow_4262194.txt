Reverse engineering C++ - best tools and approach

I am sorry - C++ source code can be seen as implementation of a design, and with reverse-engineering I mean getting the design back. It seems most of you have read it as getting C++ source from binaries. I have posted a more precise question at Understanding a C++ codebase by generating UML - tools&methology I think there are many tools that can reverse-engineer C++ (source-code), but usually it is not so easy to make sense of what you get out. Have somebody found a good methodology? I think one of the things I might want to see for example is the GUI-layer and how it is separated (or not from the rest). Think the tools should somehow detect packages, and then let me manually organize it.
