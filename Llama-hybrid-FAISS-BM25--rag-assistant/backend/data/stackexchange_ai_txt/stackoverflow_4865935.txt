Use the touchesBegan and touchesMoved delegates in the current UIView. These delegates return xy locations and time stamps. You can estimate the velocity of a touch or swipe by dividing the Pythagorean distance between touches by delta time, and get the angle from atan2(dy,dx). You can also average or filter the velocity returned, by doing this over multiple touch events.
