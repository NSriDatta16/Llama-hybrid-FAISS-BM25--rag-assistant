Assume your logistic regression model is of the following form: $$\text{logit}(y_i)=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p$$ then you can make probability predictions by rewriting the equation as the following: $$\text{logit}(y_i)=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p\Rightarrow y_i=\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p}}$$ where $y_i$ is now the predicted probability under your given model. Now if you replace your coefficient estimates with the $\beta$'s in my equation and the correct values of $x$ you should get what you are looking for.
