What are MVP and MVC and what is the difference?

When looking beyond the RAD (drag-drop and configure) way of building user interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three design patterns called Model-View-Controller , Model-View-Presenter and Model-View-ViewModel . My question has three parts to it: What issues do these patterns address? How are they similar? How are they different?
