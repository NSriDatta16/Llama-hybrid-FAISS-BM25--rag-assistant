Using a System.Guid as primary key in ASP.Net MVC?

I have created a table in the database that has a System.Guid as it's primary key. The required ADO.Net Entity Framework model has been generated and the required stored procedures has been mapped. I created a new controller and added the basic required code for Create and Edit for the data. However when the clicking on the link to edit the a particular record the following error is generated: The parameters dictionary contains a null entry for parameter '[MyId]' of non-nullable type 'System.Guid' for method 'System.Web.Mvc.ActionResult Edit(System.Guid)' in '[MySite].[MyController].[SpecificController]'. To make a parameter optional its type should be either a reference type or a Nullable type. Parameter name: parameters The edit action is declared in the controller as follows: public ActionResult Edit(Guid itemId) { return View(); } [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Edit(MyItem itemToModify) { } When adding a new record the new Guid is generated via a Stored Procedure and the list is displaying the correct Guid. The Url is also passing the correct Guid for retrieval. I can't seem to capture the point at which this fails, but how would I go about passing a System.Guid as a parameter to the Controller?
