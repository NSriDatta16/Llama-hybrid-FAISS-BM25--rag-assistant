Which version of jqModal.js do you use? The last official version from http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/ is not compatible with jQuery 1.4.x (see http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jqdnr-dragging-problem-with-jquery-1-4 and http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393/bugs/jqgrid-jquery-1-4/ ). If in your version "$()" exist inside of jqModal.js, it should be replaced with "$(document)". You can also download fixed version as a part of jqGrid package: http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=6 .
