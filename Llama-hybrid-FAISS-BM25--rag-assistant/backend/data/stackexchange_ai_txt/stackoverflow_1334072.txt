most elegant way to return a string from List

What is the most elegant way to return a string from a List ok, yeah, I know I can do something like public string Convert(List something) { var s = new StringBuilder(); foreach(int i in something) s.AppendFormat("{0} ", i); return s.ToString(); } but i m sure there is a way to do this with lambdas I tried also to append to a stringbuilder but that is not doing whats expected
