Sequential recommendation: how to effective encoding output item?

Now I am learning about sequential recommendation - session based recommendation. I have understood that User-item interactions may be viewed as sequential action (first I clicked item A, then click item B, then item C), so based on this sequences, we can predict next items. But how can we encode output items for this sequential network? In basic LSTM/RNN, we can use one-hot encoding and treat output like as classification problem, but in recommendation with huge items, it is insane. So do we have another ways to encoding output items for huge items ? As example, if we have only 100 items, it is fine to create an output vector with 100 elements, but if we have only 1 million items, it is insane to create an output vector with 1 million elements, and thus training with an 1 million elements vector (most of elements is 0) will lead to gradient vanishing.
