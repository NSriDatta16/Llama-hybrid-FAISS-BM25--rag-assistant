Well this is going to be hard to diagnose without a stack trace but I would suggest changing your config to this: MetricFu::Configuration.run do |config| config.metrics = [:rcov] config.graphs = [:rcov] config.rcov = { :test_files => ["spec/**/*_spec.rb"], :rcov_opts => ["--sort coverage", "--no-html", "--text-coverage", "--no-color", "--profile", "--spec-only", "--exclude /gems/,/Library/,spec"]} end So you can isolate the problem. Then run 'rake metrics:all --trace' and if you can't figure it out from there, post the results either here or the metric_fu google group: http://groups.google.com/group/metric_fu You can also try running rcov straight from the command line (which is essentially what metric_fu does). Hope that helps.
