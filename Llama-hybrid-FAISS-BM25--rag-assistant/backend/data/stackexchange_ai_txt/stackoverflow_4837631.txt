Each of your apps can provide a common implementation of an interface like IUnitOfWorkStorage public interface IUnitOfWorkStorage { void StoreUnitOfWork(IUnitOfWork uow); } IUnitOfWork can be a wrapper around the ISession which can look like this public interface IUnitOfWork { void Begin(); void End(); } Begin might open the session and start a transaction, while End would commit the transaction and close the session. So you can have 2 implementations of IUnitOfWorkStorage , one for the WebApp and one for the Windows App. The web app can use HttpContext.Current or something and your windows app can provide just a simple object store that is disposed at the end of your action which would End the UnitOfWork.
