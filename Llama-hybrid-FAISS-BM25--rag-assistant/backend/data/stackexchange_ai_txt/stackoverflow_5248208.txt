If you mean algorithms for "association rule learning", then those are algorithms for automatically discovering interesting relations among variables in large dataset (a typical problem in Machine Learning ). Wikipedia has a good description for this, including a list of algorithms and also links to implementations. Unfortunately I don't know of any specific implementation in c#.
