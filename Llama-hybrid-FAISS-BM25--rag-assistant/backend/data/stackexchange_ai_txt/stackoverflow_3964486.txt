I need this in my Biology class ... using MATLAB!

I'm trying to monitor the average temperature in a fabrication every hour to ensure quality control. How can I write a script that looks at the temperature inside the plant as a function of time, and outputs the times when the temperature drops below 10 degrees Celsius and when the temperature is above 80 degrees Celsius. My script should say when the temperature is out of the boundary and what the temperature is. I wanna Use the following data: Temperature = [-15 -5 5 15 24 33 42 51 59 66 73 79 85 90 78] The first measurement is made at 5am, the last measurement is made at 7pm. I wanna display the time in a 24 hour system instead of a 12 hour system.
