Whether to scale or transform your variables depends largely on the type of model you are using. For example, if you are using linear regression, due to the assumptions of linear regression, you would probably want to transform your variables so that they look as normal as possible (log scaling is sometimes very useful). Sometimes it even involves bucketing your numerical variables to categorical variables in order to make your distribution much smoother. You probably don't need to scale or normalize your variables because the coefficient your are fitting do control that. If you are using random forest regressor, you should be able to handle such data without any processing because the tree building process will bucket and split your variables at the best splitting points according to the decision criteria the algorithm is set to use.
