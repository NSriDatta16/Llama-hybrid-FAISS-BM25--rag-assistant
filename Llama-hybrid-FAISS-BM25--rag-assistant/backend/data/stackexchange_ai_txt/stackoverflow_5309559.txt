Jquery function loops without a loop!

so I have built my own drag and drop shopping cart(very basic) using Jquery UI and Jquery. The function as of now is this - Drag an element on to the "Add items here" and they get appended. A modal window will open allowing you to edit the Item's name. And its when you add two or more items, this problem occurs, the name you set for the current element gets replaced for all the three items that you have added. It seems to me that its kind of looping? Here's the link to the full code. http://jsbin.com/egosi4/2 Any help at this point is much much appreciated. Thank you.
