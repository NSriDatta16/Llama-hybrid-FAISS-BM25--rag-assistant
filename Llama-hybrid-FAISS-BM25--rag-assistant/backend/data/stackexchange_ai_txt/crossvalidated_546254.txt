Validation of Logistic Regression

I don't have a great grasp on logistic regressions, however I am trying to analyse the factors that determine plant naturalisation Dataset can be found here https://filebin.net/yoi8hafn1jj3t2tf The response (naturalised)(nat) is binary and contains three categorical predictors - cold.tolerant, period.introduced, and Number Planted (bin) which has been log transformed in 1-10, 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000, 10000-100000 My final model is M2 With a poor AIC of 614.25 I have determined the probabilities using > exp(coef(M2))/(1+exp(coef(M2))) (Intercept) cold.tolerantyes bin(10,100] bin(100,1e+03] bin(1e+03,1e+04] bin(1e+04,1e+05] 0.001316148 0.724736511 0.793515968 0.831953836 0.955718848 0.975876834 period.introduced2 period.introduced3 0.748293170 0.820253204 These values seem quite high, especially since a small number of plants actually naturalised. Additionally, I am having trouble interepreting it, for example how to I read the prob for period introduced 1, or cold tolerant no if they are incorparated in the intercept These are the raw number of plant naturalised > table(Plants $cold.tolerant, Plants$ nat) 0 1 no 177 3 yes 1161 98 > table(Plants $bin, Plants$ nat) 0 1 (0,10] 334 4 (10,100] 483 19 (100,1e+03] 325 16 (1e+03,1e+04] 171 48 (1e+04,1e+05] 25 14 > table(Plants $period.introduced, Plants$ nat) 0 1 1 294 5 2 224 19 3 820 77 Do the results of the probabilities look realistic? Any additional interpretation would be greatly appreciated, as I am struggling to wrap my head around it. Thanks
