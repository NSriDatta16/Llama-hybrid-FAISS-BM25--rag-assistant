Easy. The tree: (77(1()())()) A leaf is of this form: (integer () ()) Thus the tree has only one leaf: (1 () ()) The sum of the nodes to this leaf is 78. 78 is not 77. Result: no . What you think is a rightmost path, is none according to the definition. The first tree: (-1()()) It is just a single leaf node. One path. The sum is -1. -1 = -1. Result: yes . We can check it with a Lisp program: (defun leaf-p (node) "is the node a leaf?" (and (= (length node) 3) (integerp (first node)) (null (second node)) (null (third node)))) (defun path-sums (tree) "returns a list of all sums for each path" (if (leaf-p tree) (list (first tree)) (mapcar (lambda (s) (+ (first tree) s)) (append (when (second tree) (path-sums (second tree))) (when (third tree) (path-sums (third tree))))))) (defun tree-sum-p (sum tree) (member sum (path-sums tree))) CL-USER 223 > (path-sums '(-1()())) (-1) CL-USER 224 > (path-sums '(77(1()())())) (78)
