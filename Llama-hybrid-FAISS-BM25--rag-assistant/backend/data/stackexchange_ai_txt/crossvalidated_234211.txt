I guess one could say that deep learning is pretty much state-of-the-art in most of the subdomains of computer vision (classification, detection, super-resolution, edge detection,...) except for very specific task like SLAM where deep learning is not yet on par with existing methods. Often to get a few extra percent to win competition networks averaging is used but networks are getting so good that it does not matter that much anymore. In production it is totally different. Big companies are usually relying on old algorithms that have proven to be effective and that the experts in place have knowledge of and years of practice using them. Plus integrating a new algorithm in the supply chain requires a lot of time. I think some cameras companies still use Viola Jones detector for face detection and I know for a fact that SIFT is being heavily used in a lot of applications in industry. They are also still a bit of scepticism towards deep learning methods that are considered dangerous black boxes. But the impressive results of those algorithms are slowy making people change their minds about it. Start-ups are more willing to use such solutions as they have to have innovative solutions to get funded. I would say that in twenty years most of the computer vision based products will use deep learning even if something more effective is discovered in between. To add to Franck's answer deep learning is changing so fast that ResNets of Kaiming He are not State of the art anymore Densely connected Convolutional Networks and Wide and Deep networks with SGD restarting are now SOTA on EDIT CIFAR and SVHN and probably Imagenet too and even this could change in a few days with ILSVRC 2016 results on the 16th of September. If you are interested in more state of the art results on MS-COCO the most challenging detection dataset existing will be released at ECCV in October.
