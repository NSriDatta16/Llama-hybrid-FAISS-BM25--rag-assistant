What are the different Work Items in Team Foundation Server used for?

Please read this entire question before you try to mark this as "too controversial". I am actually setting up my Project Management/Bug Tracking environment with Team Foundation Server for the first time(I have used JIRA,Mantis and some other PM software before). I am fairly knew to using team foundation to anything else besides source control. I am really trying to use the Work Items for what they were intended to be used for. Having said that, I want to make sure that when I am adding new work items, I am classifying them correctly. When I choose to add a work Item, If have the following options to select from: 1)Bug 2)Issue 3)Shared Step 4)Task 5)Test Case 6)User Story Obviously I am aware of what classifies a bug, this is not what is confusing me. What I would really like to know is, what classifies an issue? What technically classifies a Task? What is a user story? etc. I know there may be some opinion in this, but I am really trying to organize the project, and separate all of these correctly.
