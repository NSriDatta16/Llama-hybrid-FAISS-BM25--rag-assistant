Panel data and multinomial logistic regression in R

I have panel data of varying length for some 400+ companies. Each company is identified by a code. date code var1 var2 var3 category 2016-01-01 AAA 1 2 3 2 2016-02-01 AAA 2 3 3 3 2016-01-01 BBB 1 2 3 1 2016-02-01 BBB 2 3 3 3 where the category is 1, 2 or 3 I want to do a regression to see which variables affect the Category. So far I digged it down that I need to use pglm function from the pglm package which is the Panel Estimators for Generalized Linear Models. Information on pglm is quite limited and is basically just examples. Though I wanted to run the model with fixed effects (at the date and company level), it does not seem to allow this ( Why pglm fails for within model? ) So I ran it with "pooling" formula_lm1 Questions: Am I using the correct approach - correct function for my task? Does anyone know if using the index = c('code', 'date') allows to have fixed effects? With my regression, how do I adjust standard errors? Are there any alternative packages/functions to use for my task?
