If you're comfortable making the large-sample assumption, you could use the Mantel-Haenszel test (though from your example data, this doesn't seem to be a good idea). Another option would be the stratified Fisher's exact test , where each of your neighborhoods could be considered a separate stratum. Finally, you could consider a mixed effects logistic regression .
