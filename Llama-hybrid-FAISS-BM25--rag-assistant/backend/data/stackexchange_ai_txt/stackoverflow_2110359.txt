History should never be deleted. Period. However, some people get nervous that 1Gb per day may turn into 1Tb every 3 years. This rarely actually matters, but some people still like to worry about the price of storage. Your time spent designing a data purge can be more expensive than the storage you're attempting to save. [I found 3 DBA's and 2 programmers debating ways to save a few hundred MB's. I said that I would drive them all down to Best Buy and purchase a 500Mb disk drive with the spare change on the floor of my car. The price of 5 consultants merely walking into the room to discuss it had already exceeded the price of the storage they were attempting to "save".] The question of "can we summarize?" is entirely up to the users. Sometimes you can't usefully summarize, so you can't easily delete anything either. Some folks will say that the business cycle is 20 years or something like that, and want details for the first 20 years (on 7Tb) and then summaries for time periods before that.
