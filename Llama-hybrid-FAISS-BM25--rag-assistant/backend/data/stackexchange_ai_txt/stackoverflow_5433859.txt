If you want a single selector, I think you can use $('#control ~ li') . The "~" connector (is "connector" the right word? "operator" maybe?) is like "+", but it selects all following siblings and not just the first one. Sometimes it's nice to be able to do things with a single selector string, because you may want to organize selectors and actions in a data structure. However, it's quite often the case that doing explicit jQuery function calls in a chain (as in @Nick's answer with ".nextAll()") is faster than letting the selection engine parse and evaluate a fancy selector string.
