Just in case anyone comes here looking for this answer, here it is. No goofy 'Attach to Process', no weird bad instructions from websites going off on a million stupid tangents. This answer has been FALKENIZED. When on the same LAN and on the same domain, remote debugging from Visual Studio 2010 works when you do the following steps. on web service host machine, share the web application folder where the web service lives; give yourself 755 permissions. oops, give yourself wrxr permissions. on local development machine, map a network drive to the [web service host machine][web app] folder you just shared. copy the Visual Studio 2010 remote debugger folder (containing msvsmon.exe + support files) to web service host machine. Make sure you get the correct platform for your host server, e.g. x86, x64, etc. Remote debugger is found here: C:\Program Files\Visual Studio 2010\Common7\IDE\Remote Debugger[platform] on web service host machine, drag a shortcut from the newly-copied debugger to the desktop, then start the remote debugger on local development machine, step thru code. when reaching a call to the web service, you'll be prompted to navigate to the location of requested web service code file, which will then be available in your mapped path. Do it. Finally after 1000000 headaches, you may start debugging your web service. CONGRATULATIONS
