Minimizing symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE)

I am working on a forecasting application in which forecast errors are measured using the symmetric mean absolute percentage error : $$ SMAPE = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{t=1}^n{\frac{|F_t - A_t|}{F_t + A_t}} $$ After creating my ML model and applying some Bayesian inference on data I have, I end up with a probability distribution of the possible actual values, i.e. the probability associated with each "guess". If it matters, that distribution is a beta-binomial distribution with a fixed number of trials, which means the possible results range from $0$ to some $N$. Like the mean minimizes the mean squared error and the median minimizes the mean absolute error, what point estimate minimizes SMAPE? Is there any efficient algorithm for calculating it (or a sufficiently good approximation of it)? Thank you in advance for any help!
