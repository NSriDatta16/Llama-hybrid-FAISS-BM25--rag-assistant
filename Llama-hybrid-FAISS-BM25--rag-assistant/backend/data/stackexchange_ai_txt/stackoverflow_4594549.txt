ASP.NET themes and static contents

as you all know, ASP.NET includes each CSS stylesheet in the App_Themes's Theme folder inside the page. No discussion. But now, I'm facing a little problem having lots of CSS files in a theme and willing to use a static content domain . I would like to load all the static content of my website from the static domain (not only CSS, but also icons, images, etc.), but let's now pay attention only to CSS. My question is Is it possible to override the behaviour of Page class, and for each CSS file found in Theme's folder, rewrite the tag with the correct URL of the static content domain? I have nothing preventing me to deploy files into http://static.domain.com/App_Themes/Theme path, so at least adding a prefix to the tag is fine. Thank you in advance.
