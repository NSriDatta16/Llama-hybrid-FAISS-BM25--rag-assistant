when i was a student about 2 years ago. this kind of topics where better understood in the last courses. in order to grasp all this topics i think students must have at least 3 Programming courses (Structure Programming,OOP 1,OOP 2) a software engineering course will be great too and also some DB Background. try to encourage students to start a project from scratch (requirements gathering - Release) there is nothing better than practice-practice-practice
