Keras model.predict get the value for the predicion

I'm new to TensorFlow and keras and I'm trying to learn with an example using this code in google's colab import tensorflow as tf import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split insurance = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/master/insurance.csv") #Create a column transformer ct = make_column_transformer( (MinMaxScaler(),["age","bmi","children"]), (OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"),["sex","smoker","region"]) ) X = insurance.drop("charges",axis=1) y = insurance["charges"] X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2, random_state=42) #Fit the column transformer to our training data ct.fit(X_train) #Transform training and test data with normalization (MinMaxScaler) and OneHotEncode X_train_normal = ct.transform(X_train) X_test_normal = ct.transform(X_test) insurance_model_4=tf.keras.Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.Dense(100), tf.keras.layers.Dense(10), tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) ] ) insurance_model_4.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.mae, optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),metrics=['mae']) insurance_model_4.fit(tf.expand_dims(X_train_normal, axis=-1), y_train, epochs=200) y_preds = insurance_model_4.predict(X_test_normal) X_test_normal.shape #this gives (268, 11) y_preds.shape #this gives (268,11,1) my issue is that I can't figure out how to get the actual values for predictions in y_preds , I was expecting an array with shape (268,1), that is the 268 predictions for each input in X_test_normal.Â¿How can I get the value of the predictions? Thanks.
