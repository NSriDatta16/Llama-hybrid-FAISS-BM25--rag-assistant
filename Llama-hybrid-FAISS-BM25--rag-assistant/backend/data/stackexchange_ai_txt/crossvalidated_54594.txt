I am not sure what rebalance means exactly. One solution to this type of problem is Gary King's rare events logit code for Stata . It's also available for Gauss, and in R though Zelig. He also provided some advice on sampling, which you might find useful. He (and co-authors) write: First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all variable events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). Other options are exact logistic regression ( exlogistic ) and penalized MLE ( firthlogit ). The former is really suitable only if you have small samples with a small number of discrete covariates.
