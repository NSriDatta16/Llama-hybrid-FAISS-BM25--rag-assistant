What you describe is behaviour at the boundary of two classes. There would be legitimate cases where two data points with similar features might have different class labels. The change from one class label to another has to happen somewhere along the feature, if it has anything to do with the class label. Eg: At some point, the car would stop being a 'Budget' car, and start being a 'Luxury' car. Depending on how the dataset was constructed, i.e., labeled by the same person at differnt points in time, or labeled by different people, etc., and if the domain has any data points near the boundary, you can expect the feature intervals of different classes to overlap to some extent. Robust models generally can handle these boundary conditions, and should be "fault-tolerant" so that they don't have unstable or unexpected behaviour due to these cases. For example in SVMs, regularization allows some classification errors to be made, so that a more robust boundary can be drawn between two classes.
