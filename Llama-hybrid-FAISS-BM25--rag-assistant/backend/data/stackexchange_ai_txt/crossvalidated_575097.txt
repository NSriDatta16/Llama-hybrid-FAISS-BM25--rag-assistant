Bayesian statistics: what is the variable we are integrating in?

This is a screenshot from Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman. I am a little bit confused by Equation 1.4 (first and second lines), having read Equation 1.3. In Equation 1.3, the variable of integration is $\theta$ . I understand the example scenario presented of having a set of objects weighed already, $y$ , on some scale with parameters $\theta$ . Now that I have more objects that are yet to be weighed, $\tilde{y}$ , then we want to get $p(\tilde{y}|y)$ . My questions are: Why is the first line: $\displaystyle\int p(\tilde{y},\theta|y)d\theta$ . Why is it a 'joint' probability of $\tilde{y}$ and $\theta$ ? I understand why they are conditioned on $y$ (because these are the observations I have already. So why are they joint on $\tilde{y}$ and $\theta$ ? Can someone please show a more deliberate 'derivation' how to arrive at lines 2 and 3? Since the probability is conditioned on $y$ , why is the variable not $y$ (or the integration be in terms of $dy$ .) Why is it still $d\theta$ ? Thanks for your insights.
