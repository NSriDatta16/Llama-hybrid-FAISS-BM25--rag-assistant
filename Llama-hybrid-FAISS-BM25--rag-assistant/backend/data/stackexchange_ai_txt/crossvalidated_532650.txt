Suppose $Z$ consists of $n$ values. Consider the dual problem: Minimize the standard deviation, given that at most $c$ of the values lie between $8$ and $17$ and the mean is $15.$ Because greater values of $c$ will lead to smaller possible SDs, if the minimum SD for a given value of $c$ exceeds $2,$ then $c$ must be too small. In this fashion we can determine an upper bound for $c.$ As a matter of notation, let $a$ of those values be less than $8$ and $b$ of those values exceed $17.$ Thus, $$n = a + b + c.\tag{1}$$ It is intuitive -- and relatively straightforward to demonstrate mathematically -- that the SD (or, equivalently, the variance) is minimized by (1) moving the $a$ smaller values as close as possible to $8;$ (2) moving the $b$ larger values as close as possible to $17;$ and (3) setting the remaining $c$ values to the average of $15.$ In such a configuration the mean is arbitrarily close to $$15 = 8a + 17b + 15c\tag{2}$$ and the variance exceeds $2^2:$ $$2^2 \lt (8-15)^2a + (17-15)^2b + (15-15)^2 c = 49a + 4b.\tag{3}$$ At the extreme, this will be an equality. Given $n,$ the system of three linear equations $\{(1),(2),(3)\}$ has the unique solution $$(a,b,c) = \frac{n}{63}(4,14,45).$$ Indeed, with $n=63$ and $(a,b,c)=(4,14,45)$ we find the mean is $15$ and the standard deviation is exactly $2.$ It is also clear that if $c$ is any less than $45n/63,$ the standard deviation must exceed $2.$ The solution to the original problem is now apparent. I leave it to you to turn this sketch into a demonstration that meets your standards of rigor.
