Granger causality and non-linear regression

I’m new to Granger Causality concept. I know that the “Granger causality” is a statistical concept of causality that is based on prediction. According to Granger causality, if a time series X "Granger-causes" (or "G-causes") a time series Y, then past values of X should contain information that helps predict Y above and beyond the information contained in past values of Y alone. Suppose we have two time series; X={1,2,3,4.5,5,6,7.2}; and Y={2,4,5,6.5,7.5,9,13}. The following table shows samples of X,Y over time: I would like to estimate the causality (or causality ratio) using non-linear regression model. Can anyone helps me to find if X "Granger-causes" Y using non-linear regression.
