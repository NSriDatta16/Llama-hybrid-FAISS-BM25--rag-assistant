Image upload process usability

this is more of a usability/design approach, rather than "how" question. It is html 5 and web 2.0 age, and I want more than just "select/submit" buttons. My question is regarding blog application: I want to have a nice way to upload and attach images to posts. Right now layout is simple: it has subject and body (for body I have BBCode editor). I can refer to images from the body using [img] tag. If someone has any ideas/links how to organize image attaching to blog posts - please share!
