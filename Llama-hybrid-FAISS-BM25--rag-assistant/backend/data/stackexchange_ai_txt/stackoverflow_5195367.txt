Problem with odd/even child elements in nth-child

I have a web site like this: header --> paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph paragraph and this is CSS: div.section { border: 1px solid black; } div.section div:nth-child(even) { color: Green; } div.section div:nth-child(odd) { color: Red; } And this is the result: This is OK because I get red for odd div and green for even in each section. But when I add header at the begginig of first section (commented code in sample) I get this: I don't want that. I want the to have like before, but just with a header in first section. So at first header and then red paragraph.
