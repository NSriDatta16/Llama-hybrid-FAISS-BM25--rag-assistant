I think one of the reasons abstract classes have largely been abandoned by developers might be a misunderstanding. When the Gang of Four wrote: Program to an interface not an implementation. there was no such thing as a java or C# interface. They were talking about the object-oriented interface concept, that every class has. Erich Gamma mentions it in this interview . I think following all the rules and principles mechanically without thinking leads to a difficult to read, navigate, understand and maintain code-base. Remember: The simplest thing that could possibly work.
