Data analysis: Time series for Bacterial population data

Could anyone please help with data analysis. Briefly, I am studying how the population of a bacteria changes at different points (port 1 to port 10) within a biofilter over the course of 30 days(like a time series) For example, if data looks like below,: Samples:........Day 0............Day 15......Day 30 Port 1...........3.6..............4.5.........5.0 to . Port 10.........2.8...............2.9.........3.2 then how can I figure out whether there is a significant variation between the data sets (or as whole) from day 30 to Day 0? Help will be much appreciated.
