How to tell if the relationship between time series variables changes over time?

Lets start out by saying that I'm a novice with statistics. I'm looking to analyze the relationship between Return on Sales (ROS) and Asset Turnover (TAT) over time to see how they impact firm profitability (Return on Assets (ROA)). I have a few ways to look at this data. First, I can look at the entire economy in the US as one giant company and compute the variables for each year of the time series. What would be the proper test to say that the relationship between these two variables changes over time? A test for cointegration to say that the relationship is non-stationary? Second, I can look at each company on a yearly basis and evaluate the relationship between the two variables in that way. My concern would be that there are massive outliers in the data set so a weighted regression would need to be used. Given that I would have >4,000 samples (distinct companies) for each year is there an appropriate test to look at this data and possibly say something meaningful about the relationship of the two variables? My other thought was possibly using something like the Chow test. If this is too vague let me know and I'll see if I can be more clear! Thanks
