Drag and Drop and single click style. Why did it work TWICE?

my application uses Drag & Drop operations. Everything worked perfect. Recently, some user changed system options: Control Panel --> Folder Options --> Single click to open an item (point to select). And now all my drag & drop operations worked TWICE . How could it be ? What should I change to avoid that type of behaviour ?
