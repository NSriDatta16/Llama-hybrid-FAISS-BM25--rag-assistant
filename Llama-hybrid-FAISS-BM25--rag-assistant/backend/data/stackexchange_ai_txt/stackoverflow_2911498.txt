Incorrect value for sum of two NSIntegers

I'm sure I'm missing something and the answer is very simple, but I can't seem to understand why this is happening. I'm trying to make an average of dates: NSInteger runningSum =0; NSInteger count=0; for (EventoData *event in self.events) { NSDate *dateFromString = [[NSDate alloc] init]; if (event.date != nil) { dateFromString = [dateFormatter dateFromString:event.date]; runningSum += (NSInteger)[dateFromString timeIntervalSince1970]; count += 1; } } if (count>0) { NSLog(@"average is: %@",[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:(NSInteger)((CGFloat)runningAverage/count)]); } Everything seems to work OK, except for runningSum += (NSInteger)[dateFromString timeIntervalSince1970], which gives an incorrect result. If I put a breakpoint when taking the average of two equal dates (2009-10-10, for example, which is a timeInterval of 1255125600), runningSum is -1784716096, instead of the expected 2510251200. I've tried using NSNumber and I get the same result. Can anybody point me in the right direction? Thanks! Antonio
