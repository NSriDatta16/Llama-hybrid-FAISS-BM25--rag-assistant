We build websites at work and we use sikuli http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/sikuli/ to do simple gui testing also unit testing. We leverage the graphical programming aspect of sikuli to do certain gui operations on a certain widget. The macro recording of autohotkey and the graphical programming style of sikuli complement each other purrrfectly. Personally I prefer sikuli because it supports the syntax of python, the coding style is more structured and consistent than the ahk language.
