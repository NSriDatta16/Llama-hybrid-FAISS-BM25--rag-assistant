While it seems that the OP is not interested in this question anymore (and, based on the profile information, in Cross Validated , for that matter), I've decided to add some additional information, which is IMHO relevant and hopefully will be useful for the community. First and foremost, I would like to share an excellent tutorial on deep learning , which contains a whole section dedicated to restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) . This tutorial by LISA Lab team (guided by Youshua Bengio) is available online as well as in several document formats. The RBM section can be found here and in Chapter 9 of the corresponding PDF version of the tutorial . Code samples are presented in Python, with some focus on GPU-enabled Theano deep learning library. Speaking of software , the rbm R package is an example of a few R ecosystem's packages for deep learning: https://github.com/zachmayer/rbm . Extensive collections of references to libraries and other types of software for machine learning, including deep learning and RBM, can be found here , here and here . Finally, returning from talking about software to the subject of literature and resources, this page contains an extensive list of resources on deep learning, in general, and RBM, in particular.
