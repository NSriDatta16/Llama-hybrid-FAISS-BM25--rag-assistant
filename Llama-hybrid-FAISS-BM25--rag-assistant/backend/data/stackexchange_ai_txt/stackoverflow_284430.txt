the formulas you made up for illustration purposes in your question are as good as any others - in other words, you are asking for something that is pointless. the reason is that no formula can account for the truly important variables: your team your customer your environment your standards and best practices all of which will have a much larger drag coefficient than any other terms if you want accurate estimates, ask your developers, and track their accuracy if you truly think that this sort of thing can be reduced to formulas, please resign as a project manager immediately
