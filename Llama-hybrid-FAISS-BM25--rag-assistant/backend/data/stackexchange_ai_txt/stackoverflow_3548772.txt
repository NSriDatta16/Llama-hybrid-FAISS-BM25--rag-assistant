You might be interested in design patterns ( Book , Wikipedia ), which tell you, how to solve common problems using OOP. Many classical design patterns may not be so relevant for JavaScript, since in JavaScript there are other non OOP elements (e.g. functions), which can solve some problems even more elegant. Some simple design patterns I can recommend to start with: Abstract factory: Defer the instantiation of objects. In JavaScript in most cases a function will do the job. Decorator: Transparently add functionality to an object at runtime. Can also be nested. Usage example: Logging Composite: Treat a tree/graph of object like a single object.
