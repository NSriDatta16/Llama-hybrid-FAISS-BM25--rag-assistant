I wrote some time ago a post about embedding subforms and add photos with ajax . More useful information here and here . In this post you will find a different approach. Although ajax for adding subforms it is not exactly what you want, as you say, these posts contain techniques that you can employ to implement your own embedded stuff. So I'd suggest you to read about this, how the bind process work, and take it with patience, because it is a tricky part of symfony, but it pays off!
