Whoa, attack of the 5-paragraph essays! In short, nothing makes it easy. It is hard, and my experience indicates that errors do occur. But: DVCS forces you to deal with merging, which means taking a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the tools that exist to help you out. That alone helps. DVCS encourages you to merge frequently, which helps too. The snippet of hginit that you quoted, claiming that Subversion is unable to do three-way merges and that Mercurial merges by looking at all the changesets in both branches, is simply wrong on both counts.
