For NOT IN, it is always false if the subquery returns a NULL value. The accepted answer to this question elegantly describes why. The NULLability of a column value is independent of the datatype used too: most likely your varchar columns has NULL values Do deal with this, use NOT EXISTS. For non-null values, it works the same as NOT IN so is compatible SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SomeTable S1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROm SomeOtherTable S2 WHERE S1.[MyField] = S2.MyOtherField)
