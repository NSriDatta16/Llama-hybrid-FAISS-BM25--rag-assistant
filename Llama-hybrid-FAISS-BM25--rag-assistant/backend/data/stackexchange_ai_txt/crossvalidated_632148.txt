Multiple predictions using ARIMA

I want to test the prediction capabilities of an sarima model for long sequences. I want to predict the next [24 48 96] datapoints and calculate the mse and rmse. Can you help me find bibliography and any examples? the pseudocode i use: Algorithm: Rolling ARIMA Forecasting Input: Time series data Output: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the forecast Split the input series into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Initialize the ARIMA model on the entire series. Define the size of the training set as 70% of the total series length. Assign the first 'size' elements of the series to the training set. Assign the remaining elements to the testing set. Initialize an empty list for storing predictions. For each time window in the testing set: a. Fit the SARIMA model on the current history (training data). b. Forecast the next prediction_length values using the fitted model. c. Append the forecasted values to the predictions list. d. Update the history with the actual observed values. Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the test set and predictions. Compute the RMSE from the MSE. Return the RMSE. This will run for each size(series)/prediction_length
