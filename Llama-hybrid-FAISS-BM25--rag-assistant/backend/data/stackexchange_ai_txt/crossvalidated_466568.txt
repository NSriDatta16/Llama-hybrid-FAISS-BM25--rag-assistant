How to find the relation between two time series data

I have two time series data and I want to show the relation of them. The plot of two data looks like this: From my point of view, when data2 stops changing, data1 also reduces changing amplitude. Also when data2 resumes sinusoidal movement, data1 resumes sinusoidal movement, plus a spike when it first time resumes. So I think there is some "relation" between this two data. Is there any statistical test or model that can show my observation by my eyes? I've tried correlation and cross-correlation but neither of them gives me good result. data1 is here , data2 is here . I'm not a statistics student and I don't know whether I explain my question clearly, but any help would be appreciated!
