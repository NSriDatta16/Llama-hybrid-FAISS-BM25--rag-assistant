Very interesting question! Any answer would be guess unless you tell what kind of time-series do you have and show us a plot but anyways: Phase-Space Reconstruction is still far better than any other algorithm to deal with delays and recurrence within a time-series If your assumption about delays is correct, then Granger Causality gives you much information about the relation of those delays. Recurrent NN s and TDNN s are also for this problem but don't use them if you need the model. They are just computational black-boxes. Auto-correlation will also talk about "how time-series remember itself" but if you use phase-space embedding you will use them anyways. Hope it helps :)
