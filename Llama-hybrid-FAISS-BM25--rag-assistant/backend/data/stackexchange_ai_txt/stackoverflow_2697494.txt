To answer your question, as you are learning. The problem with your regex not matching with the first lot is partly because the part before the @ does not allow the '.' character. changing to this: String regex = "([\\w.]+)@(\\w+){2,}\\.\\w{2,4}"; should allow gandalf.storm@mymail.com , because the [\\w.]+ says any character in the group '\w' (any character) or '.' (does not need to be escaped when part of a group, actually means a dot) 1 or more times This might give you enough of a help to be able to figure the rest out on your own. after all that is the point of learning :) I tested this at http://www.regexplanet.com/simple/index.html which uses the java library for the engine.
