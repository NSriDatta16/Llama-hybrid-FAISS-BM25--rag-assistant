Can a magento store with 1000 websites and daily automated product updates be made to work by using multiple mysql per website?

The mysql performance of running the magento for this situation under one mysql installation is giving a headache. I wonder if it is feasible to setup an individual mysql for each website so that updates to the catalog can occur concurrently across all websites.
