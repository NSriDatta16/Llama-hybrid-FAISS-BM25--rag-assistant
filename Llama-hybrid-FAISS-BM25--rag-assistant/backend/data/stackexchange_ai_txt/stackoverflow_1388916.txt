Documentation you need to read and understand for this can be found: In the specifications for JSR-172 at http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=172 In the JavaME SDK (with example code) at http://java.sun.com/javame/downloads/index.jsp At the developer support website for your chosen phone manufacturer. i.e. Nokia is at http://www.forum.nokia.com/Tools_Docs_and_Code/Documentation/Java/ (look for Web Services in the Javaâ„¢ ME Developer's Library). Samsung and Sony Ericsson also have decent documentation and code examples. The reference implementation of JSR-172, the version phone manufacturers can simply buy outright from Sun and include in their phone, is pure Java. This means that phone manufacturers usually have little reasons to develop their own version of it themselves. Fragmentation should then be minimal.
