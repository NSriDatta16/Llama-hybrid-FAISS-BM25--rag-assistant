audio power on AudioQueue

I'm now creating an Application using speech recognition.To check the Audio Power coming in through the microphone, I wrote a method as follows. -(void)checkPower(AudioqueRef)queue{ UInt32 expectedSize= sizeof(AudioQueueLevelMeterState); AudioQueueGetProperty(queue, kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter, audioLevels, expectedSize); NSLog(@"average:%f peak:%f",audioLevels.mAveragePower,audioLevels.mPeakPower); } I found that sometimes mAveragePower was larger than mPeakPower, and when mAveragePower was 1.0, in other words, averagePower is regarded as max, mPeakPower was lower than 1.0. I think that generally this result is inpossible. please Let me know if you have any information about sound power on CoreAudio. thanks.
