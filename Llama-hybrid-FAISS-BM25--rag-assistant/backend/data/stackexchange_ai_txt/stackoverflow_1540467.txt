Determining Smartphone / Non-Smartphone for php

It seems like facebook has this mastered, I've checked a bit into WURFL but this seems like an extremely expensive process. I've also checked out: url link. While it has a good list of user agents, I'm trying to identify which are smart phones and which are not. facebook pushes the non-smart phones to a different site than their smart phones. Trying to see if there was an easy way to do this.
