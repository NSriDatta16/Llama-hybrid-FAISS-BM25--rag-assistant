In a comment you say I just need an average so that in the example Company B will rank above Company A when creating a Top 10 or Something like that. So, if that is the goal, you can use the number of reviews to calculate a standard error of the mean (arithmetic mean) of the ratings. Using a normal distribution as an approximation, you can choose the top ten as the ten companies which are most probable to be highest ranked. A practical (and fast) way to implement that could be a simulation. Simulate say 1000 times, and choose the ten companies that most often are in the top ten. It might be better to rank-order the ratings in each simu iteration, and use the average rankings. That way the result does not depend on the number ten. Focus now on two companies with the same high mean but different standard errors (caused by different number of reviews). Now the company with the smallest standard error will have a higher chance to be on the top ten, since for these the downside does most damage. For two companies with the same low mean, the conclusion is the opposite. If you still want a formula, not only simulations, think bayes. Use shrinkage methods, and shrink towards the global mean.
