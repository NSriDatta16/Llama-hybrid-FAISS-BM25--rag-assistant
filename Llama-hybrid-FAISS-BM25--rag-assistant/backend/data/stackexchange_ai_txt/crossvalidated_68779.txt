Overview Linear algebra is the field of mathematics concerned with the study of finite-dimensional vector spaces. Matrices and their manipulation, which form the algorithmic part of linear algebra, are particularly important in statistics. References The following are introductory references: Elementary Linear Algebra with Supplemental Applications by Howard Anton and Chris Rorres. Linear Algebra OpenCourseWare video lectures by Gilbert Strang (MIT). A thread focused on linear algebra references useful for applied statistics is the following: What is a good reference book for the matrix algebra linear algebra used a lot in applied statistics? The following threads from math.se also have lists of references: What is a good book to study linear algebra? (for more rigorous references) Books for numerical linear algebra (for computationally oriented references)
