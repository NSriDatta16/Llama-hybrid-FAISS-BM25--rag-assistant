In LDA, unlike PCA, the maximum number of features after dimensionality reduction is $c - 1$, where $c$ is the number of classes. Since you have 5 classes, the maximum number of features is 4. You can learn the math here . On slide 23, the maximum rank of the between class scatter matrix is $S_B$ is $c-1$. So, the maximum number of eigenvalues/eigenvectors is $c-1$. This is why the maximum number of features is $c-1$.
