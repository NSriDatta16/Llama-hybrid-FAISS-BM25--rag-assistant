A few points that may help you understand what is going on: The XML doc files are built from comments on compiled source code. Javascript is not compiled. The only support that Visual Studio has for xml docs on JS is in the JS code editor window for intellisense and code completion. That's it. AjaxDoc is a rather complex beast that works only on JS that is built using MsAjax and leverages it's typing system. AjaxDoc cannot build xml files for POJO (plain ole' javascript) I would not hold my breath for any response from Betrand. I am currently working on a POJO documentation engine but my job has me busy. You can see an in-browser on-demand doc building prototype in the /docs directory of this download Sorry the news is not better.
