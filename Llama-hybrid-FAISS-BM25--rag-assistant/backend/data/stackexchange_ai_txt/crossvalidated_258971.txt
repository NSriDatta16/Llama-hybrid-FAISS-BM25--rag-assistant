Appropriate to use logarithmic transformation?

I'm a beginner experimenting with machine learning and regression. I have a dataset that looks like the following, where cost is the target (dependent) variable. Since the relationships seem skewed and exponential, is it appropriate to take the log of all of them before applying linear regression, like the following figure? Furthermore, only one of the variables, dose, has zero values, is it appropriate to add 1 only to that variable before I take the log or should 1 be added to all of them? Is there anything else I should check or beware of before applying a logrithmic transformation? Is there anything else in the shape of the data that is strange that I should investigate?
