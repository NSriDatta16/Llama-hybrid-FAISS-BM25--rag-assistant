This is quite a broad question, and so it there may not be a unique answer to the problem. Let me just comment it then. My first reaction (if I was the lead of the project) would be: "Don’t worry about the refresh button". I don’t think anybody reasonably expects the refresh button to preserve any state. That’s why it is called refresh. It has behaved this way since the beginning of the web, and so I don’t think it’s necessary to fight it. Yes, today it’s maybe unfortunate that it is still here and that it behaves like it does, and I’m sure it would not be here if the web was re-invented today. But if you really for some reason need to preserve the state, I think what you are doing it’s a good solution. In case you are addressing modern browsers (IE8+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3+ etc.), I would also maybe recommend to consider the DOM storage . It would be perhaps more elegant – no server session required. Here is another (random) comment. How serious is it when the user loses the state if she hits the refresh button? What if you hook on the window.onunload event and warn the user that there she may potentially lose some data? Would it be enough?
