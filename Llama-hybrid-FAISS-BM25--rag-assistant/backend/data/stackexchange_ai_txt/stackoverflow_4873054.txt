In your situation I would recommend the second option that Albert Gareev suggested. Just create a class in another .qfl lib and make an accessor to it: private autoInitiatorTerminator : Set autoInitiatorTerminator = new cls_autoInitiatorTerminator class cls_autoInitiatorTerminator private sub class_initialize ' put here your initiation code end sub private sub class_terminate ' put here your termination code end sub end class Add-And-Forget(tm): Add the library as resource to your tests and you can just forget about it.
