Never use Serializable across architectures. You have no way of knowing if the Dalvik VM will have compatible serialization to your server's Java version. Even if it works today, it might not with upgrades on either end. Always choose something that is designed specifically to work across architectures. Options include: Protocol Buffers Apache Thrift (the payload packaging, not necessarily the RPC stuff) XML (you neglected to mention what parser you used -- if you used DOM, try SAX) JSON (reportedly the Jackson JSON parser is faster than the org.json parser built into Android) Also, loading 300K of data on app startup is a prescription for trouble. Please consider leveraging SQLite to allow you to work with just the bits of data you need at a time.
