Where to put certain logic in CakePHP

I've recently started to rewrite a project I did a few years ago using CakePHP. I'm trying to do everything 'right' this time, so maybe someone get give me a a pointer on doing to the following: I'm showing a simple table from a table using Model->find('all') in the View. There are two boolean fields in this table, that together make up something I need to show to a user. So: 0x0 = 'A', 1x0 = 'B', 0x1 = 'C', 1x1 = 'D'. Where should I put this logic? I've been thinking about the following methods: The view A View helper The controller Something in the Model so that Model->find('all') outputs this value (is that even possible?) This task might seem trivial, but I think it might learn me getting this project organized and maintainable from the start. Thanks!
