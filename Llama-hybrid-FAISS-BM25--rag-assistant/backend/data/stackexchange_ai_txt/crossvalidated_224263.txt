So there are two basic empirical models: theory testing and theory building. In the case of theory testing, the a priori theory will dictate whether the intermediary variable is a mediator or a moderator. To the extent that your professor is encouraging you to "play around, it seems to me that you are engaged in theory building. In that case, there is no prior yardstick as to whether the intermediary is a mediator or a moderator. Now mediators and moderators are two completely different types of intermediaries. A relationship between an IV and DV will NOT exist without the mediator. A relationship between an IV and DV will exist in the presence of a moderator.
