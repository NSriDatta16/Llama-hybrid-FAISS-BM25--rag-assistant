Progress bars for tasks that can take an indeterminate ammount of time?

Another random question that hit me (I've drank ~9 cups of coffee in the last 5 hours, so sorry...) -- What kind of progress bar would you show a user for a taks that you do don't know how long it would take, but you have a good idea of an "average" time. For example, a task that would usually take around 30 seconds, but you have no way of knowing the progress (other than if its still going on or just failed). What would be the best UX?: A progress bar that starts out fast and slows down (maybe with progress being a 1/x style asymptotic curve) that hits 50% around the average task time (the eclipse style guide suggests this). A progress bar that progresses, slowly, at a constant rate and maybe hits the "average time" at 15% or something (IE/Firefox do this when initially looking up a domain) An indeterminate squiggly bar (macs have this all over the place, newer windows versions have it, too) that just shows some sort of motion without suggesting any progress, a spinner, or some animation that just notifies the user that something is going on. Would the answer differ if the average time was 10 minutes instead of 30 seconds? Thanks, Robert EDIT: Just to be clear, the question is about progress bars where you have NO idea/indication of how long it will take (for example, executing a task on a remote machine). If you do have some indication of progress, it's often good to use that.
