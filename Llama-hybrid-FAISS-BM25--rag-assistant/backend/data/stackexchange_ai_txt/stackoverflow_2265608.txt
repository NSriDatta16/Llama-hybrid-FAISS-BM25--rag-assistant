Android Plugin in Eclipse 3.5 / 3.6 on Ubuntu 64bit got problems with properties

I got a huge problem with the Android Development Tools ADT running in Eclipse Galileo (3.5.1) on Ubuntu 9.10, 64bit. [Edit: as well on Ubuntu 10.10 and Eclipse Helios up to the latest 3.6.2!] On this platform, I do not manage to see any property edit dialogs for layout properties. E.g. the one where you can select a string resource ID for text fields, or a drawable ID for image fields or backgrounds. Whenever I click on the ... button next to the property value - nothing happens, except this button disappears. Properties with a list of possible values, e.g. "wrap_content" or "fill_parent" are displayed in a dropdown box directly in the properties field. On a different system I work in a Windows environment with Eclipse 3.4 and the same ADT: no problems whatsoever, everything works fine, the dialogs come perfectly. Does anyone know what to do here? Where's the problem? Why does Eclipse not tell me that something goes wrong? Thanks! NEW DISCOVERIES: I found out that it might not even be an Android problem, but a general Eclipse problem that I can see with all version (Ganymede, Galileo, Helios) on my Linux (Ubuntu) system. It must be a simple UI problem: the button with ... next to the values does not receive the mouse click!! I managed to see the appropriate dialogs to edit the property values by doubleclicking the button - crazy, strange, ugly behavior! But why on earth does nobody else know about this problem - I cannot find anything else on the net about it! Could it be related to this strange "GDK native window problem" on Gnome? HELP!
