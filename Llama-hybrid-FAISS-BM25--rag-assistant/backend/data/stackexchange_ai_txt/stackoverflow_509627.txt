RE @mipadi: ZeroLink was removed in Xcode 3.1 and does not exist for the iPhone SDK. The correct answer is Louis'; the iPhone does not support dynamically-loaded frameworks in developer-created applications. Xcode does have a good user interface for static libraries; just drag them into the project and they're added to the link phase. No need to fuss with linker flags. The problem comes when you need to use the headers supplied with those static libs (then you need to add the header search paths manually) or when a static lib conflicts with an available dylib (that's when you have to add the -l flag manually).
