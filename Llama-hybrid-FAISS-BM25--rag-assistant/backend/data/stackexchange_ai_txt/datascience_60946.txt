Predict correct answer among ten answers for a given question

I have a case study to solve where I am given a dataset of questions and its answers, there are ten answers for a particular question. It's a classification problem where correct answer is having class_label = 1 and all other nine answers having class_label = 0 . Which deep learning model would fit best for this type of case study and how should I proceed?
