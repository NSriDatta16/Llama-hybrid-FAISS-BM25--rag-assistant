If you are working with tests and code coverage tools allready, you should look into maven. Especialy if you start to work with a project team. Running tests in eclipse is fine as long as you are the only developer. Using maven will enable you to use continuous intregration tools like continuum It might seem you have to invest more time in setting up maven correectly, but it wil ldefinetly pay of fin the long run. We use continuum here, and we have never seen any problems with compilation errors, as soon as the system was setup corectly.
