In 30+ years of consulting, almost none of my clients have scored more than 1 or 2 on the Joel Test. A few scored in the high 8's, but those were the exception, not the rule. " Is it justified to turn down a consulting job on the basis of potentially low Joel Test score in some situations? " You can turn down anything you want for whatever reason you want. No one cares about the justification. Seriously. You're opinion doesn't count for anything. Clients who are desperate for staff will not care why you turned them down. Your rejection will not lead to sudden moral crisis where they rethink their mistakes. Your opinion of their development practices doesn't matter at all. Your reason for turning them down doesn't matter. You don't need to "justify" anything. Indeed, they'll usually laugh if you explain why you turned them down. They know that what they are doing is the level best under their circumstances. They absolutely know that they cannot -- for example -- use source code control because they don't have the time or budget or server space or some other ridiculous excuse. You can point it out all you want. They generally won't care. They can't care, since they know what they're doing is already ideal under their unique circumstances. " Also, how could a low Joel Test score be remedied? " It can't be. A culture that performs poorly, will continue to perform poorly until significant changes to the culture and reward structure are made. One way to effect change is to work and make the case from inside the organization that things could be better. If you're successful, some folks may seek to emulate what you're doing that's successful. Turning them down does not demonstrate successful software development practices. " Is on-the-go version control feasible? " Yes. I have a laptop I bring on every job. "Would that be accepted everywhere?" Mostly. A few locations get nervous about consultants bringing in "outside" devices. They also complain that video and sound recording devices are strictly forbidden, yet iPhones are allowed. So, if they want to create trouble for you, they can. Some places won't let you build code on your laptop. Some will let you.
