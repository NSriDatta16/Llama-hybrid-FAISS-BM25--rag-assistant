Alternative names for items in logistic regression

I am reading Applied Logistic Regression by Hosmer and Lemeshow. In chapter 1, they defined $D$ as $-2\ln(\text{likelihood ratio})$, which $D$ is also known as the deviance , and $G$ as $$D(\text{model without the variable}) - D(\text{model with the variable}).$$ I wonder if $G$ also has an alternative name. Thanks.
