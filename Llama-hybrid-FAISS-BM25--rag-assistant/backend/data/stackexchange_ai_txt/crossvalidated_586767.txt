The rule of 10 events for logistic regression

I want to assess whether the rule of 10 events is in my logistic regression model. My sample is small and I have overfitted my model which goes against the rule. However, I would like to present this graphically plotting the number of events per variable versus the estimate (OR) How can I come up with this plot?
