All possible return values of a function must be of the same type. So your case does not work since in one branch you are returning a String and in the other branch you are returning a function. This would work: let isParentRoot parVal = match parVal with | "0" -> (fun _ -> "0") | x -> (fun _ -> "something") If you really want your case to work you could upcast both return values to Object.
