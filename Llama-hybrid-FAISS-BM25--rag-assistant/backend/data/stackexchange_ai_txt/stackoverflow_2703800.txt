Magento has a lot of history at this point, so it's a good idea to not always trust that method names will do what "seems obvious". Obvious now wasn't obvious a few years ago. If you look at the following two methods on the Mage_Catalog_Model_Product class public function isInStock() { return $this->getStatus() == Mage_Catalog_Model_Product_Status::STATUS_ENABLED; } public function getStatus() { return $this->_getData('status'); } You can see that isInStock checks the status attribute, set in the "General" section of the Product admin. Try this instead $stockItem = $product->getStockItem(); if($stockItem->getIsInStock()) { //in stock! } else { //not in stock! }
