I think you are missing some points about the 'experts' you talk about : They have been around a long time, they already make a lot of money out of it, and they want to stay it that way They already use advanced techniques for that (quantitative finance), and always try the new things like ML They are at the top of their academic field / employ people that are the top of their academic field They have all the hardware / software they want for doing so Yes, you can use some ML techniques to predict the stock market, but those experts you seems to dismiss are way ahead, see this Quant SE questions from 2011 : https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/111/how-can-i-go-about-applying-machine-learning-algorithms-to-stock-markets Actually, applications of ML in finance know a recent boom because those experts start going public with their methods, see Advances in Financial Machine Learning , and its companion implementation MLfinLab )
