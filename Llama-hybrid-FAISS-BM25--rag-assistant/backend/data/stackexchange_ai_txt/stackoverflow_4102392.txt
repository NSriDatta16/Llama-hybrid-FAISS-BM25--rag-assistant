As of iOS 4.0, full-screen anti-aliasing is directly supported via an Apple extension to OpenGL. The basic concept is similar to what you are already doing: render the scene onto a larger framebuffer, then copy that down to a screen-sized framebuffer, then copy that buffer to the screen. The difference is, instead of creating a texture and rendering it onto a quad, the copy/sample operation is performed by a single function call (specifically, glResolveMultisampleFramebufferAPPLE() ). For details on how to set up the buffers and modify your drawing code, you can read a tutorial on the Gando Games blog which is written for OpenGL ES 1.1; there is also a note on Apple's Developer Forums explaining the same thing. Thanks to Bersaelor for pointing this out in another SO question .
