How to make resizeable box go from left to bottom as well as right to top

Ok, so I am working on building my own catalogue of some sort. I am working on making a selecting tool to choose a part of the image to see up close. This is where I am currently working on it Anyway, I am missing something in my logic as far as how to make the box resize when I drag from the bottom right corner to the top left. I know it isn't working because of how the box is positioned. Positioning works by using the top left corner as a reference point. So I had two solutions I was working on but I couldn't get very far with them. The first was trying to figure out a way to position the box based on the bottom right corner. The other method I was playing with was perhaps offsetting the box position by the height/width and perhaps this would have the effect of having a bottom right position. This is a quick link to my JS So, any help with working through this problem would be appreciated. Thanks, Levi
