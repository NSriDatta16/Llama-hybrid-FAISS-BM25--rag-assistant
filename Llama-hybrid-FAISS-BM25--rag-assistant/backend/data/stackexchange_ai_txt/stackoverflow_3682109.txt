Second UIScrollView responding when using a UIScrollView

This is more of a check as I believe this is right but its a lot of work if I'm wrong. I want to basically achieve fixed positioning with a scrollView. I want to have a list along the top that is always visible, scrolls horizontal only and then a scrollview beneath that to move around the information which scrolls both vertically and horizontally. I figure I need to subclass UIScrollView and overwrite touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchesEnded to send the touch to both UIScrollViews. Is this right or off track? Cheers
