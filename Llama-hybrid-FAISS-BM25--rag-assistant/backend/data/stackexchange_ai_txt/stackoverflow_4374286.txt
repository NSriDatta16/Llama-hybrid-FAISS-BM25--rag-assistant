In the post on my blog which Jonathan linked to in his answer I described my setup which doesn't do any commits during the build process. Instead of increasing the build number during the build I just use the revision number from Subversion. I prefer it this way because based on the build number I can easily retrieve the sources that where used to make the build. Ths works great in my case where all the builds are done on CruiseControl.NET. Building setups manually is more tricky in this case because the files in Subversion don't have the correct build number. You could circumvent this problem by using the already modified files from CruiseControl.NET build and use them to build your setup. Or you could just build the setup continuously as well. If this doesn't work for you, you should take the Filtered Source Control Block path suggested by DilbertDave. Just put your AssemblyInfo.cs file (or any other files you modify in the build process) in the exclusionFilters to get rid of the build loop.
