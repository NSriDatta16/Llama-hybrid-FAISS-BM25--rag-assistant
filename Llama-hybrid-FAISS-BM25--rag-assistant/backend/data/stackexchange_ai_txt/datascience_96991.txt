From what was described, I would not use machine learning for this task. Just statistics. Take a look at the binomial distribution . Not knowing all of your data, I cannot solve the problem for you, but that is what your mentor is asking you do to. My guess is the data shows biased coins. This type of problem is classification not regression. Simple linear regression would not be the algorithm to use.
