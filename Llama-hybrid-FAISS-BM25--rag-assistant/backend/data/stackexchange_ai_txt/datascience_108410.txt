Online learning is defined as a method of machine learning in which data becomes available in a sequential order and is used to update the best predictor for future data at each step, as opposed to batch learning techniques which generate the best predictor by learning on the entire training data set at once , so the time component is important and is the thing which distinguishes between online and offline learning. So I would say "No", most deep learning models are probably not online, but they do use batches when learning, which is a different thing, since the batches are random samples from the data irrelevant of time of data acquisition.
