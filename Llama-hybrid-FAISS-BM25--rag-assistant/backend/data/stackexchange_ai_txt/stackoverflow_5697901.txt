Magento - rearrange welcome message, searchbox and catalog nav using local.xml

i'm trying to achieve a layout wherein the default welcome message sits on top of the search box followed by the catalog nav similar to what they have here . i was hoping to do this through the local.xml file. so far i have this: css/local.css topSearch top.search catalog.topnav 1 i was able to unset the searchbox but i couldn't make it insert before the catalog nav - nothing happens. i also tried inserting it this way top.search catalog.topnav 1 but it still doesn't work. what could i be doing wrong here? i'm getting really confused here, is this kind of approach okay to do? i checked the header.phtml and saw that i only have to switch the lines for the default welcome message and searchbox and i'm done! but i guess this would mean that i would have to make a copy of the header.phtml to my own theme. would this be a better approach? thanks!
