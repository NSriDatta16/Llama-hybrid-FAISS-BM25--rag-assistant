preparing time series data for building a rnn

I am preparing time series data for to build an RNN model (LSTM). The data is collected from sensors installed in a mechanical plant. Consider I have data for input and output temperature of a compressor along with the time stamps. Like this there is data for around 20 parameters recorded along with their time stamps. Problem is there is differnece in the time stamps at which data is collected. So how do I ideally match the time stamps to create a single dataframe with all the parameters and a single time stamp
