First and most importantly, do NOT attempt to apply OLS techniques to summarize time series data. OLS techniques were developed for and are the tool to use if the data is cross-sectional. In the distant past and absent time series techniques, OLS was adopted to summarize time series. We have 1000s of articles and 100s of textbooks written in an attempt to fix the failures resulting from the mis-application of OLS. The first step in time series modeling is to insure the series is or are stationary.
