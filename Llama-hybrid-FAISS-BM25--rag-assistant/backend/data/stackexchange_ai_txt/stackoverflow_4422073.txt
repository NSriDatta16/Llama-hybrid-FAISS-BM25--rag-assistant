Since you have tagged the question with asp.net, I believe storing/retrieving/validating a cookie would not be the problem for you. Otherwise too, If you need help working with cookies in asp.net.....the net is full of those how to's. One to save your strokes : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178194.aspx So if data like passwords, User details, etc is not what your " token " refers to, then all you need is to pass the token as a sort of query string. This can be done using flashvars. Visit the link for a good little tute up. http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/flashVars/index.html Edit I was merely pointing out that asp does it way elegantly. Use the token , read from the LSO to remember the user. var token:SharedObject; token = SharedObject.getLocal("UserToken"); if (token.data.value==undefined) token.data.value = ?; // Pass the User token here while writing else ? = token.data.value; // Use the values while reading If you wish to work with a Local shared object example, follow this: http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2008/12/28/understanding-as3-shared-objects/ But please do remember storing things without users knowledge is not advisable. So do take pains to let the user know that he will be remembered by the website. Something like remember me checkbox?
