Dependent Variable takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3 - What is the right (logistic) regression model to use?

I am looking for help to analyze the data from my online experiment. For my master thesis I conducted an online experiment where participants had to conduct a shopping task where they were provided with a local and a non-local product three times in a row. So for three times, they had to choose between either the local or the non-local product. The result of the shopping task is my dependent variable "Green Shopping Behavior" . Every time someone chose the local product, they got a "1" and if they chose the non-local product they got a "0" . In the end i added everything up , so for each observation the dependent variable can take the values 0, 1, 2 and 3 . So from my understanding i have a metrically scaled variable that can be considered count data. I have two metric/continuous independent variables I want to use to predict if participants chose 0/1/2/3 local products, as well as control variables. Since the structure of my dependent variable is not fitted for a linear regression I looked into other regression models and landed on different logistic models but am heavily confused about what the right approach is. I understand that a classic logistic regression is not suitable , because my dependent variable ist not binary, I further looked into multinomial and ordered logistic regression analysis from which I think that the ordered regression is most suitable given the structure of my dependent variable. Could you give me some insights into what is the right analysis, if i am on the right track or if i am heavily mistaken and if you would propose a completely different strategy? Your help is highly appreciated! edit: I use STATA
