Efficient C code for Hardware realization in Verilog

I have a plain C code for a Image codec.My goal is to develop a efficient C model which will be taken and realized in Hardware using Verilog or some such Hardware description language. What i am trying to find out is: 1.) What modifications need to be done in exisitng C code structures to make it hardware efficient 2.)Do data structures need to be modified. Are there any constrains related to arrays/buffers(Like they should be declared with storage class register. 3.) I heard that a H/w model should not have if conditions or as minimal as possible. What is that about? (Consider a generic Hardware realization using some FPGA, Verilog w/o much details about bus, clock etc..) -AD
