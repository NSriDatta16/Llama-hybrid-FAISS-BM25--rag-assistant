How to test that a discrete time series has markovian properties? How to use the Wilcoxon test to do so?

Let us assume I have a time series made of the following observations: ts = c(163,18,53,189, 243, 101, 150, 39, 60,96,36,76,71,67,56,3,72,96,15,19) How can I use the Wilcoxon test to determine if it respects Markov properties? The actual data I am dealing with is made of about 500K observations. I have divided it into 5 chunks, then I have used the Wilcoxon--Mann--Whitney test to verify that the distribution of the whole series (500K obs) has the same distribution of its sub-series (the 5 chunks). Does it make sense? The reason for asking this specific question is given by the test's popularity in the literature. See for example this paper . Thanks
