The parsing time of SQLite isn't really that much (you can amortize it over many queries) unless you're substituting the values into the SQL query by hand. Substituting by hand is hard work, awkward, slow and probably unsafe too. Instead, you should be using bound parameters so that you can do things more directly (see http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html for the relevant API). Note that if you switch to a different database, you will have the same issue; you only get high speed out of any SQL system by using bound parameters. (And consider not sweating over performance too much; the bits where it hits storage are the bottleneckâ€¦)
