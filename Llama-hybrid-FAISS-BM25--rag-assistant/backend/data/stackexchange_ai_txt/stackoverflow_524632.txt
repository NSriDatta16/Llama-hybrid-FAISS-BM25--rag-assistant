Fidelis Assis and I have been adapting the spam filter OSBF-Lua so that it can easily be adapted to other applications including web applications. This spam filter won the TREC spam contest three years running. (I don't mind bragging because the algorithm is Fidelis's, not mine.) If you want to try things out, we have "nearly beta" code at git clone http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/osbf-lua-temp We are still a long way from having a tidy release, but the code should build provided you install automake 1.9. Either of us would be happy to advise you on how to use it to clean your database and to integrate it into your application.
