asp.net application performance and stress testing ? Please guide

thanks for your attention and time. I want to test asp.net application for stress, load and performance. Please guide me what free tools should be used for this ? Is there any tool which particularly can be used to analyse individual components, functions and scripts and resources they use ? Thanks in anticipation for your help
