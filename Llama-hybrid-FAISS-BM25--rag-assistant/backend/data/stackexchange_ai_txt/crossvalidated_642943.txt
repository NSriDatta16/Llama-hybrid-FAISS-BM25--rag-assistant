You say "I want to identify the coefficients for all levels of these categorical variables", but actually you already did! As you probably know (or have read in the links Kjetil b halvorsen mentioned) the coefficients of the non-base categories show the differences with the base category. So, if a categorical has 4 levels, only three "differences" from the base category are shown. However, at the same time these three differences give you the differences from the base to the three other categories! So, what would you like to know more about the base category then? Actually, more information is shown about the base category than about the other (non-base) categories, for which only the difference with the base is shown! With the default dummy variable, coded as 0 or 1, differences with the base are shown, or: the non-base categories are "contrasted" with the base category. Another interesting possibility is to show (for each category of X) the difference from the average outcome in your sample. In that case, the sample mean or average of your dependent variable serves as the reference point, instead of one particular category! Example, suppose you have only two categories, 6 males and 4 females. The males have mean Y (dependent) value 10 and the females have mean 15. The total sample average would then be 12. For males, the regression effect would then be -2 as their mean lies 2 points below average, and for females the regression effect would be +3, as their means is 3 points higher than average. The intercept of the regression equation would be the sample average! This way of contrasting categories with the sample mean is another way of studying/describing influences of the different categories on the outcome variable. It is e.g. applied in package "wec" (weighted effect coding) in R. Also described here
