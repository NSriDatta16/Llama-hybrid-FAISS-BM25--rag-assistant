This sample size calculator seems to assume you're trying to determine the proportion of units in your population has a particular characteristic. $p$ represents the proportion in the population that has the characteristic you're studying. The calculator probably assumes $p=0.5$ since this gives the most conservative (largest) sample size. The variance of a Bernoulli random variable is used because each unit in the population is either has the characteristic you're studying or doesn't. If you're not just calculating proportions - for example if you're trying to estimate average height, then you replace the $p(1-p)$ with an estimate of the variance of the characteristic you're collecting (e.g. do some initial research to estimate the variance of heights in your population). That result is saying that if you repeated the survey many times, then 95% of the time, the proportion of units in your survey that have that particular characteristic will be within about 3% of the true proportion in the population.
