R only alternatives to BUGS

I am following a course on Bayesian statistics using BUGS and R. Now, I already know BUGS, it's great but I am not really fond of using a separate program rather than just R. I have read that there are a lot of new Bayesian packages in R. Is there a list or reference on which packages there are for Bayesian statistics and what these do? And, is there an R package alternative for the flexibility of BUGS?
