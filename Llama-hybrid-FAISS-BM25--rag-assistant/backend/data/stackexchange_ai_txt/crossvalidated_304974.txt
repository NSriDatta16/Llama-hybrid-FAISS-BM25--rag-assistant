Information content of a numerical dataset

Please consider a dataset $n \times m$, composed exclusively of continuous values, and where $n \gg m$. We wanted to use this dataset in a machine learning setting, as a training set. To add instances to this dataset has an associated cost, hence, we are looking for the smallest possible set of instances. I was wondering if there is a measure which tells us whether the benefits of adding another instance does not justify its cost. (i.e., something similar to an asymptotic saturation curve).
