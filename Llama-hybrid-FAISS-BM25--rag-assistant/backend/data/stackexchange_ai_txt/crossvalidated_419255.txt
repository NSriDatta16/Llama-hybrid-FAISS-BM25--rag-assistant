conditional independence mixed linear models

I'm analyzing an experiment using linear mixed models but am not sure whether my model is appropriate or whether I'm violating the assumption of conditional independence. I've asked a statistician at my department and he wasn't sure either. The problem can be understood with this example: There is a puppy sitting in the middle of a room and I'm feeding it 7 different types of food. The variable I'm interested in is how the loudness of its barking changes from before to after getting the food. In other words, I want to know how the nominal variable "type of food" affects the continuous variable "difference in loudness". Crucially, I am measuring this loudness difference with 16 different microphones located at different points in the room and I am measuring several technical replicates (e.g. I'm averaging across 100 barks before feeding and 100 barks after feeding for each experiment). I'm repeating this experiment multiple times, each time with a different puppy and a different set of microphones (not always located exactly at the same place). To summarise, after averaging across technical replicates my data is structured like this: deltaLoudness = nPuppies x nTypesOfFood x nMicrophones My question is whether I can treat each microphone as a conditionally independent observation. I.e. can I ask: deltaLoudness ~ 1+ food + (1|puppy) My thinking is the following: 1) The measurements from the microphones are clearly not independent, however, they are also not identical and may get different levels of environmental noise (say my experimental chamber has a busy street on one side and a lunch area on the other side) 2)As I gather from here ( https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/352884 ), technical replicates are fine to be included. But I'm not sure I would consider this a technical replication. 3) I could rearrange the data to include true technical replicates. This would, however, force me to become mainly interested in an interaction term. I.e. loudness ~ 1+ beforeAfter + food +beforeAfter*food + (1|puppy) + (1|puppy:microphone)
