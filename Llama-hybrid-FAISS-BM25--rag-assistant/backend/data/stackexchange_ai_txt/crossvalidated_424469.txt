Both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches are likelihood-based approaches in this case. And likelihood-based approaches give you valid results under both the missing completely at random and missing at random missing data mechanisms. This is under the proviso that the model is correctly/flexibly specified. This includes also the variance-covariance structure for the repeated measurements. That is, you should model the correlations in the repeated measurements adequately. In both approaches you can/should work with all available data. You should not do a complete cases analysis (i.e., only consider the 15 subjects who provide all measurements) because this will be less efficient and also be valid only under missing completely at random.
