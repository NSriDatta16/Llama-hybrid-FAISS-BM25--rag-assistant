Score/validate a regression Neural Network

I wonder what is the best statistical method to validate/score/evaluate a regression Neural Network used to predict probabilities (an example would be using a Regression NN to predict the probability of raining tomorrow or not - this is just an example). The R Caret package uses RMSE and $R^2$ by default. However, is there a better way?
