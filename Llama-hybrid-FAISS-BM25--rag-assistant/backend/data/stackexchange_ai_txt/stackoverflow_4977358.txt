It depends on the expected rate of positive feedback and the number of the people that vote on average. If, like in the example you give, you are going to have sometimes 5 and 10 people voting and other times a 1000, then I would suggest the Wilson midpoint: (x+z^2/2)/(n+z^2) The midpoint of the Adjusted Wald Interval / Wilson Score where: n = Sum(all_votes), x = Sum(positive_votes) / n, z = 1.96 (fixed value)
