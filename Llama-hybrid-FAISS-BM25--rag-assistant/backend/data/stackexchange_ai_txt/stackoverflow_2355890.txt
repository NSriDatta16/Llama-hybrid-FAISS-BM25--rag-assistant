JavaScript charting library for advanced charting

Background to Question: Software for analysing blood glucose readings for diabetics, typically have something called a "daily modal" chart. This chart type is a line chart showing times of day on the X-axis, blood glucose readings on the Y-axis, and it displays this for a specified date range. So for example, I can see a chart of my daughter's readings over, say, the last week - with each day's readings superimposed on the single chart (this is the key -- superimposing each day's blood glucose readings on the same time-of-day based chart). It's the best way to see trends by time of day. If there is, in addition, a trend line showing the averages by time of day over the given time period, even better. The Question: Does anyone know of a JavaScript charting library that would allow me to build such a chart? I'm wondering if Flot does, or the Google visualization API for example? Thanks in advance
