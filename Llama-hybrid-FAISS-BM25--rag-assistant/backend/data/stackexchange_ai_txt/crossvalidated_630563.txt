How is forecasting values for stationary time series even possible?

Forecasting future values for a time series using Holt-Winter's model makes a lot of sense: by identifying a trend and some seasonal patterns which are likely to repeat in the future one can make predictions for future values. However, many models including the ARMA model expect the time series to be stationary meaning it has a constant mean (i.e. no trend), constant standard deviation and no seasonality. How is predicting future values of such a time series even possible? The autoregressive model is a linear model which uses past values to predict future observations. I see it working with a time series with a linear trend (e.g. next value is 1.2 times the last value) or with changing standard deviation (e.g. next value is -1.2 times the last value). But if both the mean and standard deviation must remain constant, how can a linear model work here? The same question goes also for any other model operating on stationary series.
