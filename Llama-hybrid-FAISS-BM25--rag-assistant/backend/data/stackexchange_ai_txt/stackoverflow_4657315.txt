I reply to your comment here, it's less messy... Maybe it's displaying the commands in the same order they were added (not using priorities). I would delete all commands when Edit_Cell is added and add them all again, after Edit_Cell is added. If you can only modify your form's code, then you can override the addCommand method to ensure when Edit_Cell is added all previous commands are removed and added again later. Something like this: @Override public void addCommand(Command cmd) { if (cmd.getLabel().equals("Edit_Cell")){ removeCommand(sample1); // with all the previously added commands } super.addCommand(cmd); if (cmd.getLabel().equals("Edit_Cell")){ addCommand(sample1); // again with all your previously added commands } } It's not very elegant, but well, you can always make it more classy, as long as it works....
