This behavior is "By Design." When embedding a string expression inside an XML literal the value will be escaped to be a legal string value. To get the behavior you are looking for you'll need to be embedding an XElement/XNode within an XML literal. Take the following example. It will correctly keep the tag as an XElement. Dim text2 = Line Line Dim markup2 = .ToString One way to achieve this is to fake an XElement. To make the text a valid string, simply wrap it on both ends with a normal tag, for example. This is now a parsable XML fragment. Once you have an XElement, it's easy to get the embedded behavior you are looking for Dim text = "Line1 Line2" Dim text2 = XElement.Parse(" " + text + " ") Dim markup = .ToString
