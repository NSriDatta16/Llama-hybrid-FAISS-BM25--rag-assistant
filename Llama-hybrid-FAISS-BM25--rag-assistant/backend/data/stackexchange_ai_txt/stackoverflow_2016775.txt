The only figure worth worrying about is "Logical Reads". Physical Reads will depend on how much data is currently cached, which could change every time the query is run. Scan count is sometimes telling , but isn't really worth focusing on. Edit: See some more discussion of these results in this post here. What I meant by "telling" is that the scan count can sometimes be a "flag" indicating that SQL is retrieving data from that table inefficiently. But when it comes to trying different versions of your query while you optimize, I pay much more attention to the improvement I can make in Logical Reads.
