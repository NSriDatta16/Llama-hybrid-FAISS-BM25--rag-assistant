The linear regression models an output variable $y$ as $$ y \sim N(\mu=\beta x, \sigma^2=\epsilon^2), $$ i.e. the output variable for input $x$ is normally distributed with a mean $\beta x$, with symmetric gaussian errors around this value. This goes beyond simply assuming a continuous output. In particular, it assumes that the output is unbounded . Since, in your case, scores are explicitly bound between $0.0$ and $10.0$, this assumption breaks down near the boundaries. On the other hand, logistic regression models an output variable $y$ as $$ y \sim B(1,p=g(\beta x)), $$ e.g. a binomial distribution with probability $\beta x$. So, logistic regression is actually just a specific type of binomial regression . (If we could rename regression techniques, it would be good to call OLS linear regression normal regression). Neither of these completely captures your case, where you have either an ordinal output between 0 and 10 or a continuous output between 0 and 10. Are the scores all integer multiples, or half-integer multiples? You may want to consider a multi-level logistic regression, but this likely would be overly complex. An alternative is beta regression, modeling an output $$ y \sim B(\alpha=g(A x),\beta=g(B x)) $$ In this case, the output variable $y$ is continuous in the range $y \in [0,1]$. You can map your problem to this trivially by dividing the score by 10.0 so that it is a score out of 100%.
