It's a known fact that, on average, people can keep 7 +/- 2 things in their head at a time. I like to use that principle with parameters. Assuming that programmers are all above-average intelligent people, I'd say everything 10+ is too many. BTW, if parameters are similar in any way, I'd put them in a vector or list rather than a struct or class.
