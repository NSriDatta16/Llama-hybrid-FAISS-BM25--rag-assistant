Absolutely, that's what it is all about. Import your solution into VS2010, Project + Properties, Application tab, change the Target Framework to .NET 4.0. Open the References node in the Solution Explorer window, select the Microsoft.mshtml reference and set its "Embed Interop Type" property to True. It is automatically turned on for new projects that target 4.0 This works for any COM type library that you selected on the COM tab as well as any PIA you selected in the .NET tab. The type library is only required at build time, you don't have to deploy the interop libraries or PIAs anymore. The actual COM server must of course still be present on the target machine. The new dynamic keyword and the optional and named argument features are not related, they merely make it easier to write cleaner code when working with COM servers that were designed to work with scripting languages. Mshtml is already pretty clean, Office interop is the best example. Also note that it tends to be easy to avoid taking a dependency on mshtml when you leverage the Windows Forms' HtmlDocument and HtmlElement classes. That gets started by using the WebBrowser.Document property. They however don't wrap all mshtml features.
