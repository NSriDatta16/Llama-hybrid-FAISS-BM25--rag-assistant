I speak for the XP. You can change the temp on your asp.net account only and affect only the asp.net. The easy dirty way , open regedit , locate on HKEY_USERS the asp.net acount, buy navigate the tree, and look on environment , for the TEMP, TMP that have the aspnet/temp, and just change them, and reboot. Attention with regedit. The other way is to log as aspnet, and change them from controlpanel | system | advanced | enviroment variables. That way you change the temp directory affecting only the aspnet acount.
