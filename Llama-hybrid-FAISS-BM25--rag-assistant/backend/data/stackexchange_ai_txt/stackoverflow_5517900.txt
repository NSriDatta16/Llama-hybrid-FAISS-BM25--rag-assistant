Disabling ctrl-click on jquery ui selectable

I was wondering if there is an option on the jQuery UI Selectable that will let me disable the Ctrl +Click, but still keep the draggable for the multiple selection. On my project I want to be able for people to select multiples, but only by dragging, not by Ctrl +clicking. If there isn't, does anyone know a way I can achieve this? Any information would be really helpful! :) Thanks!!!
