I did a fairly in-depth answer here , ReactOS is your best bet as it seems again, everybody here is a bit off base. I would strongly discourage attempting to disassemble system DLL's. A MUCH more adventagious (and I do not believe discussed so far from the looks of things), technique is to enumerate the contents of PDB's. PDB files are debug symbols as you may know, however, Microsoft is required, due to the action from anti-trust court cases, to release great volumes of otherwise un-documented information. Fully accurate, usable and updated information for massive amount's of the Windows API is only documented via PDB file's. The calling convention, argument count and even argument types and names are documented their (however not the specifics regarding the use of course:). Review the DIA SDK, dia2dump is a good example distributed with Visual Studio, to investigate further, it also provides a solution to undecorate function's, to speak specifically to your question. Also, kernel32 provides UnDecorateSymbolName, so you can use that also if you do not wish to link to the debug sdk libraries.
