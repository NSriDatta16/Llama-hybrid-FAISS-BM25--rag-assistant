CKEditor disable HTML transformation

I've got a problem with CKEditor. Especially the br- and img-Tags are transformed to not be valid. In the source-view I see and but when I inspect the rte-source the slashes are gone as well as when submitting the form. Can someone tell me where I can disable this or enable XHTML-conformity? The embedding page is XHTML. Thank to any hints, ideas or solutions.
