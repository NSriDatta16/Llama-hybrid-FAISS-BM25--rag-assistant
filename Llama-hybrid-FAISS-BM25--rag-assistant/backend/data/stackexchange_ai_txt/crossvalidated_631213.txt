I have never liked this type of approach to specifying a mixed model. In my opinion, the model should reflect the experimental design, and not be an artifact of a data-driven process. One very good reason for this is that models that are specified based on an exploration of the data are far less likely to generalise to new data or different population because there is a real risk of overfitting. This was the subject of a paper by Douglas Bates (one the primary authors of the nlme and lme4 package) and colleagues where they argued rather strongly against a similar approach that gained a lot of interest, called a "maximal" model (Bates et al, 2015) Following the publication of the "keeping it maximal" paper by Barr et al (2013), this site was strewn with a large number of questions from people trying to implement the maximal model approach, and finding that their fitted models were singular. This was almost always because the random structure was far too complex (ie, the model was overfitted). Now to address your actual problem: You appear to have two grouping factors that you want to fit random intercepts for: person and visit_number . From your description, these factors appear to be crossed, not nested. So no problem there. My first question is should I define random slopes corresponding to all of my fixed effects? You should fit random slopes when you expect, a priori , there to be significant variation in the fixed effects within the relevant grouping variable. This is usually requires a very good understanding of the domain. When estimated, if it turns out that the variance for the slopes is extremely small, or can't be estimated due to the model being singular, then remove it. Otherwise retain it ! Should the within subject grouping be such that i add all fixed effects? Something in line with `(1 + treatment * 5_min_window | person) ? Again, only do this is you have good reason to expect the effects of treatment, the window and all their interactions to vary significantly by person Also of note is the presence of 8 five minute measurements during each treatment. Should nesting be somehow incorporated? I assume this means that for each visit_number for each person, the respiratory frequency was measured 8 times ? I assume this was done for precision. In which case just take the average. References Barr, D. J., Levy, R., Scheepers, C., & Tily, H. J. (2013). Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal.
