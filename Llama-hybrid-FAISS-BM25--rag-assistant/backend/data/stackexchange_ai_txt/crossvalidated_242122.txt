Is there any difference between the result for dual and primal of SVM?

There are many variants of types of solver in liblinear . But, I am kind of wondering whether there will be any difference for primal and dual for L2-loss. They suppose to be different forms of the optimization. Will they give different results? -s type : set type of solver (default 1) for multi-class classification 0 -- L2-regularized logistic regression (primal) 1 -- L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (dual) 2 -- L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (primal) ...
