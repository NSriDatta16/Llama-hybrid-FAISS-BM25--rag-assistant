Do you want to write this yourself? Or do you simply need the functionality? If you need the functionality, an embedded/in-memory database with Full Text Search support may do the trick. Since it's .Net, I'd recommend SQLite ADO.Net Provider as the open-source contender. It's really good ( Support LINQ before any other provider out there, design-time support, etc.), and the FTS support is under very active development. I think Google is working on that. There is also VistaDB Database . I'm using that mainly now. It should have FTS support. Entirely .Net, which gives it some integration advantages. If you have to do it yourself check-out books on Information Retrieval . I've read a few, but know nothing that stands out from the crowd. Amazon might help there.
