When a member joins, you know when their membership will expire. So, instead of searching for a list of members to deactivate daily (or however often), you can add each member to the appropriate list of memberships that expire on the same day. Then, every day you just go through and delete the expired memberships for that day. It's pretty much what you said, except that instead of searching, you store the results. The size of your storage is proportional to the length of your longest membership.
