if you want to check if a string is an integer, Integer() is an elegant way to do it, because it makes sure your definition of an integer matches ruby's. if you would rather not use that because it throws an exception, regular expressions work nicely - why avoid them? also, note that in the integer case, you can simply push y onto your stack, not ch, and not need the to_i calls when popping. as for the other question, ruby does indeed have an eval. y = Integer(ch) rescue nil if y stack.push(y) else num2, num1 = stack.pop(2) a = eval "#{num2} #{ch} #{num1}" # see mehrdad's comment for why not num1 ch num2 stack.push(a) end
