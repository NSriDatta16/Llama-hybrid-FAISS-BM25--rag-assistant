The Robust Wald test in Stata is achieved by using the option robust after the glm or poisson command in Stata. This is not the same as bootstrapped standard error estimates, which are another type of "robust" estimate for standard errors. The nominal "robust standard errors" estimates you receive by using the robust command are the Huber White standard error estimates. Huber White estimators are not resampling based, but use the empirical information to estimate $\widehat{\mbox{se}(\hat{\beta})}$. They account for unspecified sources of correlation in the data, heteroscedasticity, and model mispecification. The parameter estimates from such model coefficients are interpreted as "population averaged" which makes them useful for non-causal epidemiologic studies of association.
