Drag start is started via script looking at mouse events. mouse down followed by a mouse move. If you can simulate those mouse movements via Javascript (I don't know where, how, or even if this is possible), then it should fire off the start of a drag. Note: just found that YUI has a way to simulate mouse moves and mouse clicks. Check out http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuitest/#useractions
