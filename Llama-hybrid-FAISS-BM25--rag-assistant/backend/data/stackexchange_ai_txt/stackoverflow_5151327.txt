It's really easy to get sidetracked and drawn into details such as code coverage tools like rcov and even more detailed tools such as heckle, flog, flay . These tools are great and they track down bugs but they should be secondary to unit tests being related to design and documentation. I feel this sums it up - From the agile TDD page "The act of writing a unit test is more an act of design than of verification." "It is also more an act of documentation than of verification"
