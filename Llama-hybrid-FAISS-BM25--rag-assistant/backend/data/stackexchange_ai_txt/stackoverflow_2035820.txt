I recently wrote a jQuery plugin to get position:fixed working in IE 6+. It doesn't jitter on scroll, it looks at capability (not user-agent), works in Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8. If you use strict mode in IE7+ position:fixed will be honoured, but by default IE7+ operates in Quirks Mode. This plugin checks for browser capability, and if it doesn't honour position:fixed, then it implements the jQuery fix. http://code.google.com/p/fixedposition/ Something like this may work for you: $(document).ready(function(){ $("#Createinner").fixedPosition({ debug: true, fixedTo: "bottom" }); }); You may need to make some minor CSS adjustments to get it working for your code. I'm working on "offset" values as options as we speak.
