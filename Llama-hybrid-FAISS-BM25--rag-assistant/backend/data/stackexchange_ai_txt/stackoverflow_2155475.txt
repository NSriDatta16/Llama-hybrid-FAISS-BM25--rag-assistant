I've had to work on similar GUIs and ran into the same problem. I never did find a good data structure so I'll be watching other answers to this question with interest. It gets especially tricky when you are dealing with several different types of controls (combo boxes, list views, checkboxes, panels, etc.). What I did find helpful is to use descriptive names for your controls so that it's very clear when your looking at the code what each control does or is for. Also, organization of the code so that controls that affect each other are grouped together. When making udpates, don't just tack on some code at the bottom of the function that affects something else that's dealt with earlier in the function. Take the time to put the new code in the right spot.
