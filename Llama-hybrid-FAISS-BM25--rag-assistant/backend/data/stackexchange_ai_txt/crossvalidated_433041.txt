what is the probability of detecting departure from H0?

The desired percentage of SiO $_2$ in a certain type of aluminous cement is 5.5. To test whether the true average percentage is 5.5 for a particular production facility, 16 independently obtained samples are analyzed. Suppose that the percentage of SiO2 in a sample is normally distributed with $\sigma$ = .3 and that $\bar{x}$ = 5.25. If the true average percentage is $\mu$ = 5.6 and a level $\alpha$ = .01 test based on $n$ = 16 is used, what is the probability of detecting this departure from $H_0$ ? I have been trying to figure out this problem and have found no luck with other outside resources. At first I thought that I needed to find $\beta$ (5.6), or $\Phi$ ( $z+\frac{\mu_0-\mu'}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$ ) for when $\mu$ ' > $\mu_0$ , but neither of these got to the correct answer of .1056. I feel that my biggest problem is understanding what exactly "detecting this departure" means. any help would be appreciated! the question is 8.21 part b from "Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences" ninth edition by Jay L. Devore.
