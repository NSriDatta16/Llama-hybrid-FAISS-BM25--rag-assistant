Have you looked at JASP? It's very easy to use -- and the community is VERY helpful. I'd post your question on the JASP forums, I'm sure you'll get a helpful response. I'm pretty new to Bayesian stats as well, but I assume what you want to do is analyze each experiment separately, testing simply to see if there is an effect of condition. This will yield, for each experiment, a Bf quantifying the ratio of evidence for this hypothesis to the evidence against this hypothesis. If you take the inverse of this Bf, you will get the evidence in favor of there being no difference in each experiment. I believe you can then look at the ratio between those Bfs to get what you're looking for, but I'm not confident in that last step.
