First, the size of the dataset. I recommend taking small, tractable samples of the dataset (either by randomly choosing N datapoints, or by randomly choosing several relatively small rectangles in the X-Y plane and taking all points that fall within that plane) and then honing your analysis techniques on this subset. Once you have an idea of the form of analysis that works, you can apply it to larger portions of the dataset. PCA is primarily used as a dimensionality reduction technique; your dataset is only three dimensions (one of which is categorical), so I doubt it would apply here. Try working with Matlab or R to visualize the points you are analyzing in the X-Y plane (or their relative density if working with the entire data set), both for individual types and all types the combined, and seeing what patterns emerge visually. That can help guide a more rigorous analysis.
