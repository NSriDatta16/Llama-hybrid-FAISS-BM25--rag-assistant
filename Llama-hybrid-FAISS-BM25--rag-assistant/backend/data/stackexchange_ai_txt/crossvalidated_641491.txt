Logistic regression in R: Handling mixed numerical and categorical variables

I'm attempting to fit a logistic regression model in R and need some guidance on handling both numerical and categorical variables simultaneously, especially when looking for significant explanatory variables. Background I have a dataset named df containing 12 columns in R. My response variable, renewal, is binary with values indicating whether a customer renewed their insurance policy (1) or not (0). The other 11 variables are potential predictors. Among them, 4 are categorical: AccInsurance, ProdNumber, CompNumber, and LivingForm. I converted these categorical variables into factors using the following R code: df $AccInsurance AccInsurance) df $ProdNumber ProdNumber) df $CompNumber CompNumber) df $LivingForm LivingForm). I'm seeking to determine the significance of each explanatory variable in predicting the renewal outcome. Challenges Significance Testing: I proceeded to fit a logistic regression model using the following code: logit_model However, upon looking at the summary output, I noticed coefficients for individual categories within categorical variables (e.g., ProdNumber50, ProdNumber51, etc.), rather than the overall significance of the categorical variable itself. What can I do in order to see the overall significance of the categorical variable? I want to do this analysis in order to know of I should keep all the explanatory variables or remove some that are not statistically significant. Is my approach using drop1(logit_model, test = "Chisq") or Anova(logit_model, type = "II") to do this appropriate for assessing the significance of explanatory variables, or is there a better method? The summary summary(logit_model) Call: glm(formula = renewal ~ ., family = binomial, data = df) Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.588e-02 1.629e-02 -2.203 0.02760 * System -7.961e-03 5.833e-02 -0.136 0.89144 ProdNumber50 7.599e-02 8.896e-03 8.543 Conclusion In summary, I seek clarification on if my method for assessing the significance of explanatory variables in logistic regression is correct. Any insights or alternative approaches would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
