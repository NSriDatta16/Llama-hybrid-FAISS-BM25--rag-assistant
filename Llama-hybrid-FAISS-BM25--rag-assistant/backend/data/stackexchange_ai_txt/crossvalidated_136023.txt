If you consider the returns to be stationary , a very simple way to compare two return time series is using a cross-sectional view of the data (i.e. histogram). This actually what the Sharpe ratio does. (I didn't understand what exactly you meant when you said those metrics "didn't use statistics". Do you mean p-value, confidence regions, etc? Because the Sharpe ratio is pretty much the mean of the returns divided by the standard deviation, which certainly are "statistics" of the data). If you subscribe to a frequentist view, you can use a Student's t-test to compare the two distributions. If you are Bayesian, you can use Kruschke's BEST approach, which is a little more involved but the result is more interpretable. For example, a Bayesian analysis would give you the probability that the mean of the returns of one asset is greater than the other, while a frequentist would give you the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (which could be that the two samples have the same mean) if the null hypothesis is actually true. If you go for a cross-sectional approach, you have to be careful on your assumptions about the data. First, you must confirm that the returns are stationary. Second, you must choose a distribution to model the returns. People in finance usually use Gaussians for that, but it underestimates extreme events ("black swans"), hence it underestimates risk. Lastly, defining what is better in finance is an open issue. The problem arises when dealing with risk. Some people don't even believe that it's possible to model risk analytically (such as Nassim Taleb). Most people use standard deviation as risk, but it's a very superficial approach. A metric I like is conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) because it doesn't ignore tail events (e.g. low probability of huge losses) and is convex, which makes it easier to embed in an optimization procedure. Of course, you will be completely dependent on the way you model and estimate parameters from the data, but most metrics will suffer from the same problem.
