I will try to come back and provide more detail. If you have any question about the efficiency of one operation over another, you would do best to profile your own code (as Dirk suggests). The system.time() function is the easiest way to do this although there are many more advanced utilities (e.g. Rprof, as documented here ). A quick response for the second part of your question: What about the various flavors of apply? Are those just hidden loops? For the most part yes, the apply functions are just loops and can be slower than for statements. Their chief benefit is clearer code. The main exception that I have found is lapply which can be faster because it is coded in C directly. And what about matrices vs. data frames? Matrices are more efficient than data frames because they require less memory for storage. This is because data frames require additional attribute data. From R Introduction : A data frame may for many purposes be regarded as a matrix with columns possibly of differing modes and attributes
