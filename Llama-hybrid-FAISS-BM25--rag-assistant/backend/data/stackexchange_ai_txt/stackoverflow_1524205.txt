flex: how to refresh (reinitialize) list

I am a Java developer who tries Flex. So my new problem is such: I have a list component in Flex filled by objects got from Java (by binding dataprovider). I have put drag-drop support on list. Everything is good. But I wanted to have a reset function to reinitialize list, namely get back drag-dropped elements to the list. I tried several thing on event handler of reset button but could not reinitialise the list data. For example: public function resetList():void { trace("reset") listsrc.dataProvider = srv.getTerritories.lastResult } "reset" is debugged but there is no change on list. Thanks;
