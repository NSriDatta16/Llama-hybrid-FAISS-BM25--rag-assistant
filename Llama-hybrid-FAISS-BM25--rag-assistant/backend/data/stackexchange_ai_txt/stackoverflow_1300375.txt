General comment about any anti-spam system: Nothing you do is going to be 100% secure. If your site is big enough or rewarding enough that a spammer decides to devote special attention to breaking it, they'll probably find a way. But it's like they routinely say about home security: Sure, a skilled, professional thief can beat any alarm system the average home owner is likely to be able to afford. But you'll keep out the clumsy amateurs, and if you make it enough trouble for the professional, you increase the risk for him that by the time he breaks it, you'll have returned home or a neighbor will see him and call the police. When I worked for the military, we routinely talked about the balance between security and preventing the legitimate users from doing their jobs. The goal in the military is not some hypothetical "absolute security", but rather something good enough to reduce the risk to "acceptable levels" consistent with minimum inconvenience to authorized people. Obviously what constitutes "acceptable" depends on what you're protecting: I certainly hope that the people who were protecting nuclear warheads insisted on a higher level of security than we put around radar systems. People in areas where attacks were suspected, like bases in the Middle East, had higher security than we had in middle-America bases. Etc. Point being: How likely a target is your site? I certainly hope my bank uses tighter security to protect my money than I bother to use to prevent spam abstract submissions on the convention site I run. Sites that have millions of visitors and are well-known probably need better security than obscure sites with thousands or hundreds of visitors. How much is "good enough"?
