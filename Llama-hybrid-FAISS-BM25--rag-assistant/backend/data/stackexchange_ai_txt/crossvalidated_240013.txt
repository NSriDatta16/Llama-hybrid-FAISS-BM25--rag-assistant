How does R handle Observation fewer than Variable problem in PCA

Got a dataset of 63 observations of 900 variables. The Variable data is arranged as 63x900. I'm trying to build a prediction model based on this dataset. Three methods have been tried: PCR, PLSR, and Random Forest Regression. PCA returned a 63x63 matrix, which obviously something happened there which I dont know why. I tried then transpose the Variable matrix and PCA, and then transposed it back for regression. By using the Root Mean Square Error with validation data, I tested different models accuracy with increasing PCs. It gave a totally different result, which suggests the PCs are also different. I want to ask how does R handle such problem when observation is fewer than variable dimensions in PCA. Some further exploration and comparison I found PLSR may also have the same problem. Random Forest however gives a similar RMSE result with the transposed PCA regression, which gives me a really challenge to decide which one is correct. 63PCs model RMSE Transposed PC model RMSE
