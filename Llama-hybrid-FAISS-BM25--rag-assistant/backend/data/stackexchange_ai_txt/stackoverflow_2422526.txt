Wow, good luck with this! I think your solution will certainly work and I can't think of a more elegant solution. However I think you're going to be in deep trouble down the line. The thing that I would do would to be simply to put a Unique Identifer on the table that auto increments. That shouldn't affect any of your processes or even your bulk insert application unless you insert using an ordinal field offset rather than named. Sorry this answer isn't exactly what your looking for but the DB is just so bad that (any) answer presented I think will be equally bad.
