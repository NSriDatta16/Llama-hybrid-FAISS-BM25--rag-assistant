Go on with logistic regression (LR.) Logistic regression is a generalized linear model (glm) and is the (first, at least) way to go when your response variable is binary. To read up on LR Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? , Intuition behind logistic regression . EDIT Answer to additional question in comment: Your binary response variable democrat/republican can be modeled as binomial, which has a nonconstant variance which is a function of the mean. So the constant variance assumption of usual linear regression is not fulfilled. Also, linear regression may fit probabilities larger than one or smaller than zero, which does not make sense. Still, this is sometimes used as an approximation under the name linear probability model . Don't do it without some very good reason.
