Minimum sample size for time series cross-validation (tsCV)

I am doing cross-validation of an autoregressive neural network model and I am using the tsCV function ( forecast package) proposed by Hyndman (2014) and illustrated here . The problem: it's necessary for the CV to require an initial minimum sample, and the tsCV function has the argument initial . On the other hand, Hyndman points out that "you do not even have to specify the minimum sample size for model fitting, as it will silently fit models beginning with a single observation, and return to missing value whenever the model can not be estimated." In the book, there is an example arbitrarily using the initial sample as k = 48. I looked for some questions answered by the author on his profile here , but I did not find it. How could I decide the minimum sample size for this kind of CV? HYNDMAN, R. J. Forecasting: Principles & Practice.2014
