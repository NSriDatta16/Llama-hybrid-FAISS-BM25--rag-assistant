How to calculate credible intervals in variational Bayesian methods

to calculate the 95% credible interval in traditional MCMC methods, I take the posterior samples for a parameter and calculate the values where 95% of the probability mass is in. The point estimate is usually the mean. How is this done in variational inference (VI) methods? From my understanding, VI iteratively improves the point estimates in each step. How can I get the uncertainty associated with the parameters?
