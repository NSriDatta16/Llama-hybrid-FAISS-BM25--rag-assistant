If you make the decision based only on the validation error, they are nearly the same. Also $k$ equal to three or four is not very different. You don't have good reasons to prefer any model, you can choose whichever. What you could do is exploratory data analysis of their predictions and the misclassified cases, to see how they differ. If they don't differ, the choice is arbitrary. I'd personally go with higher $k$ as theoretically this is less likely to overfit due to averaging over more observations.
