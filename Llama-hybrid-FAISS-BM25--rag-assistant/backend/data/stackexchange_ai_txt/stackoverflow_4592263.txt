iOS: Multiple views accessing the same data - how to access?

I'm a Java Developer new to iOS and objective c development. I need to build an iOS application where multiple views (e.g. a ListView and a MapView) access the same data (e.g. stored in an NSArray). Currently, I do alloc and init a DataManager class that loads the data (loading it from a plist, later it should be requested from the web) in the app delegate. How do I access this data from the views? Should the DataManager be a singleton? Is there a better/more elegant/more "obj-c 2.0" solution? Thanks!
