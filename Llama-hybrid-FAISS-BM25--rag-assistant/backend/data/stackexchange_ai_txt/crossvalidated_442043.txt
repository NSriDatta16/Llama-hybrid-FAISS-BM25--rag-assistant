Welcome to CrossValidated! I would perhaps go iteratively from the beginning to the end, setting all data points to missing where the absolute or relative difference to the last non-missing data point is large. It seems in your dataset, the wrong sensor data is easily discernible by the large jump compared to what you would expect (perhaps allow for increasing differences the further away you move from the last non-missing data point). By setting them iteratively to missing, you will be also able to discern adjacent wrong data point. In a second step you can then interpolate the missing points again iteratively via splines or moving averages. You can also try some robust regression approaches such as quantile regression (with a flexible trend component).
