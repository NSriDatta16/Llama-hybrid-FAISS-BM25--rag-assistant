Libraries for Online Machine Learning

I am looking for packages (either in python, R, or a standalone package) to perform online learning to predict stock data. I have found and read about Vowpal Wabbit ( https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki ), which seems to be quite promising but I am wondering if there are any other packages out there. Thanks in advance.
