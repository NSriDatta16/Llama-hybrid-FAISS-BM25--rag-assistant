While accessing the assembly in otherAppdomain ,how to reflect the changes done in assembly in Other appdomain Referred

I am accessing one assembly in other application by loading that assembly in Another Appdomain,its working fine. My Question is : If I make changes in the Assembly and build it,the changes are not getting reflected in the application where I have created the another appdomain for accessing it unless i build the application . Plz let me know how can I access the assembly in this case without building the application. Thanks, Gagan dhamija
