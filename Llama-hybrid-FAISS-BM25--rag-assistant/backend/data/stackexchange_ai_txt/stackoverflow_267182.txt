If you're talking about ColdFusion (which I assume you are from the tags) then I'm not sure this is doable but I may be very wrong here... IIRC, When CF compiles it essentially compiles into a interpreted form of the CFML as a plain old java source file, this is then compiled into the class. Therefore, any instrumentation that you may have will apply to the intermediary version rather than the CFML itself. Saying that though, Adobe have got the CF debugger now which can step though code, so please prove me wrong - I'd love code coverage in CFML.
