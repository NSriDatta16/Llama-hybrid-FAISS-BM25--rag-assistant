Are there any libraries or components that handle storage and fast retrieval of user-generated content?

Considering the case of having a large and active user base where each user wants to store a profile picture and some additional images or other artifacts, are there any libraries or frameworks that allow for easy storage and query of such data? A reference implementation would be Facebook's Haystack Photo Infrastructure . The following characteristics are important Data store should scale well: adding resources should be transparent to the application using the store ( similar question had an answer referring to LinkedIn's Voldemort ). Ability to add some meta-data alongside the data being stored. Meta-data can be queried with good performance (e.g. stored in configurable index like Lucene/Solr). Quick key-based access and some intermediate caching layer Any recommendations for libraries or frameworks that can be easily integrated into a Java web application are welcome. Update : thank you for the first few answers. I have to go into more detail on what type of answers are expected. Tobu's answer , although not java related is very good (just voted up). It is possible to implement a solution with a combination of file system access and a DB and add some layer of caching in between, but I consider it a waste of time, if someone more qualified than me has already designed, implemented and run a better solution. Something based on a solution with underlying DB or JCR implementations is a good fit, but implementing the other infrastructure is not what I want to do.
