USB drive LED flash

I was recently reading about the Arduino's Hello World application, and I thought to myself, "I wonder if I can do that with hardware that I have right now." Since I don't have an Arduino, I grabbed a usb flash drive that I had laying around and started googling around for information about it. I didn't find much helpful information in this area, so I'm now asking here: is it possible for me to access a USB drive's hardware (e.g. the LED) and interact with it via some programming environment (I was thinking C# should probably have some way to do this)? Also, related to this subject - does anyone know what kind of commands USB drives use? For example, SCSI storage devices have a standardized command set; ATA devices have a similar protocol. How are things like simple read/write commands issued to a USB storage device?
