For these types of work, I would suggest not to pay much of attention to methodologies, because after all, what matters is the algorithm. But, for the sake of having a response for your dilemma, I would suggest using XP (eXtreme Programming). Why? Is light It doesn't require filling many papers as RUP & others Is more suited for changing evironments, such as yours Just take a fast search at Google for XP methodology and you'll get a bunch of useful results. ARUP (Agile RUP) might be worth looking also. I hope I can help you.
