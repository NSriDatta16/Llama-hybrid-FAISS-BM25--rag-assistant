In order of importance: Switch on compiler optimization. Allocate a single array for each matrix and use something like M*i+j for indexing. This will allocate faster and perhaps more importantly be more compact and less fragmented than multiple allocations. Get used to indexing starting by zero, this will save you one array element and in general zero comparisons have the potential to be faster. I see nothing wrong in using for loops. If you are willing to spend even more effort, you could either use a vectorized 3rd party linear algebra lib or vectorize yourself by using things like SSE* or GPUs.
