Apache Tomcat Cataline file changes not reflecting!

I am using apache-tomcat-6.0.18 on windows xp prefossional SP3. My requirement is to show additional information ( like Organization Name) in the Tomcat Manager => Server Status => in between the JVM and http- Header. I have modified the file "org.apache.catalina.manager.StatusTransformer::writeConnectorState " from catalina.jar source and added simple text to it. Sample code is public static void writeConnectorState(PrintWriter writer, ObjectName tpName, String name, MBeanServer mBeanServer, Vector globalRequestProcessors, Vector requestProcessors, int mode)throws Exception{ if (mode == 0) { // START - Added New Code to display org name writer.print(" "); writer.print("XYZ Organization."); writer.print(" "); // END - Added New Code to display org name writer.print(" "); writer.print(name); writer.print(" "); writer.print(" "); writer.print(" Max threads: "); writer.print(mBeanServer.getAttribute(tpName, "maxThreads")); writer.print(" Current thread count: "); writer.print(mBeanServer.getAttribute(tpName, "currentThreadCount")); writer.print(" Current thread busy: "); writer.print(mBeanServer.getAttribute(tpName, "currentThreadsBusy")); ........... ........... }else{ ......... }// end if-else }// method end Again created catalina.jar with modified code. and replaced with the existing jar from catalina_home/bin . Restarted the tomcat but nothing coming out of it. Even if i remove catalina.jar from catalina_home/bin and starts the tomcat, its working!!!! I tried even after restarting the system but my changes are not reflecting. Please help me out for the following queries Am i modifying the wrong file? How tomcat is running without catalina.jar? How to reflect the changes? i.e. Any other way?
