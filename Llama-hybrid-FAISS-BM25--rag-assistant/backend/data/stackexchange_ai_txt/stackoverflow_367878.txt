This problem has vexed me for some time. My custom CMS does some quite complex processing, uploading and manipulation, and so sometimes ouputs quite lengthy error and information messages, which aren't suitable for converting to GET data, and I have always wanted to avoid the reload problem on data INSERT, but not yet found an adequate solution. I believe the correct way to go about this, is to create message arrays for each possible state - each message or error you could want to display, and then you only need to send error/message numbers which are a lot easier to handle than long data strings, but it's something I have always shied away from personally as I find it a bit tedious and cumbersome. Frankly, this is probably just laziness on my part. I quite like the SESSION variable storage solution, but this raises the question of how do you ensure the SESSION data is properly destroyed? As long as you ensure you are only sending information (messages/errors) and not data that should/could be stored (and thus potentially sensitive) this should be an avoidable problem.
