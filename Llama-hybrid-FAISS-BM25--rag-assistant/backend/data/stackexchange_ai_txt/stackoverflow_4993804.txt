You say you want to improve the load time of your website so let me offer an alternate solution. Why not offload your images to a service like amazon s3 (simple storage system) so they can serve up your images for you? And to really speed things up you can use a content delivery service like amazon cloud front . This will probably speed up your site much more than lowering the image quality. Another benefit is that it'll be pretty cheap when you start out (most likely free) and you'll be able to scale easily in the future if you end up needing that.
