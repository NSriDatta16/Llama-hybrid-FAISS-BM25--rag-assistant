wchar_t is a wide character with platform-defined width, which doesn't really help much. UTF-8 characters span 1-4 bytes per character. UCS-2, which spans exactly 2 bytes per character, is now obsolete and can't represent the full Unicode character set. Linux applications that support Unicode tend to do so properly, above the byte-wise storage layer. Windows applications tend to make this silly assumption that only two bytes will do. wchar_t 's Wikipedia article briefly touches on this.
