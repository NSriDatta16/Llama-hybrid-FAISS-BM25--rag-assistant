I'd start by enabling logging: agent.log = Logger.new(STDOUT) This is going to give you all headers, incoming and outgoing, which you can use to understand the problem. Additionally, I'd use an http sniffer like Scoop that would show me what's going on when I manually enter this url in the browser. Then you'll be able to compare what your browser is doing with what mechanize is doing and find the problem. Also, try setting the user-agent because some websites do terminate a connection if mechanize honestly introduces itself. agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari'
