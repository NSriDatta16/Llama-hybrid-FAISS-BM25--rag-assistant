I have a basic embedding of logic programming in F#. I developed it for the course I teach on "Programing Paradigms", which uses F# throughout and includes a couple of lectures on logic programming. The code uses imperative updates to reflect substitutions due to unification, and it uses success continuations. So it is relatively different from, e.g., Kanren. I'm not sure how much sense the notes will make by themselves, but you can find this embedding at the end of: http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3242/16-logic-prog.pdf I can provide a refined version of this embedding on request.
