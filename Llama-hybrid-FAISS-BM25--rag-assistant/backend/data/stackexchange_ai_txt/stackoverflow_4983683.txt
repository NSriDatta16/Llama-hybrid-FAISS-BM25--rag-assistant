Short answer is no. Facebook's recent lists and so on are a dynamic amalgamation of posts - a post can't be marked to opt-out of this, Facebook decides its relevancy and coverage. A user may have their profile configured to so that postings of certain types/from certain applications are handled in a specific way, but there's nothing you can personally do about that - and I still don't think it encompasses options to hide posts from feeds, mainly just disallow them from their wall in the first place.
