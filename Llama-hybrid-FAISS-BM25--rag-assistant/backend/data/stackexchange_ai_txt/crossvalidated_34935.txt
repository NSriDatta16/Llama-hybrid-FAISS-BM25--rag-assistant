I agree with Erik in most respects. However I do think that in the first case that you are trying to predict a rate parameter from a point process and so Poisson or negative binomial regression would be appropriate. Most texts on regression deal primrily with linear regression. Some also include topics on nonlinear regression. But in your case you are interested in learning about special topics like logistic regression, probit models and Poisson and Negative Binomial regression which are best covered in specialized books such as: Negative Binomial Regression by Hilbe Probit Analysis by Finney Applied Logistic Regression by Hosmer and Lemeshow
