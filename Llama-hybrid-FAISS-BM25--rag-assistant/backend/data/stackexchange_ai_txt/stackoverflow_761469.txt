It's been a while, but I saw that you used a pragma to define the location of the interrupt handler before you created the function, might you need to do the same thing with main()? It might be handled in the .h file - I'm not sure. I only ever used ASM on the PICs and I explicitly handled everything (ie, at 0x000 jump to main; at the interrupt vector address jump to this memory address; at main address do these things, etc). 'main' for me was defined to be an available address in the code section (which I see you've done, started the code section then defined main) but I believe I had to explicitly define that 'main' was to start at a memory address in the code section. Again, it was ASM, but I wouldn't doubt that you need to do something similar - a pragma to define main as main.
