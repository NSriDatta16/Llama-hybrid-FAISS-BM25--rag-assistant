Let's say that you now have a 20 by 4 cost matrix $C$ consisting of the costs of assigning agents to tasks. You can make 5 new tasks, each requiring one agent, out of each original task. To do this, make a new cost matrix $C_{\text{new}}$ , which is 20 by 20, in which each column of $C$ appears 5 times. Use the Hungarian algorithm on $C_{\text{new}}$ . and you will have 1 agent assigned to every new task, which will therefore be 5 agents assigned to every original task.
