Check out this link for what an IPS tag is. It's essentially an identifier for your domain registration agent. To quote: An IPS TAG allows Nominet to administer use of their automated domain name registration system and associated services. The IPS-TAG is a unique sequence of letters and/or numbers. You need to be able to tell Nominet your registration agent's tag to be able to change your registration agent.
