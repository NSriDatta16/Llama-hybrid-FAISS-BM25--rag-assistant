Time period length for comparing two Boxplots?

I want to see the variability in a dataset or timeseries in two different period by the means of Box and Whisker Plot My time series covers a period of 1901-2010. I want to see the variability post-1970 period w.r.t. to pre-1970 period. Is this the right approach to compare the Boxplot of 70 year of dataset (1901-1970) to boxplot of 40 years of dataset (1971-2010)? As there will be more number of datapoint in the former timeseries, hence, range may be more? or Should I compare the boxplot of 1931-1970 with boxplot of 1971-2010 to have the identical length of dataset? Edit-1: I am dealing with rainfall data. I want to see the variation in extreme rainfall events, seasonal rainfall after and before 1970 to find how the rainfall pattern has changed in the recent period. Edit-2 There are no zero value in the data, as I am picking the extreme values at 95 percentile from each year. I am also making a time series of total annual rainfall which is again a non zero number. I am dividing the seasons as per the monsoon (major rainfall months), post-monsoon and pre-monsoonal months.
