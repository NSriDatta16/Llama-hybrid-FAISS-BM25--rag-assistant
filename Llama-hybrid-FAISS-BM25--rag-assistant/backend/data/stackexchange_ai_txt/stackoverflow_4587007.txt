Calculate how many 128 bytes packets you could fit in the current memory layout. Let be that number n. Calculate how many 128 bytes packets you could fit in a memory layout with the same number of bytes allocated than the current one, but with no holes (that is, move all the + to the left for example). Let be that number N. Your "fragmentation ratio" would be alpha = n/N
