Try be inspired by pragmatic programmer. Compile only what is necessary, have two or more test suites. One for quick tests, other for full tests. Consider if there is real need to use each build-step every time. It necessary try to use jikes compiler instead of javac. After project spans several hundreds of classes I switch to jikes to improve speed. But be aware of potential incompatibility issues. Don't forget to include one all in one target to perform every step with full rebuild and full test of project.
