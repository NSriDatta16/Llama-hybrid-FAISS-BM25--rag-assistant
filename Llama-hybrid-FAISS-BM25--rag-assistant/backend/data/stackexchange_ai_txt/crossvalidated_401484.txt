Expected value notation in GAN loss

I am reading Goodfellow's original paper on GANs. What I struggle to understand is his notation of the subscript in expected values. $$ \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{x} \sim p_{data}(\boldsymbol{x})}\ldots $$ If I understand it correctly then $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a realization of some random variable $\mathbf{x}$ , but how can there be an expectation wrt. $\boldsymbol{x}$ ? Or is $\boldsymbol{x}$ a random variable? Thank you. Edit: I do not think this is duplicate, as the referenced question does not answer what $\boldsymbol{x}$ means.
