When is a time series considered to be "complex"? (not complex-valued)

what is a measure or definition for complex time series . When is a time series considered to be normal and when it is considered to be a complex? A lot of researcher saying they predicting/analayzing complex time series. However, I am asking me what is the property that makes a time series a complex one.
