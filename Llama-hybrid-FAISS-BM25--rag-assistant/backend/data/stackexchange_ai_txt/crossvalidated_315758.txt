Itâ€™s not stationary because if you assume $p_t = bp_{t-1} + a_t$, then the variance of this process is $\sigma^2_{p_t}$ = $\sigma^2_{a_t} / (1-b^2)$. Hence when b = 1, the variance explodes, (i.e- the time series could be anywhere). This violates the condition required to be stationary (constant variance)
