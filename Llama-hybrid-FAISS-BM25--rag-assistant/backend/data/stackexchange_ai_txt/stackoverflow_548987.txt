Different using-statements on production and developement environments

I have an annoying problem in one of my projects where the production environment uses Microsoft Office 2000 and we only have Microsoft Office 2003 in the developement environment. I use automation to do some manipulation of Word documents so to make this work in both the production and the developement environments i have to put a conditional compiler statement into the using-section of my code in all the files that uses automation. #if DEVELOPEMENT using Word = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word; #else using Office; #endif Edit: I know the obvious solution is to get Microsoft Office 2000 onto the developement environment, but that is not easy if you want to do it the legal way. I use Visual Studio 2005, so is there a more elegant way to avoid this conditional compiler statement? Edit: The solution with using the TlbImp.exe tool from the SDK works beautifully, you just have to remember to give the generated file a strong name by generating a keyfile using the sn.exe tool else the Visual Studio wont compile the solution: "c:\...\SDK\v2.0\Bin\TlbImp.exe" "c:\...\Microsoft Office\Office10\MSWORD9.OLB" /keyfile:Office.snk /out:Office.dll
