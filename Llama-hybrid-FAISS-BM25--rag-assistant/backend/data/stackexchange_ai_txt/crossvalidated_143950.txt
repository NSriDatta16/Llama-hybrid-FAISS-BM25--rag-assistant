Recommendation system and baseline predictors

I'm participating in programming contest, where I have a data, and where the first number is a user, second number is a movie, and the third is a number in then-points rating. 0 0 9 0 1 8 1 1 4 1 2 6 2 2 7 This data in a table: Rows is users 0, 1 and 2; columns is movies 0, 1 and 2; cells are scores, "-" were not voted on: And I have to predict third number for next data: 0 2 1 0 2 0 2 1 I use this way for finding bias values https://youtube.com/watch?v=dGM4bNQcVKI and this way for predicting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RSigTais8o . Raw average is 6.8 , because all numbers in table divide to numbers length: (9 + 8 + 4 + 6 + 7) / 5 = 34/5 = 6.8 Bias value for user number 0: 9 + 8 / 2 = 8.5 - 6.8 = 1.7 . Bias value for movie number 2: 6 + 7 / 2 = 6.5 - 6.8 = 0.3 . And baseline predictors: 6.8 + 1.7 + 0.3 , where result is 8.8 , but in contest result is: 7.052009 . And result for all given numbers must be (where the first number is a user, second number is a movie, and the third is a number in then-points rating): 0 2 7.052009 1 0 6.687943 2 0 6.995272 2 1 6.687943 Where is my mistake?
