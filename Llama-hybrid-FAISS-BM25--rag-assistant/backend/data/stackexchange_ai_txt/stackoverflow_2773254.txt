There is NOT an elegant way - all ways suck. WHERE @isActive == -1 OR isActive = @isActive is basically the only way - but even then you please make sure that the query plan is reevaluated every time, otherwise most queries will use the wrong query plan. THis is a classical case where stored procedures are bad. Querying should IMHO not be done using stored procedures at all since modern times - which started about 15 years ago when someone was smart enough to write the first ORM.
