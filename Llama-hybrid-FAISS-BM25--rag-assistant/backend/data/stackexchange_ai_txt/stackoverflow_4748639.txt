NSUserDefaults is a convenient way to store some preferences and the current state of the application (ex: "remember me" checkbox set to yes or no). You should only use it for this kind of data. You can also use a custom PList to store this kind of information but it can be overkill. The key question is how large are the data you need to store ? small dataset => NSUserDefaults large dataset => PList You should also consider using CoreData if you have serious storage needs.
