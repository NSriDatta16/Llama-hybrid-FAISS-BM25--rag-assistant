Help in problem formuation :Hebb's learning

In the supervised learning problem, the goal is, given a training set, to learn a function $h : X \mapsto Y$ so that $h (x)$ is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of $y$. If $y$ takes discrete values, then it is a classification problem. $X = \{x_1,x_2,...,x_N \}$ is the training set of $N$ examples where each example $x_i \in R^D$ has $D$ number of elements in binary. Then the problem formulation becomes : $$y^{(i)} = \theta^T x^{(i)} + e^{(i)} \tag{1}$$ where $i = 1..N$ and $e$ is the prediction error. Please correct me if I am wrong in saying that this is a linear regression formulation. Estimating the unknown parameter $\theta$ for all the training examples can be done using Least Squares. I think $\theta$ will be a vector of size $D$. I have training data that consists of $N$ time series where each $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}$ is of length $D$. The problem is to learn a transformation coefficient $\mathbf{W}$ for all $N$ examples such that the output $\mathbf{y}_i \approx \mathbf{x}_i$ . The target output should be close to the input for all the examples in such a way that the error between $\mathbf{e}_i = ||\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{y}_i||$ is minimum. The data $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}$ comes from a nonlinear dynamical map TEnt map $g(.)$ , so each example $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}$ is obtained from $D$ iterations of $N$ different maps. The question is based on the document http://www.ece.rice.edu/~erzsebet/ANNcourse/handouts502/course-cf-3.pdf which talks about Nonlinear Hebb learning. But it is unclear to me how I can apply to my model in Eq(2) I cannot represent the problem mathematically. I tried something like this but not sure if it makes sense and so need help in formulation. Is the following problem formulation correct? $$\mathbf{y}_i= Wg(\mathbf{x}_i) + \mathbf{e}_i \tag{2}$$ and assuming error to be $i.i.d$ Gaussian distributed. I cannot understand how to derive Hebb's learning law for weight update $\theta$. Can somebody please provide the solution? Thank you.
