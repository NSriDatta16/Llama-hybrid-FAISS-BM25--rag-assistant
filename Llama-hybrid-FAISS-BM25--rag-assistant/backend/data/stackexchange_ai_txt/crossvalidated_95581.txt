The SVM separating hyperplane is defined as the set of all points $x$ satisfying $w^t x - b = 0$ where $w$ is some nonzero vector (it is the normal to the separating hyperplane). It is easy to see that $\{x : w^t x - b = 0\}$ is an affine space of dimension $D-1$ since it is equal to $b + w^{\perp}$ and $\dim w^\perp = D-1$ where $w^{\perp}$ denotes the space perpendicular to the span of the vector $w$.
