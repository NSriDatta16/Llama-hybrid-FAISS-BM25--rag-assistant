How to choose between poisson regression and zero inflated models

I have data on children visiting the A&E department. I want to see which variables are associated with the numbers of visits. For instance, if genetic factors are associated with more visits to A&E. I've tried a logistic regression to compare children that go to the A&E and children that don't go. After that, I've model the number of visits (1 to 7) to a poisson regression. However, I got confused if this is the most appropriate solution. So I tried to model a hurdle regression to the data ( 0 visits to 7 visits). The results are different between the poisson ( 1 to 7 visits) and the hurdle regression (0 to 7 visits). I'm wondering what is the most appropriate approach. Any pointers and clarification will be most welcome.
