The thing about RelativeLayout is that you have to tell where to put the itens. Example: Pay attention to android:layout_above="@id/buyTicket". If you want button A on top of button B, you first declare button A (for example), align it to top of parent, and then at the button B declaration, you say you want it under button A. In your case, you have to declare button A, B, C and D, then set android:layout_alignParentTop="true" in button A, and then set android:layout_bellow on B, C and D (to the one before them). And don't forget to set height and width to wrap_content .
