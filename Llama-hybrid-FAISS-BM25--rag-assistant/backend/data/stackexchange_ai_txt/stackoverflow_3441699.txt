Change paragraph text dynamically with jQuery?

I want to take the information typed into a text field and display it in a paragraph elsewhere on the page. Basically, exactly what is happening below as I'm type this (go to post a question and start typing in the main text box and you'll see what I mean). Any idea how to do this? The page has so much JavaScript on it I can't find how they did it.
