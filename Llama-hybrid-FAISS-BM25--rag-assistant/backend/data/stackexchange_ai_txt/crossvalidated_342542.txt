Comparing multinomial logistic coefficients across groups

I have a multinomial logistic regression model - 1 DV with 3 categories and 5 IVs (4 continuous and 1 categorical). I would like to test whether my effects differ between different ethnic groups. Is it possible to do this without running the analysis for each group separately?
