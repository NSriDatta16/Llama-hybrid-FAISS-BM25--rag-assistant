Populating data in multiple cascading dropdown boxes in Access 2007

I've been assigned the task to design a temporary customer tracking system in MS Access 2007 (sheeeesh!). The tables and relationships have all been setup successfully. But I'm running into a minor problem while trying to design the data entry form for one table... Here's a bit of explanation first. The screen contains 3 dropdown boxes (apart from other fields). 1st dropdown The first dropdown (cboMarket) represents the Market lets users select between 2 options: Domestic International Since the first dropdown contains only 2 items I didn't bother making a table for it. I added them as pre-defined list items. 2nd dropdown Once the user makes a selection in this one, the second dropdown (cboLeadCategory) loads up a list of Lead Categories, namely, Fairs & Exhibitions, Agents, Press Ads, Online Ads etc. Different sets of lead categories are utilized for the 2 markets. Hence this box is dependent on the 1st one. Structure of the bound table, named Lead_Cateogries for the 2nd combo is: ID Autonumber Lead_Type TEXT 3rd dropdown And based on the choice of category in the 2nd one, the third one (cboLeadSource) is supposed to display a pre-defined set of lead sources belonging to the particular category. Table is named Lead_Sources and the structure is: ID Autonumber Lead_Category NUMBER When I make the selection in the 1st dropdown, the AfterUpdate event of the combo is called, which instructs the 2nd dropdown to load contents: Private Sub cboMarket_AfterUpdate() Me![cboLead_Category].Requery End Sub The Row Source of the 2nd combo contains a query: SELECT Lead_Categories.ID, Lead_Categories.Lead_Category_Name FROM Lead_Categories WHERE Lead_Categories.Lead_Type=[cboMarket] ORDER BY Lead_Categories.Lead_Category_Name; The AfterUpdate event of 2nd combo is: Private Sub cboLeadCategory_AfterUpdate() Me![cboLeadSource].Requery End Sub The Row Source of 3rd combo contains: SELECT Leads_Sources.ID, Leads_Sources.Lead_Source FROM Leads_Sources WHERE [Lead_Sources].[Lead_Category]=[Lead_Categories].[ID] ORDER BY Leads_Sources.Lead_Source; Problem When I select Market type from cboMarket, the 2nd combo cboLeadCategory loads up the appropriate Categories without a hitch. But when I select a particular Category from it, instead of the 3rd combo loading the lead source names, a modal dialog is displayed asking me to Enter a Parameter . alt text http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/184/enterparamprompt.png When I enter anything into this prompt (valid or invalid data), I get yet another prompt: alt text http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/8065/enterparamprompt2.png Why is this happening? Why isn't the 3rd box loading the source names as desired. Can any one please shed some light on where I am going wrong? Thanks, m^e =================================================== UPDATE I found a glitch in the query for the 3rd combo.. It wasn't matching up with the value of the second combo. I fixed it and now the query stands at: SELECT Leads_Sources.ID, Leads_Sources.Lead_Source FROM Leads_Sources WHERE (((Leads_Sources.Lead_Category)=[cboLead_Category])) ORDER BY Leads_Sources.Lead_Source; Those nasty Enter Param prompts are GONE!!! However, the 3rd combo still stubbornly refuses to load any values. Any ideas?
