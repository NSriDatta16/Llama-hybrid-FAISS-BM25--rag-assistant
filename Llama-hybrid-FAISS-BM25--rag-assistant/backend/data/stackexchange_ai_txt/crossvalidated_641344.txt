Changepoints vs Structural Breaks

I am looking at this source : It defines changepoint and changepoint detection the following way: 1 Change point detection A particular change point test seeks to identify the specific period of time that relates to a change in the probability distribution of a stochastic process or time series. In general, the problem concerns both detecting whether or not a change has occurred, or whether several changes might have occurred, and identifying the times of any such changes. To establish a relatively general framework for the detection of a change point, we can assume that we have an ordered sequence of data, $y_t=\{y_1, \ldots, y_T\}$ . A change point is then said to arise within this dataset when there exists a time, $\tau \in\{1, \ldots, T-1\}$ , such that the statistical properties of $\{y_1, \ldots, y_\tau\}$ and $\{y_{\tau+1}, \ldots, y_T\}$ are different in some way. Extending this idea for a single change point to multiple changes, we can allow for $m$ change points, that are associated with positions, $\tau_{1: m}=\{\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_m\}$ . Each change point position is then ordered so that $\tau_i if, and only if, $i . Consequently the $m$ change points will split the data into $m+1$ segments, where the $i$ th segment may be summarised by a set of parameters. The parameters associated with the $i$ th segment will be denoted $\{\theta_i, \phi_i\}$ , where $\phi_i$ is a possible set of nuisance parameters and $\theta_i$ is the set of parameters that may describe the change. In this case, we typically want to test how many segments are needed to provide the best representation of the data generating process. They discuss tests for finding changes in mean and/or variance. Later on then define the difference between the definition of structural break and changepoint here: The term structural break is in many respects synonymous with change point, but would refer to specific cases where there is a change in the regression coefficients. But if a changepoint is " a change in the probability distribution of a stochastic process or time series.", and a structural break related to " a change in the regression coefficients", I do not understand how a structural break is a case of a changepoint and not completely synonymous. How we can have a changepoint that doesn't change regression coefficients?
