Why the majority of serious machine learners are from the computer vision society?

I have noticed that most individuals who want to specialize in machine learning tend to go into computer vision labs. I was always curious about why computer vision in particular. My confusion was basically because I find computer vision quit a boring task. Classifying images as cats or dogs or numbers is not interesting at all for me. Maybe for others. But to some extent I don't believe that those people go there because they are really passionate about computer vision in particular. Also I noticed that most universities have only 'computer vision' labs. I always wondered why not to call them "machine learning" labs. My question: Do people choose to go with computer vision because it's the most challenging machine learning task such that if you can solve it then you can solve any problem, or is it something else? Edit: I'm not sure how to reword this question to make it better. If someone has an idea, please feel free to edit it.
