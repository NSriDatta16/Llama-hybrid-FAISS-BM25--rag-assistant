Any alternatives for plotting (long) time series?

I'm looking for ways to visualize large time-series other then in traditional 2-axis line charts. More specifically, I hope to find a way that intuitively reveals patterns in the data such as the spiral approach found in http://ieg.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~aigner/teaching/ws06/infovis_ue/papers/spiralgraph_weber01visualizing.pdf In my case, since I'm working with sensor data to track ones movements, days are a suitable interval. Another benefit of using spirals is that it doesn't require a linear increase in pixel space. Other ideas: Overlaying data from multiple days on the same 24-hour x-axis or displaying the days individually, similar to a calendar. Is there a better way? Any tips?
