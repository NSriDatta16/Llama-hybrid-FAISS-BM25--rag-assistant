Manipulating binary C struct data off line

I have a practical problem to solve. In an embedded system I'm working on, I have a pretty large structure holding system parameters, which includes int, float, and other structures. The structure can be saved to external storage. I'm thinking of writing a PC software to change certain values inside the binary structure without changing the overall layout of the file. The idea is that one can change 1 or 2 parameter and load it back into memory from external storage. So it's a special purpose hex editor. The way I figures it: if I can construct a table that contains: - parameter name - offset of the parameter in memory - type I should be able to change anything I want. My problem is that it doesn't look too easy to figure out offset of each parameter programmatically. One can always manually to printf their addresses but I'd like to avoid that. Anybody know a tool that can be of help? EDIT The system in question is 32 ARM based running in little endian mode. Compiler isn't asked to pack the structure so for my purpose it's the same as a x86 PC. The problem is the size of the structure: it contains no less than 1000 parameters in total, spreading across multiple level of nested structures. So it's not feasible (or rather i'm not willing to) to write a short piece of code to dump all the offsets. I guess the key problem is parsing the C headers and automatically generate offsets or code to dump their offsets. Please suggest such a parsing tool. Thanks
