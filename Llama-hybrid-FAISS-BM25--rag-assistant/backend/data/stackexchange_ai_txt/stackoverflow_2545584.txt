If you build with Release configuration, make sure you keep a copy of the .dSYM file and the application bundle. Then when the application crashes on the device, plug it into Xcode and download the crash reports. Open Xcode and then open the Organizer from within Xcode. From there you can view crash reports from a device. The crash reports will be symbolicated if (and only if) you saved the .dSYM file and the application bundle. You can then use the crash reports to find out why it is crashing, and fix it.
