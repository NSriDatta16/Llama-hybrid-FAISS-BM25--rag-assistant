The symlink script you are thinking of already exists. It's called Module Manager (modman) and it's great for managing multiple modules in one Magento install. Modman allows you to checkout and manage multiple SVN repos in the same folder. However, please note that a security change in Magento 1.4.2.0 makes it impossible to symlink template files into app/design, so a workaround is needed. More info in this bug report .
