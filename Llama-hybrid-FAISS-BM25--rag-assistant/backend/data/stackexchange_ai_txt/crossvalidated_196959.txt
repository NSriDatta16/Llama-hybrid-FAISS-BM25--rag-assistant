Very poor accuracy in Naive Bayes for ancestry/surname classification

Naive Bayes has a very good reputation on the classification of surnames by ancestry (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24944286 ). I would like to apply a Naive Bayes classifier in R to identify the ancestry of individuals based on character 3-gram of their surnames. My dataset has 5 classes: IBR, JPN, GER, EAS and ITA. Surprisingly, the code bellow classifies all surnames as Japanese or German ancestry; the accuracy is only 0.09 (these two classes are the least common in my sample!) library(e1071) library(caret) test When I increase the size of the training set the problem get worse and everybody is classified as Japanese; I am pretty sure that the data is fine, because I tested other classifiers (SVM and Carvar & Trenkle)and they performed ok. When I increase the value of "threshold"=0.05, accuracy goes to 0.5. Thank you!
