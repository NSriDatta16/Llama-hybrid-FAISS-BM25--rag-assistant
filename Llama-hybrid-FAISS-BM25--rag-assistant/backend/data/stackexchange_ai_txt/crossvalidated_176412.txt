Help with question from Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" - 2.43

I've been having difficulties with the following question: I feel this is a very simple problem that I'm overthinking, but I've been stumped on this question for a while. I've tried to simplify it and turn the integral into the gamma function, but I can't figure out how to do it! x is only present in the exp() function, so I can't understand how to transform it into something else. I would appreciate any help directing me to the right way to do this question.
