I guess it depends on what assumptions you want to make. Since you are comparing two sets of temporal data, you could assume that each set was generated by a different constant rate of publication with some random noise. In that case, if you assume the noise is of the same type, it wouldn't be too hard to infer the 'true publication rates'. Otherwise, you could assume the form if the 'true publication rate' is a more general function of time than a constant. In this case, you would need a norm to compare the two functions. This may be more a more complicated task than what you seek. More philosophically, why do desire to model these events statistically? The simplest test to see which period was more productive would be to average each. However, this wouldn't give you a 'probability'. To me, it seems like the Mind Projection Fallacy idea is relavant here. It basically says that the events of the world aren't inherently random, but since we only have a limited information about phenomena we observe, the best thing we can do is model these phenomena probabilistically. In regards to your problem, if the phenomena you care about is publication rates, you basically know all the information during these two periods and treating them as random events doesn't make too much sense unless you are actually interested in some more convoluted phenomena (like the person's effort or production of ideas during these periods).
