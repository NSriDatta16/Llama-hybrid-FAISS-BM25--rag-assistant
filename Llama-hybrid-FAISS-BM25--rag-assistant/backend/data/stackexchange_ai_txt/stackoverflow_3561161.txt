How to create Swing OSGi bundles on AWT EventQueue with Spring DM

I have an OSGi target platform consisting of Equinox, the Spring Framework, Spring DM, and several custom bundles for my application. All of my bundles contain Spring application contexts and so are automatically loaded by the Spring OSGi extender. Some of my bundles contain Swing ui components. The problem is that the Spring OSGi Extender does not create these application contexts on the AWT EventQueue which results in several ui issues. The only workaround I've found so far is to create a fragment bundle for the spring-osgi-extender and configure the "taskExecutor" as mentioned here . Basically my custom taskExecutor implementation forwards all execute() calls to the AWT EventQueue. This is not really a good solution since ALL the Spring-powered bundles in my application will be created on the AWT thread, slowing down the ui at start-up (and basically killing our splash screen load status since it's starved of any refresh). Any ideas about how to create those Spring/Swing bundles on the AWT EventQueue?
