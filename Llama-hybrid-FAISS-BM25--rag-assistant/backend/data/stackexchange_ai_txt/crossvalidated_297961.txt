Your reviewer suggested the right thing which is to choose Poisson regression. And I disagree with Formite in that the reasoning to choose Poisson regression over logistic is not to approximate binomial model. This is a very poor justification. The only reason to choose Poisson regression is because you are doing a large cross-sectional study, which means the total sample including all cases and controls is a random variable following Poisson distribution, as opposed to the binomial (number of either exposed or diseased fixed) or multinomial model (total sample size fixed). Whether to choose logistic or Poisson regression depends on your sampling scheme. Logistic regression enjoys certain attractive properties such as the unbiasedness of the regression coefficient estimators under different sampling scheme including case-control sampling. That said, you could still use a logistic regression in your case, however, the resulting estimator will yield a higher variance than the one from a Poisson regression so why to use it? Additionally, odds ratio in logistic regression only gives information about the odds but not the risk or rate for each exposure group (unless the disease is rare) and in some research, the risk/rate for each exposure can be of interests. However, I'm not sure why your reviewer suggested Poisson regression based on the crude prevalence of the disease. This does not sound conventional and perhaps, you could as him/her why? Does this mean if the disease prevalence is low, you are to use logistic regression? This is a quite strange justification. Please keep me posted if you find out.
