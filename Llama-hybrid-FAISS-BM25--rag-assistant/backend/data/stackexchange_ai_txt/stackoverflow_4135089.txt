Can Joomla's article.xml file be overriden in a template?

I'm working on creating custom article parameters in Joomla 1.5 and was hacking the file /administrator/components/com_content/models/article.xml . Folks discourage hacking the core files of Joomla and now I'd like to follow good practices. So how would I override the article.xml file so that my template has its own copy with custom parameters in the Advanced section of the file?
