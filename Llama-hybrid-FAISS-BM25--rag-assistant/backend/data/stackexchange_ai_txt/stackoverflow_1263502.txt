In the book "C style: Standards and Guidelines" from David Straker (available online here ), there are some good ideas on file layout, and on the division between C file and headers. You may read the chapter 7 and specially chapter 7.4. And as John Calsbeek said, you can based your organization on how the header parts are used. If one structure, type, macro, ... is only used by one source, you can move your code there. You may have header files for the prototypes and some header file for the common declarations (type definitions, etc...)
