Center align plain text (php)

I have been asked to come up with a solution which would allow our users to create their own custom javascript dialog text. However we need it to be centered. At the moment, we have a textarea, which the user pads using spaces and tests with a preview button. I would like to change this to allow for the text to be center aligned automatically. I think this would mean just adding the spaces myself line by line in the backend, and also adding in the correct line breaks. The only way I can think of doing it, is getting the longest line as int , and then subtracting subsequent lines from it, and diving the result by two, and tacking that many spaces on front and back. Is there a cleaner more elegant way to approach this problem? Are there ways of aligning text actually inside the dialog? I had considered something like TinyMCE, but I think it's a little overkill, for what is essentially a 150 character, 4-5 line string.
