NeuralNetworks Inputs units

I want to know if is it possible to build a neural network with inputs with different units. For example, can I build a neural network using as inputs temperatures and percentage of a chemical product? If not, is it possible to split a neural network into different neural networks and combine the results or something like that? Thanks
