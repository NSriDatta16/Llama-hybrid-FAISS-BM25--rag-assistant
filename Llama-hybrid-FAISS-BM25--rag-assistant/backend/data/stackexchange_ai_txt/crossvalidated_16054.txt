Best algorithm for classifying time series motor data

I am working on a machine control project. We can measure the motor's current during operation. Sample data from two motors performing an operation successfully is below. The red trace shows the current from one motor, the blue trace the current from another. I'd like to try and come up with an algorithm for identifying problems with machine behavior. Problems could be excessively high motor current, near zero motor current, current increasing at the end of the operation, a shorter time series than normal, anything in general which doesn't look like a typical operation below. Can anyone suggest a good algorithm for achieving this? The only one I'm familiar with is a neural network. I have put an Excel file of actual data at motor currents
