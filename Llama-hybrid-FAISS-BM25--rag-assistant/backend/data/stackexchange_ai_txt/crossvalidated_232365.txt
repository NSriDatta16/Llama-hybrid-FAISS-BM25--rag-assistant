Referring to this thread and the comments on it I think that the frequentists are those that define ''probability'' of an event as the long run relative frequency of the occurence of that event. So if $n$ is the number of experiments and $n_A$ the number of occurences of event $A$ then the probability of the event $A$, denoted by $P(A)$, is defined as $$P(A):=\lim_{n\to +\infty} \frac{n_A}n$$. It is not hard to see that this definition fulfills Kolmogorov's axioms (because taking limits is linear, see also Is there any *mathematical* basis for the Bayesian vs frequentist debate? ). In order to give such a definition they must ''believe'' that this limit exists. So the frequentists are those who believe in the existence of this limit. EDIT on 31/8/2016: on the distintion between S- and P-frequentism As @amoeba distinguishes in his answer between S-frequentists and P-frequentists, where P-frequentists are the type of frequentists that I define supra, and as he also argues that it is hard to be a P-frequentist I added an EDIT section to argue that the opposite is true; I argue that all S-frequentists are P-frequentists . In the S-frequentism section @amoeba says ''this procedure succeeds in encompassing true $\theta$ with a particular long-run success frequency (particular probability).'' In his answer he also states that P-frequentists are a rare species. But this ''long-run success frequency'', used to define S-frequentism, is what he defines as P-frequentism as it is the interpretation of $P(\widehat{CI} \ni \theta)$. Therefore, according to his defintions every S-frequentist is also a P-frequentist. Therefore I conclude that P-frequentists are not so rare as argued by amoeba. There is even more; @amoeba also argues that the S-frequentists consider the unknown parameter $\theta$ as fixed or non-random, therefore one can not talk about ''probability of $\theta$ having a particluar value'', he says that ''The only thing we can do, is to come up with a procedure of constructing some interval around our estimate such that this procedure succeeds in encompassing true $\theta$ with a particular long-run success frequency (particular probability).'' May I ask what might be the origin of the name ''frequentist'' : (a) the ''non-random $\theta$''-idea or (b) the ''long-run frequency''-idea ? May I also ask @mpiktas who writes in his comment to the answer of amoeba: '' It is very hard to be a P-frequentist, because it is practically impossible to give mathematically sound definition of such probability '' If you need a defintion of P-frequentism to define the S-frequentism, how can one then be more S-frequentist than P-frequentist ?
