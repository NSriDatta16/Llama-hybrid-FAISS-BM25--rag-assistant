XGBOOST - different result between train_test_split and manually splitting

I am trying to train XGBOOST model. X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=43, stratify=y) when I'm using train_test_split and pass the model X_train, Y_train and for eval_set X_test, Y_test, The model seems to be a very good one. CM example: But when I manually split the Dataset : splitValidationIndex = round(dataset.shape[0]*0.6) splitTestIndex = round(dataset.shape[0]*0.8) X_train = X[:splitValidationIndex] y_train = y[:splitValidationIndex] Pass it to fit X_val = X[splitValidationIndex:splitTestIndex] y_val = y[splitValidationIndex:splitTestIndex] Pass it to eval_set X_test = X[splitTestIndex:] y_test = y[splitTestIndex:] Check the model prediction on that that produced a much worse model example: What am I missing/doing wrong?
