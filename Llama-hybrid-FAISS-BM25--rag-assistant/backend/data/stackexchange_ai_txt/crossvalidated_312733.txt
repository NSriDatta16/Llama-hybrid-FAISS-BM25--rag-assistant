Nope. The central limit theorem should provide some insight. Or you can appeal to the variance of a sum. If $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$ comprise your $p$ independent z-scores to average together, (mean 0, variance 1), then the mean has variance: $$\mbox{var} (\bar{X}) = \frac{1}{p^2} \sum_{i=1}^p \mbox{var}(X_i) = 1/p$$ This quantity could be scaled, however, since the sum of normals is normal, and this would meet the criteria of a Z-score.
