Maven: hibernate-entitymanager together with javaee-api break my unit tests

I'm having the two dependencies javaee-api and hibernate-entitymanager in my pom. But they don't work very well together: as soon as I add javaee-api, all my unit tests break due to java.lang.ClassFormatError: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file javax/validation/Validation . Without javaee-api, everything works fine. Why is that? (this question has been edited in order to fit the problem ;))
