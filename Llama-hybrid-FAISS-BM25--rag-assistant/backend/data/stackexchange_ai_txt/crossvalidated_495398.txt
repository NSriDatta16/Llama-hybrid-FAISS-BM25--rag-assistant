Standardizing data values

I see an example for standardizing data value here . For better illustration, the table is shown below I did the same thing in excel and as you can see, the results are different. For mean and variance, I used AVERAGE and VAR formulas, respectively in Excel. The standardized values are calculated as: 0 -> (0-2.5)/3.5 = -0.714 ... What is wrong then?
