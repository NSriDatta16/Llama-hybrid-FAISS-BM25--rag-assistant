SVM: What is relationship between the number of features and the number of dimensions?

I have implemented a support vector machine (SVM) in Python. I want to know the relationship between the number of features and the number of dimensions. My dataset contains 5 features, does it mean that my SVM classifier has 5 dimensions? Thanks
