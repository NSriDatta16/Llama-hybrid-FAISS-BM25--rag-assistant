I didn't find any way to implement this by simply with dragging and dropping. I had to implement a delegate and data source for the table of cities (from the example). The window controller is notified of the selection changes in the popup button and this updates the content on the table view delegate / data source. I actually feel this is little bit better way to implement the issue (than with bindings and array controllers) since it gives more control over special cases.
