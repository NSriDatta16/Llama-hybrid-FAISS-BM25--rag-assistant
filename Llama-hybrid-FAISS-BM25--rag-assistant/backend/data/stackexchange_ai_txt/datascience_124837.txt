Hassle-free platform for a small data science team?

our team of 4 data scientists has been exploring options to automate our ETL, data storage and model updates and are looking for a hassle-free platform that can help with this. We've had several consultancies trying to sell us expensive and complicated options like Synapse Analytics, which are an overkill. Our workflows consist mostly of data import, cleaning and export as well as model training, evaluation and generating predictions. We do the explorative analysis on local machines but once our models are finalized, we need to set them up so that the ETL and the subsequent training and predicting happen automatically. Our datasets are rather small, not more than 20-30 K observations and usually Currently, we have two of our models saving outputs to Azure datalake but we're looking for something that can also do the computation automatically based on a schedule, without it being too complicated to administer or too expensive for our small team (we're not expected to grow). Are there any other good options there?
