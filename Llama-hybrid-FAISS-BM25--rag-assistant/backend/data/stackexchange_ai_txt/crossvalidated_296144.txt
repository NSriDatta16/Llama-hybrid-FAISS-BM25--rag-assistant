Should I use an ANOVA or Chi square: I want to see if there is a difference among number of road crossings across different road types

I am currently looking at the number of road crossings made by a taxa within a certain area. This area has different road types. Road type A takes up the majority of the roads in the area and Road type D has only 1 road within the area. So if I had to look at the total road crossings per road type it is skewed (e.g. 100km for Road type A vs. 1km for Road type D); and because of this I wanted to take the length of the road types into account. So far I have split my data up into two ways (the first made sense to me initially, but then I began to second guess this) and am getting very different results in R. I have given a short example of my set up below for each method: I assume that if there is an interaction between road length and road type I should be getting the same result as the chi square test but I am not. Please forgive my naive understanding of stats. I simply want to answer the question: Is there a difference between the number of road crossings across the road types (while accounting for the fact that there are more roads in one type compared to another)? Any advice would be much appreciated.
