The code that you wrote is working. It is just not very readable/maintainable. Declaring the variable a inside the scope of the if may give the false impression that a is only visible inside this scope (which, as this program shows, is not true - a will be visible throughout the whole function). This JsLint warning encourages you to place the declaration at the exact scope where the variable is actually used, as follows: function test(){ var a; if(true){ a = 5; } alert(a); }
