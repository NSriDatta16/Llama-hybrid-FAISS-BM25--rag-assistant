Anytime you can offload logic onto a resource that doesn't need to be recompiled to change behavior of your program, you're doing well for yourself. Of course, with anything, this practice is best when moderated appropriately, but anytime you're doing something that you see changing frequently or at the whim of individual users, consider offload the logic and data that drives it into a plist. Finally, considering the phenomenal support AppKit provides for working with plists (in many cases one line of code turns an on-disk file into an in-memory data structure), you'd be hard pressed to find solid justification for using other data storage methods unless you're storing gigabytes of data or doing massive cross-structure queries.
