A hashing function does do what you're looking for - it takes some input x and generates a digest d that will be the same whenever you give it input x again. A better definition from wikipedia , that explains this property: Determinism A hash procedure must be deterministicâ€”meaning that for a given input value it must always generate the same hash value. In other words, it must be a function of the hashed data, in the mathematical sense of the term. This requirement excludes hash functions that depend on external variable parameters, such as pseudo-random number generators that depend on the time of day. It also excludes functions that depend on the memory address of the object being hashed, if that address may change during processing (as may happen in systems that use certain methods of garbage collection), although sometimes rehashing of the item can be done. However, if this is for password retrieval, I would advise against it. Instead, I would recommend the approach of sending them a link to reset their password, and then have them reset their password.
