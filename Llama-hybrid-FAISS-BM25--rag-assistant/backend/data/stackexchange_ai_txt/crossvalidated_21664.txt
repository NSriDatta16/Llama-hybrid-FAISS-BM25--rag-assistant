I am an electrical engineer and not a statistician. I spent a lot of time to go through Gelman but I don't think one can refer to Gelman as introductory at all. My bayesian-guru professor from Carnegie Mellon agrees with me on this. having the minimum knowledge of statistics and R and Bugs(as the easy way to DO something with Bayesian stat) Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS is an amazing start. You can compare all offered books easily by their book cover! 5 years later update: I want to add that perhaps one other major way of learning in a fast way(40 mins) is to go through the documentation of a Bayesian Net GUI based tool such as Netica 2 . It starts with basics, walks you through the steps of building a net based on a situation and data, and how to run your own questions back and forth to "get it!".
