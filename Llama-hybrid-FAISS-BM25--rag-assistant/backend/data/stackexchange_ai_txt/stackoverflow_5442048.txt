PHP loop with set intervals

I have the following code that converts my twitter account rss feed into a string so that I can parse my followers user names. $url = file_get_contents("MY_TWITTER_RSS_FEED_URL_GOES_HERE"); $source = simplexml_load_string($url); foreach ($source as $match){ //name of node $username = "&nbsp@".$match->author->name; //removes the name and parentheses ex.kyrober555 (Robert) $usernames = substr($username, 0, strpos($username, ' ')); //returns usernames only ex.kyrober555 echo $usernames; } Using the foreach loop I return all 15 names from the feed and it looks like this. @ajay54 @marymary770 @funnigurl1209 @jimiwhitten @kyroberthl @tree_bear @crftyldy @sanbrt63 @Sandra516 @DreamFog @KravenSwagNBzz @DreamFog @TheCrippledDuck @TheCrippledDuck @Cass60 Now here is what I would like to do, but I am not sure if its possible, and I wouldn'y know how so I ask for your help. When I load the page for this php file it returns all user names at once. What I would like to do is return 5 user names then do something then return 5 more then do something else then return the last 5. Maybe something like this but I don't know... foreach ($source as $match){ /* Return the 1st 5 user names */ /* do some other type of coding */ /* Return the second set of 5 usernames */ /* do something here */ /* return the last 5 usernames */ } Ultimately returning all 15 user names, but at different intervals not all at once.
