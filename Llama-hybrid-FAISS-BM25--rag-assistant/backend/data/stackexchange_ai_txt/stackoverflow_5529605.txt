Distinguish between Classes and Objects. Define a Class Class Truck extends Vehicle { private SteeringWheel mySteerer; } Here we see that when we create a Truck Object it has-a SteeringWheel . A composition relationship. Now, where is the Class definition of the SteeringWheel ? So far you don't know. It could be in a separate Class file: Class SteeringWheel { // stuff } Or alternatively we could make it an inner class: Class Truck extends Vehicle { private SteeringWheel mySteerer; private Class SteeringWheel { // some stuff } } In either case, we still have Composition. The thing that the Inner Class is giving us is a structure in the code, by making it an Inner Class we restrict the scope of the SteeringWheel class, it's only visible in the Truck class. So Inner Classes are primarily a tool for organizing the implementation - good code organization aids maintenance.
