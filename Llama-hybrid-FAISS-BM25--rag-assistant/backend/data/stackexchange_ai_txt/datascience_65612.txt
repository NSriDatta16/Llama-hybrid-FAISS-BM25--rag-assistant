Yes its called correlation clustering. Even though correlation can cause problems with many clustering algorithms by giving extra weight on these attributes, it would be best to drop highly correlated variables for example with PCA However, there exist correlation clustering algorithms that are meant to process data containing multiple correlations, and cluster objects based on the correlations they exhibit, using your problem exactly to an advantage.
