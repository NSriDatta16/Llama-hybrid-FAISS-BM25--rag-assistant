A simple way to do this is to sum the pixel values in each column (going down) to create a single array (the same width as your input image) of average values. Starting in the middle of the array, search for the minimum value. This will be the column where you can split the image. This column probably won't be the center of the gap between your blobs. You can do another outward search from this column, going left first to find all similar columns, and then going right. ------------------------- ----WWW---------WWWWW---- ---WWWWWWW----WWWWWW----- -----WWWW-------WWW------ ------------------------- col avg: ---wwWWwww-----wWWWWww--- Depending on how blank the space is (pixel value wise) between the two blobs, you can set your threshold value pretty low. If there is some noise, it will have to be a little higher. Finding the right threshold value can be a chore, unless you can determine it algorithmically.
