What does it mean that high dimensional integration is difficult?

When we say numerical integration is difficult for high dimensional problems, what do we mean by high dimensional? For example, in the Bayesian framework, the marginal normalizing constant can be hard to compute. Does 'high dimensional' simply refer to the infinite integration range under which no closed form expression for the integral can be obtained? What are the remedies in such cases and why? Are there any exceptions where closed form solution could be obtained?
