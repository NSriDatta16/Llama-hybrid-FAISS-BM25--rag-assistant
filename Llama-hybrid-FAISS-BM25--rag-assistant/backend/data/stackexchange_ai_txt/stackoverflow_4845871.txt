Firstly, use jonearles suggestion about bind variables. If a lot of your code is like this, with 1000 concurrent users, I'd hate to think what performance is like. Secondly, if it is busy then there is a chance of time-outs. As you say, if an exception is encountered then it falls back to the "updateNewUserFav" Really, it should only call that if NO exception is raised. If an exception is raised, the function should fail. The current code is similar to "TURN THE IGNITION KEY TO START THE CAR" "IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, RING GARAGE AND BOOK APPOINTMENT" "PUT CAR INTO GEAR AND RELEASE HAND_BRAKE" You really only want to release the hand-brake once the car has successfully started, otherwise you'll end up rolling down the hill until the sudden stop at the end (often involving an expensive CRUNCH sound).
