MCMC convergence with spBayes

I am running spBayes to fit a model like y ~ ID + 0 and I am using an exponential model for the spatial component. I am a bit confused on the outcome of the MCMC simulation. In particular while the nugget, partial sill and the covariates' parameters seem to have converged (the trace plots show good mixing) this doesn't seem to be true for the range. Is this the case? If yes, how can I solve this problem? Thanks
