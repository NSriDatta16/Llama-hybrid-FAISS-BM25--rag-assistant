Making sense of the Gain term in Gradient tree boosting

In the XGBoost Documentation they specify the Gain term as \begin{equation} Gain=\frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{G_L^2}{H_L+\lambda} + \frac{G_R^2}{H_R+\lambda}- \frac{(G_L+G_R)^2}{H_L+H_R+\lambda}\right]-\gamma \end{equation} Furthermore, it is stated that if the gain is smaller than $\gamma$ , we would do better not to add that branch But why is that true? Also, how do I pick which feature/node to split? (In CART, for example, you simply scan through all features and all thresholds) EDIT: perhaps they mean that the term is smaller than zero, and not $\gamma$ , which makes things clearer
