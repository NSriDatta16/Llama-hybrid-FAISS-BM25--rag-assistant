As indicated by Wikipedia's reference to Bayesian intervals as an alternative, confidence intervals are really based in a frequentist interpretation of probability. You are correct that u(X) and v(X) are methods for constructing bounds. The first definition says that if those methods are applied in very many cases, then in a proportion γ of cases the interval will contain the parameter θ. The second definition refers to a single application of the methods, the interval either does or does not contain the parameter θ; under the frequentist paradigm it doesn't make sense to talk of the probability of a single completed event.
