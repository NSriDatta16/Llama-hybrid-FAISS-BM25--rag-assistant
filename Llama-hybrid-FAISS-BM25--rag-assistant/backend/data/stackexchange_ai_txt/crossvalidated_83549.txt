Statistics question on interpreting my results for sampling distribution

The weights of pennies minted after 1982 are approximately normally distributed with mean 2.46 grams and standard deviation 0.02 grams. What is the probability that in a simple random sample of 10 pennies minted after 1982, we obtain a sample mean of at least 2.465 grams? I found out that the answer is 0.2148, but I don't know how to interpret my result. I know that if I take 100 of these pennies about 21 of them will result in a sample mean of at least 2.465, but when I say this it makes little sense. Am I saying that I am averaging 21 of these pennies to be at least 2.465 grams? Are they averaged randomly? What's a better interpretation? The probability that a randomly selected penny will have a sample mean of 2.465 grams is 21.48%? When I say this, I still can't make sense of the wording.
