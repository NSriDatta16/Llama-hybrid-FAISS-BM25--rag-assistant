What is the 95% confidence interval for E(Y)?

A research team studied Y, the percentage of voters in favor of a candidate. The random variable Y had standard deviation o = 50%. A random sample of 800 voters was selected, and their average was y-bar(800) = 52.3%. What is the 95% confidence interval for E(Y)? The answer is: 52.3% +- 3.46%. Can anyone help me figure out how to find this answer? I don't know the formula to find it.
