In this example http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/directions-draggable.html you will see the following line: google.maps.event.addListener(directionsDisplay, 'directions_changed', function() { computeTotalDistance(directionsDisplay.directions); }); I hope this helps. Thanks for asking that question because I wasn't aware of such a listener.
