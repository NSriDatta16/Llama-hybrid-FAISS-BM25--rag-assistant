How to make IQueryable work with a reqular IQueryable?

I am using Linq2SQL and working with a legacy system. The system was built in .Net but without a datalayer so I am transcoding it so that it will have one. I have a linq query that looks like this... var data = from p in db.tblPeoples orderby p.strLastName,p.strFirstName select new { guidPersonId = p.guidPersonId, strFirstName = p.strFirstName, strLastName = p.strLastName, strRank = p.tblCodesRank.strDescription, strPhone = p.strPhone, strEmail = p.strEmail, strOffice = p.tblOrganization.strAcronym, RolesList = p.tblRoles }; and when I check the signature of the var it is an IQueryable and I have no idea what that is. In my datalayer I have this returning as an IQueryable, but when I try to use the datalayer version and then do a .where on the returned dataset to search on it, I get errors that I Cannot convert lambda expresstion to type 'string' because it is not a delegate type. What should I do about this? I am trying to create code reuse and use my datalayer version that is already written. the data layer version looks like this: public static IQueryable RetrieveAllPeople() { var data = from p in db.tblPeoples orderby p.strLastName, p.strFirstName select new { guidPersonId = p.guidPersonId, strFirstName = p.strFirstName, strLastName = p.strLastName, strRank = p.tblCodesRank.strDescription, strPhone = p.strPhone, strEmail = p.strEmail, strOffice = p.tblOrganization.strAcronym, RolesList = p.tblRoles }; return data; }
