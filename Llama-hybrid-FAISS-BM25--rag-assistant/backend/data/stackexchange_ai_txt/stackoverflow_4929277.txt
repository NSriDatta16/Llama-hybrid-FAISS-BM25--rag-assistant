Your view model doesn't need to know anything at all about the physical position of your cards, if you design your view properly. Here's a pretty simple example. The default styles I've created for TextBlock and Border control how large they are, and (through the negative margin) how they overlap when they're stacked together. The ItemsControl uses a horizontal StackPanel for layout. If you adopt this approach, you can position the items controls wherever they need to be positioned in the view (me, I'd use some combination of dock panels and margins to organize that), and either have a different collection in your view model for each items control to bind to. It's a bit more complicated, maybe, but you could also have a single collection of card objects and bind each ItemsControl 's ItemsSource to a CollectionView that filtered on some property of the card. The nice thing about that is that you can "move" a card from one place to another just by changing the value of that property. In either case, you'll see that once you make the items controls responsible for managing the layout of their content, you can move them around in the view freely without having to touch your view model.
