Geometrically, whenever $v_1$ is a unit (column) vector, left multiplication of any column vector $x$ by v1 %*% t(v1) (which is $v_1 \cdot v_1'$) is the projection of $x$ onto $v_1$. In this application, $v_1$ is the first principal component of a centered matrix of columns. Therefore, this code computes the projection of the centered columns onto their first principal component . Continuing the illustrations at Bottom to top explanation of the Mahalanobis distance? , which describes this procedure in more detail, we may depict it in the two-column situation as starting with and, after finding the center and principal axis of these points as described there, doing this: The gray arrows depict the process of (orthogonal) projection; the blue points are the results of this projection. They all lie along the principal axis and everything is done using the point of averages (in red) as the origin. A similar illustration appears at the end of JD Long's explanation of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/2700 .
