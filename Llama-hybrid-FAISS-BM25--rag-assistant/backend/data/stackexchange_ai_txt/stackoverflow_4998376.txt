Entity Framework 4.0, PoCo & Navigation Properties for Lookup Tables

I have the following Models DeltaDirectionType, int Id string Name Delta, int Id string Name DeltaDirectionType DeltaDirectionType Double Value Trade int Id DateTime BusinessDate IList deltas So DeltaDirectionType is a lookup table, Trade holds a collection of Deltas In the database it is implemented as follows DeltaDirectionTypes Id int Name varchar(max) Deltas Id int Name varchar(max) DeltaDirectionType_Id int Trade_Id int Value float Trades Id int BusinessDate DateTime Delta_Id int When I generate the model from code for the Edmx file, and (un check the foreign keys) as my model does not have properties for these. I am having problem with the navigation properties. Something like this in nHibernate would be a simple one to many mapping for the DeltaDirectionType and Delta and a many to many for Delta and Trades however, how do I firstly get it to recognise that DeltaDirectionType is a lookup and secondly get the Icollection to work for me. I am struggling with this, Entity Framework does not make it easy for you. I have tried the usual, delete the navigation property that EF puts in for you on one side, but then you get some mapping fragments errors, properties not mapped etc. Please help or point in the right direction. Lookup tables are real life problems, not sure why it is so hard withing EF to implement. Any help much appreciated Thanks
