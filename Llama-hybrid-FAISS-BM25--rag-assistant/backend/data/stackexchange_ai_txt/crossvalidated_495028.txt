Are SHAP feature importance measures biased towards variables with many potential cut points?

Variable importance measures in Random Forests can be biased towards variables with more categories, even using permutation-based methods: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-8-25 Does this also apply to feature importance as measured by SHAP (in eg xgboost)?
