As mentioned by previous answers, Stan, JAGS, and WinBUGS require that priors be specified as mathematical functions. If you've already got an MCMC-represented posterior from a previous analysis, and you want to use that MCMC posterior as a prior for subsequent data, you must approximate the MCMC posterior in a mathematical form. Unless you have a simple model with conjugate priors, the mathematical approximation of the MCMC distribution will be only an approximation. As was implicit in Bjorn's answer, it's important to include the correlations of the parameters from the MCMC distribution in the mathematical approximation for the prior. Finally, if the previous data and the novel data have exactly the same structure and you're using exactly the same model, then you can get an exact answer by combining the two data sets and running the model just once on the combined data.
