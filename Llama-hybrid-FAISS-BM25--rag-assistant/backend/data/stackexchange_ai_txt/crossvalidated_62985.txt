Formulate a sampling model (or preferably, a bunch) in which the null hypothesis is true. Try the model used in the Bayesian adaptive part, plus different dependence structures, missing covariates, anything that breaks model assumptions in plausible ways -- especially ways that might inflate the "success" rate under the Bayesian model. Simulate the trial under each of these different models a large number of times, say 10,000 or 100,000. The relative frequency with which the trial gets >59 successful patients is a Monte Carlo estimate of the Type I error rate under the assumed model.
