CNN model overfitting to a Color, not learning edges

I've been working on this binary classifier which predicts if a certain type of battery is in the live webcam feed or not. The problem I am facing is that my CNN model predicts any 'orange object' in the frame as a battery. It can't tell the difference between an orange pair of scissors and a cuboidal orange battery. Also, sometimes it detects a human as a battery too. Battery Image: https://robu.in/product/orange-5200mah-3s-40c80c-lithium-polymer-battery-pack-lipo/ I've tried several CNNs like, A) Classic CNN with ~10 layers (3x(Conv2D, MaxPooling), 2xDense along with a few BatchNormalization and Dropout layers) --Validation Accuracy ~92% B) Concatenation of two NN (1. using canny edge filter on my complete dataset 2. With the colored images) --Validation accuracy C) MobileNet on Colored Images D) ResNet E) AlexNet etc... I've tried Data Augmentation(Using Grayscale images, Adding/Subtracting Pixel values, etc.) All images are of size 150Ã—150 Total image dataset of ~200 images How should I tackle this problem of color overfitting?
