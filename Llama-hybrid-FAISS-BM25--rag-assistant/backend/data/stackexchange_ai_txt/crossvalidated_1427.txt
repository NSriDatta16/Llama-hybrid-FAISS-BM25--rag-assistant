Time-series data pre-aggregated into non-stationary rolling 12-month periods: are there special considerations for modeling?

I'm exploring the use of changepoint detection or other methods (am slowly becoming aware of wavelet transformation, etc. but have tons to learn in this area) to identify key shifts in health care performance patterns over time. However, many of the metrics I'm seeking to analyze (e.g., health care quality metrics) are both generally calculated and more reasonably interpreted as rolling-12 month aggregates. For example, it's important to me to track on a monthly basis the proportion of patients who are up-to-date on a certain lab test within the 12-month period ending that month, but I'm not particularly concerned with how many of these tests occurred specifically in August. So it's something sort of like having a moving average to work with as a raw starting point. That said, there are also reasons why this rolling-12 aggregation does not result in a stationary process either. My thought was to account for the data structure and seasonality by modeling it as a function of a 1-month and 12-month lag. Is this the proper way to think about this data? Is there anything else or a better approach I should be doing/considering? Again, my general goal is surveillance of the general trend as well as breaks -- so if it affects the answer, I'm looking at this in the context of using the R strucchange package, CUSUM statistics, or some other approach to identify good and bad anomalies. Thanks, Shelby
