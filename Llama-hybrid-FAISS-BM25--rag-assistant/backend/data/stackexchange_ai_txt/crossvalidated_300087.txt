Neural Network gives exact same values of previous day for 1 day ahead prediction

I have hourly data for 365 days, and I would like to train a neural network model for 7 days and predict 8th day hourly data. It is a time series 24-h ahead regression problem. I am also applying such an approach instead of predicting all day data I am predicting each hour, so my neural network model has 1 output and 6 inputs. We can think that each days and each hours are features. I am training the model as follows Xtrain = Day-1 Hour-1, Day-2 Hour-1 ... Day-6 Hour-1 (6 sample,1 feature), Ytrain = Day-7 Hour-1, after training I am giving Day-7 Hour-1 to predict Day-8 Hour-1 Xtrain = Day-2 Hour-1, Day-3 Hour-1 ... Day-7 Hour-1 (6 sample, 1 feature), Ytrain = Day-8 Hour-1, after training I am giving Day-8 Hour-1 to predict Day-9 Hour-1 After I predict all hour-1 values I am repeating this for Hour-2, Hour-3 ... Hour-24. This procedure goes up to 365 days. First of all, Is this approach valid? The problem is, the model predicts the exact same values of previous day. Why do you think this happens, what might be the issue? I have also tried training with l2 regularizer, but results are almost same. NN --> 6 Inputs -> 12 Hidden Neuron -> 1 Output. Using Adam optimizer, 5k Epochs and RandomUniform Initializer. EDIT: Same happened if I use choose 8 random hourly value as feature for each day as Xtrain = D1-h6 D1-h8 D1-h10 D1-h12 D1-h14 D1-h16 D1-h18 D1-h20 ... D2 ..... D6 Ytrain = D7 h1 to h24 Xtest = D2-h6 D2-h8 D2-h10 D2-h12 D2-h14 D2-h16 D2-h18 D2-h20 ... D3 ..... D7 Predict = D8 h1 to h24 D8 values are exactly the same with D7 values.
