Most meaningful way to compare multiple time series

I need to write a program that performs arithmetic (+-*/) on multiples time series of different date range (mostly from 2007-2009) and frequency (weekly, monthly, yearly...). I came up with: find the series with the highest freq. then fill in the other series with zeros so they have the same number of elements. then perform the operation. How can I present the data in the most meaningful way? Trying to think of all the possibilities
