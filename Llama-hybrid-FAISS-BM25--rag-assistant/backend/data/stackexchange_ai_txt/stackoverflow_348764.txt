Asp.net - what are the best latest tools /frameworks, etc to look at . .

Ok, i have done a bunch of asp as well as asp.net right when it came out. A friend is starting a non profit organization and he wants me to put together a site for him. I figured i would kill 2 birds with one stone and look to freshen up my skills on the latest that the web has to offer in asp.net, web 2.0, etc. The site requirements are pretty simple: Organization mission statement Users ability to register Photos, content Blog posts Ability to donate directly on the site (maybe through paypal) So my questions is what are the best tools to start here given its going to be hosted on windows ASP.net platform 3.5. Any other frameworks that i should be looking at. Where is the best place to start? I could easily build the site just putting a table together and a bunch of static pages but i figured if it made sense to utilize and help freshen my skills, it would be worth the efforts of the learning curve. Feel free to suggest any other items that i haven't listed.
