what does space of all models means

In one of the Lectures taken at Wroclaw University of Technology, the instructor defines machine learning in three steps: - 1) Defines a space of all possible models 2) Learns the parameters and structure of models from data 3) make predictions and decisions In my understanding,each set of values for the parameters would correspond to a separate model (as a result, a model space is created when we consider all sets of parameter values). Further, the set of parameter values for which test accuracy is maximum is the best model. Then what is being done in step (1) in the name of defining a space of all possible models In particular, what does "space of models" means and how is it obtained
