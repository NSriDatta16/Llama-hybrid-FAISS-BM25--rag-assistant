Now you have data, and it is somewhat late for a power analysis, if not for a future confirmation experiment. The hypothesis of equal proportions in three groups is the hypothesis of homogeneity in a contingency table. You data is (I am using R ): yourtable G1 G2 G3 x 37 55 32 total 213 344 210 The proportions are sapply(as.data.frame(yourtable), function(x) x[1]/x[2]) G1 G2 G3 0.1737089 0.1598837 0.1523810 For the homogeneity test we need this in the form of a contingency table: con.table so there is no evidence against homogeneity, but you need evidence for homogeneity. I would first go for confidence intervals, which can be calculated via logistic regression: my.df logmod logmod Call: glm(formula = cbind(x, `n-x`) ~ 0 + G, family = binomial, data = my.df) Coefficients: GG1 GG2 GG3 -1.560 -1.659 -1.716 Degrees of Freedom: 3 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual Null Deviance: 385 Residual Deviance: -3.553e-14 AIC: 22.08 > confint(logmod) Waiting for profiling to be done... 2.5 % 97.5 % GG1 -1.928812 -1.217750 GG2 -1.957458 -1.379635 GG3 -2.110139 -1.354896 You could backtransform that confidence interval to probability scale, and see if it is close enough for your purposes. Else you would need to collect more data,sample size calculations could be based on simulations from this model, or look at ideas from Experimental Design on Testing Proportions or Sample size for logistic regression? For experiments with the code, here is a textual representation of yourtable : dput(yourtable) structure(c(37, 213, 55, 344, 32, 210), .Dim = 2:3, .Dimnames = list( c("x", "total"), c("G1", "G2", "G3")))
