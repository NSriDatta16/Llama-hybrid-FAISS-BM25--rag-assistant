How to simulate a rich text view?

I want to simulate this kind of rich text view: (From twitter for iPad) Only the text with the button on the link. ;) How can I place a button on the link? or make the link look as cool as this? I would like to have this kind of view but I have to be able to select text even id the view is not in editing mode (this is not possible in Twitter app), but when editing it it does not have to be that fancy. A simple UITextView should be enough. Any ideas how can I achieve this or is there a library out there I can use? I don't want to use UIWebView since I want to have at least 9 of this views and maybe UIWebView is slow? Thanks EDIT : In early versions (iOS2.x) there was a undocumented API in UITextView: [myTextView setContentToHTMLString:@" Content In HTML Other Paragraph "]; that still works in iOS4.2! (simulator test). But probably my app will be rejected;( I also have found this article that support the theory that UITextView still supports HTML but the API is not public: http://www.lazyrobot.org.uk/2010/06/rich-text-on-iphone.html#comment-form
