I use emacs-autocomplete.el (version 0.2.0) together with yasnippet. Works ok for me, although it isn't a complete auto-completion environment like eclipse+java is. But enough for a common emacs hacker like me :) 1) Download autocomplete from here (first link) and put it in your load-path directory. Also download the extensions you want to use (Attention: Ruby and etags extensions need additional stuff). Put them also in yout load-path dir. 2) Download yasnippet and install it like the instruction on that page says (including the (require ...) part). 3) Put these lines in your .emacs file and edit them for your needs (like all the extensions you want to use): (require 'auto-complete) (global-auto-complete-mode t) (when (require 'auto-complete nil t) (require 'auto-complete-yasnippet) (require 'auto-complete-python) (require 'auto-complete-css) (require 'auto-complete-cpp) (require 'auto-complete-emacs-lisp) (require 'auto-complete-semantic) (require 'auto-complete-gtags) (global-auto-complete-mode t) (setq ac-auto-start 3) (setq ac-dwim t) (set-default 'ac-sources '(ac-source-yasnippet ac-source-abbrev ac-source-words-in-buffer ac-source-files-in-current-dir ac-source-symbols)) For more informations on options see the auto-complete.el file. 4) Restart emacs or do a M-x load-file with your .emacs file. Write some code and press TAB for auto completion.
