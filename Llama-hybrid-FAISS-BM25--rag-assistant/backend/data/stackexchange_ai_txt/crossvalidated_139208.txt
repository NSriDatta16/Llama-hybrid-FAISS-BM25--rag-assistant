When I see "dependent or independent variables", I do not think of "statistically independent", but rather experimentation and modeling, where there are dependent and independent variables. [Edited per amoeba's comment.] So if you are doing a regression to predict electricity usage, electricity usage would be your dependent (target) value. Other measurements (temperature, etc) and lagged values for these measurements (temperature two hours ago, or temperature same time yesterday) and of the electricity usage itself (usage two hours ago, usage same time yesterday) would be your independent variables. If you are asking if each hour's electricity usage is independent of other values, Dilip Sarwate's comment is correct: time series like this have autocorrelation and an hour is not independent of the previous hour.
