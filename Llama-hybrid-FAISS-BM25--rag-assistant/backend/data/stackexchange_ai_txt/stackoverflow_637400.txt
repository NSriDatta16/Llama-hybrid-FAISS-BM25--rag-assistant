I don't think you can. One of the basic principles of Java is security, and if you were able to embed an innocuous Windows program like Notepad, what's to stop someone else from embedding some kind of a virus in the applet? Not to mention, standalone programs aren't really embeddable in anything. You'd need to have some kind of embeddable widget - that exists for, say, Excel (that's how you can get spreadsheet boxes in MS Word documents) but not for every program out there.
