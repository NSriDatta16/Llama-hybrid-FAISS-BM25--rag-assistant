Fragment empty when hidden then shown

Ok, this is odd. I am having a problem with the fragment manager with add and replace. So, instead im just loading all of my fragments, and hiding them (which is only 3 fragments). Well, on one of the fragments, if I dont hide it, it works fine. But, if I hide it, then show it again, its just an empty black space. Anyone else run into this issue?
