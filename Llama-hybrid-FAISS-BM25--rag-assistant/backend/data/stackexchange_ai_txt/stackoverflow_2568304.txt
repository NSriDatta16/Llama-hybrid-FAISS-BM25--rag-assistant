The actual issue turned out to be a working feature within Portal. Specifically, Portal's action protection which prevents the same action from being submitted twice, while keeping the navigational ability of the portal. There is a cache that retains the actions results for every successful action and uses them to compare and reject duplicates. The issue for us was the fact that we required "longer than normal" user sessions (60+ minutes) and with 1,000+ concurrent users, we leaked out on this protection mechanism after just a couple hours. IBM recommended that we just shut off the cache entirely using the following portlet.xml configuration entry: wps.multiple.action.execution = true This allows double submits, which may or may not harm business functionality. However, our internal Portal framework already contained a mechanism to prevent double submits, so this was not an issue for us. At our request, IBM did come back with a patch for this issue which makes the cache customizeable, that is, let's you configure the number of action results that you store in cache for each user and thus you can leverage Portal's mechanism again, at a reduced session overhead. Those portal configuration settings were: wps.multiple.action.cache.bound.enabled = true wps.multiple.action.cache.key.maxsize = 40 wps.multiple.action.cache.value.maxsize = 10 You'll need to contact IBM about this patch as it is not currently in a released fixpack.
