The best pragmatical way is creating a working thread. In general exist another documented way, which I can explain on the example of unmanaged code. During initialization a windows service have a small time to do this. This time can be change somewhere in registry. If service need more if can call SetServiceStatus with dwCurrentState=SERVICE_START_PENDING some dwCheckPoint and dwWaitHint , of SERVICE_STATUS struct filled so that dwWaitHint is The estimated time required for a pending start operation in milliseconds. Before the specified amount of time has elapsed, the service should make its next call to the SetServiceStatus function with either an incremented dwCheckPoint value or a change in dwCurrentState . See description of dwWaitHint on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685996(VS.85).aspx .
