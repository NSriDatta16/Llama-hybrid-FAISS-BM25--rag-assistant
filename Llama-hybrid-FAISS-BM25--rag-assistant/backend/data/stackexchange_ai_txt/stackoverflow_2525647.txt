Drag and Drop from Flash/Flex to HTML and Vice-Versa

Is there a library simplifying the process of dragging and dropping between the Flash/Flex environment and the surrounding browser? I've done some research on the process, and so far the closest thing that I have found is from HTML to Flash in a Floorplanning application . I have yet to find a demo going in the other direction however. Is there a simpler way to do this now?
