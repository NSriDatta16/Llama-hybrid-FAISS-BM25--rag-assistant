SVM training method (or alg.)

I'm using SVM classification (Matlab) within my research works, and I want to know: The advantages and disadvantages of each training algorithm, i.e., SMO, LS and QP In general case, what is the suitable algorithm? If the choice of one of them can impact the classification performance? If the are any relationship between the choice of training method (or algorithm) and the choice of the kernel function.
