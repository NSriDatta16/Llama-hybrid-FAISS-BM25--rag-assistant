Hypothesis testing time series using permutation tests

I am performing a permutation (exact) test on some data and would like a sound check or to be schooled if what I’m doing is statistically valid or not. I have multiple time series that might experience an event on any given day which leads to my hypothesis that on any given day the event occurs the day-to-day percentage change will have greater standard deviation than that on days where the event does not occur. H0: σno_event ≥ σevent HA: σno_event To test my hypothesis I randomly sample 3000 samples of days where the event occurred and 3000 samples where the event did not occur (recording the percentage change). I then run a permutation test where I run 10000 iterations where samples are combined, shuffled and then put into two random n=3000 samples. The standard deviation is calculated for both and the difference in stdv is calculated, if this test statistic is greater than the observed difference (stdv of event - stdv of no event) then I increment a counter. At the end of the test I calculate the p value as being the # of times the test statistic is greater than the observed difference / 10000. If the p value is greater than my alpha value I reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the stdvs.
