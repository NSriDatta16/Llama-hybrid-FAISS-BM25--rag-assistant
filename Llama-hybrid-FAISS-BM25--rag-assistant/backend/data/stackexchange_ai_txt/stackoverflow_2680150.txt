As Mark Wilkins says, this is a workable plan with whatever regex-handy scripting tool you prefer, but I'd suggest a couple of additional points: Use two scripts: one to translate your list into a regexes, and another to apply them. Trying to do both jobs in one script is asking for trouble. Don't forget to change the #include directives and rename the header files at the same time. If you know how to change one thing in N files, then, heck, you can just loop over the K things you want to change. It's not the most efficient way in terms of processor time, but that's not the bottleneck here. This approach will work in theory, but if it works in practice on the first try then your code base is cleaner than anything (that size) I've ever seen. There will almost certainly be little surprises: a hard-coded path that doesn't match the regex, a bad name that collides with a good name, some other glitch nobody would have thought of. I suggest starting small, with one or two pairs of names, compiling after every replacement, and retreating in case of trouble. If you do this right you can set it up to run overnight and in the morning you'll have a working code base that's almost done, and a list of the names that caused trouble and need human attention.
