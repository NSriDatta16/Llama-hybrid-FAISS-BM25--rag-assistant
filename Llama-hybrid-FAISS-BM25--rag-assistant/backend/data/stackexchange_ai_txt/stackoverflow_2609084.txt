How can I subsample data from a time series with LINQ to SQL?

I have a database table full of time points and experimental values at those time points. I need to retrieve the values for an experiment and create a thumbnail image showing an XY plot of its data. Because the actual data set for each experiment is potentially 100,000 data points and my image is only 100 pixels wide, I want to sample the data by taking every nth time point for my image and ignoring the rest. My current query (which retrieves all the data without sampling) is something simple like this: var points = from p in db.DataPoints where p.ExperimentId == myExperimentId orderby p.Time select new { X = p.Time, Y = p.Value } So, how can I best take every nth point from my result set in a LINQ to SQL query?
