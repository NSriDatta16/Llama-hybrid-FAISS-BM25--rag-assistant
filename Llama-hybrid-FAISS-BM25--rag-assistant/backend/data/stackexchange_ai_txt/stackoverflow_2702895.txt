From the "Gang of Four" (GOF) "Design Patterns" book: Memento: for "undo" operations Prototype: to simplify the creation of diagrammatic objects (while promoting composition over inheritance) There was also a PLOP pattern called "Product Trader" which can be helpful for deserializing saved files (such as diagram files) - so that they can be loaded back into memory. Of course there are other patterns that apply to any kind of UI, such as "Chain of Responsibility" (GOF), but those are usually "provided" to you by the UI framework that you are developing with.
