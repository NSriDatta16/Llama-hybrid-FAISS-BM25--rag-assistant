Dealing with zeros when computing proportional change

I'm attempting to investigate the independence of the proportion of dividend payouts which is not linked to the movement of the stock index. The data I have is in the form of a list of dividend payouts for given dates and also a time series of the price of the stock index. My current attempt is as follows: Since we are interested in movement, we have to look at some form of daily change. Since we are dealing with stocks, proportional change seems to most appropriate. Hence, we compute the proportional change of the stock index. To see the proportional change of the dividend, I first convert it into a time series by forwards filling the data, and then calculate the proportional change. Obviously this is zero for many days. We want to see the part of the movement which is independent from the movement of the index, and so we linearly regress the proportional change of each stock against the proportional change of the index and are left with some residuals. Let's suppose we have two stocks, A and B. We want the residuals of A and B to be uncorrelated, since this would suggest that the residuals are just random noise, and not linked to some additional factor. Hence we compute the correlation between the residuals of A and B and hope this is small. My problem is: When computing the proportional change from day to day: $$ \frac{x_i-x_{i-1}}{x_{i-1}} $$ We obviously have some issues dealing with the case $x_{i-1}=0$. If $x_i = 0$ then we have a $-100\%$ decrease, but the opposite obviously won't encode an infinite proportional increase. What would be the best approach to get around this problem? Is considering proportional returns the right thing to do? Thanks
