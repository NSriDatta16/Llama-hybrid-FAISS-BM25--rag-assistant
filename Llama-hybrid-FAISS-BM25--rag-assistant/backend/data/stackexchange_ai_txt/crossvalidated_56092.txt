Feature Selection Packages in R, which do both regression and classification

I am very new to R. I am learning machine learning right now. Very sorry, if this question appears to be very basic. I am trying to find a good feature selection package in R. I went through Boruta package. It is a good package but I read that it is only useful for classification. I want to do implement feature selection in R for regression tasks. I went through the caret package documentation but for my level, it is very difficult to understand. Can any one please point me to a good tutorial or list any good packages or most frequently used packages in R for feature selection. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
