I do not think either the Sun or IBM JVM can do this (I know that the AS/400 one can, but that is most likely not relevant to you). I would suggest using Java WebStart (and before you discard this, then notice that it has been updated with Java 6 u 10 and is much better suited for launching "local" applications and applet) since it allows you to provide a "small instance", "larger instance", "gigantic instance" as links/icons. You will most likely look into the "inject application in webstart cache" and "offline"options.
