What is a multimodal embedding?

I don't have computer vision background, yet when I read some image processing and convolutional neural networks related articles and papers, I constantly face the term, multimodal embedding. Can anybody provide some intuition behind this term? I usually encounter this term in image captioning and image recognition.
