SQLite and Portuguese-br characters

I'm developing an app that requires the storage of Portuguese characters. I was wondering if I need to do any configuration to prepare my SQLite db to store those considered special characters. When I query a db table that contains those characters I get a '?' (without quotes) in their place.
