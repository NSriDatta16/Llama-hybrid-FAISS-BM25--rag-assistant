Linq To Sql Domain Model

This is a more generic question, and I'm not 100% on what I'm actually asking so apologies in advance if this turns out of be a load of waffle! I am creating a website in ASP.NET MVC2, and I'm looking at setting up my domain model. I am reading books that appear to be setting up the relationships between tables in C#, as opposed to the database (or maybe I'm reading it wrong?). If so, is this the correct way to do it? For example, if take the 2 domain model classes below: [Table(Name="Users")] public class User { [Column(IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true, AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert)] public int ID{get;set;} public string Name{get;set;} } [Table(Name="Posts")] public class Post { [Column(IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true, AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert)] internal int ID{get;set;} internal int MemberID {get;set;} public string Body {get;set;} internal EntityRef _user; [Association(ThisKey="MemberID", storage="_user")] public User User { get{ return _user.Entity; } internal set{ _member.Entity = value; ID = value.ID; } } } The EntityRef, is this a replacement for creating a relationship in MSSQL Server? Is the idea to define the relationships between entities in the C# rather than the database itself? Just a little confused, and as I said I could be totally off course here.
