What about applications which don't use a database but use some other serialization for their data (such as writing out an XML file)? MVC and ORM are orthogonal concepts. MVC is about how you organize your internal object interactions, and ORM is about how you serialize and deserialize the model. You can certainly use MVC without ORM by simply substituting a different serialization method. The controller part of MVC is not about making the low-level calls to serialize, it is about tying together views and models to create the proper user experience and task flow.
