By default Devise requires you to provide a password whenever you try to update a user so based on your description I am assuming this is the cause of your problem. There is a devise wiki page that tells you how to change this behavior . Another option would be to write your own controller to handle updates to your user model outside of devise. If you do disable the password requirement I would encourage you to enable some level of authorization to prevent everyone from being able to update user models. CanCan is a simple and easy authorization gem that could help.
