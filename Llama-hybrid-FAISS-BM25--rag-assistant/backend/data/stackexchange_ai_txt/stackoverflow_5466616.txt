There are several things needed to be done in IB to get the table view to load properly sounds to me that because the nib file is loading that their is no outlet set for the view in interface builder. In IB try control dragging from the file owner to the table view and when the menu pops up select view.This sets the view property of the UItableViewController to the tableview. Not sure but something to try.
