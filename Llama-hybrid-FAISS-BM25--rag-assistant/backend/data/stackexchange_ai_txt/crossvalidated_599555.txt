Significance of the p-values of the parameters in a non-linear model (using R)

I applied a logistic regression using the nlmrt package to describe the relationship between biomass and the distance and site variables. I got this result, but I am not sure to understand the p-value of the parameters. Do these results mean that my model describes the variation of biomass as a function of distance in a significant way? library(nlmrt) nlxb0 ```
