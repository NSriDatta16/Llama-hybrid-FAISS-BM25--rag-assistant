Model Examples always with 1 or 2 features

Why are all the model examples that I see on sklearn (e.g., https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor.html or https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_isolation_forest.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-ensemble-plot-isolation-forest-py ). Would it be reasonable to expect that most ML applications are going to have at least a few more features to consider? Am I missing some point like doing PCA to reduce the features fitting the model? Thats the only explanation I can come up with - in my naive mind.
