NSPasteboard type for NSManagedObject

I need to drag a reference to an NSManagedObject between two table views of my application. What's the preferred NSPasteboard type to store a reference to an NSManagedObject? My current solution is to store the URIRepresentation of the object's NSManagedObjectID in a NSPasteboardTypeString. I suspect there's a more elegant solution out there.
