How to drop something into a flex tree item?

I just read a comment at FlexExamples : One thing to note about the tree is that it is really just a list in which items are displayed. What that means is, you can’t really drop somthing “into” folder unless the folder is open . Even in that case the user experience isn’t quite right. So try moving everything out of one of the folders and then collapse that empty folder. If you drop something “on” the folder, it actually winds up between the target folder and the one below or above. This is indicated by the black line showing up as you move the mouse over the folders. If you “open” the folder (the only way to tell it is open is by the arrow) and then try it, you end up with an additional drop zone that is basically the bottom half of the opened, empty folder. This is also indicated by the black lines position. It would be better if the middle section of any item could always be the drop zone for “add to this folder” and the top and bottom edges could be for dropping above or below respectively. I've just come to the same problem. Has somebody already managed this problem? In my case, I have dragMoveEnabled in the tree and offer the ability of dragging the tree items. But it is impossible to drag an item into another item that is empty. You can only drop the dragged item above or underneath an empty item.
