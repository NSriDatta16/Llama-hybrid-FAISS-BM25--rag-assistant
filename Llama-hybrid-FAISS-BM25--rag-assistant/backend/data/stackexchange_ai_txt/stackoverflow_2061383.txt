Basic differences: A relational db removes redundancy in the data, flat file you are stuck with redundant data. A relational db moves towards solving inconsistent update problems, flat file you need to do this yourself A relational db has a lot of work done to increase speed, provide optimal searching and storage systems, type your data, etc. A flatfile system has none of this. You may find more interest in the features of more advanced RDBMSes too, as MySQL is actually a pretty basic relational db. The extra features of PostgreSQL for example, with it's much improved concurrent access controls, etc.
