IIS7 URL Rewrite, how to set to handle Friendly URLs

Looking to get something working in II7 URL Rewriting i.e product.aspx?id=200&name=Microsoft to product/200/Microsoft I was following this tutorial http://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/804/developing-a-custom-rewrite-provider-for-url-rewrite-module/ But basically that though me how to create a table with an old link and new link and to redirect to new link once the old urls is entered. Which is cool but not what I want. I.e I need a REAL URL to go to a Friendly URL in IIS7 URL Rewrite so i.e if the unfriendly URL is entered it redirects to friendly, and if friendly URL entered it stays as the URL but contains in the link the contents of the unfriendly URL. Any help would be greatly appreciated EDIT : Slight Change Ok So the site I am working on right lists organisations, and each org has 5 different details pages. Overview,Purpose,Governance,Financial, and last one I cant remember but anyway. Each one has its own .aspx page. So I have overview.aspx,governance.aspx,financial.aspx . And I want to get friendly URL's set up for each section. So yes Each org would have 5 Friendly URLS. Now the Tricky part is I want the section name AFTER the org name. I.e /Orgname/Financial or /Microsoft/Governance. From looking at the samples its put template â€“ StevieB 26 secs ago edit Ah yes I understand that now and here my very last question.
