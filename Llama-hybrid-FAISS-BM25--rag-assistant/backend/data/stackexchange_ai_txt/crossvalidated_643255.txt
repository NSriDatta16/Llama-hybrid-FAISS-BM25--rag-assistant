ANOVA on proportion data isn't appropriate, as the underlying assumptions aren't met. That's discussed frequently here, for example in this answer . With outcome values restricted to 0 and 1, the errors around the model predictions can be far from the assumed normal distribution. In some modeling scenarios you can even get model predictions outside that range. You can use a generalized linear model for binomial regression, such as logistic regression, for a binary outcome. In your situation you should consider a hurdle model that combines the modeling of binary movement/no-movement with a model of the continuous distance moved if there is movement. See this answer , for example. The glmmTMB package referred to in that answer provides an implementation. The coefficient estimates themselves aren't usually corrected for multiple comparisons. You shouldn't worry too much about coefficient p -values themselves, anyway. In many situations what's important is the reliability of model predictions, evaluated by point estimates and confidence intervals. Correction for multiple comparisons becomes important when evaluating multiple predictions from the model.
