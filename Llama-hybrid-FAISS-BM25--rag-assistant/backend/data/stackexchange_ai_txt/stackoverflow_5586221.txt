How to do manual commit using spring's DefaultMessageListenerContainer?

We have an application that listens on a queue for messages and I know that the dmlc provides a sessionTransacted property that I assume would allow us to manually commit the message receive event, however I am not sure how to leverage it in the Listener. It seems that simply by throwing a RuntimeException the message gets put back onto the queue and goes into a loop if an ErrorHandler has not been set but we would like to specifically commit the receive. e.g. public class JMSMessageListener implements MessageListener { @Override public void onMessage(Message message) { // do something with the message and then manually commit } }
