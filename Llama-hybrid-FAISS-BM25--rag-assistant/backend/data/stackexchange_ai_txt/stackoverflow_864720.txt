I doubt you'll have any space issues as a result of using GUIDs rather than INT types for example. One thing I will warn you about is that you might be tempted to create clustered indexes on the GUID columns in the database. DO NOT DO THIS. By default, GUIDs are random, and inserting random data into a column that has a clustered index causes a few issues. Clustered, as you might know, means IN PHYSICAL STORAGE SEQUENCE. So when you insert a new random value (GUID) that row usually has to be inserted into the middle of the table. This can lead to massively fragmented indexes. My advice would be to create a table that links the GUIDs to INT values (BIGINT if you expect that many users) and then use the INT everywhere else. Like Fermin just said.
