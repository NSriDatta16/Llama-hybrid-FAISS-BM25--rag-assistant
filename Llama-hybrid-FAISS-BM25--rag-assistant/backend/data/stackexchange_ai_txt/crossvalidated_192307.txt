Yes, it is possible. After you train it, you have $$z = f(X^Tw + b)$$ as your encoder. You can now record the empirical distribution of $P(z_i)$ where $i \in d'$ is a feature index in the hidden layer space $d' \ll d$. You can do this by inputting your original data set and measuring for example the frequency of values one encoded feature $z_i$ (let's say independently of the others, for starters). Once you have some ideas about the distrubtion of $P(z)$ then you could randomly add noise and select different combinations of values of $z_i$ to generate new data using the decoder. $$x' = f((z_k + \epsilon_k)^Tw + b)$$ Where $k$ is a combination of latent values with randomly injected noise $\epsilon$. You might also want to look into Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), check out this reddit thread.
