How do I fix this simple CSS floating issue in IE?

I've got four div elements floated to the left. The third div is cleared. In Firefox and Chrome the elements are positioned as expected: The first and second div s are adjacent to each other and are above the third and fourth div s which are also adjacent to each other. IE7 on the other hand places the fourth div adjacent to the first and second div s with the third div below. I know I can fix it by adding a br element after the second div but I'd rather not edit the markup if I don't have to. Is there a more elegant way of fixing the problem? I've been trying to Google for a fix for a while now but haven't found one, which is rather surprising considering how elementary the problem seems. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, is there a reference site that lists simple CSS issues like this one or am I just ignorant about basic CSS? Edit: I've made the sample code slightly more complex after Nazgulled "solved" the problem (see the comments). There are now four div s instead of three and the third div is cleared instead of the second. Here is the complete source code: IE Float Test div { width: 100px; height: 100px; color: white; font-size: 3em; float: left; } #divone { background-color: red; } #divtwo { background-color: blue; } #divthree { background-color: green; clear: both; } #divfour { background-color: purple; } one two three four Here is what is looks like in Chrome: Here is what is looks like in IE7:
