You could use regularized regression, although with 685608 observations regularization may be unnecessary. As your goal is to predict prices, you could validate your model with cross validation. Since you have one factor variable with many levels (manufacturer), you could try the fused lasso , see Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? . When you have validated a regression model, if the predictions it give are not good enough, you can see if neural networks or random forest can give better results. But note that random forest may not work well when a categorical predictor have so many levels. Then, you could use the grouping of levels you got from the fused lasso model in construction the forest model. PCA do not seem to be a relevant method for this problem.
