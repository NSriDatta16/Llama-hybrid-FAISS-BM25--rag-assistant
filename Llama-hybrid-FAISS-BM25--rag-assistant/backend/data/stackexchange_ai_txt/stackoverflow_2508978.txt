I've heard of people working around that by holding the connection (i.e. sending no response) until it dies then reestablishing it. 30 seconds is not that much though. If done this way it would still feel more responsive to the user than polling every 30 secs. About the bandwith usage: Depending on the payload "typical" HTTP requests can range from a few hundred bytes to some kBytes especially with cookies. With an average size of let's say 5kB (pessimistic) every 30 sec that would sum up to around 14 MB per 24 hrs. Maybe you can cut down the size by setting a path in your cookies so they don't get send for these connections. Maybe you don't need to send the whole payload again every 30 secs.
