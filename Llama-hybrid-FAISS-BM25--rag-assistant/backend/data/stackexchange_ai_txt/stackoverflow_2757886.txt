The point of a protected member function is that it is meant to be overridden by your derived subclass. Here is a short section of the libstdc++ manual which discusses exactly that . Here's an excerpt from which makes the same point in code: // [27.5.2.4.2] buffer management and positioning /** * @brief Manipulates the buffer. * * Each derived class provides its own appropriate behavior. See * the next-to-last paragraph of * http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/bk01pt11ch25s02.html * for more on this function. * * @note Base class version does nothing, returns @c this. */ virtual basic_streambuf * setbuf(char_type*, streamsize) { return this; }
