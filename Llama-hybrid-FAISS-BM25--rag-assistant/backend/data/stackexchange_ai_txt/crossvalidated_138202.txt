Modeling transitions into and out of poverty

I have individual panel data for two consecutive years, my variable of interest is "being under/over a monetary threshold", which is the poverty level. More precisely, I am interested in analyzing the dynamics of poverty, that is people that stay poor, people that stay non poor, and people that transistion between the two states. I have 'a lot' of potential explicative variables : it is the French version of SILC , so I have access to age, gender, job status and job if employed, education, family composition, subjective well-being, material deprivation, income, taxes, some transfers.... My first descriptive statistics are to examine the proportion of people in and out of poverty for various subpopulation for both years. Then, my idea would be to do a logistic regression, and eventually to use odds ratios. I then have two questions : Is this analysis valid ? Is there a better way to obtain results about my problematic ?
