1. The researcher may have an exogenous event in mind, and wants to test if there was a breakpoint corresponding to this event. Assuming that the likelihood function satisfies some regularity conditions then the researcher can use the likelihood ratio test to compare the hypotheses $H_0$ : There is no breakpoint at time point $\tau$ versus $H_1$ : There is a breakpoint at time $\tau$ . ( Wilks, 1938 ) is a common citation for this kind of analysis (although Wilks doesn't specifically refer to breakpoints). 2. The "usual" test statistic is too small here because we have introduced a new parameter, the breakpoint $\tau$ , which we choose in order to maximize the difference between the two resulting segments: equivalent to choosing $\tau$ to maximize the resulting test statistic. If $\tau$ was known ahead of the analysis, the usual test statistic would be fine, but the introduction of this new parameter inflates the test statistic. The unknown breakpoint $\tau$ only appears under the alternative hypothesis so a likelihood ratio test with $\tau$ estimated from the data would not possess an asymptotic $\chi^2$ distribution ( Davies, 1977 ; Andrews, 1993 ). Andrews (1993) calculates the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood ratio when $\tau$ is estimated from the data, so a p-value for $H_0$ vs $H_1$ can be obtained. The plot below shows the distribution of the absolute t-statistics for data generated from $100$ $N(0, 1)$ random variables (i.e. with no true breakpoint). If we guess that the exogenous breakpoint is in the middle of the time series (as discussed in Quandt (1958, p.877)) then we get a very different distribution of t-statistics than if we choose the breakpoint to maximize the likelihood. I'll put the code I used to generate this at the bottom of my answer. 3. I can't see how the breakpoint estimation problem could be framed as a selection bias problem but I only have a little experience with selection bias problems and no experience with Rubin Causal Models.
