Highlight table view cells when user drags across rows

I have a grouped table view that does not need to scroll. I'd like each cell to highlight as the user moves their finger down the screen and call didSelectRowAtIndexPath on release. This behaviour can be seen done by apple in 'settings > mail > add account'? I can't seem to replicate it myself, all I can get is the default, where the cell deselects as soon as the user moves their finger.
