You could use PIL to repeatedly resize the image down by a factor of 2 in each dimension until it reaches 1x1. I don't know what algorithm PIL uses for downscaling by large factors, so going directly to 1x1 in a single resize might lose information. It might not be the most efficient, but it will give you the "average" color of the image.
