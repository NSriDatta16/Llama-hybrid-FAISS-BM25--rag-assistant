Databases contain a significant overhead in terms of memory, storage space, and efficiency. Adding new records to a database or modifying existing records is far slower. (In addition, many are unfamiliar with SQL and/or the specifics of setting up a database.) If, however, you need analysis or metric evaluation capabilities that are difficult to get via a simple text file, then there's certainly nothing wrong with that. It's very much a case-by-case situation.
