A Wachter plot can help you visualize the eigenvalues of your PCA. It is essentially a Q-Q plot of the eigenvalues against the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. I have an example here: There is one dominant eigenvalue which falls outside the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. The usefulness of this kind of plot depends on your application.
