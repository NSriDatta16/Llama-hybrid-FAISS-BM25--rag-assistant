Some of the key differences are in the complexity requirements. A map requires O(log(N)) time for inserts and finds operations, as it's implemented as a Red-Black Tree data structure. An unordered_map requires an 'average' time of O(1) for inserts and finds, but is allowed to have a worst-case time of O(N) . This is because it's implemented using Hash Table data structure. So, usually, unordered_map will be faster, but depending on the keys and the hash function you store, can become much worse.
