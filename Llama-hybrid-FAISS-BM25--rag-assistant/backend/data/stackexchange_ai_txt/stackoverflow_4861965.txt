Is there an STL string class that properly handles Unicode?

I know all about std::string and std::wstring but they don't seem to fully pay attention to extended character encoding of UTF-8 and UTF-16 (On windows at least). There is also no support for UTF-32. So does anyone know of cross-platform drop-in replacement classes that provide full UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 support?
