Library for Dataflow in C

How can I do dataflow (pipes and filters, stream processing, flow based) in C? And not with UNIX pipes. I recently came across stream.py . Streams are iterables with a pipelining mechanism to enable data-flow programming and easy parallelization. The idea is to take the output of a function that turns an iterable into another iterable and plug that as the input of another such function. While you can already do this using function composition, this package provides an elegant notation for it by overloading the >> operator. I would like to duplicate a simple version of this kind of functionality in C. I particularly like the overloading of the >> operator to avoid function composition mess. Wikipedia points to this hint from a Usenet post in 1990. Why C? Because I would like to be able to do this on microcontrollers and in C extensions for other high level languages (Max, Pd*, Python). * (ironic given that Max and Pd were written, in C, specifically for this purpose â€“ I'm looking for something barebones)
