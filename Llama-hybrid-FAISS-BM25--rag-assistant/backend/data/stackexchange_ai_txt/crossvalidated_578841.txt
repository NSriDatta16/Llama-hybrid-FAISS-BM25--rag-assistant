Your error terms are not white noise according to the graphs, they are showing a clear pattern. The ACF plot indicates a Moving Average process, MA(1) in this case. You should also plot the PACF for more information, you will most probably see a gradually declining pattern in the lags of PACF. This will further indicate a MA process. Your model probably needs one moving average term to eliminate autocorrelation. Then, your error terms will most likely become white noise.
