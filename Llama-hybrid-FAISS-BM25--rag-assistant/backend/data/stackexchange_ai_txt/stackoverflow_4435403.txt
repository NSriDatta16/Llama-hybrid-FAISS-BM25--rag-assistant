You can ask the web browser to not cache the page. Try these HTTP headers: Cache-control: no-cache Cache-control: no-store Pragma: no-cache Expires: 0 Particularly, Cache-control: no-store is interesting because it tells the browser to not store the page in memory at all which prevents a stale page being loaded when you hit the back/forward button. If you do this instead, you don't have to poll for data on page load.
