Linearity of logistic regression

Given an unknown classifier, could someone make assumptions for the linearity of this model from the fact that $$y=\left\{ \begin{aligned} 1 &\;\mathrm{if}\;& p(y=1\,|\,x) \geq 0.5 \\ -1 &\;\mathrm{otherwise} \end{aligned} \right.$$ ? Is that the reason we conclude logistic regression is linear?
