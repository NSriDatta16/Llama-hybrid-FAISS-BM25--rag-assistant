Once you've sent the faux user agent headers with cURL as vartec pointed out, it might be a good idea to cache the XML to your server. For weather, maybe an hour would be a good time (play with this, if the RSS is updating more frequently, you may want to try 15 minutes). Once it is saved locally to your server, reading it and parsing the XML will be much quicker. Keep in mind too that the RSS does state Redistribution Prohibited . IIRC there are a few free online weather RSS feeds, so maybe you should try another one.
