What libraries are available for Java that parse IP header bytes?

On my project, we have been writing our own IP header parsing code for some time now. I'm starting to wonder if our time could be spent better elsewhere. A google search has not yielded much of use. Basically, what I am looking for is a third party library that will be able to parse out all of the meaningful information out of a IP packet header stored in a byte array. Someone told me that there was a Java Wireshark library out there that used JNI to wrap libpcap. Does anyone know of a pure Java solution? Commercial or open-source solutions both would be acceptable.
