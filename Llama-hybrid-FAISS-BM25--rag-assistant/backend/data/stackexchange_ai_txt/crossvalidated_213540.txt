Testing for random effects: Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM)

So I have a panel data with two time periods. My dependent variable is an index that lies in the range of 0 to 1. I did a Breusch- Pagan test (in stata) to see whether I should use random effect or pooled estimation. In the results the variance for u is 0 and the p value is 1 which means I cant reject the null and hence have to do a pooled regression. My question is that isn't the variance of u (unobserved fixed effects) being 0 a bit odd as I am in a panel data setting? What does this really mean? Furthermore if I can't reject the null does this mean that I can't use a fixed effects estimation as well?
