You should look at Tera-WURFL , it is a PHP & MySQL-based software package that detects mobile devices and their capabilities. Here is the Tera-WURFL code that you would use to detect the browser width in PHP: GetDeviceCapabilitiesFromAgent(); $browser_width = $wurflObj->capabilities['display']['max_image_width']; // You can also get the actual display resolution $display_width = $wurflObj->capabilities['display']['resolution_width']; ?>
