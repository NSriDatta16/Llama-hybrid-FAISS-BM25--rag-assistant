What are the best practices for making CSS layouts with fewer selectors and fewer DIVs? There are three of these: Don't add selectors until you need them. Don't add div s unless you need them. If you're not sure whether or not you need something, you don't need it. Fewer selectors means less HTML and CSS, which is easier to manage. I know, right? The easiest page I ever managed had no selectors and no tags at all, and was in fact a text file! How can we avoid using too many class/other selectors? Use tag selectors. I know, I know... Some folks like to give everything classes, thinking to themselves, "I might some day want to make odd-numbered paragraphs bright red with a royal blue background, and it'd be a real shame if I had to go back and modify the markup first." But that's just silly - red on blue is horrible. Avoid adding classes until you need to; that is, avoid adding classes until you've used up all of the tags. HTML has lots of tags, so use 'em .
