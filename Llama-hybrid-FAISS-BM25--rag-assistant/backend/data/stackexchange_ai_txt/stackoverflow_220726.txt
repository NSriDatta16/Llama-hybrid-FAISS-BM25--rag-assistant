public MyBigObjectOfStorage getDB() { return m_oDB; } As you put it is correct. It will return a copy of the reference , which is kind of in between a copy and a reference. The actual object instance returned by getDB() is the same object referenced by m_oDB. However, you can't change the reference returned by getDB() to point at a different object and have it actually cause the local private m_oDB to point at the new object. m_oDB will still point at the object it was already. See http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2000-05/03-qa-0526-pass.html for more detail. Although looking through your code there, you never set m_oDB at all, so getDB() will always return null.
