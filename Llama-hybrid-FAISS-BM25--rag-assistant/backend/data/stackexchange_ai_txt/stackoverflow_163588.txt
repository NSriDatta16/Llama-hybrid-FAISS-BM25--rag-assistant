The list of HTTP headers is easily available on the W3 website: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html PConroy also linked to the wikipedia page, which is more concise, and a little easier formatted: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers However, the "User-Agent" header is a bad example, since there's no set response; the user-agent string is decided by the client so it can literally be anything. There's a very comprehensive List of User Agents available, but it's not necessarily going to cover any possible option, since even some toolbars and applications can modify the user-agent for Internet Explorer or other browsers.
