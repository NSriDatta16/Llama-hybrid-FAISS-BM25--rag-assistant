Separating first paragraph from others

Let's say, that I have the following source output: This is first paragraph This is second paragraph This is third paragraph What I want to achieve is... I want to split them, first paragraph goes into one variable, others into other. Like: $first = " This is first paragraph "; $next = " This is second paragraph This is third paragraph "; Because those are generated by TinyMCE and user input, I can never know when user will add or other tags, which will cause TinyMCE to generate a new code-break \r\n . Therefore, all the solutions which split them by looking for \r\n won't work this time. Any advice?
