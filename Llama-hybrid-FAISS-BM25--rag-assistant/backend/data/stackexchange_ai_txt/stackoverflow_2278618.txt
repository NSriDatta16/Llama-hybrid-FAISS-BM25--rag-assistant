Thread on this here: Is there a good charting library for iPhone? CorePlot seems to be the concensus so far, but still evolving. This thread: Any good library for generating graphs for the iPhone? also had a great point: In terms of embedding a JavaScript charting library, you can always use a WebKit view to host a web page containing whatever JavaScript you want. You will likely be interested in this sample code showing how to call into JS from Objective-C and visa versa. You could try that with something like flot or other js libraries.
