I have submitted comments to standards committees from time to time. I notice that I am more appreciative and willing to do that when comments and their discussion are public somewhere. Even so, I have submitted comments to write-only input points and occassionally been pleased to receive a response, often much later, on the disposition of my comment. As a current member of a few standards-development committees, I can tell you that external comments and feedback are prized. There are also organizations, such as OASIS, where the importance of external comments and their responsible disposition is part of the rules for operating a TC. External feedback lets us know that there are people paying attention that care about the work. I know we also disappoint people when we don't respond openly and quickly. I also realize that for feedback that involves proposals that are essentially feature requests, we are often not limited by what is considered in scope and, in particular, whether anyone is willing (or already has) to implement the requested feature. In any case, feedback to the standards-development and -clarification processes is extremely valuable. (And if the effort you go through to provide input is not valued, that is usually easy to detect.) This is not much different than the submission of bugs and feature requests for software that you are using, as well.
