Replace a empty space with " " using Jquery

I am looking around on the web but I am not finding anything useful. :( I am having a problem that I don't understand. I am sure that I am doing something wrong, but I don't know well the syntax of jQuery to understand what is that I am not doing right. I am using animations with JS and CSS 3, and I am having troubles with empty spaces between the words, and to solve this problems I have to find a way to substitute chars inside a string of text with something else. Like an empty space with a , or as a test that I was trying to do a " n " with a " xxxxx ". What I think that I am doing is: when the page is loaded Modify the string of any paragraph with the class .fancy-title that contains " n " with a text " xxxxx " So: $(document).ready(function(){ for(i=0; i But I receive an error that it said: charCheck.replace("n", "xxxxxxxx"); it is not a function I am using jquery and other scripts that are based on jquery to make animations, rotation and scaling... and they are all in the HEAD with jquery first to load. What am I doing wrong? Manipulation in jQuery does it need a specific .js extension? I understood that was in the basic capability of jQuery, and looking at other examples all creates me the same kind of error. I even tried if(charCheck == "n"){ $(".fancy-title").text()[i] == "&nbsp;" } But simply the modification it is not applied on the page. I tried with innerHTML as well :( I feel so incompetent... Thank you in advance for any help.
