How do I cancel a "drag" motion on an Android Seekbar?

I've been reading through the docs, and I cannot figure out how to cancel a "drag" on a Seekbar once the bar has been completed. For example, when I drag the bar to the end, I want an event to happen. However, if I keep my finger on the screen and drag my finger past the SeekBar, it keeps firing off that event even after I reset the progress of the Seekbar. How can I prevent this action from happening? Thanks
