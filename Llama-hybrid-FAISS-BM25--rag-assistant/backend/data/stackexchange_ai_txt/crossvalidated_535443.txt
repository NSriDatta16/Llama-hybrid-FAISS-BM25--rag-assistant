What is the actual Mechanism of Boosting for building the Models?

I couldn't able to find the proper step by step procedure to understand the Boosting Mechanism, how does it build the models and the data used to build it. So, I have gone through tutorials which led to the confusions in Boosting Mechanisms, here's the link of the videos which are on youtube, (video clips of hardly 2 minutes each with the mentioned time, although I am writing the things what I is explained in the video.) Tutorial1 [4:56 - 6:00] Tutorial2 [7:51 - 8:51] So, heres the thing what is explained in these two tutorials: First step is same in both tutorials so everything is fine but from step 2 the things are totally different. Could someone share the document/blog what is the actual mechanism of boosting, at present I only want to understand the things in simple manner not to deep dive in mathematical knowledge and types of boosting alogorithms like Ada Boost, XGBoost etc. So pls try to keep things simple.
