Why DID estimator is ATT?

A generalized DID has the equation as below $Y_{it}$ = $\alpha$ + $\beta$ $(Leniency Law)_{kt}$ + $\delta$$X_{ikt}$ + $\theta$$_t$ + $\gamma$$_i$ + $\epsilon$$_{it}$ where i , k , and t index firms, countries, and years respectively. $X_{ikt}$ is a vector of the different firm, country, and industry control, while $\gamma$ and $\theta$ are firm and year fixed effects. From this answer of Ariel, $\beta$ is the average difference between pre- and post for the treated population. Because the ATT is the effect on the treated population of the intervention. Remember, DID is using the common trends assumption to try to tell us what would have happened to the treated population had they not been treated. It then compares the realized treated outcomes to the predicted untreated counterfactual I am wondering if $\beta$ is ATT, meaning that we did not mention control group in our explanation, so if we did not mention, why we include the control group into our regression?
