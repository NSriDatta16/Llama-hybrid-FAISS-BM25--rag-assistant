I think that adding new protocols to the socket call would be something quite difficult. You'd have to make sure that socket supports that call. I think you would have to recompile the socket function and I dont think it's easily possible under windows. Crafting custom packets does not require you to create a new protocol I think that the correct way of specifying a RAW socket is like this SOCKET s; s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW); If you're really trying to play with raw ethernet like your variable names suggest, then either you use winpcap driver or write your own driver I don't think there is another "easy" solution to raw ethernet. winpcap is rather easy so you might want to check it out
