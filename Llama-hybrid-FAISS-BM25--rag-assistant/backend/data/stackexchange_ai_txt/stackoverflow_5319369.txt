A scene graph is a way of organizing all objects in the environment. Usually care is taken to organize the data for efficient rendering. The graph, or tree if you like, can show ownership of sub objects. For example, at the highest level there may be a city object, under it would be many building objects, under those may be walls, furniture... For the most part though, these are only used for 3D scenes. I would suggest not going with something that complicated for a 2D scene.
