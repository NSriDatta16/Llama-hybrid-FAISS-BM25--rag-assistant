You can do this with reflection in Java: class A { def cat(s1: String, s2: String) = s1 + " " + s2 } val a = new A val hi = "Hello" val all = "World" val method = a.getClass.getMethod("cat",hi.getClass,all.getClass) method.invoke(a,hi,all) And if you want it to be easy in Scala you can make a class that does this for you, plus an implicit for conversion: case class Caller[T>:Null :Null Doing this sort of thing converts compile-time errors into runtime errors, however (i.e. it essentially circumvents the type system), so use with caution. (Edit: and see the use of NameTransformer in the link above--adding that will help if you try to use operators.)
