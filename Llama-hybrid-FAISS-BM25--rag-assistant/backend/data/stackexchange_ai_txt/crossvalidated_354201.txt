What the equation is describing is not a "binomial distribution", but a generalized linear model. Such model is described in terms of linear predictor: $$ \eta = \alpha+\boldsymbol{\mathrm{x}^\mathsf{T}\beta} $$ link function $$ \pi = g^{-1}(\eta) $$ and likelihood function $$ Y \sim \mathcal{Bernoulli}(\pi) $$ as described in multiple places on this site. When using Bernoulli distribution as a likelihood function, we are talking about logistic regression . As about the $^\mathsf{T}$ symbol, it stands for transpose (alternatively you could see $^{'}$), so it is a shortcut to saying $$ \mathrm{a}^\mathsf{T} \mathrm{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \dots + a_k b_k $$ where, depending on context, it could be matrix times vector, or vector times vector.
