I think your question is too broad, and better descriptions are available in the manuals for the packages you have cited. that being said.. The goto reference for the math is Rubin (1987) Rubin, D. B. (1987). Multiple imputation for nonresponse in surveys, John Wiley & Sons. New York. The approach is generally the same for the packages you mention (although I dont know aregimput ). 1) Missing variables from different data types (ratio, integer, ordinal, nominal) are calculated based on a corresponding regression technique (e.g., linear regression, cumulative link regression, logistic regression). Basically the values you have are used to model the values you are missing. 2) These calculations start with random weights and are adjusted based on their error predicting the known values. 3) Chains of these calculations (weight adjustments, missing value predictions) are run until some convergence criterion is reached. This paper was very helpful for me when learning the ropes in mi : Su, Y. S., Yajima, M., Gelman, A. E., & Hill, J. (2011). Multiple imputation with diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening windows into the black box. Journal of Statistical Software, 45(2), 1-31. Edit: one last suggestion that was quite helpful for me: Schafer, J. L. (1997). Analysis of incomplete multivariate data. CRC press.
