Implementing Movable 's in jquery

I am trying to build a dynamic drag&drop module for my App. It includes a table that holds all the droppable divs and few shapes. As i can't know from advance the type of shape someone will put in a div and i have to save the div or divs which the user chose to drop the shape in i need to allow the app to be very dynamic... I managed to do it for all the celld except from the top row for the big square and the long line and the right column for the big square and for a wide line.... The code: Untitled Page .draggable { width: 20px; height: 20px; background-color:Blue;} .draggable_big { width: 40px; height: 40px; background-color:Blue;} .draggable_wide { width: 40px; height: 20px; background-color:Blue;} .draggable_long { width: 20px; height: 40px; background-color:Blue;} .droppable { width: 20px; height: 20px; background-color:Red;} $(document).ready(function() { $(".draggable").draggable({ snap: '.droppable' }); $(".draggable_big").draggable({ snap: '.droppable' }); $(".draggable_wide").draggable({ snap: '.droppable' }); $(".draggable_long").draggable({ snap: '.droppable' }); $(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function() {alert('dropped:' + $(this).attr('id')); } }); }); ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** ***not getting responce for draggable_big*** Any one have any idea what is the problem? Thanks
