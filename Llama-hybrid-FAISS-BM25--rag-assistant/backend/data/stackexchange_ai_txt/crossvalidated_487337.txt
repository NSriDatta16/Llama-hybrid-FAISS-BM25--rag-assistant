VAR($p$) estimation

I am bit stumped by this result. Source: Remark on page 46 of Multivariate Time Series Analysis by Rsay. ... one can obtain the GLS estimate of a VAR( $p$ ) model equation by equation. That is, one can consider the $k$ multiple linear regressions of $z_{it}$ on $x_t$ separtely, $i=1,\ldots,k$ . If this is true, and as the previous page shoes $\hat{\beta}$ does not depend on $\Sigma_a$ , i.e. the coefficients do not depend on the covariance matrix of the $k$ components of the disturbance; even if they were uncorrelated that answer would have been same! I fail to intuitively digest this result. How can correlation information among the $k$ components not effect the parameters at all!! Any explanation, hints, links are appreciated!
