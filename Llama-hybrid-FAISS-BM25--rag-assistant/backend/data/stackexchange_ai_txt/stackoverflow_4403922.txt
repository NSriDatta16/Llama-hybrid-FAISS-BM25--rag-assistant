In comments you said: In the simplest terms I can think of... I am trying to get a pointer in one class to point to another pointer in a different class. To answer that question: an inner class has no special relationship to the outer class. For example, a student instance within the book class has no direct way to access its “containing” class. To do this you would have to pass a pointer to the containing book class into student ’s constructor and store it in an instance variable within student . However, this has a big caveat: when the student instance holds a pointer to the containing book class, that pointer could become invalid. For example, if you are storing book instances in a container like a std::vector , the vector may reallocate memory, invalidating any pointers to book s held within the vector . If you can guarantee that the book will not be stored in an STL container (or anywhere else where it can get moved) then this approach can work. I would still reconsider the overall approach as having instances store pointers in this way seems fragile. There could be a composition-based approach that would work.
