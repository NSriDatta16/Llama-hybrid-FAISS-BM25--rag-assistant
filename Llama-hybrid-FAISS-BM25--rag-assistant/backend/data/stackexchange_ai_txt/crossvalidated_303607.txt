I've created a notebook that almost replicates your drop in accuracy. I think that most likely error is actually retraining PCA - if you fit PCA on train set, then fit classifier, and then try to run it on principal components retrieved from the test set, then you use incorrect parameter space for the classifier - classifier uses train set principal components as coordinates, and then you run it on test set PCs.
