add Element for providers for membership (ASP.NET Settings Schema) enablePasswordRetrieval attribute : "Specifies whether the membership provider instance supports password retrieval. If true, the membership provider instance supports password retrieval The default is false for both the SQL and Active Directory providers." passwordFormat attribute : "One of the MembershipPasswordFormat values that indicates the format for storing passwords in the membership data store. The default is Hashed." Hashed : "Passwords are encrypted one-way using the SHA1 hashing algorithm. You can specify a hashing algorithm different than the SHA1 algorithm using the hashAlgorithmType attribute." Encrypted : "Encrypted Passwords are encrypted using the encryption settings determined by the machineKey Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema) element configuration." So, by default the SqlMembershipProvider uses a hashed (one-way) password that is hashed with SHA1. Hashing the passwords doesn't use the EncryptPassword/DecryptPasswords methods, but no, you cannot manually pass salts to Encryption/Encoding of passwords (it salts them for you).
