Crop Image From User Input

I'm building a c# app to take photos of visitors for ID badges. I have found a c# wrapper for web cams so can take a snap shot easily, however I need to set the images to a certain number of pixels ideally with the persons head filling most of the area. I imagine the best way to do this is to allow the end user to drag out a rectangle over the initial image with fixed x and y ratio covering the persons face. This would crop the image and do any resolution adjustment necessary. Does anyone know of an example similar to this? I think I know how to do the rectangle and get my co-ordinates for the image cropping apart from fixing an x and y ratio. Obviously an example would be quicker than trying to write my own.
