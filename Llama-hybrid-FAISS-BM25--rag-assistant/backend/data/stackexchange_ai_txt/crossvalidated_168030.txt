In my experience, taking a small sample (less than 10, or 5% of the overall number of equipments) doing several measurements gives an indication of how many measurements need to be done to have a good CI. For instance, if I have 50 pieces, I am going to take 5 pieces, do several measurements until I find a balance for each of the 5 pieces, ranging from 3 measurements to 10 first. If I don't find a balance, I'll redo the measurements, but this time 11 to 20 times (and so on). Once I have a smoothed average of measurements, I'll deploy the method to the overall pieces. This will give you an estimated standard deviation. Based on that and your level of confidence, you can, then, build your CI with the formula I assume you already know.
