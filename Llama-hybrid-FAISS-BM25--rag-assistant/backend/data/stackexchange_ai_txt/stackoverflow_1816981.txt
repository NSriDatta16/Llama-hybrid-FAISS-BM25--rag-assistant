Is there any actively supported lcov port for windows

I measure coverage for my code using gcov library and I would like to generate coverage report in user-friendly format. I've found lcov utility for that, but it's not compatibile with Windows environment (mainly because of the way the paths are parsed). Does anyone know about actively supported lcov port for Windows? It seems that making it work on Windows would be quite easy (it think it might even be solved by few creative batch/perl scripts that mimic the behavior of unix shell commands), and the tool is quite useful, so I suppose someone might have already done it.
