Robert Nau from Duke's Fuqua School of Business gives a detailed and somewhat intuitive explanation of how ACF and PACF plots can be used to choose AR and MA orders here and here . I give a brief summary of his arguments below. A simple explanation of why PACF identifies the AR order The partial autocorrelations can be computed by fitting a sequence of AR models starting with the first lag only and progressively adding more lags. The coefficient of lag $k$ in an AR($k$) model gives the partial autocorrelation at lag $k$. Given this, if the partial autocorrelation "cuts off"/ceases to be significant at a certain lag (as seen in an ACF plot) this indicates that that lag does not add explanatory power to a model and therefore that the AR order should be the previous lag. A more complete explanation which also addresses the use of ACF to identify the MA order Time series can have AR or MA signatures: An AR signature corresponds to a PACF plot displaying a sharp cut-off and a more slowly decaying ACF; An MA signature corresponds to an ACF plot displaying a sharp cut-off and a PACF plot that decays more slowly. AR signatures are often associated with positive autocorrelation at lag 1, suggesting that the series is slightly "underdifferenced" (this means that further differencing is necessary to completely eliminate autocorrelation). Since AR terms achieve partial differencing (see below), this can be fixed by adding an AR term to the model (hence the name of this signature). Therefore a PACF plot with a sharp cut-off (accompanied by a slowly decaying ACF plot with a positive first lag) can indicate the order of the AR term. Nau puts it as folows: If the PACF of the differenced series displays a sharp cutoff and/or the lag-1 autocorrelation is positive--i.e., if the series appears slightly "underdifferenced"--then consider adding an AR term to the model. The lag at which the PACF cuts off is the indicated number of AR terms. MA signatures, on the other hand, are commonly associated with negative first lags, suggesting that the series is "overdifferenced" (i.e. it is necessary to partially cancel out the differencing to obtain a stationary series). Since MA terms can cancel an order of differencing (see below), the ACF plot of a series with an MA signature indicates the necessary MA order: If the ACF of the differenced series displays a sharp cutoff and/or the lag-1 autocorrelation is negative--i.e., if the series appears slightly "overdifferenced"--then consider adding an MA term to the model. The lag at which the ACF cuts off is the indicated number of MA terms. Why AR terms achieve partial differencing and MA terms partially cancel previous differencing Take a basic ARIMA(1,1,1) model, presented without the constant for simplicity: $y_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}$ $y_t = \phi y_{t-1} + e_t - \theta e_{t-1}$ Defining $B$ as the lag/backshift operator , this can be written as follows: $y_t = (1-B)Y_t$ $y_t = \phi B y_t + e_t - \theta B e_t$ which can be further simplified to give: $(1-\phi B) y_t = (1-\theta B) e_t$ or equivalently: $(1-\phi B)(1-B) Y_t = (1-\theta B)e_t$. We can see that the AR(1) term gave us the $(1-\phi B)$ term, thus partially (if $\phi \in (0,1)$) increasing the order of differencing. Moreover, if we manipulate $B$ as a numeric variable (which we can do because it is a linear operator), we can see that the MA(1) term gave us the $(1-\theta B)$ term, thus partially cancelling out the original differencing term—$(1-B)$—in the left-hand-side.
