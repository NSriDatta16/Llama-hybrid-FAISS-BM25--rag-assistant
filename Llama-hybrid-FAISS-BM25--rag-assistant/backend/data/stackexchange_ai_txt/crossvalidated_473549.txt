How to calculate the probability Matrix (Alpha) for Regular Markov chains

Pardon me for being a novice here. In the image attached, eq 3.1 represents the transition matrix (it's pretty clear). I am not able to comprehend the eq 3.2, alpha*P = alpha, as well as the further equations. I have the P matrix with me as an outcome of one of my projects. How should I calculate alpha and the elements a1, a2, a3....etc? I would request some of your valuable guidance and help. Mritunjay
