How do I send POST data with LWP?

I want to make a program that communicates with http://www.md5crack.com/crackmd5.php . My goal is to send the site a hash (md5) and hopefully the site will be able to crack it. After, I would like to display the plaintext of the hash. My problem is sending the data to the site. I looked up articles about using LWP however I am still lost. Right now, the hash is not sending, some other junk data is. How would I go about sending a particular string of data to the site? use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST); use LWP::UserAgent; $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new(); my $req = POST 'http://www.md5crack.com/crackmd5.php', [ maxlength=> '2048', name=> 'term', size=>'55', title=>'md5 hash to crack', value=> '098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6', name=>'crackbtn', type=>'submit', value=>'Crack that hash baby!', ]; $content = $ua->request($req)->as_string; print "Content-type: text/html\n\n"; print $content;
