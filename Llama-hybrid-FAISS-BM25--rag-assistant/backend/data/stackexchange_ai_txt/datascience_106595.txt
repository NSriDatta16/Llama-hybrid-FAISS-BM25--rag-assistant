Underfitting means that you have failed to capture features that influence the outcome, in your case, the digit that is drawn in an image. The ultimate in failing to capture features is to capture no features and always predict the prior probability of $\sim 1/10$ for each number (I recall there being slight imbalance in the $60000$ standard training images). This is the baseline performance, and it corresponds to a neural network with zero features and zero hidden layers, essentially an intercept-only (multinomial) logistic regression, and it is analogous to a linear regression with $R^2=0$ . You might be tempted to use a model that has stronger performance, but this is the most underfitted a model can be, and I would expect it to be useful for the teaching purposes you have in mind.
