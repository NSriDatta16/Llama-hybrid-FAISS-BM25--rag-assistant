Choice of Data Structure

I need to have a list(array, ect) of objects that have a static values. What is the best way (more usefull) to organize such data structure on c#? Now, I am able to do it using two ways: 1) Enumarations with an additional parameters: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/stringenum.aspx 2) Create some class with needed fields and then create an array of different classes instances. Please write what of methods is the best with comments why or provide other ideas how to do it
