Files in IsolatedStorage keep getting deleted. Is that expected?

I’m storing user state in an xml file in IsolatedStorage. When I run my app in the emulator I notice that these files often disappear. Everything works fine when the app is running – it seems to be when the app restarts (it happens when if keep the emulator open or not). Is Windows deleting my files in IsolatedStorage to save space? Should expect this behavior on the actual device or is this just an emulator bug? Thanks,
