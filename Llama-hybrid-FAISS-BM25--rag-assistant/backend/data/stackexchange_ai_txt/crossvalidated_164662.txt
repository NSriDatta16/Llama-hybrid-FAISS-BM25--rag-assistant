When testing for linearity to the logit, do I include all variables in the same step?

I'm testing for linearity to the logit of the continuous predictor variables in a logistic regression by entering X and X ln(X) terms into the regression. I have multiple continuous predictors. When I enter them all in the same step, some of the X ln(X) interactions terms are significant. However, when I use separate models for each predictor variable (rather than adding them all simultaneously), the X*ln(X) interaction term is no longer significant. Why does this happen? And which method is the correct one to use?
