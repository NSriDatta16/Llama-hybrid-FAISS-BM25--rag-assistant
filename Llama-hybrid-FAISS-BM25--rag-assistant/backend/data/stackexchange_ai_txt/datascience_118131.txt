What method should I use to see whether my categories are well-encoded by my variable?

In order to test some linguistic hypotheses, a friend of mine looked at some words in some text and tries to see what tests can one do to predict in which category the word belongs. The data format is the following: Columns: Category, Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4 Rows: each row corresponds to a word in that text As someone who has a small background in stats and data science, I am trying to help find "which pattern of variables can predict the column category?". I tried to use the DecisionTreeClassifier from sci-kit learn by restricting its depth, but I don't understand the nodes of the plot and I don't really know what I am really looking for... Any insight would be quite helpful. The goal is not to predict and generalize on new data, it is only to understand the structure of the current dataset.
