What defines an observation in AIC?

I have a question based upon a section of this paper: "Model selection for dynamical systems via sparse regression and information criteria", which can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01773 It states the following: My question is: How can the sum over each time series residual be called average error (no division) and how can that be used in place of the likelihood function? How is this mathematically sound?
