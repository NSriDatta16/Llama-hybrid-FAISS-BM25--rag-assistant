Yahoo! UI Library: Calendar "The Calendar component is a UI control that enables users to choose one or more dates from a graphical calendar presented in a single month or multi month interface. Calendars are generated entirely via script and can be navigated without any page refreshes." "You'll find the Calendar Control to be a useful and easy-to-implement enhancement to any date-selection interaction; you may also find that the Calendar's foundation classes are a good place to start for more complex interfaces that visually organize date-tagged information (like appointments, photos, events, etc.)."
