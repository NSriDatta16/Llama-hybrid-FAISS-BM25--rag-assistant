html paragraph tag automatically closes in firefox when containing a form

I stumbled across a strange behavior in Firefox. I have a dynamically created text, into which I have inserted a form element including a link in order to be able to pass parameters via the post method. Ideally, it should just flow with the text and look like a normal anchor. However, whereas it displays normally in IE, Firefox terminates the paragraph just before the form, which inserts an undesired line break. Does anyone have an idea why this happens and have a workaround / alternative solution ? Result in IE (ok): This is my paragraph and here goes my link ** ** Result in Firefox (ko): This is my paragraph and here goes my** ** link Thanks in advance
