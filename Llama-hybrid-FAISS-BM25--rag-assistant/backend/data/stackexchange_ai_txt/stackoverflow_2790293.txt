Something like that sounds possible using javascript, but it depends a bit on the structure of your html and whether or not you want to break paragraphs or just move the next paragraph to the next page if it doesn´t fit So the simplest example, not breaking paragraphs / html elements with a flat html structure (no nested divs, columns, etc) like: title texts subtitle texts ... texts would be to do something like: height = 0 loop through all direct child elements of .document { if ( (height + element_height) > page_height) { add page_break_element before current element height = 0 } height = height + element_height } I´d use jquery because it makes it easy to loop through the elements, measure heights, etc. I guess breaking paragraphs would be possible as well, but a lot of extra work.
