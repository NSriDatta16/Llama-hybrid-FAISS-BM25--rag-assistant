I hate to say it, but singingfish is right. The Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::DBIC has not been updated in some time (aside from being made to display the deprecated warning) It also uses the old (2006) authentication API and will be the limiting factor of your application even if you did get it to work. If you have the option, I would switch to DBIx::Class . If not, your only real choice is to write your own user storage module that works with Class::DBI . It's actually not too hard and you can find instructions in the internals doc for Catalyst Auth: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication/lib/Catalyst/Plugin/Authentication/Internals.pod Good luck!
