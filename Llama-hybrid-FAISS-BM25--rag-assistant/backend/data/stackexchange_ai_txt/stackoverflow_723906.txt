SQLite3 ODBC Driver with VB6 errors

I am using an SQLite ODBC Driver (from here http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/ ) with my VB6 application. Everything works fine, as far as retrieving and saving data, however, if I try to get the list of table columns via the following command: pragma table_info (myTableName) The ADO call fails with 2 errors (found in Connection.Errors property) Error #1: Description : "Multiple-step OLE DB operation generated errors. Check each OLE DB status value, if available. No work was done." : String : cMisDataLayer.ExecuteRecordset Error #2: Description : "Provider does not support the property." : String : cMisDataLayer.ExecuteRecordset My question is why am I getting this error and is there a workaround to getting the column list for a table in SQLite? Thanks.
