I think you are right. PCA can be thought as a rotation of the axes done in such way that the first axis captures more variation than the second axis, the second more than the third etc and all axes are orthogonal to each other and the origin is centered on the mean of the datapoints. Here variation is the sum of square distances between the points projected on an axis and the origin. There is no statistics involved since you are not trying to infer anything about the population that generated the given data. (I'm pretty sure I'm not getting things 100% right myself).
