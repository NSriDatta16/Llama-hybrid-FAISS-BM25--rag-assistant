I answer to your comments, not to your main question, correctly answered above and not useful to your need... In Firefox, you don't do Inspect image to get its URL, as you saw, but select Properties: it will give you full path, under Image Properties if there is a link on the image (like on the Stack Overflow logo at the top of this page as I write: I can see http://sstatic.net/so/img/logo.png URL). Unless the image is defined in CSS, ie. as background, making it harder to find out (Firebug can help here). Beside, your shopping cart page is probably defined in a template (you haven't told us what software you use). For example, in Zen Cart, you can find a file at /includes/templates/template_default/info_shopping_cart/tpl_main_page.php but it can be instead in /includes/templates/ /info_shopping_cart/tpl_main_page.php if you use another template. And the part of interest can actually been in another file which is included by the main file, or even, if coding is a bit sloppy, hard-coded in some PHP (or other language) file... In this case, once you located the image in Firebug, look around: does your image, or some tag near it, have an ID? Or some class, eg. class="banner leftside" ? Searching a fragment of HTML like this with some recursive grep facility can help in locating the file to change. With some traps, since for example classes can be generated too (ie. you can find in the code something like: class="banner " ). And follow the instructions on customizing your cart (if any). If well made, it offers to created a custom template by copying only the changed files under another folder. You must avoid, if possible, to modify the files provided out of the box, as they can be overwritten when upgrading the software. HTH.
