HTML5 enabled browser for Windows Mobile 6

I did some research on Google but I couldn't find any HTML5 browser for Windows Mobile 6. The main resource I'm looking for in HTML5 is WebDatabase and/or localStorage. With a little research I found Iris ( http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/ppc-download-iris-browser.html ), a Webkit based browser with some HTML5 features, but localStorage and Web Database doesn't work on it. Does anyone know any browser with storage capability for Windows Mobile 6?
