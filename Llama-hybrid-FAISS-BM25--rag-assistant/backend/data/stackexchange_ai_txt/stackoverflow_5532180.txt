Xcode 4: Is a build archive provisioning profile specific?

I haven't really used the archive function under Xcode 3, but got used to it now in Xcode 4. So far I always used to have three or four build settings in all my projects: Debug, Distribution AdHoc and Distribution AppStore. Distr. AdHoc and AppStore were both copies of "Release" and only differed in regard to their provisioning profile selected for Codesigning (so essentially they were a thing of convenience, making sure I never sent the wrong person the wrongly signed build). Now I noticed that Xcode asks me with which profile I would like to sign my build with whenever I export an archived build form the organizer, yet at the same time the build would also fail if the selected provisioning profile in the build settings was not valid. Are Xcode 4 archives provisioning profile independent from or are thy tied to a provisioning profile? How do you solve the "challenge" of having to build for AdHoc and AppStore without having too many build settings groups (switching the groups associated with the build schemes has become somewhat cumbersome in Xcode 4)? Thanks!
