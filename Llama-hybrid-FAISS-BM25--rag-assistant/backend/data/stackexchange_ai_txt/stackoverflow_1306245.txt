The Setup.exe contains the .NET bootstrapper that will check for the presence of the .NET framework on your target machine. It also is used by Windows Vista/7 to enforce admin right during the install. If you are in an environment that you'll know already have the .NET framework in place, or you don't need the automatic UAC leveraging, you could probably skip the .exe.
