If you're developing for Windows, there are ways you can restrict access to memory, but absolutely blocking out others is not doable. If you're hoping to keep a secret secret, read Writing Secure Code - which addresses this problem at some length, but be aware that you have no way of knowing if your code is running on a real machine or a virtual machine. There's a bunch of Win32 API stuff to deal with crypto that handles this kind of thing, including safe storage of secrets - the book talks about that. You can look at the online Microsoft CyproAPI for details; the OS designers recognise this very problem and the need to keep the cleartext secure (again, read Writing Secure Code ). The Win32 API function VirtualAlloc is the OS level memory allocator. It allows you to set access protection; what you could do is set access to PAGE_GUARD or PAGE_NOACCESS , and flip the access to something friendlier while your program reads, and reset it afterward, but that's merely a speed hump if someone is trying really hard to peek at your secret. In summary, look at the crypto APIs on your platform, they'll address the problem better than something you hack up yourself.
