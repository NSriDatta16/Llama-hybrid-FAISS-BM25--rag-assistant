I think the problem is that your IIS user (Network Service / ASPNET) doesn't have access to the certificate. In order to grant Network Service to access the certificate in the store, download the following tool: winhttpcertcfg ( http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=c42e27ac-3409-40e9-8667-c748e422833f&displaylang=en ) Now open command prompt and type: winhttpcertcfg –g –c LOCAL_MACHINE\My –s ORGNAME –a "Network Service" Please note that "Network Service" can be substituted with any other account. I.e. if you you have configured a custom user for your app pool, you should put this user as the value for the -a parameter. ORGNAME should be substituted with the Organisation name you specified during the creation of your cert.
