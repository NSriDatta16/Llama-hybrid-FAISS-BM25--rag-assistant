Can Survival Models model the time at which a random variable will first pass a certain point?

Using standard survival models (e.g. Joint Survival Models), I could calculate the hazard and survival functions for individual cohorts at different time points in the future. Thus, I could make the naive argument that a standard Survival Model could show me when the average individual in a given cohort is expected to "pass a certain threshold for the first time". Recently, I found out about First Passage Regression Models: https://www.jstatsoft.org/v66/i08/ . As I understand, these are based on the principles of Brownian Motions and explicitly model the first passage time. To play devil's advocate - if I can do this with a Joint Survival Model, why do I need a First Passage Regression Model? What added advantages do I gain from a First Passage Regression Model instead of the standard Survival Model? My guess is that using First Passage Regression Models (based on Brownian Motions), we end up with a full probability distribution of the first passage time instead of a point estimate - thus allowing for a richer analysis. Is this interpretation correct?
