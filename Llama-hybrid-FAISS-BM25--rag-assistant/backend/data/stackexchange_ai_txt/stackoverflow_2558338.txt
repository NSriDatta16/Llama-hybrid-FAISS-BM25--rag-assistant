Performance Counters in Server Development

All of you agree with the value of using Performance Counters for server applications. I would like to know how to implement these using C#. Usually performance counters have the following attributes: They are shared/global Writing requires locks to ensure synchronization Reading sometimes requires locks too Is it better to update them asynchronously? What is the best way to make them asynchronous? I am planning to use the ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem() function. What is your opinion about this? If my questions seem a bit vague, please look at the HelloWorld WCF service. I also want to know the following: How many times it's being hit overall and within a certain period Average/min/max response times overall and within a certain period If any one knows of any specialized ways to do this in .NET or WCF, please let me know.
