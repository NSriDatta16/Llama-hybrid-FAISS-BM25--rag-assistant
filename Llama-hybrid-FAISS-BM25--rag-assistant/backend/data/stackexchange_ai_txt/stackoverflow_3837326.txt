I certainly prefer seeing links to any docs... "CONTAINS (Transact-SQL). SQL Server 2008 R2 Books Online" has paragraph: "Comparison of LIKE to Full-Text Search *In contrast to full-text search, the LIKETransact-SQL predicate works on character patterns only. Also, you cannot use the LIKE predicate to query formatted binary data. Furthermore, a LIKE query against a large amount of unstructured text data is much slower than an equivalent full-text query against the same data. A LIKE query against millions of rows of text data can take minutes to return; whereas a full-text query can take only seconds or less against the same data, depending on the number of rows that are returned*"
