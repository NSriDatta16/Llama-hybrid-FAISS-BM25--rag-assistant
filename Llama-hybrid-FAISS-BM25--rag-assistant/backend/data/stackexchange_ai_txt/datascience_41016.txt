How to fill missing numeric if any value in a subset is missing, all other columns with the same subset are missing

There is a clear pattern that show for two separate subsets (set of columns); If one value is missing in a column, values of other columns in the same subset are missing for any row. Here is a visualization of missing data My tries up until now, I used ycimpute library to learn from other values, and applied Iterforest. I noted, score of Logistic regression is so weak (0.6) and thought Iterforest might not learn enough or anyway, except from outer subset which might not be enough? for example the subset with 11 columns might learn from the other columns but not from within it's members, and the same goes for the subset with four columns. This bar plot show better quantity of missings So of course, dealing with missings is better than dropping rows because It would affect my prediction which does contain the same missings quantity relatively. Any better way to deal with these ? [EDIT] The nullity pattern is confirmed:
