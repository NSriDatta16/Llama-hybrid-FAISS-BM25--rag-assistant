I'm going to use SWFObject to embed a Flash object in my page and pass variables. Can a user spoof those variables?

i am wanting to know how much I can be sure that users of my website will not be able to pass bogus variables to my Flash movie. Basically I will have some features available to certain users and I realise that for the average user they will not know anything about how to send spoof vars but is it possible for someone to change the variables sent using SWFObject when a page loads and thus be able to use the functionality that I am trying to disable for them. I have a PHP (my_flash_movie.php) page that calls a function from an included globals.php file to determine if the user can see the restricted functionality - is_user_a_subscriber($_SESSION['user_id']); which returns 1 or 0. This 1 or 0 is then passed to Flash which enables or disables certain features. I dont want someone to be able to send a 1 instead of a 0 basically. This isnt a site where security is critical and the functionality that is disabled is not really critical either so wouldnt be too bad if this happened but im just curious about this and wondering if I should think of another way to pass these vars that might be more hidden. If someone is able to do this (pass spoof variables) how would they do it? cheers
