Which design patterns are underutilized?

Is there a specfic Gang Of Four Design Pattern that you frequently use, yet hardly see used in other peoples designs? If possible, please describe a simple example where this pattern can be useful. It doesn't have to necessarily be a Gang Of Four pattern, but please include a hyperlink to the pattern's description if you choose a non-GoF pattern. Put another way: What are some good/useful design patterns that I, or someone else who does have a passing knowledge of the main patterns, may not already know?
