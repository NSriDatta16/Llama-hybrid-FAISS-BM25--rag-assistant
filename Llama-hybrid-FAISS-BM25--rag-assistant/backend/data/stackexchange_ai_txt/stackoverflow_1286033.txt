Exiting Instruments "Full Screen"

I was doing a memory profile in Instruments for my iPhone app and I pressed the "Full Screen" button in the lower left. The screen went black and I can't make it do anything else. When I power cycle the box I get the splash screen appearing, and then it goes back to black. Please help. Here's a doc showing the button in the lower left.
