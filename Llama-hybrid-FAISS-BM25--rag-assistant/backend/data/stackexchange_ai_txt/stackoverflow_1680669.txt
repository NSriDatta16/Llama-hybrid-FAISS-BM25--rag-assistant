Qt Custom Window

Pardon me, I am a newbie :) Is it possible in Qt to create a custom window without borders but still draggable without holding down the Alt Key? I created a borderless window but in order to be able to drag it (on Linux) you have to hold down the alt key. I was planning to create a window with rounded corners. Any one have any idea how to make this possible? Although, I think implementing the mouseMove, mousePress or something is a possible solution but I need some other solution. Thanks
