"Unknown Method" using IronRuby in C#

Hi and good evening, hope someone can help. I am trying to get some sort of scripting support going. I have the following code, which executes a ruby method and returns the result. However, it is returning a "method not found error" from IronRuby itself. var engine = IronRuby.Ruby.CreateEngine(); returnvalue = engine.Operations.InvokeMember(instance, method, arg).ToString(); I am running the following ruby code as a test: class Plotlight def get_message(a) res = "Hello- from Ruby " Now, when running the method get_message("something") , things work great. However, when running something that has a reference to the standard library (swapcase in this example), it will return the error $exception {"undefined method `downcase' for fooBAR:ClrString"} System.Exception {System.MissingMethodException} Running the code through ir.exe works without any problems. Do I need to make a reference to the library, and if I do, how do I do that? Hope someone can help! Thank you very much. Kind regards, Marco
