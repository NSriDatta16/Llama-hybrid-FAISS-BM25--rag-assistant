Based on your description my best guess is that you looking for a recommender system. You can model that by treating documents as "users" and tags as "items". Then you may have e.g. such a table where a certain document "likes" certain tags. document id | tags | d1 | music, bach | d2 | programming, r | d3 | programming, python | This can be converted to an implicit preference matrix document id | music | bach | programming | r | python | d1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | d2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | d3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | or to a graph (like your approach), where ... every node is a tag and the weight of the node is the number of times this tag has occurred a connection between two nodes / tags exist, if these tags co-occurred at least once in a document. So the weight is the number of times of co-occurence Now you can use the Jaccard index as similarity metric. similarity | music | bach | programming | r | python | music | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | bach | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | programming| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.5 | r | 0 | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | 0 | python | 0 | 0 | 0.5 | 0 | 1 | This is a very simple example of course. For a selected tag, the recommended tags are the most similar by these scores. Starting here, you can dive deep into item-based collaborative filtering (good for starters) and in (tag) recommender systems in general, depending on how you want to extend the system. For example, if you treat users as users and the tags in their profile as "items", you can apply all the standard methods to recommend new tags (for implicit preferences, i.e. 0 and 1 instead of ratings). Since user generated tags form a so called folksonomy and that in combination with recommender systems is a well known research area, you will find additional methods there. If you are looking for an less mathy intro to the area of recommender systems (and machine learning in general), I can recommend Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran (but: it does not cover folksonomies and there might be newer / better books for beginners)
