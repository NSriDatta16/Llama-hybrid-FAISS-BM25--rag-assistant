How do I get my Neural network to ignore certain values?

I was wondering if there was a way that I can get my CNN encoder-decoder neural network to completely ignore certain values in my data (2d images). There are some pixel values of 0 that never change from the input to the target. They are meant to be ignored. I've tried some self attention layers and I even multiply the 'mask' image at the end of the encoder-decoder network, but it still does not ignore these values, causing a lot of unnecessary noise and inaccuracy in my results. How can I ensure these values are being ignored at every convolutional layer?
