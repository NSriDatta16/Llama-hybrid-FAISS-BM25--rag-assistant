Motifs for prediction

I'm trying to find a method for using motifs for prediction. Motifs defined as similar (sub)sequences can be found using approximate or exact methods, see Exact Discovery of Time Series Motifs . My problem is: once you have motifs of labelled time series how could the motifs be used for prediction?
