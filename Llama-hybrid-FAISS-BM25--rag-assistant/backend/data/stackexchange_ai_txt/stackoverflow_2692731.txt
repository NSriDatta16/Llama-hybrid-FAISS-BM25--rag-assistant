height returns height in pixels. Unfortunately centimeters is going to be very difficult for you to work with. Monitors all have different pixel densities, and javascript does not have a way to know this pixel density. You'll have to estimate how many pixels average a centimeter and convert from there. Average pixel density would have anywhere from 100-130px in a centimeter, as you can tell this is a pretty wide range.
