Sorted it! Thank goodness, i was totally out of ideas when i went back to a video by hanselman. He mentioned that the Web Deployment Agent can have permissions. I went in had a look and there was a tab in it's properties called log on. I entered the detials of an account with a decent level of access and clicked okay. I then restarted the service as requested to enable the changes. I then went back to VS 2010 and clicked Publish Web. Music to my eyes, i see the words "Publish succeeded", I check the database and the tables are there. Excellent! I think i scared the office by getting a little over excited, if you get this problem and this solution fixes it for you, try to hold in the temptation to shout out "YES!, yes, get in!" while laughing maniacally or people will think you're weird like me.
