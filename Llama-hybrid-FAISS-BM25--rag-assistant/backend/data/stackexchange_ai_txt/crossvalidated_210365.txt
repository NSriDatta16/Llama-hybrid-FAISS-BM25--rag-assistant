number of participants to have a 80% chance of detecting a 1.5% point difference as significant

Can someone explain how the math used to determine that 34 participants were required for this study? To have an 80% chance of detecting a 1.5â€“percentage point between-group A1C difference as significant (at the two-sided 5% level), with an assumed SD of 1.9% and a loss to follow-up of 26%, 34 participants were required per group. An interim analysis indicated group differences of 0.8% with an SD of 1.3%; therefore, a revised power analysis was conducted.
