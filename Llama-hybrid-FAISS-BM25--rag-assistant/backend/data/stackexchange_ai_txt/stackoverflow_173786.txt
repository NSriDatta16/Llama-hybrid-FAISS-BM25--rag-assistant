How do I stop a UIScrollView from bouncing horizontally?

I have a UIScrollView that shows vertical data, but where the horizontal component is no wider than the screen of the iPhone. The problem is that the user is still able to drag horizontally, and basically expose blank sections of the UI. I have tried setting: scrollView.alwaysBounceHorizontal = NO; scrollView.directionalLockEnabled = YES; Which helps a little, but still doesn't stop the user from being able to drag horizontally. Surely there is a way to fix this easily?
