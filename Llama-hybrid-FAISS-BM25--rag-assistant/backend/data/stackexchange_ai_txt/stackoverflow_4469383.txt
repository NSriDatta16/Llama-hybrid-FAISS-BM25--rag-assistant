I understand that Lua is the industry choice for problems like this. A bold claim! I would suggest that if you are already running Linux, the choice is wide open. Linux itself is by no means the "industry choice" for embedded systems; the 'industry' is far more fragmented than that. A language that is implementable on virtually any system regardless of performance, size, and OS (or even no OS), is Forth. Not the most fashionable language perhaps, but easily implementable and extensible. Another candidate might be ch , which is an embedable C/C++ interpreter, so you can use the same language for compiled and scripted code.
