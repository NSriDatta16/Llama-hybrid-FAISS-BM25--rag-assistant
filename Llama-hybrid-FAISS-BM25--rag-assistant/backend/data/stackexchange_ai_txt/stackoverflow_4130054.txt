This isn't the most elegant solution, but you could have the publisher deal with the subscriber through an interface which would decouple the publisher from needing to know about any specific subscriber implementation. For example interface ISubscriber { object Arguments{get;} } Which would make the client API signature: void Subscribe(ISubscriber subscriber) Of course you may want to implement the interface on a seperate type if you don't want your subscriber types having an Arguments property.
