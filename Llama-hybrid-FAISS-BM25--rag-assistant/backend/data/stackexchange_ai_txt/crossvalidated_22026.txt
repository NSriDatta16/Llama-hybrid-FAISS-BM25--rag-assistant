The Internet is full of garbage, as all of us know. It helps to find authoritative sources and focus on them to help resolve such issues. A pamphlet published by the American Statistical Association (attributed to Fritz Scheuren and "thoroughly updated circa 1997") defines the margin of error as a 95% confidence interval (p. 64, at right). In light of this, it is surprising that the Wikipedia article on margin of error uses a different definition, even though it references this pamphlet! Wikipedia writes, The margin of error is usually defined as the "radius" (or half the width) of a confidence interval for a particular statistic from a survey. ... When a single, global margin of error is reported for a survey, it refers to the maximum margin of error for all reported percentages using the full sample from the survey. In other words, to Wikipedia the MoE is one-half the maximum width of a set of confidence intervals (which might have coverages differing from 95%). We have discussed this confusion (or, at least, lack of standardization) in comments elsewhere on this site. Our conclusion was that you need to be clear what you mean by "margin of error" whenever you use that term.
