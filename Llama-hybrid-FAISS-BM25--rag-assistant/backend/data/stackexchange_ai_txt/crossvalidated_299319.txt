Such an observation is called a high leverage point. As such it has a huge potential to influence your parameter estimates and everything related to it. How large the influence finally is also depends on the size of the residual. Ideally such observations are already identified in the preliminary descriptive analysis. There is no general rule how to deal with such values. Options include Use a regression method that can better deal with outliers in x, like e.g. robust regression with redescending weight kernel Correct the value if it is a data error If you are allowed to, remove the value and clearly state that your results only apply to a certain range of x values.
