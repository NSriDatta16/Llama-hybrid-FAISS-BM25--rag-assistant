Assumptions on the target density in the RWM optimal scaling paper by Roberts, Gelman and Gilks

In the famous paper Weak Convergence and Optimal Scaling of Random Walk Metropolis Algorithms by Roberts, Gelman and Gilks, at the bottom of page 116, the supremum of the third derivative of $\ln f$ is occuring on the right-hand side of a bound. However, the assumptions on $f$ don't seem to ensure that this supremum is finite. Am I missing something? The finiteness seems to be crucial for the conclusion. EDIT: Just noticed that he's assuming that $f$ is only $C^2$ . So, $(\ln f)'''$ does not even need to exist ...
