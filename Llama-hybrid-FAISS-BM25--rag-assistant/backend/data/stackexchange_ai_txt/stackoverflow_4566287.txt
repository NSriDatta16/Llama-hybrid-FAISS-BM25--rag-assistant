How to implement drag-and-drop between lists in android?

I'm trying to make it so that the user can drag a textview from one listview and then drop it into another, and I'm finding it to be very difficult. The biggest problem I have found so far is that onTouchEvents seem to only be heard in the view that the ACTION_DOWN event originated in. I'll click in one list and the ACTION_DOWN is heard in there. Then I'll drag outside the list and let go over another list. But the onTouchEvent is only being called for the original list, no matter where I'm going. I thought it was going to be as simple as listening for an ACTION_UP event in the receiving list; but that's called on the original list even though I'm outside it. What I have so far is a bit messy. When onLongTouchEvent is called, the list tells the main activity to start dragging a draggableTextView (which has a moveTo method). Since the move events continue to be called on the original list, I have it continually setting the position of this draggableTextView. But I can't insert it into another list because I can't figure out what I'm letting go on top of.
