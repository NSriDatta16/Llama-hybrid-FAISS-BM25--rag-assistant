There's no "default storage class" for what is commonly known as "global" variables. When a variable is defined in namespace scope it always has static storage duration . There's no way to change that, which is why the idea of something "default" is not applicable here. (And storage duration is what it is correctly called.) When you apply the keyword static to a variable defined in namespace scope it does not affect its storage duration - it was static already and it remains static - but it affects it linkage . The keyword static changes the linkage of such variable from external (default) to internal. Linkage is a separate concept, virtually unrelated to storage duration .
