If you want to compare Attention Deficit with Other Deficit then it is convenient to exclude Other Deficit from your model. That way the parameter for Attention Deficit will be directly the comparison of Attention Deficit with Other Deficit. In the comments you mention that you will use this in logistic regression, so lets use an example with logistic regression. Say we want to explain union membership if women in the USA with marital status, race and education ( grade_c , which is centered at 12 years of education($\approx$highschool)). In particular we are interested in the comparison never married versus married. The exponentiated constant is the odds of union membership for those women who are married, white, and finished highschool, that is, have the value 0 on all explanatory variables. So for married white highschool graduates we expect to find .24 union-members for every non-union-member. The other coefficients are odds ratios, which are ratios of odds. So if one is never married than the odds will increase by a (nonsignificant) factor $1.27$, or an increase of $(1.27 - 1)\times 100\%= 27\%$. So by excluding the married dummy, the coefficient for never married is directly a comparison between the married and never married. . logit union ib2.marst i.race grade_c, or base nolog Logistic regression Number of obs = 1,876 LR chi2(5) = 35.73 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -1027.0716 Pseudo R2 = 0.0171 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- union | Odds Ratio Std.

This is true if you exclude the constant, but will dramatically change the interpretation of your coefficients. Now the exponentiated coeffcients of the marital status dummies are no longer odds ratios, but odds. So to continue the example: For married white highschool graduates the odds of being a union member is 0.30, while for never married white highschool graduates the odds of being a union member is 0.27. We can compare those odds by computing their ratio, and if we do so we get the odds ratio of 1.27 we got in the first example. So both are just different representations of the same model. Both can be useful, but if you want to focus on the comparison, then the first is a more direct way of doing so. . logit union ibn.marst i.race grade_c, or base nolog nocons Logistic regression Number of obs = 1,876 Wald chi2(6) = 447.72 Log likelihood = -1027.0716 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- union | Odds Ratio Std.
