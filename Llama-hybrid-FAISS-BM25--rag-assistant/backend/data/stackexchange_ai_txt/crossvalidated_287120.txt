One idea, you could ignore the models and timesteps and just compare the values, with anova or kruskal-wallis. This isn't very elegant, but with data that clearly separated, it gives you the magic p-value. Another idea, if you can put 95% confidence intervals around the models on the plot, the fact that the intervals don't overlap would suggest that the methods are different. Again, nothing fancy, but it does the job.
