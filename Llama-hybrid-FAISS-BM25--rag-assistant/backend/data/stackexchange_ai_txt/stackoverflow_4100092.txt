To keep configuration separate from code, I created a folder outside of the web folder (htdocs) containing the configuration files, and they mimic the folder structure within htdocs. The files compiled from the configuration files are then moved within the place where they are going to be used. So I think I made everybody happy. All the configuration files are within a separate folder but they are still organized by features. So it's cohesive that all the config files are in one place, while still grouping each of the config files by feature. Sorry for a confusing question...
