Quick and dirty hack: var foo = " "foo").gsub(/[\n\r]/, ' ') %>"; This just replaces the newlines with spaces, a no-op from the point of view of an HTML parser. However, this is a pretty fragile way to create JavaScript objects. You'll need to account for quotes in the partial that'll make your JavaScript invalid, etc. I'd suggest trying to create JavaScript templates for the HTML you want to render and populate them with JSON versions of your Models.
