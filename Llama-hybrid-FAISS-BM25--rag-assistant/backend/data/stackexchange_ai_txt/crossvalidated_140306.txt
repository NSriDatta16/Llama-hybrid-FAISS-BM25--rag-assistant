Sensitivity analysis of machine learning techniques

As you know we can have sensitivity analysis (sensitivity of output(s) based on changing of inputs) in different kinds of regression. Can we have sensitivity analysis for machine learning techniques (Specially Neural network and Support vector machine or others). I'm using MATLAB R2014b for coding. How can I do that?
