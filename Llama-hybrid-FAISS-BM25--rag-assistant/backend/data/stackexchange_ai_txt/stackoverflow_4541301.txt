My very first job out of college was updating a set of unit tests. They were about 7 years old, with many deprecated methods being used. It took me eight months (there were a lot of them!) and I still didn't finish the job. However, I did manage to reduce the file size to about 1/3rd the original size and greatly simplify the work by refactoring much of it, and that helped speed up the work. So, I would definitely encourage refactoring!
