struts action singleton

Why is the struts action class is singleton ? Actually I am getting point that it is multithreaded. but at time when thousand of request hitting same action, and we put synchronized for preventing threading issue, then it not give good performance bcoz thread going in wait state and it take time to proced. Is that any way to remove singleton from action class ? for more info Please visit : http://rameshsengani.in
