Here is a possible solution based on my experience in high throughput biology. Before you launch your classification machinery, you need to learn more about the subject of your studies. I see two options. Use external knowledge. What are these labels? How can they be related? Do you have an other source of information that would group them together? Lacking external knowledge, I would sacrifice a randomly selected fraction F of your data to understand which labels cluster together. Build the clusters based on the set F, using cross-validation and whatever clustering validation schemes you think are worthwhile. Then, re-label the remaining data (F') using the new clusters as labels, which should optimally reduce the number of unnecessary categories. However, the split into F and F' is crucial: if you build your new categories using the full data set in which you then run your machine learning, you will end up overfitting.
