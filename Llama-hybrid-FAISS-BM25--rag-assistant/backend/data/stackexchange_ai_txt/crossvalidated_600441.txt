TL;DR I use an example — inference for the rate $\theta$ in a Poisson model — to show how to construct a likelihood interval. I've borrowed this example from the book In All Likelihood: Statistical Modelling And Inference Using Likelihood by Yudi Pawitan. Say we observe $x = 3$ from $\operatorname{Poisson}(\theta)$ . The likelihood interval for the rate $\theta$ is: $$ \begin{aligned} \left\{\theta:\frac{L(\theta)}{L(\widehat{\theta})} > c\right\} \end{aligned} $$ where $\widehat{\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the likelihood is scaled so that the maximum is 1, which occurs at $\theta=\widehat{\theta}$ ; $c$ is a cutoff point (between 0 and 1; to be chosen next). In his answer @SextusEmpiricus refers to $L(\theta) / L(\widehat{\theta})$ as the relative likelihood. This formalizes the concept of the likelihood "within some percentage of the maximum value" $L(\widehat{\theta})$ : the likelihood interval is the set of parameter values $\theta$ with high likelihood. But how can we decide what is "high enough", ie. how can we calibrate the likelihood? As @utobi explains, under regularity conditions, the likelihood ratio $2\log L(\widehat{\theta}) / L(\theta)$ has (approximately) Chi-squared distribution . Therefore, when the likelihood is reasonably regular: $$ \begin{aligned} P\left\{\frac{L(\theta)}{L(\widehat{\theta})} > c\right\} = P\left\{2\log\frac{L(\widehat{\theta})}{L(\theta)} If we want to choose $c$ , so that the likelihood interval has approximate $(1-\alpha)$ 100% coverage probability, then $P(\chi^2_1 . Here is a plot of the (scaled) likelihood $L(\theta)/L(\widehat{\theta})$ as well as the likelihood interval calibrated to have 95% coverage probability. # significance level alpha alpha lower upper #> 0.05 0.746065 7.779286 R code to reproduce the figure and calculate the likelihood interval. find_cutoff $lower, c, like.ci$ upper, c, col = "#2297E6", lwd = 3 ) title( paste( "95% likelihood interval [blue segment] for Poisson rate θ on observing x =", x ), font.main = 1 )
