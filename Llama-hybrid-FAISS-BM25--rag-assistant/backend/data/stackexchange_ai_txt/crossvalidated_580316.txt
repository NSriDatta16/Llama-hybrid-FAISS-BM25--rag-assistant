Linear correlation and machine learning methods

I am reading a paper that has a wide number of explanatory variables. In order to reduce this number, the author first computes the (Pearson) correlation between each pair and keeps just one of the high correlated ones. This way, he reduced the number of variables and then feed an ML model with it. My question: from what I understand, there are some ML techniques that 'are able' to identify no linear relationships. Is it ok to employ linear correlation to dismiss some variables because of their LINEAR relationship to then use a model which not necessarily models a linear relationship? Can somebody help me to clarify this doubt? Thank you!
