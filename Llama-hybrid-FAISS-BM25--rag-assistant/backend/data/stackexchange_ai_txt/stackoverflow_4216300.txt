how to find last index of string in perl

I am new to perl scripting. Can some one tell me how to find the last indexof substring in a string which is repeat several times in the string. Actully I want to extract the file name from a give path $outFile = "C:\\AOTITS\\BackOffice\\CSVFiles\\test.txt"; If I can find the last string of the '\' I cand extract the file name using substr function. I already did that in the following way. But it is inefficient. $fragment = $outFile ; $count = index($fragment, "\\"); while($count > -1) { $fragment = substr ($fragment, index($fragment, '\\')+1); $count = index($fragment, '\\'); } Can some one tell me a way to do that in a efficient way.
