I'm posting as an answer because the comment became too long. :) Usually, this type of approach is better after some sort of standardization of the variables to make them comparable. So, we may transform the variables so that they make sense in similar ranges. The advantage of having the variables living more or less in the same range is that the coefficients of a weighted average would represent the relative importance of each variable. Continuous variables can be transformed, as you mentioned, on their z-score , i.e., by $z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$ , where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and the standard deviation, respectively. The variable $z$ will have a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$ . If you have several variables of this type, the transformed ones will be comparable. Integers may be transformed in the same way if there are may different values or just divided by the maximum value if we have non-negative integers. Dividing by the maximum value will make the maximum of the transformed variable be equal to $1$ . Categorical variables (that include nominal) can be transformed into dummy variables. These assume the value $1$ if that category was present for that individual and $0$ otherwise. This is just an initial approach and it may not be perfect. For instance, if the continuous variables or the integers are skewed you may want to use other transformations, say the logarithm of the data, or the square root or a Box-Cox transformation .
