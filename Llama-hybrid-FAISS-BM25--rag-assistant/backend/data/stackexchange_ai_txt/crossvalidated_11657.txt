Using latent Dirichlet allocation for information retrieval

I am working on understanding various document ranking algorithms like (TF-IDF, LSI, language models, etc) by actually implementing them. I want to understand LDA and using various resources to understand the algorithm. What I don't understand is how we come up with the latent (hidden) variables/topics. Can someone please explain it to me using examples like: Doc1: "shipment of gold damaged in a fire", Doc2: "delivery of silver arrived in a silver truck", Doc3: "shipment of gold arrived in a truck"}; Query: "gold silver truck" I will really appreciate any help in this regard. Thanks!
