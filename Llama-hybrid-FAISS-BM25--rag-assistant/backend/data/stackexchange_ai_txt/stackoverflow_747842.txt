This is a question of semantics. You are trying to decide the appropriate datatype for storage which can be a tricky question. The best rule of thumb is to store your data as integers if you will need to use the data as an integer. In other words, since you will never be using a postal code as a number it does not make sense to store it as one. It doesn't matter what the data looks like, it matters what it is . Is a postal code a number? No, it's a string of characters that just happens to be made up of wholly numeric characters. Therefore a postal code is best stored as a string.
