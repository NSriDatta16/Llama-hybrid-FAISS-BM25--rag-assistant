Let us take your example of those who lasted at least four years, and then look at the residual mean lifetime. $295$ of those left in the time interval $[4,5)$, which means that these lasted strictly less than five years, i.e. they did not last a full further year. By including $0.6209$ in the sum in the numerator of your calculation, you are treating them as all lasting the full fifth year, when in fact they all left earlier in that year. Similarly with all the other years. So your method is biased upwards. If you wanted to adjust for this bias and you thought that teachers left on average a quarter of the way through the year, you could take your method and subtract $0.75$ from the final result, or you could leave out the initial term in the sum in the numerator of your calculation and add $0.25$ to the final result. Both methods come to the same answer.
