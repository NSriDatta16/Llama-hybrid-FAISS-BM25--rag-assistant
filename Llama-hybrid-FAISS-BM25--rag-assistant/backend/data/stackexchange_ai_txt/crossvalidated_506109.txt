Rejecting hypothesis after performing a logistic regression

I was analyzing a dataset that consists of 20000 chess matches. My hypothesis was that when ratings of players increase, the probability for white to win also increases. I was thinking of performing a logistic regression for this, 0 value as 'black wins' and 1 value as 'white wins'. However, I am unsure if logistic regression is the correct model in this situation, as in logistic regression, 0 and 1 values are mostly used for possibilities. Is there a better model to analyze if there is a correlation between white winning and players' rating?
