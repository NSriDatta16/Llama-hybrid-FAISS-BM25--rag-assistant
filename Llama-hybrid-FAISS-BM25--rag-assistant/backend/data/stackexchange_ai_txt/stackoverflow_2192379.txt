As the documentation states for AudioRecord and AudioTrack : audioFormat the format in which the audio data is represented. See ENCODING_PCM_16BIT and ENCODING_PCM_8BIT you can only work with 8-bit and 16-bit PCM. If you want audio in other formats, either don't use AudioRecord and AudioTrack (try MediaRecorder and MediaPlayer ) or you will have to transcode it using your own code, possibly leveraging the NDK. AudioRecord and AudioTrack are designed specifically for cases where the audio in question is not supported by the OpenCORE multimedia engine, either because it's not a supported codec or not a supported streaming protocol (e.g., SIP).
