C++ extern storage class life-span

I am a C++ newbie and come from a Java background. I would like to confirm the following: I am reading C++ by dissection by Ira Pohl and the book states that the life-span for a file/ extern variable/function is the duration of the program (which makes sense because the variable is not declared in a class) . What I want to know; is that also the case for a variable declared in a class? If not, if a variable is declared in a class does that make the variable use the auto storage class? Thanks.
