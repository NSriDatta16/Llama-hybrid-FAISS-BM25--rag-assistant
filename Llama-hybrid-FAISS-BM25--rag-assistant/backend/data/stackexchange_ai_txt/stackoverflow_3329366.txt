I generally dislike creating all sorts of hidden views within a nib file, precisely because of how messy things get and how easy it becomes to inadvertently click and drag something you don't intend to. What I'll do instead in that instance is break out the hidden views into separate nibs, and have the controller load and place them into the view on an as-needed basis. Another upside to this approach is that it loads views only when they're needed - making the view lighter-weight overall.
