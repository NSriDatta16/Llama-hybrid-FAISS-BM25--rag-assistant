Check out Mahout which is a distributed machine learning library. One of the examples there uses a dump of wikipedia https://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/wikipedia-bayes-example.html http://mahout.apache.org I'm not familiar with the exact details of business intelligence, however machine learning is about finding relevant patterns and clustering of information together. At the very least this should give an example of loading wiki into memory and doing some simple and not so simple things with the data.
