If you drag-drop a file to a batch-script (.BAT file), the batch-file will be run with the drag-drop item as the first parameter. So all you need to do is process the first parameter, which is indicated by %1. For starters, in your .BAT file, add the line near the top: echo The Drag-Drop file is %1 Then test that to make sure you can drag-drop to your batch file. I am not sure if/how batch-scripts handle multiple drag-drop, but check the subsequent parameters (%2, %3, %4...) to see if that works for multi-file drag-drop.
