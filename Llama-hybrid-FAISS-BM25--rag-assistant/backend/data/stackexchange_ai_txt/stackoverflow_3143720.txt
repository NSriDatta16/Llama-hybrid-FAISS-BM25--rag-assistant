Iteration through the rows and columns is always going to slow things down. Try manipulating CSS rules directly to avoid the iteration in your JavaScript and force the browser to do it for you. Checkout the plugins jQueryRule and jQueryCSSRule . Manipulating CSS rules directly can be beneficial if you combine all rules. Here's a quick test with 500 rows, and 50 columns. The majority of the time is spent re-rendering, and time spent within the JavaScript function gives me on average 200-300 ms on Chrome, and 0 ms on Firefox. Currently it's using standard APIs, but it's trivial to extend this to IE. It works by creating a new node within the document, and adding all column manipulations there. The key idea is to combine all rules into one when hiding certain columns. So instead of doing: table tr :nth-child(1) { display: none; } table tr :nth-child(4) { display: none; } table tr :nth-child(7) { display: none; } it does: table tr :nth-child(1), table tr :nth-child(4), table tr :nth-child(7) { display: none; } When all columns must be displayed back, delete this one rule above that is hiding particular columns.
