Tumour cells and ResNet

A patient is represented by a set of images (1000 at maximum) of his tissues of either healthy or tumour cells. A patient is classified as 1 if at least one of the images shows tumour cells. These images are not available but ResNet features are available for each of the images that have been extracted using ResNet50 pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. We also have as a label not the annotation for each image but only whether or not a patient has cancer cells. The aim is to determine whether or not a new patient represented by a maximum of 1000 images has cancer cells. I have tried several classifiers as a logistic regression on the mean per patient of the ResNet features but I only get a maximum AUC of 0.7. Do you have an idea for improvement? There are as a training set about 300 patients each represented by 2048 (ResNet features) * 1000 (number of images sometimes a little less).
