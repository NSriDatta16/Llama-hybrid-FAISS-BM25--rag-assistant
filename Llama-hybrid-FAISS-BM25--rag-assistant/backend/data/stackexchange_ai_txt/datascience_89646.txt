Since you have both degrees in pure math, most likely you won't need to do another Masters or similar. For now, focus on making your CV look more like DS/AI/ML/DL. Keep in mind online courses at present do not increase the value of your CV too much. So this is not an easy task, but you have a good start with pytorch. What I'd do if I were you: assuming, you are interested in applying DL in computer vision. Here are some links: kaggle.com (competitions) paperswithcode.com labelled datasets: Pascal VOC, MS COCO, torchvision library (model zoo) for pytorch (simply import torchvision to get started) What you should do, is 1) read through some papers on state-of-the-art OS solutions for CV, like Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, 2a) use them in pytorch, they are available in torchvision and/or github, 2b) same with the datasets, 3) hack into them to understand them at a deeper level, luckily they are all opensource, 4) write your own functionality for them, 5) contribute to contests/OS packages, put up your own models on github You can put all of the above, especially 4) and 5) on your CV. Good luck!
