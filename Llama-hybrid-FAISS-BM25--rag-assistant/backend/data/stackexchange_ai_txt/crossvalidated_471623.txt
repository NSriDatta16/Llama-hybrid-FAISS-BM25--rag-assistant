question about the paper "ADDITIVE LOGISTIC REGRESSION: A STATISTICAL VIEW OF BOOSTING"

I am reading the paper "additive logistic regression:a statistical view of boosting". I am confused about how to get equation (31),(32),(33) in the paper. Could anyone explain a bit please? equation (31): $E l(F+f)=E[2 y^*(F(x)+f(x))-log[1+e^{2(F(x)+f(x))}]]$ . equation (32), (32) are the first and second derivative of eq (31) at $f(x)=0$ ,respectively. Thanks a lot!
