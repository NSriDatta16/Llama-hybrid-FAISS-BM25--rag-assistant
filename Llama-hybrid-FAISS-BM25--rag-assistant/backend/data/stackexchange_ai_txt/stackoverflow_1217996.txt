The file should be fetched once in most user-agents (including IE) but in the case of JavaScript, the code will be executed twice. The best example would be tags. Images will load once, but can be used multiple times. As for your example. It seems vain to do the same operation twice. You are basically saying "if less than or equal to IE8", then proceed to load the same file "if less than or equal to IE6", which it automatically will if it triggered the first rule.
