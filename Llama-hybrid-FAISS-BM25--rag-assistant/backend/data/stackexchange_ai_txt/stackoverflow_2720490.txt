Clojure and NoSQL databases

I am currently trying to pick between different NoSQL databases for my project. The project is being written in clojure and javascript. I am currently looking at three candidates for storage. What are the relative strengths and weaknesses of MongoDB, FleetDB and CouchDB? Which one is better supported in Clojure? Which one is better supported under Linux? Did I miss a better product (has to be free and OSS)?
