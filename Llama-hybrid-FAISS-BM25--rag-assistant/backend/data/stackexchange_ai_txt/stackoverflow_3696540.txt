Cannot see my label outlet when draging file owner in Interface builder

I have this in my .h controller @interface helloViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UIlabel *label; } -(IBAction)hello:sender(id); @end I opened the corresponding .xib file and I could drag and associate the button -hello to the file owner but trying to associate the label doesn't work: it suggests me to associate -view outlet instead why ?
