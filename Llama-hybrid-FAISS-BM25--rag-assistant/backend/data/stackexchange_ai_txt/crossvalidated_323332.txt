Given a flat prior, the posterior probability distribution for $q_{control}$ is $Beta(1+m_{control}, 1+(N-m_{control})$ (conjugate distribution, cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#Discrete_distributions ). Thus it is easy to draw a large number of candidates for $q_{control}$, $q_{cond1}$, $p_{control}$ and $p_{cond1}$ and simply count, how often one ratio is larger then the other. This is one of the examples where Bayesian flexibility makes things actually easy.
