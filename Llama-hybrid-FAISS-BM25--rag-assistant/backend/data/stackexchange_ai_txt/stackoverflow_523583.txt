No matter how secure the Nazi's thought their communications were, the allies would often break their messages. No matter how you try to stop bots from using your site the bot owners will work out a way around it. I'm sorry if that makes you the Nazi :-) I think a different mindset is required Do not try to stop bots from using your site Do not go for a fix that works immediately, play the long game Get into the mindset that it doesn't matter whether the client of your site is a human or a bot, both are just paying customers; but one has an unfair advantage over the other. Some users without much of a social life (hermits) can be just as annoying for your site's other users as bots. Record the time you publish an offer and the time an account opts to buy it. This gives you a record of how quickly the client is buying stuff. Vary the time of day you publish offers. For example, have a 3 hour window starting at some obscure time of the day (midnight?) Only bots and hermits will constantly refresh a page for 3 hours just to get an order in within seconds. Never vary the base time, only the size of the window. Over time a picture will emerge. 01: You can see which accounts are regularly buying products within seconds of them going live. Suggesting they might be bots. 02: You can also look at the window of time used for the offers, if the window is 1 hour then some early buyers will be humans. A human will rarely refresh for 4 hours though. If the elapsed time is quite consistent between publish/purchase regardless of the window duration then that's a bot. If the publish/purchase time is short for small windows and gets longer for large windows, that's a hermit! Now instead of stopping bots from using your site you have enough information to tell you which accounts are certainly used by bots, and which accounts are likely to be used by hermits. What you do with that information is up to you, but you can certainly use it to make your site fairer to people who have a life. I think banning the bot accounts would be pointless, it would be akin to phoning Hitler and saying "Thanks for the positions of your U-boats!" Somehow you need to use the information in a way that the account owners wont realise. Let's see if I can dream anything up..... Process orders in a queue: When the customer places an order they immediately get a confirmation email telling them their order is placed in a queue and will be notified when it has been processed. I experience this kind of thing with order/dispatch on Amazon and it doesn't bother me at all, I don't mind getting an email days later telling me my order has been dispatched as long as I immediately get an email telling me that Amazon knows I want the book. In your case it would be an email for Your order has been placed and is in a queue. Your order has been processed. Your order has been dispatched. Users think they are in a fair queue. Process your queue every 1 hour so that normal users also experience a queue, so as not to arouse suspicion. Only process orders from bot and hermit accounts once they have been in the queue for the "average human ordering time + x hours". Effectively reducing bots to humans.
