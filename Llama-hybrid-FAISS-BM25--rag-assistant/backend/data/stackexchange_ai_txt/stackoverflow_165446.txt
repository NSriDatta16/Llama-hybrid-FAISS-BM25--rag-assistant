Where can I find a good jQuery drop shadow plugin?

Does anyone have a good recommendation for a drop shadow jQuery plugin? I've been working on a project that had every element on the page with a subtle drop shadow, we started using RUZEE to do the shadows but there was a severe performance hit when you had more then 4 or 5 shadows being calculated on the page. I went to writing my own plugin , I call it simple shadow and it only uses jQuery to inject images in floating div's around the div you want a drop shadow. Nothing elegant but for the purpose of completing that site it worked without performance hits. Now my plugin isn't anything special but I am still in search for a good light weight shadow plugin.
