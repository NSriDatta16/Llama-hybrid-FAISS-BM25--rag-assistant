I believe that the problem is in persistentStoreCoordinator method in your GFree2AppDelegate.m file. Could you update your question with the exact code of managedObjectModel , managedObjectContext and persistentStoreCoordinator methods from this file? These methods are generated by the XCode when you check "Use Core Data for storage". By the way, you shouldn't import .m files.
