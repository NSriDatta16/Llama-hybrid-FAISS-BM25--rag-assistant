It seems you are suffering from the css-sprites bleeding problem. It's not that easy to solve, since not all browsers zoom in the same manner. One workaround is embedding the text in the button itself, this will prevent the browser from increasing the text more then the button. But this kind of defeats the purpose of css sprites.. Another workaround is to generate your text as an image using a PHP script and then put that in front of the button. This will prevent zooming while maintaning the flexibility of your current system. Or you could also make a sprite of all the button texts you want to use and combine those 2 sprites to display the button you want.
