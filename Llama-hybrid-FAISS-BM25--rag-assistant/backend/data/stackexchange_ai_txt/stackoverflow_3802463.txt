One implication of this, as I think of it in my rather naive way, is that clearing all of these values will create gaps, and the index would become fragmented. I guess the rows are still in the right order though, so is that really index fragmentation? Yes. You will get internal fragmentation. SQL Server won't automatically compact the data page to reclaim the space. You can use the SQL Internals Viewer tool to see this. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though dependant on your workload. Some degree of internal fragmentation can be useful to mitigate the below (and even added deliberately through use of FillFactor) Or you can think about it the other way; if they're all null to start with and you insert data, do you end up having to shuffle data out to different pages and also get index fragmentation? Yes. Assuming that there is not sufficient empty space on the page to accommodate the longer row you will get page splits to make room for the new data. The logical order will become different than the physical order and you get external fragmentation.
