Here's an analogy from physics - consider the distribution in $n$ dimensions to have many peaks or valleys throughout. In a MCMC sampling problem, the 'height' of the peaks would be how improbable the state was - we would want to go to the valleys. Now, let us imagine this same surface to be a the map of potential energy for a physical system. Then, since a particle or object would want to find a minimum for the potential, it will try to go 'downhill'. Now, in a classical sense, the particle can never pass through or 'tunnel' through the potential barriers. These barriers are the peaks in our distribution. However, in quantum theory, these particles always have a nonzero probability of tunneling through these peaks, and the probability of this tunneling behavior is dependent on the size of the barrier and the amount of energy the particle has. Essentially, if the particle has a lot of energy, it is moving fast. If it is moving fast, it can tunnel through the potential barrier. If a particle's aggregate phase of matter has a high temperature, each particle has a lot of kinetic energy, on average. Let's reconsider our analogy with simulated annealing. If we have particles with high temperature, we allow them to escape local minima by going through otherwise unfavorable portions of state space. They are, in this analogy, 'tunneling' through the regions of low probability. Now, as to how this relates to the distributions, I'm not sure.
