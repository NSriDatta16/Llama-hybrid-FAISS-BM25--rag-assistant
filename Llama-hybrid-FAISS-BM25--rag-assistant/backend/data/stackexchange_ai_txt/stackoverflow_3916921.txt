It depends on your environment. If your developers use similar machines in terms of OS and disk partition, workspace location, framework(s) location, etc, then I don't think you will have a problem with checked-in settings, in fact, as some have stated here, it can simplify the process of on-boarding. However, I've always worked in environments where everyone has his own individualized settings, some people used macs, some were on windows or linux, etc. Disk partitions were not the same neither was the way everyone organized their workspaces. In that kind of an environment committing project settings can cause really big pains. We've always added them to SVN ignore list. We use a screencast to make on-boarding quicker.
