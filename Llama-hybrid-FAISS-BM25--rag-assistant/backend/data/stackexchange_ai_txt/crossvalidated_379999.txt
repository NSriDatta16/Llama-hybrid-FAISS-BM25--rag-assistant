All models are wrong, but some are more useful than others. -- George E P Box You have made a great observation! The short answer to "how we can be sure that the joint underlying distribution exists, it's one and somehow fixed?" is: we can't be sure! The longer answer is: whatever distributional assumptions you make will be wrong , and you can learn a lot by understanding how they are wrong and by trying to make them less wrong. For example, you can plot residuals against time, and see if there is an important trend. If you find evidence of an important trend, then you can investigate modifying your model's assumptions to be less wrong. You could investigate simple modifications, such as just including time as an ordinary independent variable in an ordinary linear regression, or more complicated modifications, like abandoning linear regression in favor of an explicit time series model. Through this process of criticizing your model and finding appropriate modifications to model important trends in your data, you will, well, understand the important trends in your data :) This journey of model-based exploration is usually more insightful than p-values you can read off of the destination model.
