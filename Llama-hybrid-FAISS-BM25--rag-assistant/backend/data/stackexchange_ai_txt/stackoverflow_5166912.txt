This seems all pretty unlikely, especially the part where "func" transformed into "letterList". Nevertheless, you have to tell the linker to also link the import library of the DLL so that it can resolve identifiers that are imported from that DLL. The easiest way to do that in MSVC is: #include "DLLTest.h" #pragma comment(lib, "dlltest.lib") in CodeTest.cpp. The #pragma does the same thing as the linker's Additional Dependencies setting.
