This feature has been taken away to maintain consistency between Xbox and Windows games. The Xbox cannot compile shaders at runtime, but in XNA 3.1, the Effect.CompileFromX methods were included in the runtime common to both Xbox and Windows. As Shawn Hargreaves explained in his blog , there are still several ways to compile effect content (or any other kind of content) at runtime, but only on Windows games. I personally find the 4th method Shawn exemplifies to be both easy to implement and robust; you can import any type of content you want at runtime, and you don't have to go to all of the pain of setting up any MSBuild projects. EDIT: It's come to my attention that all of the methods listed in the answers to this post (as of January 23 2011 at 14:50-7UTC) require references to some of the XNA Content Pipeline libraries, meaning that users might have to install XNA to be able to use your product...
