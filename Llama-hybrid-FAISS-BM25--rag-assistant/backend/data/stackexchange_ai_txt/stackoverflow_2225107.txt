In my opinion, it is rarely a good idea to have any public members. It increases coupling between classes, and makes refactoring very complicated (should you need it.) Setters/Getters are the way to go, and the very small performance penalty that you pay for it is usually either optimized away, or trumped by elegance. To answer your question about array vs. single-getter-per-var, it's a matter of taste. I tend to only keep variables of a similar type within an array, and separate the rest.
