How to reorder a row of html input fields without getting into AJAX

I'm generating a set of rows of html input text fields, which I want my end-users to be able to reorder. I don't want to use AJAX, but am okay with Javascript. I'm okay with some arrow buttons placed on the side of each row, which when pressed move the fields up and down. My issue with AJAX is that its too heavy (50-60kb) for just this functionality. I had a look at some Yahoo code (YUI), but again, it seems overkill for one particular functionality. I found this - http://www.danvk.org/wp/dragtable/ - which is seems like the lightest code, but only allows column reordering. I'll be working on the last option, but I'm open to other thoughts / approaches on how to do this (ie, to allow the user to reorder the row-wise fields). PS: Not important to this discussion I suppose, but I'm using PHP to generate these html text fields.
