So the problem was with my Gallery entity I had private EntitySet _Tags; [System.Data.Linq.Mapping.Association(Storage = "_Tags", OtherKey = "TagId")] public EntitySet Tags { get { return this._Tags; } set { this._Tags.Assign(value); } } and it was throwing a null reference at this._Tags.Assign(value); So i assigned a blank EntitySet to the _Tags variable and problem solved
