They are not the same thing . This question in various forms is asked & answered multiple times on this site, see for example Discriminant analysis vs logistic regression or Linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression and especially Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? . Read those posts carefully! Summary: While logistic regression (binomial or multinomial is unimportant here) can be used for classification, that requires some extra decisions, like probability thresholds for classes. logistic regression is not classification, it is risk estimation . logistic regression is often more robust that LDA, since it does not use any assumption, like normal distribution, on the predictors. Such an assumption is rarely fulfilled.
