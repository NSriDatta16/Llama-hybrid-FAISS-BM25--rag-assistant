Nobody stops you from also checking errno / strerror (e.g. in your exception handler) for a more specific reason for failure. UPDATE -- regarding portability Incidentally, IIRC Visual Studio's fstream implementation calls the _open / _read / _write /etc. CRT methods, which set errno . Microsoft makes no guarantee about GetLastError still containing the correct value after the CRT methods return. Idem for the cygwin, mingw etc. implementations, which set errno with no claims or guarantees about GetLastError . So I stand by my claim that all you need, can, and therefore want to do is check errno . Now, given all of the above, if you still want to complicate your life and overengineer by using Boost::System instead of simply calling strerror then I guess my definition and your definition of elegance and simplicity are not the same. :)
