proper way to organize files in jcr repository

what is a proper way of organizing files in a wcm that is using JCR. Let's say the total file count is 100,000+ files and total file size is about 50-70GB. Is it better to organize files by fie types ( and create sub directories to further group the files by some category) What are the advantages. Does it make any difference while using query api, maintenance, or something.
