Clustering customers with transaction data

I'm rather new to machine learning but would like to use this to learn. I have access to a customer database with all transactions at the unit level. I'm pretty good with SQL so I can get the data in any shape required. My analysis tools would be either Base SAS or Python. Is there a preferred method of clustering customers according to their transactions across various product segments?
