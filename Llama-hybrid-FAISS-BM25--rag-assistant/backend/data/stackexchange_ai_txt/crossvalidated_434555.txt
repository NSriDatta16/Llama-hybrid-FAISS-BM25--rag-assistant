Gaps in time-series for LSTM classification model

I am using an Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network model to perform classification of accelerometer sensor data. The experiments (for collecting the data) were run a few months apart and there are gaps throughout the data. I have read about methods for interpolating and imputing, but since this is for classification and not regression/forecasting, I am wondering if I even need to fill in the gaps. Would it be reasonable to just sample intervals (sequences) from the time intervals I already have, and train the model on these samples? Any advice would be appreciated, as I am worried I am overlooking something.
