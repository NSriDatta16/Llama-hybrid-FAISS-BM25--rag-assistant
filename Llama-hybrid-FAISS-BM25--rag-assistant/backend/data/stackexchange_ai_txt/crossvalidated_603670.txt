When you have many hundreds of events, as you seem to, even a small absolute difference in survival cam lead to "statistical significance." You need to apply your understanding of the subject matter to determine whether the differences are practically significant. The log-rank test comparing two groups is equivalent to the score test for a Cox model with the groups as the predictor variable. You thus should get similar estimates of statistical significance, as you do. Yes, the crossing of curves suggests that the proportional hazards assumption doesn't hold for a simple model using only IHCA versus OHCA status as a predictor. The Cox model will provide a type of event-averaged hazard ratio, in this case probably emphasizing the large number of early events. That hazard ratio, however, clearly doesn't describe your data adequately. A more complete model, however, might resolve the proportional-hazards issue. Omission or improper modeling of outcome-associated predictors can lead to this type of observation. For example, if the OHCA individuals tended to be younger than those in the IHCA group and your outcome is the cumulative probability of death following an initial cardiac arrest, then the later crossing of the curves could just be due to omission of age as a predictor from the model. With this large a data set you could consider incorporating up to a few dozen outcome-associated variables to help account for things other than IHCA/OHCA . See Frank Harrell's notes on Regression Modeling Strategies for suggestions on how to do that.
