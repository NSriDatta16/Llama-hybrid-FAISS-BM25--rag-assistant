My employer has a 2D DataMatrix barcode on every document and form that is sent out. We then scan the results using an OPEX Scanner The resulting TIFF images we send to the SoftTek Barcode Reader which allows us to quickly identify the incoming form and account information. Since it's an ActiveX control we were able to user it in Delphi easily. We evaluated several options for reading barcodes but found that the SoftTek library allowed us to get the best read rates. It's not a cheap library but it's has proven that it's value to our organization. I just took a look at Zebra, the Version Control System had all the files deleted out of it on Sept 23, 2010. I can't see where they may have (if they did) move the repository. Browsing through the 51 revisions you can see the files that were available. But it appears that the project owner either did not know how to use version control or was playing around. Personally I would shy away from this library based on what I have seen in SVN.
