You need to supply a valid HTML fragment to $.before() . At the moment you have no closing tag. The cleanest way to do this is to self-close the tag: $('#slideshow').before(' ').cycle({ ... If you're using Firebug or the developer tools in a Webkit browser you can always see what elements jQuery is finding by writing console.log($("#slideshow-nav")); or console.log($(slide)); in your callback function.
