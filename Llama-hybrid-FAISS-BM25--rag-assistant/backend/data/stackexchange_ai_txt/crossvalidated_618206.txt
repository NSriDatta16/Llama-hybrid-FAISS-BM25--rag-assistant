How to properly evaluate survival models of different covariate set and sample size

I'm looking for a comprehensive guideline of how to compare different survival models on one particular data set. My priority is having a model that gives the best possible prediction of time to event. By different models here, they can be Models of different types (e.g. CoxPH, parametric PH models, AFT models, random forest, etc.) Models are fitted on different sets of covariates, each set can be mutually exclusive or overlapping with each other, and all sets are subsets of a complete list of covariates Models are fitted on different sets of sample, each comes from a larger pool of samples I would like to describe the context of my problem if specific details are needed: I'm working on estimating time-to-default of consumer loans My dataset contains about 200,000 loans originated from 2017 to 2020 The proportion of censored observation (loans without default) is considerable (approximately 70%) I need guidelines on these specific topics: Given the nature of the models I'm testing, what can be a good metric to compare them? I found that some metrics depend on sample size and the number of covariates (e.g AIC), and c-index can be problematic regarding highly censored data. If evaluation on a hold out set is needed, is there any rules for choosing it? (The data I'm working on has a great portion of censoring) I really appreciate if anyone can give me some comments. Thanks!
