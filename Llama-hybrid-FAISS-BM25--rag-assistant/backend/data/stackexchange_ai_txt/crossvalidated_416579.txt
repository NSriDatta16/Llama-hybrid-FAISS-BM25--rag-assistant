There is not really a formal explanation, there is only intuition, like you have, backed up by actual computations that confirm it. It just turns out that if you create a word embedding, that these computations work. So, hypothetically, if 'Madrid' is mapped to [2, 3, 4] , and 'Spain' is embedded as the vector [1, 1, 1] , then the difference between those, [1, 2, 3] , is very close to the difference between the embeddings of 'France' and 'Paris'. So you could say that the direction of [1, 2, 3] , in the vector space, corresponds to the 'is the capital of' relation. More realistically, these vectors are in 300d, not 3d as in the example above.
