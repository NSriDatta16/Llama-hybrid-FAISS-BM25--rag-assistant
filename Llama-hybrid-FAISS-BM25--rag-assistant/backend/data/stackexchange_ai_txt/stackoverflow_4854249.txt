This is a NOTE / INFO for others:: As "Steve Wranovsky" stated, take a look at StarageScp.cs in the clearcanvas src. In there you will find the StorageScp class that I have successfully used to accomplish retrieving a file from my ImageServer. First make sure you configure your Device port in your ImageServer under Admin/Configure/Devices to 106 or something. Then this is how you start the StorageScp class to Listen on your port. StorageScp.StorageLocation = @"C:\Users\USER\Downloads\DICOM\ScpTEST"; StorageScp.StartListening("LocalAETitle", 106); while(!StorageScp.Started) System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10); Remember to stop Listening when you close your app. StorageScp.StopListening(106); Then you just make your C-Move call to receive your DICOM file while your StorageScp class is listening. MoveScuBase moveScu = new StudyRootMoveScu("LocalAETitle", "SERVERAE", "localhost", 104, "LocalAETitle"); moveScu.AddStudyInstanceUid(StudyUID); moveScu.Move(); Also if you would like to send a file to the ImageServer look at StorageScu.cs & to use the class do something like this... StorageScu scu = new StorageScu(); scu.AddFileToSend(d.FileName); scu.Send("LocalAETitle", "SERVERAE", "localhost", 104);
