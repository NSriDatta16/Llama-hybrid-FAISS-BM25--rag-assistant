May I dare to challenge some elements ? Hopefully it can be useful to you : if you want your classes to have a well-known name ... well, anonymous is the contrary of a named class ! ;-) preserializing and delivering objects as binary data is a dangerous choice , and you got bitten by it (during a refactoring, but I believe that could happen in many other conditions). Serialized data is usually considered as a short term solution in Java, good for a few seconds. Many other options are available for longer term storage. Now, if asked to solve your short-term problem, the only approach I see is to restore your classes to a state compatible with the previous version. If the different ordering you mention is the only difference, I believe that defining the anonymous classes in the same order as before is worth trying ! Also take care that references should be backwards (to a class earlier in the file), not forward (to a class later in the file).
