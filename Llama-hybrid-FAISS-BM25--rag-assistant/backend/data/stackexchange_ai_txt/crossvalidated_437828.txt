Since you are working with a given data set, you can't increase the amount of data, so you will have to use simpler models. How much simpler? That depends on the model. There are some rules of thumb, e.g., for linear regression you want at least 10 observations for each independent variable; for logistic regression you want at least 10 observations in the smallest class for each independent variable and so on, but they are only rules of thumb (and there are others that recommend different limits). This isn't solvable by changing the train and test sizes as increasing the size of one will decrease the size of the other.
