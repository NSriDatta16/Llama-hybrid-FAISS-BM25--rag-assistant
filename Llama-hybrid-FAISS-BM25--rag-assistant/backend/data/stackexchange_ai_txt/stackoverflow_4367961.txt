Size of Image in Android

For a particular Image say on blue background, I can get its Width and Height in android. I can display it on screen using ImageView. Even If I keep the background of Image as transparent I can display it on screen. But still if I try to find out the width or height of image programmatically , I still get the same as in previous step. What I wanted to achieve Is there any way through which I can get the exact height or width of image minus transparent background. I want to do this because I 'm trying to implement a drag/move gesture. But now the Image size is more due to transparent background I can only move it to few portion only. Probably I 'm new to whole game that's why not getting right words to express me. But hope someone will understand. Thanks
