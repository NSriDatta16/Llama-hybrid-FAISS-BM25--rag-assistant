Why do we use only the first component scores to construct different indices?

I have seen that in constructing indices by PCA the scores of only the first component is used. Although the first principle component explains the most variation contained in the data, often the VAF is too small (10% or even less). Then why do we use only the first component score instead of combining the scores of first few dimensions which would explain more variation when combined (I don't know if combining these score on different dimensions is legit)?
