Interpretation of Moving Average coefficient in ARIMA and its equivalance with exponential smoothing parameter

On Running an ARIMA (0,0,1) model from statsmodels.api on a differenced time series say X(t). I get the following output const = 5.34e-06 ma.L1 = 0.8934 How should I interpret the above MA model with parameter 0.8934 in terms of an equivalent exponential smoothing formulation with smoothing parameter. X^(t) = X(t - 1) - 0.8934*( X(t - 1) - X^(t - 1)) = 0.8934*X^(t - 1) + (1 - 0.8934)*X(t - 1) The above assumes an underlying MA(1) formulation as X^(t) = X(t - 1) - theta*e(t - 1) but if I assume X^(t) = X(t - 1) + theta*(X(t - 1 ) - X^(t - 1)) = -0.8934 X^(t - 1) + 1.8934 X(t - 1) The second one is a more followed convention but looks like the first interpretation yields a more intuitive result.
