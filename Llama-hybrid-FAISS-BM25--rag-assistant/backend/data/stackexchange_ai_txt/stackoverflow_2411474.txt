WCF RIA Services - Loading multiple entities

I'm looking for a pattern to solve the following problem, which I imagine is common. I am using WCF RIA Services to return multiple entities to the client, on initial load. I want both entities to load asyncrhonously, so as not to lock the UI, and I'd like to leverage RIA Services to do this. My solution, below, seems to work. Will I run into problems/limitations with this approach? Is there a better pattern for this? Thanks! //create proxy to Domain Service var proxy = new RIAService.Web.DomainContext(); //call service; fire event when Presentation entities have been returned var loadPresentations = proxy.Load(proxy.GetPresentationsQuery()); loadPresentations.Completed += new EventHandler(loadPresentations_Completed); //call service; fire event when Topics entities have been returned var loadTopics = proxy.Load(proxy.GetTopicsQuery()); loadTopics.Completed += new EventHandler(loadTopics_Completed); void loadTopics_Completed(object sender, EventArgs e) { //bind topic entities to XAML } void loadPresentations_Completed(object sender, EventArgs e) { //bind presentation entities to XAML }
