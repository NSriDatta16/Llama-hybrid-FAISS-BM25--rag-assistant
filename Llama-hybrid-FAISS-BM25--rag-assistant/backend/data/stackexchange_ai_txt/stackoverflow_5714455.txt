How to get user information from SAP HR in an MS SharePoint Workflow?

Okay so basically I am creating a Workflow BPMS in SharePoint and I want to get a user's information like his/her department, supervisor etc. into the workflow. The workflow goes like this: If an employee wishes to order some stationary, he/she enters the workflow by filling up a form, which is sent to their supervisor (whose information comes from SAP HR module) and when approved goes to the general administration department. Since SAP stores the roles of the users and their organizations, I want to have all this information connected with my workflow. How can I achieve this integration? Thanks.
