PHP - accesing and modyfing data "on the fly"?

Imagine you have some code generated by php : (...) But the the code is dynamically generated and loaded in one function and there's no direct access to each nodes ( in this case). So on my site it looks a bit like an include: All clear? So here's the deal. I want to modify this code. So after it loads I want each element to be inside of a with increasing ID. So the end code will look like: (...) Any ideas? I have my own concept based on stripping site's code after loading and adding s with for loop but I believe there's more elegant way?
