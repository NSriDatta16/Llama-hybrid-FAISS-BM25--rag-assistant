Did a small empirical test with simulated data. Seems like procedure 2 can improve performance when using Random Forests. After thinking about it a bit more i think you dont really add more information into the model by using procedure 2 but it can help to present the information in a way that makes it easier for the algorithm to make a correct classification. Just like PCA can improve performance sometimes although it doesnt add new info. Seems like for linear models procedure 2 wont add anything or even make it impossible for the method to run, e.g iirc regression doesnt work when one of the features is a linear combination of the others.
