Why doesn't gcov report any lines being covered by my unit tests?

I am using Xcode 3.2 on 10.6, with the shipped version of gcov and default GCC compiler (both version 4.2.1). I have created a dependent Cocoa unit test bundle which is injected into my app, and followed Apple's documentation on setting up a gcov-instrumented build configuration - based on the Debug configuration which doesn't have any compiler optimisations enabled. When I build the test bundle with this 'Gcov-instrumented' configuration, the app launches and the tests are injected and run. Also the coverage statistics files are generated at: build/ .build/Gcov-instrumented/ .build/Objects-normal/x86_64/ .gcda build/ .build/Gcov-instrumented/ .build/Objects-normal/x86_64/ .gcno So far so good. I know the tests are really being run because if I insert failures then the test suite fails as expected. Unfortunately, gcov reports that no lines of the objects have been covered by the tests! Every line is reported as 0 coverage. I've searched here and at the Apple mailing list archives, and can't find anyone with a similar problem. I expect I'm missing something - but what is it?
