I'm not sure I really understand your analogy, but it seems like your analogy doesn't fully capture either the objections or the philosophy of Bayesianism. If I were going to criticize Bayesianism, I'd point to the fact that there are no guarantees on the results. Frequentists enjoy frequency properties of their estimators. They can say, at least in theory, that 19 out of every 20 95% confidence intervals they construct will contain the true estimated. That is a very nice thing to be able to say about your methods. Because bayesians necessarily don't view probability in terms of frequency, they can't make those sorts of claims. Another popular, but ultimately bad, objection is that priors are completely subjective. If you and I have different priors, then how are we to decide which model or analysis is right? At least frequentists can claim their methods are unbiased. People's objections to Bayesianism have nothing to do with the iterative procedure of conditioning. Without sounding like I am being harsh, I think your characterization shows a great lack of understanding of the Bayesian philosophy.
