Cluster Analysis: effectiveness of k means results and alternative methods

I have to separate 425 observations based on certain variables numbering 32. 1)I used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of Data, which gave me 32 components out of which 5 components accounted for 75% of the variance. 2)I used Elbow plot to determine no of clusters that is 6. I further used these 5 components as variables for kmeans clustering. when plotted using clusplot() Clusters are not well separated. Does this mean that clustering was not successful.(between_SS / total_SS = 67.9 %). Is there any other way to determine effective ness of clustering? Can somebody suggest a better way to obtain better clusters may be PAM, Hierarchical clustering ...?
