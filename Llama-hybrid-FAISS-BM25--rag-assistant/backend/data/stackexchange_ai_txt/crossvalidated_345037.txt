There is no "k nearest neighbor clustering". That is usually just a typo for k-means (but which does not use k-nearest but 1-nearest). K-means is a bad choice here. Do not use it on encoded data, and with different scales. In your setting, 0=online,1=bank,2=ATM means that average of online and ATM would be bank... K-means must only be used when averages make sense on every attribute! Avoid distance based approaches when you attributes have very different scales. What you likely want to do instead is train a classifier , not perform clustering.
