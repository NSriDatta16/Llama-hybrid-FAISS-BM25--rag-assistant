Show PDF file inside web browser with iText

I developed a report (without and independent of any db datasource) only with iText . I know that with JasperReports this is easy. But in my case I just storage the report in pdf file or I used acrobat for java beans to show the report to user. Now I need to change my implementation code to show this report in web browser instead to save in the file. How I can do this?
