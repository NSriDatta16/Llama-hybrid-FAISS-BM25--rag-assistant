I'd use a Markov chain algorithm for this. In summary: Build a dictionary. Iterate through the letters in an example piece of English text. Build a data structure that maps pairs of letters. Against each pair, record a probability that the second letter appears immediately after the first. Generate your text. Using the map that you built in (1), pick a sequence of random letters. When deciding what letter to write next, look at the letter you wrote most recently, and use that letter to determine the probability of the next letter.
