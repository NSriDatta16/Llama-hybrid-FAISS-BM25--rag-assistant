Per RFC 3986 : A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource. The basic syntax components as defined by the RFC: The generic URI syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of components referred to as the scheme, authority, path, query, and fragment. URI = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] hier-part = "//" authority path-abempty / path-absolute / path-rootless / path-empty So - an e-mail address is not a URI. However mailto:you@server.com is a valid URI.
