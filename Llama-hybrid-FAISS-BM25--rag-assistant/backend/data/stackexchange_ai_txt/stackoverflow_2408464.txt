If you want to learn something about parallel processing, I do not believe that picking a single algorithm will provide you with significant insights. Mapreduce is a composition of a map and a reduce operation. These are typical higher-order functions that functional languages provide. I would recommend first to learn a functional language, for example Scheme or Clojure. For Scheme, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" seems to be all the rage.
