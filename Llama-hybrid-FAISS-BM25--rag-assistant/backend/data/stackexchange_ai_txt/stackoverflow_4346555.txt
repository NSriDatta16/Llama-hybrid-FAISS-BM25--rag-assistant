The basics of edge labelling in JUNG are demonstrated by this snippet of code: vv.getRenderContext().setEdgeLabelTransformer(new Transformer () { public String transform(MyEdge e) { return (e.toString() + " " + e.getWeight() + "/" + e.getCapacity()); } }); Here, vv is your VisualizationViewer and MyEdge refers to your custom edge class. In my case, I've defined the functions getWeight() and getCapacity() to return the weight and capacity of my edge. Then I created a popup menu for each edge that allows the user to enter the edge weight and capacity and then used the setWeight() and setCapacity() functions to update my edge. I picked up how exactly to create the edge popups from http://www.grotto-networking.com/JUNG/ You could borrow from this example to set your own edge labels.
