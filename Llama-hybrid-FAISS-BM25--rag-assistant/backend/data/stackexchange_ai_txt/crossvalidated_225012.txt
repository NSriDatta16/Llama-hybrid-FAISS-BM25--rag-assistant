Interpreting R regression output with multiple interaction variables

Context I am exploring how different factors in targeting affect subjects' self-reported likeliness to purchase a product. Likeliness to purchase was measured on a four point scale: "Very unlikely", "Unlikely", "Somewhat likely", "Very likely." I fit two models, the first model compares people's responses to the survey at different times of the day. This model does not take into account my treatment and control variables (whether they had previously been shown an ad or not). The results are as follows: glm(formula = as.numeric(gfk_data$AnswerText) ~ gfk_data$daypart) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.03341 0.00086 0.00208 0.00376 1.00376 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2.997917 0.028795 104.112 So nothing is really significant here. Then what I do is interact the time with the treatment variable so that I can see if people the time of day makes a difference for how likely they were to purchase. The results for that model are: glm(formula = as.numeric(gfk_data$AnswerText) ~ gfk_data$daypart * gfk_data$Exposure) Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 3.61140 0.21564 16.748 Question I'm confused because given the base case, which is evening in both models above, how is it that daypartmiddle_of_day:gfk_data$Exposureexposed and daypartmiddle_of_day:gfk_data$Exposurecontrol have both have positive significant coefficients in the interaction model but middle_of_day in in the first model shows very little difference? Am I interpreting this correctly in saying that both daypartmiddle_of_day:gfk_data$Exposureexposed and daypartmiddle_of_day:gfk_data$Exposurecontrol have on average ratings that are .8-.9 higher than the base case, which is the aggregate of control and exposed for evening?
