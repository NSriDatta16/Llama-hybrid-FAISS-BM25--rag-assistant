I don't want to add anything to the other answers, but I do want to say that you have been led astray by bad terminology, in particular the term "line of best fit" which is used in some statistics courses. Intuitively, a "line of best fit" would look like your red line. But the line produced by Excel is not a "line of best fit"; it is not even trying to be. It is a line that answers the question: given the value of x, what is my best possible prediction for y? or alternatively, what is the average y value for each x value? Notice the asymmetry here between x and y; using the name "line of best fit" obscures this. So does Excel's use of "trendline". It is explained very well at the following link: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/regression.htm You might want something more like what is called "Type 2" in the answer above, or "SD Line" at the Berkeley stats course page.
