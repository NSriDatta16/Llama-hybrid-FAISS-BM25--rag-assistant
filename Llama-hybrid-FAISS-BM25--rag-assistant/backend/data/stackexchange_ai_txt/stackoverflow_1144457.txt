For getting the data, there are three levels of difficulty: file_get_contents($url); //easy Unfortunately a lot of sites aren't very responsive to the proper user agent. You've got two options, here. One's a little harder than the other. Intermediate is Zend HTTP Client $client = Zend_Http_Client(); //make sure to include Zend_Http, etc. $client->setConfig($params); // params will include proper user agent $client->setUri($aUrl); $html = $client->request()->getBody(); Option three, which you might not even want to consider unless you really want to keep it more scripting than object-oriented, is to explore PHP's cURL functionality There are a few PHP-native ways to access HTML data via a DOM object, but my favorite is the Simple HTML DOM Parser . It's very similar to jQuery/CSS style DOM navigation. $domObject = new Simple_HTML_Dom($html); foreach ($domobject->find('div#theDataYouWant p') as $sentence) { echo " {$sentence} "; }
