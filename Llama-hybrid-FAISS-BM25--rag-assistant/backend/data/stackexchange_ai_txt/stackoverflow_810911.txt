Not in the general sense - there's no real defined format for cookie storage, so each browser is free to keep the cookie database wherever, and in whatever style, it prefers. You could implement cookie reading functions for the mainstream browsers (IE, Firefox), but that would leave some people out. It would also be non-robust - what happens when the user clears their cookie cache, or uses more than one browser? If you want to keep your application synchronised with a website, I'd recommend that you have it call directly into web services (RESTful, etc) on that site, with a username/identifier your application users configure. This way, you're not tied to an arbitrary 3rd party that is, at best, only "maybe" right.
