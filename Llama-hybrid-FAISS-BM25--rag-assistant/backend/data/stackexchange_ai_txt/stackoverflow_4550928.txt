For ID field use analyzer based on keyword tokenizer - it will take all the content of the field as a single token. For DATA field use language specific analyzer . Notice, that there's possibility to auto-detect the language of the text ( patch ). I'm not sure, if it's possible to find the most frequent words with Solr, but if you can use Lucene itself, pay attention to this question. My own suggestion for it is to use HighFreqTerms class from Luke project.
