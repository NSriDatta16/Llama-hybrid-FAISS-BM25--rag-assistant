Reporting binomial logistic regression

I want to report the results of a binomial logistic regression where I want to assess difference between the 3 levels of a factor (called System) on the dependent variable (called Response) taking two values, 0 and 1. My goal is to understand if the effect of the 3 systems (A,B,C) in System affect differently Response in a significant way. I am basing my analysis on this URL: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/ This is the result of my analysis: > fit summary(fit) Call: glm(formula = Response ~ System, family = "binomial", data = scrd) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.8840 0.1775 0.2712 0.2712 0.5008 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.2844 0.2825 11.626 Following this analysis I perform the wald test in order to understand whether there is an overall effect of System: library(aod) > wald.test(b = coef(fit), Sigma = vcov(fit), Terms = 1:3) Wald test: ---------- Chi-squared test: X2 = 354.6, df = 3, P(> X2) = 0.0 The chi-squared test statistic of 354.6, with 3 degrees of freedom is associated with a p-value Now I check whether there are differences between the coefficients using again the wald test: # Here difference between system B and C: > l wald.test(b = coef(fit), Sigma = vcov(fit), L = l) Wald test: ---------- Chi-squared test: X2 = 22.3, df = 1, P(> X2) = 2.3e-06 # Here difference between system A and C: > l wald.test(b = coef(fit), Sigma = vcov(fit), L = l) Wald test: ---------- Chi-squared test: X2 = 12.0, df = 1, P(> X2) = 0.00052 # Here difference between system A and B: > l wald.test(b = coef(fit), Sigma = vcov(fit), L = l) Wald test: ---------- Chi-squared test: X2 = 58.7, df = 1, P(> X2) = 1.8e-14 My understanding is that from this analysis I can state that the three systems lead to a significantly different Response. Am I right? If so, how should I report the results of this analysis? What is the correct way? I think I managed to understand the procedure of using contrasts. Here you go my analysis: > fit1 summary(fit1) Call: glm(formula = Response ~ System, family = "binomial", data = scrd, contrasts = list(System = contr.treatment(levels(scrd$System), base = 1))) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.8840 0.1775 0.2712 0.2712 0.5008 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.2844 0.2825 11.626 > > > fit2 summary(fit2) Call: glm(formula = Response ~ System, family = "binomial", data = scrd, contrasts = list(System = contr.treatment(levels(scrd$System), base = 2))) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.8840 0.1775 0.2712 0.2712 0.5008 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.0129 0.1853 10.860 > > > fit3 summary(fit3) Call: glm(formula = Response ~ System, family = "binomial", data = scrd, contrasts = list(System = contr.treatment(levels(scrd$System), base = 3))) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.8840 0.1775 0.2712 0.2712 0.5008 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.1431 0.4113 10.072 I would report the results as follows: "Two binomial logistic regressions were performed using two different contrasts to ascertain the effects of the system type on the likelihood that participants report correct identifications. Results showed that participantsâ€™ accuracy was significantly lower for the system B compared to both system C (p Are these sentences correct? Also, is it ok to report only the p-values? Maybe the values for the coefficient beta? Any comment?
