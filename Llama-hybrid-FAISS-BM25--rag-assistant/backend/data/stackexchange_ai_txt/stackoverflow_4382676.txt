This works. I don't if that's elegant enough though. player_scores1 = [{:first_name=>"Bruce", :score => 43, :time => 50}, {:first_name=>"Clark", :score => 45, :minutes => 20}] player_scores2 = [{:last_name=>"Wayne", :points => 13, :time => 40}, {:last_name=>"Kent", :points => 3, :minutes => 20}] p (0...[player_scores1.length, player_scores2.length].min).map {|i| { :full_name => player_scores1[i][:first_name] + " " + player_scores2[i][:last_name], :score => player_scores1[i][:score] + player_scores2[i][:points] }} This example on Codepad .
