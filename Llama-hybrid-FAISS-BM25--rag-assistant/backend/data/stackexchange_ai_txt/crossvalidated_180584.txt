What is an appropiate machine learning algorithm for my problem?

I was having an idea for a software, which would make use of machine learning, and I started to code it. I got stuck at selecting the algorithm, since I'm not familiar with this field. My use-case is: For teaching, I'm collecting Wi-Fi data, and measure signal strength, like: My network, 86% Neighbours network, 34% Other network, 23% Then I assign 2 numbers to it, each between -1 and +1, so for example: (-0.65, 0.43) For the evaluation part, I give similar samples: My network, 68% Neighbours network, 27% Other network, 36% Then expect the algorithm to return something like: (-0.63, 0.41) I'm thinking it would be neural networks or pattern recognition, but these are really broad terms. I was hoping someone could tell me which algorithm(s) would cope well with this problem.
