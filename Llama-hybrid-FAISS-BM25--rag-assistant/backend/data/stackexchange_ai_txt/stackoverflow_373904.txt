I think many programmers cut their teeth with MicroSoft products (and their example code) and/or programming for Windows API and the early Microsoft coding conventions which were used in the code fragment in your question (I.e. Hungarian notation, capitalization of defined types, etc..). I loathe looking at source code from MicroSoft which looks like it has been run through a crosscut paper shredder and glued back together. But an ugly coding convention is not a function or reflection of the C++ language which I find no more beautiful or ugly than most other languages. Actually, I find the C++ syntax with minimal keywords, curly braces and rich set of symbolic operators serves to not distract from or crowd out the important stuff: my variables, my type defs, my methods; which, of course, allows me to make the most beautiful code of all :-)
