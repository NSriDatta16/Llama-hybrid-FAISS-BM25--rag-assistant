What's the purpose in hashing information?

After being taught how to create a hash table in class, I don't understand when hashing data would be useful. It seems to me that all hashing does is storing information in semi-random positions in an array. I want to know how any of the data can be made useful after it's stored. My question is this: what are some examples where hashing information is beneficial? How is data retrieved in any organized manner? It seems to be placed in arbitrary positions where it would be difficult to retrieve.
