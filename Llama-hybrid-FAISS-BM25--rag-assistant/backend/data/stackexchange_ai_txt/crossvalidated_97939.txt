If your algorithm is based on some kind of probabilistic model, then you can simulate data from this model, apply your algorithm, and see if you get the correct values. For example, if you wanted to test out a Normal mixture clustering EM algorithm, then simulate data from a mixture of normals and try and use your EM algorithm to correctly identify the true clusters & parameters. I use this approach (simulate data from the truth and try to recover the paramters used for simulation) for my MCMC projects when I don't trust convergence diagnostics. As @DanielMahler points out, this process is only reliable when your algorithm is unbiased, which will often not be the case. Biased algorithms won't recover the true parameters as easily as unbiased ones.
