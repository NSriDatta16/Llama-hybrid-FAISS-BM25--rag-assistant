Test if two averages of two binomial distributions are statistically significant to one another

First, this may be a duplicate of: statistical significance I'm unsure if that post covers my exact situation. If so, just mark this as a duplicate. Let's say I have a list of 100k potential clients and I sell cars. I select 10k clients based on a probability to buy a car from a model with many features. Each client has a different probability. I test the 10k clients on whether they buy a car or not across different periods of time and bucket the clients into four buckets based on, let's say their income level. For week 4, I have 1200 clients in the income bucket " $50k-$ 75k", and 1000 of those bought a car. I also have 1600 clients in income bucket " $76k-$ 100k" and 1100 of them bought a car. Can I use the fisher test to calculate the p-value between these two subgroups of clients in these specific buckets? A couple things I am unsure of is the definition of sample in this experiment and if the size is too large for the fisher test. Also, I'm assuming this is a sample without replacement and does that work with the fisher test? Are there better options than the fisher test?
