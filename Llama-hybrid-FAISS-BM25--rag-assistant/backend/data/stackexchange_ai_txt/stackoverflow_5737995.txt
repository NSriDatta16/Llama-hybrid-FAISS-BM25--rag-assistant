THANK YOU very much for you discovering of the 'Web Deploy Agent' service! This is something that only recently got turned on as I had all this working perfectly and just today installed the updated version of IIS Express, and ran into the exact same problem with port 80. So now that I have turned off the Web Deploy agent, my system works correctly again. As for ASP.NET MVC3, that works great for me on port 80 and port 443. It was quite a bit of work to bind both those ports so that IIS Express was able to use them as a normal user (most of it from the link you posted above), and to install the SSL certificate we use. I manually created all the entries in my applicationhost.config file to get this working, and the appropriate sites section is below: Note that my site is a combined PHP and ASP.NET MVC3 site, as we are in the process of re-writing the entire thing to run on ASP.NET MVC3, so most of the site is still PHP but lots of new stuff is now running ASP.NET MVC3, and that stuff works for me. Does your IIS Express work properly with MVC3 outside of Visual Studio, or is the MVC3 stuff just not working at all?
