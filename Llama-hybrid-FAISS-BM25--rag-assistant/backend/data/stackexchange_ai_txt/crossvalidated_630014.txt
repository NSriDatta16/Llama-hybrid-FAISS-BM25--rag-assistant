Your outcome seems to be a deterministic function of a feature. If someone buys again within $90$ days, they are a return customer. If they do not buy again within $90$ days, they are not. There is no statistical or machine learning modeling to do here, just a definition check. However, I see it as a major issue that you are trying to make a predictive model with information that will not be available until after you have observed the outcome. You do not know the gap between purchases until they make the purchase, at which point, you know if that customer counts as a return customer. You only have that information at a time when statistical modeling is obsolete because of the completely deterministic relationship. Consider what you will do when someone new makes a purchase. You have no idea when they will make their next purchase until they make that purchase, at which point, you know with certainty if that person was a return customer or not.
