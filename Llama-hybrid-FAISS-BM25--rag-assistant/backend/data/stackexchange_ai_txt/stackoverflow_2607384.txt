The user that PHP runs under - nobody - is set by the system administrator. There's nothing you can do about that. You can try chown() to change the file's owner if you know the FTP user's ID. Usually though, you will not be allowed to do this from within PHP. Depending on the group situation on the server, it could be that if you use chmod to change the file's access rights after the file has been uploaded, the FTP account can access the file: Try this first: chmod($uploaded_file, 0660); // owner+group read+write If that doesn't work, try this: chmod($uploaded_file, 0666); // global read+write one of these should make the file usable by the FTP account. The 0666 is highly discouraged because other users on the server could write into your files, but in some configurations, it's the only way to get going.
