It is not necessarily the "one to use" in the sense that you would need to use it, of course. In fact, if your prior beliefs regarding the unknown variance differ from what is encapsulated by such a distribution, you should not use it. However, the fact that both the prior and the posterior are from the same family tells us that this prior is a so-called conjugate prior, which may have certain advantages. These are for instance discussed in more detail here . Conjugate priors also tend to be computationally convenient in the sense that if the posterior, generally the object of interest, follows a well-known distribution, there is a good chance we can conveniently compute posterior moments etc. and need not resort to more computer-intensive methods such as MCMC.
