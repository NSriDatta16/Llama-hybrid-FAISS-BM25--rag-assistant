Normalization does not determine performance. Normalization is about correctness and preventing certain data integrity problems. A database in Normal Form does also help reduce design bias (a biased schema means one designed to suit some types of query better than others). In that sense it should give the best chance for the database optimiser to do its work. Denormalization means adding redundancy and in many cases that also means more storage is required for the same information - potentially impacting performance.
