Move UIElement in Visual Tree without recalculating layout

We have a WPF application (.Net 4.0) using a Docking Control (Actipro). We can dock out the docking windows. In that case, a "real" Window is created and the content is assigned to that window. Of course, moving stuff in the Visual Tree will re-trigger the complete layouting . This is problematic, because in one of these docking windows, we have a diagramming control (Mindfusion Diagramming,WPF control) that can take up to 10 seconds to completely layout itself (very large diagrams). I don't think that there's any direct solution to this problem. I wonder however how other programmers with similar issues approached this problem. Is there any clever way to avoid recalculating the layout? In theory, nothing really changes since the diagram is inside a ScrollViewer, so whenever it is placed, the amount of avaiable space remains the same(infinite). Edit: Also note that the diagram control inside is interactive. We need Drag&Drop.
