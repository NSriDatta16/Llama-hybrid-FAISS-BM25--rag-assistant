In many places, undergrads in statistics learn to derive common statistical procedures, so any standard text that has basic mathematical statistics - of which there are dozens of reasonably suitable choices - covers the basics of this. It requires little more than basic calculus and a little linear algebra to cover many of the tests discussed in a basic intro stats course. A text like Wackerly, Mendenhall and Scheaffer, Mathematical Statistics with Applications has derivations for a number of basic tests (some might be partly covered in exercises). Pretty much any edition will do - you don't need a recent one, and there are any number of good alternatives at a similar level. I'd probably start with something like that. If you seek a little more depth (within a still-widely-used text), you might consider Casella and Berger, Statistical Inference . I don't claim either book is the best of its kind, just that they're widely used books. I'd supplement those with a book on nonparametric statistics. Possibly something like Conover's Practical Nonparametric Statistics , which gives just about enough background to derive a number of popular tests, and to understand something of how permutation tests work. What you'd need beyond that is a reasonable text on regression. I'll try to come back with a suggestion for that, but from my recollection Fox's book Applied Regression analysis and Generalized Linear Models was reasonable and if I recall correctly has some of the derivations. If you want to look at the bootstrap, perhaps Davison and Hinkley, Bootstrap Methods and their Application . What else you might look at (e.g. Bayesian stats, time series, survival analysis etc etc) depends on how broad a coverage you want.
