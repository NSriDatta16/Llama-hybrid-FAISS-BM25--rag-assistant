How to reference an array element in ObjectiveC when that element is buried in an object hierarchy

I have having a hard time with ObjectiveC syntax. I have an array that is buried within an object hierarchy and I can't figure out how to reference elements from the array. Please see my object in the screenshot below: link provided. https://skitch.com/aibkwik/rqunh/fullscreen the element I am trying to reference is the "school" - whose value is "Freedom High". Can someone provide me with the appropriate reference syntax? I've tried things like: *nsstringptr = [cellValue.courses objectAtIndex:0 school]; I know I know - I'm a noob. But Thanks for your help.
