What puzzles me...Are .NET languages the mainstream languages for Windows (standalone) applications?

I'm an inquisitive .NET student without any commercial working knowledge and I have been puzzled by what exactlty are .NET languages meant for? Q1.If you look on job websites, .NET seems mainly used for web applications, not much for Windows applications? (My dream job is to develop standalone small Windows applications.) Q2.Are most "major" Windows applications developed using C/C++? e.g. word processing applications like MS Word or OpenOffice; photo editing software like ACD See or Photoshop; MSN or Yahoo Messenger; disc burners... Is .NET too slow and too indirect to handle these kinds of tasks? Q3.Are .NET languages mostly only used in SIMPLE business applications involving database backend? E.g. payroll or GPS applications Because it's too slow and too indirect for major software applications? Q4.I thought for the last few years .NET was the only development tool encouraged by Microsoft for Windows applications and C/C++ are outdated languages? Do they use MFC to access Windows API which is also outdated in new versions of Windows(backward compatible but not encouraged by Windows)? Q5.If C/C++ are the main tools for major standalone Windows Applications, then the (slow) managed code approach is only a joke? Or the dominance of C/C++ is due to most major applications are older than .NET? Can you give me some famous names of software developed using .NET? Thanks a lot for your industrial insight!
