Beware of the implications of changing recovery models!! And now for one more sobering thought for all you production DBAs thinking about using the script: BEFORE YOU CHANGE THE RECOVERY MODEL FROM FULL TO SIMPLE... there's no worries if you're in a development/ QA environment. But if you're in a production environment where you're responsible to ensure full recovery of data in the event of an issue, you may want to take a closer look at what BOL says regarding doing this (see BOL under: "Managing Databases" -> "Transaction Log Management" -> "Recovery Models and Transaction Log Management"): A database can be switched to another recovery model at any time. However, switching from the simple recovery model, is unusual. Be aware that if you switch to the full recovery model during a bulk operation, the logging of the bulk operation changes from minimal logging to full logging, and vice versa. After switching from the simple recovery model If you switch from the full or bulk-logged recovery model to the simple recovery model, you break the backup log chain. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you back up the log immediately before switching, which allows you to recover the database up to that point. After switching, you need to take periodic data backups to protect your data and to truncate the inactive portion of the transaction log.

" We strongly recommend that you back up the log immediately before switching, which allows you to recover the database up to that point. " I cannot understand why this little tidbit of information is hidden in a section named "After switching to the simple recovery model" making most "normal people" think they can go ahead and switch it and then continue or come back and read this after changing it. Rant To Microsoft: So, please correct me if I'm wrong, if I fail to do the t-log backup BEFORE changing from FULL to SIMPLE and lo and behold my database gets corrupted somehow (ever heard of Murphy's law ?) right before I'm able to take a backup... then I'm screwed, right? If switching the recovery model of my ****production**** database from FULL to SIMPLE is something that can break the backup log chain such that if I fail to take a transaction log backup before doing it (like it suggests above) I'm potentially going to lose data , then WHY THE HECK AREN'T YOU HIGHLIGHTING THAT IN A BLINKING MARQUEE MAKING IT A BIGGER DEAL than you seem to be??! You should literally be grabbing me by the shirt and slaping me to get my attention (so to speak) and warning me of the importance of this UPFRONT!!
