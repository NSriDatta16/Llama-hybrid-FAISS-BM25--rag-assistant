Does anyone know a tool for Git similar to SVN Time-Lapse View

SVN Time-Lapse View is a cross-platform viewer that downloads all revisions of a file and lets you scroll through them by dragging a slider. As you scroll, you are shown a visual diff of the current revision and the previous revision. Thus you can see how a file evolved, and you can easily find the revision at which lines appeared, disappeared, or changed. http://code.google.com/p/svn-time-lapse-view/
