R, structural change and Wald test

I'm doing a time series analysis and wanna identify structural breaks from a regression. Here are the data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramyshaban01/dataframe/aa074811a322b5f5252fcb59c81b75bd6503d260/data.csv here what I have done: library(strucchange) formula the breakpoints() command, using a Bayesian criterium, show me I should keep two structural breaks, and so did I. But then I wanna test for the significance of those break points. I chose to use a Wald test (maybe not the most relevant?). I didn't find any command calculating the Wald statistic for me, so I computed it manually wald_stats BTW, please confirm that my formula for the Wald stat is good (I don't know if I should put in the formula the number of observations for the full period or the period after the breakpoint) But then, I don't know how to do the test, I heard that there was a command wald.test() , but don't know how to use it. Don't know neither how many degrees of freedom I should subtract from the number of observations, and neither the distribution table (in this case is it normal or chi-square?) Thank you for your attention.
