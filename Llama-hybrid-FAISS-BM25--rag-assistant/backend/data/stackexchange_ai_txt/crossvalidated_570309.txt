Assumptions in causal machine learning

I am currently reading about causal machine learning, e.g. causal bayesian networks. I am wondering about the assumptions on that the causal machine learning models are based. For example, for linear regression the error term needs to be uncorrelated with the regressors so that the effect of the regressors on y is unbiased. I have not read about any such assumptions for a causal bayesian network. What if there is a hidden variable that is in fact part of the network, but is not represented in the data. Can the results of a causal bayesian network analysis be still called causal? Can you redirect me to some good books, where assumption of causal machine learning are made more clear.
