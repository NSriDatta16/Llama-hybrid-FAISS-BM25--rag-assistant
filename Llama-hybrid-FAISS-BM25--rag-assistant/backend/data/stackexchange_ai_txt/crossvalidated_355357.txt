I am using LDA for neuroscience research. Traditionally in neuroscience people "analyze one neuron at a time" and use the measures of all the sampled neurons to test statistical significance. In recent years population-level analysis is gaining its attention. Especially for high level cognition, single neuron usually does not have a one-on-one relation to behavior. By building a classifier on the neuronal population, one can get insight on how information is encoded in the brain. LDA, albeit simple, has advantages for my and most neuroscience projects. (some are specific to the comparison to LR, some are not) comparing to logistic regression, most importantly it's easier to classify more than 2 classes with LDA. usually in neuroscience datasets are high dimensional low sample size. As a linear classifier, LDA fits relatively less parameters. Fancier classifiers may lead to overfitting. LR seems also to perform worse in this case. LDA is simple to understand and to interpret. In neuroscience, performance is not all that matters. The rationale is to micmic living brain and to understand it. Thus LDA is suitable, textbook LDA is even the best. In multi class situation, classes in LDA are interpreted as the clusters in discriminant space. Analogy can be drawn between LDA and neurobiology. LDA, assuming identical covariance matrix for each class, use linear combination as discriminant axes, which is feasible biologically and is usually how theoretical neuroscientists assume the neural network to work. LDA is also a dimensionality reduction algorithm, which is extremely useful to neuroscience, of which the principle is to compress the over-complicated biological data and make understandable visualization... there is also a good thread here: Logistic regression vs. LDA as two-class classifiers One recent paper that used LDA for neuroscience. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-017-0003-2 A book chapter on patter classification in neuroscience. It compares a dozen of decoders for the purpose of neuroscience. http://klab.tch.harvard.edu/publications/PDFs/8404_019.pdf
