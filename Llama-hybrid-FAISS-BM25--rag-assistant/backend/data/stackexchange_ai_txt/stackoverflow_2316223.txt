Would this be reliable for using as an ID for data storage(SQL Server)? No. GUIDs are 128-bit but hashcodes are 32-bit. Therefore, there are necessarily collisions. It may be unlikely that you ever encounter one, but you are not guaranteed to never encounter one. What you want for reliability is a guarantee that you never encounter a collision. If you insist on using Guid.NewGuid().GetHashCode() then you need to add logic to detect collisions. GUIDs do have advantages (and disadvantages) but without additional information I would suggest using an auto-incrementing int column. Especially as you say you want a numeric column I would lean towards using an IDENTITY .
