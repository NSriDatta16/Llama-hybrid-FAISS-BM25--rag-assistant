There's quite a lot to fitting an ARIMA model properly. As with most statistical models there are things you need to do to check that the modelling assumptions are correct and that you've chosen the most appropriate form. The auto.arima makes some sensible choices for you but to understand these choices you'll need to do some background reading. Here's a useful place to start http://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim.htm However a short answer to your question is that there apparently isn't much by way of trend or seasonality in your time series and therefore the best forecast is a straight line. (It's often difficult to convince people that straight line is the best forecast - they want to see something complicated looking in order to be convinced).
