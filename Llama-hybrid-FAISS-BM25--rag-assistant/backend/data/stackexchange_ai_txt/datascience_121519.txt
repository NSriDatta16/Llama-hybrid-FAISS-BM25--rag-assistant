To input this type of data into an LSTM, you can use an embedding layer, which is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to represent discrete input tokens as continuous vectors. In your case, you can create an embedding layer for each of the categorical variables in your input vector (i.e., the chord, duration, beat strength, numerator of the time signature, denominator of the time signature, and key signature). Each embedding layer will map the discrete variable to a continuous vector representation. For the chord input, you can represent it as a one-hot encoded vector of length 128 (corresponding to the MIDI note numbers). You can then pass this one-hot encoded vector through an embedding layer with a specified embedding size (e.g., 32) to get a 32-dimensional vector representation of the chord. For the continuous variables (i.e., duration, beat strength, numerator of the time signature, denominator of the time signature, and key signature), you can pass them through a linear layer to get a continuous vector representation. Once you have obtained the continuous vector representations for each input variable, you can concatenate them into a single vector and pass it through the LSTM. The output of the LSTM can then be passed through a linear layer to obtain the predicted chord for the next time step.
