xgboost GridSearchCV take too long or does not goes to the next step

just strange %%time xgb = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.07, gamma=0, subsample=0.75, colsample_bytree=1, max_depth=7, tree_method='gpu_exact') this code takes around Wall time: 866 ms. but when I do the gridsearchCV it does not goes to the next step even though I gave only one parameter %%time xgb = XGBClassifier(tree_method='gpu_exact',verbose_eval=True, silence=False) kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, random_state=0) xgb_param_grid = { 'learning_rate': [0.08,0.09], 'random_state': [0], 'max_depth': [8,9], 'n_estimators': [400,500] } xgbGrid = gsRFC = GridSearchCV(xgb,param_grid = xgb_param_grid, cv=5, scoring="neg_mean_squared_error", n_jobs= 10, verbose = 1) xgbGrid.fit(X,y) xgb_best = xgbGrid.best_estimator_ for my understanding, this should not take that long. it d does not go to the next step I do not sure this even working or not it stop with Fitting 5 folds for each of 8 candidates, totalling 40 fits [Parallel(n_jobs=10)]: Using backend LokyBackend with 10 concurrent workers. data set size is (15035, 22) am I doing something wrong?
