If the problem is in embeding (html/css/js) try other methods such as swfobject or the one flash generates itself. If it works, then you have to concentrate on embedding faults. Another weird problem I had embedding in ie, comes with the http headers. If you need to load external data from a flash movie in IE, and the page has http headers with no-cache paradigm on, the simply flash will fail to load external data. This is IE voodoo. Also, if you prevent caching, flash movie will not be able to load ven a crossdomain file. Things get even worse on ssl. I hope it helped... Try this, could give you more info: http://faindu.wordpress.com/2008/04/18/ie7-ssl-xml-flex-error-2032-stream-error/
