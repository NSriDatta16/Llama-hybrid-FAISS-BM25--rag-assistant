Execute statements for every record in a table

I have a temporary table (or, say, a function which returns a table of values). I want to execute some statements for each record in the table. Can this be done without using cursors? I'm not opposed to cursors, but would like a more elegant syntax\way of doing it. Something like this randomly made-up syntax: for (select A,B from @temp) exec DoSomething A,B I'm using Sql Server 2005.
