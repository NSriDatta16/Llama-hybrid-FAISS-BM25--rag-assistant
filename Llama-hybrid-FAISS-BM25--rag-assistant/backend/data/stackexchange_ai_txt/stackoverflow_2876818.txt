Make DataVisualization Chart object zoom and scrollable by dragging the scroll bar

I'm using a System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting.Chart control, and have the ChartArea's AxisX and Y both set Zoomable to true. When chart is zoomed in, I see the scrollbar, but cannot drag it. Is it possible to drag the scrollbar, and have the chart display move as I am dragging the scrollbar button? I want to make it intuitive and interactive for the user. Thanks!
