How do you find the block of code you are looking for in Magento?

I have been struggling with a stupid situation. A customer has asked me to alter his 'advanced search' page to add a few options. The URL of this page is like http://www.domainname.com/index.php/catalogsearch/advanced/ This is a Magento store and I have no experience with this framework. I tried to learn it but found the learning curve too steep to gain enough knowledge to finish the project on-time. So I first made a small PHP tool that searches in all source files for a search term and reports back te number of hits. I used this tool to look for unique strings that appear on the advanced search page. But the text is nowhere to be found! My next attempt was looking at the database to find the string. So I exported all DB data and copied the resulting queries into my code editor and searched again, and found nothing! This is very awkward and is driving me mad. I cannot find the block of code that outputs the advanced search options! 'ANY' help would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks, Majid
