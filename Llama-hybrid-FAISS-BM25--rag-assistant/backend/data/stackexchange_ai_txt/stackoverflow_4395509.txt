How can I get a list of products related to an invoice in magento?

I am trying to alphabetize the items listed on an invoice in the backend of a magento site. I have access to the Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Order_Invoice_View_Items object used to display these items in the backend. Is there any way I can use this object to get a list of product skus and reorder these items? Edit: Here's the line of code that's gathering the objects for display in the view. I imagine I'd need to get the items sorted before this point â€“ getInvoice()->getAllItems() ?>
