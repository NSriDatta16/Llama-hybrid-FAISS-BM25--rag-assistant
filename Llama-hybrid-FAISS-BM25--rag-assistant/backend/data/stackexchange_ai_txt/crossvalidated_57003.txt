What you are missing is that it very rarely makes sense to use a prior for which all of parameters are independent. That might make sense if the parameters were as varied and logically disconnected as, say, the set {some physical constant, some baseball player's batting average, some yeast gene's expression level}. Most analyses look at sets of parameters that are best modeled as exchangeable , like, say, the set of all current players' batting averages or the set of all yeast genes' expression levels. For estimation, this leads to approaches like this ; for testing, it leads to approaches like this .
