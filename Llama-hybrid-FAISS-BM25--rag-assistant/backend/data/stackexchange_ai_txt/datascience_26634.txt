I would try using Google's CausalImpact package. Your use-case isn't causal inference exactly, but CausalImpact relies on bayesian structural time series models (using the bsts package) and has some good defaults that keep you from needing to dive into bsts immediately. Basically, you fit a model to the first part of your data, then forecast the rest. You see where your model deviates from the forecast. Using bayesian models means you can get error bounds - so you can have a degree of confidence in the deviation. In your case, you'd set your 'intervention' point to wherever timestamp you want to separate your modeling data from your forecasting data. Then compare the forecast to the actual data (look up 'nowcasting'). Here is a tutorial to get you started , and here's an introductory video.
