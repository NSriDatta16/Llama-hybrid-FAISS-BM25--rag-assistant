If you call android.os.Debug.dumpHprofData(String fileName), you can capture an HPROF dump that can be viewed with jhat or MAT. You'll need to trap the exception somehow (either try/catch or specify your own global default exception handler), and if you want to write to /sdcard you'll need the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission. See also Dalvik Heap Profiling .
