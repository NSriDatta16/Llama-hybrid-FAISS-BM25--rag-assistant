This makes no sense to do because the average outcome of the healthy patients is meant to stand in for the average outcome of the sick patients had they not received treatment (which is not observed due to the fundamental problem of causal inference/unbearable lightness of being). Without some additional strong assumptions, there is not much else you can do with this design. The difference-in-differences approach you outline above assumes that the sick when untreated share a trend with the healthy (though there may be a constant gap between them), which seems unlikely to hold.
