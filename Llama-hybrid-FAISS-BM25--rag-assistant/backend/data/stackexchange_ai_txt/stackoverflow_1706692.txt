Optimal code - One large query but more complicated data retrieval or lots of small queries

I have a C# program that retrieves multiple rows from a DB but currently does them one at a time on the same connection. Would it be better to write it so that instead of repeatedly running (where blah changes each time): select data from table where name = 'blah' To something like: select name, data from table where name in ('blah','blah2','blah3') I'm nervous of making this change as I am unsure of the additional overhead of retrieving this data from the resulting table. Please note the example data is not representative of the actual data so I can't do anything like: select name, data from table where name like 'blah%' Additionally this is in a highly stressed environment so even the slightest improvement could be significantly beneficial. Thanks in advance, Tom
