The proposed interpretation in your last paragraph is incorrect -- that increase only applies at the mean . If you started lower, it would be a smaller increase and if you started higher it would be a larger increase. $e^{a+0.8}- e^a=e^{a}(e^{0.8}- 1)\approx 1.2255 e^a$ It's better to think in terms of percentage increase. $\frac{e^{a+0.8}- e^a}{e^a}\approx 1.2255$, or about 122.5% increase. However, I am concerned about your use of logs on a count that could be zero (count of "likes").
