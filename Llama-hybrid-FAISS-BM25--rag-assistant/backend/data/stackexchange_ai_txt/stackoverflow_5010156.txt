working with threads on pageload

When my asp.net page loads, it needs to get data from 2 webservices. I want to make the data retrieval processes work concurently. How can I do this and update Label1 with the text result from WS1 and label2 with the result from WS2? I don't know how the code should look like in order to be able to update the controls on the page.
