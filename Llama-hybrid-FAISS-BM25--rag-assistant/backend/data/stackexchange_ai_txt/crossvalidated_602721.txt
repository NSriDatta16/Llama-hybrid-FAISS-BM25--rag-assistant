The context matters. In general, it is difficult to assign labels like “good” and “bad” to any performance metric, be it $R^2$ or something else. Your value of $0.11$ is better than $0.10$ and worse than $0.12$ . However, it is not reasonable to think of $R^2$ in terms of letter grades in school. It could be that your value is the best ever at a task like this, which sounds like an $A$ -grade to me; or it could be than even $R^2=0.9$ is rather mediocre performance, when though such a number looks like an $A$ -grade. What your value of $0.11$ does tell you is that you have made an improvement upon naïvely predicting the overall mean of $\bar y$ . While modelers might want to get much better predictions than such a naïve strategy would, you are doing something useful, rather than being outperformed by such a simple strategy. If other work like yours is getting $R^2$ values around where you are, that should be encouraging. If other work is getting bigger values, that is less encouraging. $R^2$ has some limitations, chiefly that it can be driven high by overfitting to the data. If you don’t want to do any kind of out-of-sample performance assessment, you might be interested in the adjusted $R^2$ , which, loosely speaking, makes an attempt to penalize for overfitting, and I’ve given a more technical description here .
