Logistic Regression: Risk Ratio and Interpreting the Magnitude of Confounding

Let's say I have a treatment and a test group, and I am trying to interpret the magnitude of confounding variables using logistic regression. From my understanding, to do so I need 1) the crude risk ratio ( $RR_{crude}$ ), which from my understanding is the risk ratio of the regression model without the confounding variable(s) added to the model and 2) the adjusted risk ratio ( $RR_{adjusted}$ ), which from my understanding is the risk ratio of the regression model with the confounding variable(s) added to the model. With this information, if I want to get the magnitude of confounding I can use the following equation - source : $magnitude of confounding =\frac{RR_{crude} - RR_{adjusted}}{RR_{crude}}$ Now here are my questions: How do I calculate RR, and is my interpretation of crude and adjusted RR correct (additionally is there a way to calculate RR in Python using scipy or statsmodel ) - i.e. I do understand how to calculate Odds Ratios. Is the way to calculate the magnitude of confounding above correct? How do I interpret the magnitude of confounding? Does it give me an indication as to by what percentage I need to adjust the results of my treatment group to take into account the effect of confounding variables (i.e. if I have a conversion rate on my treatment group of 9% and the magnitude of confounding, is 0.05, does it mean I need to reduce the conversion rate of my treatment group by 5% to take into account the influence of confounding variables?
