How to detect small details in high resolution images using CNNs?

I have the goal of training a CNN model that can detect if clothing items has any defects (holes, stains etc.) on them. I am using Keras to accomplish this. I will use the model for image classification, there are five classes in total (clean, stain, hole, pethair, wrinkle). To tell about the problem I am facing; the inputs I receive for inference will come from users, and they will be photos uploaded from these user's smartphones. So in average, input resolution will be 3024 x 4032 , and the aspect ratio will always be 3:4. I have collected a dataset of high resolution images, and set the input of my model to 900 x 1200 pixels. But still I can't seem to achieve any success when it comes to detecting small details, and my model's accuracy is pretty low. For example; This the input image, 3024 x 4032 pixels These are the holes I am trying to detect I think I have collected enough data to train the model, but I believe the details are lost when the images are resized to match the input resolution. What else can I do to make my model work? Is there any way other than setting the input resolution even higher?
