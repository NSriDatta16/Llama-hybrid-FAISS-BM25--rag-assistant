How to match second tag in this string

I have a HTML fragment which contains two anchor tags in various parts of the HTML. My Site &gt; Announcements &gt; Settings I'm looking to write a regular expression that will return the second anchor tag, which has 'Announcements' as it's text. In trying to write an expression, I keep getting both anchor tags returned - but I'm only interested in the second tag. Is it possible to match the second tag only? EDIT: I will always know that I'm looking for an anchor tag which has 'Announcements' in it's text, if that helps.
