I don't have a copy handy, but I believe in Edward Tufte's The visual display of quantitative information , he suggests that for time series charts the X axis should be reserved for the temporal dimension (simply for familiarity). He also has an example where connecting the lines between the observations one is able to discern periodicity in the observations that would be difficult to detect simply observing the dots. So I would just suggest a simple line plot, which with your above data could be graphed in R as; plot(x = 1:11, y = dat$conv, type = "l", xaxt='n') axis(1, 1:11, as.character(dat$date)) Considering the nature of the data another question suggesting to graph confidence intervals for estimates may be of interest as well.
