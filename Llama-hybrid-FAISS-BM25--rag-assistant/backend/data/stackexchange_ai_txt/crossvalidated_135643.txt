No , it does not make sense to look for cointegration among stationary time series. Cointegration can only take place if the individual time series are integrated (thus non-stationary). The basic idea can be found in Wikipedia : If two or more series are individually integrated ... but some linear combination of them has a lower order of integration, then the series are said to be cointegrated.
