This sounds like an analysis of variance is needed first. Very first preliminary is to analyze the scores for individuals and scores for groups just to check that there are meaningful differences. If there's not much different between individuals and between groups, then no need to proceed trying to model the nonexistent differences. Assuming there are differences, and assuming all groups are the same number of individuals, an initial approach to model might be to fit scores to a model using each of individuals as dummy variables, e.g., Individual001=1 if Individual001 was in the group, 0 otherwise. If the model fits, then higher coefficients mean that individual is contributing more to group scores, lower means less of a contribution, maybe even some negative coefficients if there are individuals that drag down group scores.
