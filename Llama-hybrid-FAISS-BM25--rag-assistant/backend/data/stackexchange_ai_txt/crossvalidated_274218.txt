If you know the data is an outlier then you should deal with it, e.g. remove it. Averaging is not a way to deal with outliers. Averaging works for noise reduction. Noise is not outliers. Your problem description sounds like if you were dealiong with noise, not outliers. Example of an outlier: you're measuring the daily rainfall by checking the bucket outside your house. You collected the data but one day sticks out. You check the CCTV camera recording for that day and notice that a deer got into the backyard and kicked the bucket. The observation has obviously nothing to do with the rainfall, so you need to remove it. This is very different from reading the small amount of rainfall from a big bucket. It'll be quite noisy, so you may want to average it out, to rolling weekly or monthly average. This is not an outlier, it's just the measurement noise. These are two very different situations, and must be dealt differently.
