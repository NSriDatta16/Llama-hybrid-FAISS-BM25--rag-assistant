is there any difference between linear and nonlinear activation function in a single hidden network? If you have a single-layer network with activations functions that are all linear, the network is a linear model -- the same as a linear regression. This is because compositions of linear functions are still linear. If the last layer is a softmax, but the hidden layer is linear, this is a logistic regression. If you have a single-layer network with nonlinear hidden units, it is not equivalent to any linear model. It is expressly a nonlinear model.
