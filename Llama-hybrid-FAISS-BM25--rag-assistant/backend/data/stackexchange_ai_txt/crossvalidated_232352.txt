I would agree with the definition you've encountered in the WLLN rather than their definition of a "population mean" as being a "sample mean of the entire population". They differ in some important ways. Suppose for instance that I conduct a survey which samples the first 100 people who come through the mall on a Saturday. My experiment does not generalize to all mall patrons, or even the first 100 to come through on any other day of the week. An important distinction in frequentist statistics is that of an infinitely sized "population". In my mall survey, the "population" would be defined as an infinite number of independent replications of my experiment in which I "rewound time" and did my survey again and again and again. This is counterfactual reasoning. If you sample 100% of a finite population without replacement and obtain a sample mean $\bar{X}$ you can still replicate that experiment an infinite number of times and sample people again and again and again obtaining sample mean $\bar{X}$ an infinite number of times. So a proper finite sample CI would be $\bar{X}$ to $\bar{X}$. The answer above obviates this. The population characteristic does not have a distribution. By "values obtained" do you mean the estimand? In statistics , if a sample is obtained from IID observations with a mean $\mu$, then the sample average will also have mean $\mu$, that's simply a result of linear operators. Practically, it would not be an estimate if you sampled everybody. You can safely say that you have found the "true mean". RVs are mappings or functions, they have nothing to do with sample/population distinctions. I think what you are saying here is a mistake. A parameter in a model may be the mean, and we may call that $\mu$ (or $\theta$ or... there is no conventional notation here), but there are other distributions with different parameters like shape, scale, shift, or rate parameters which we may call $\mu$ or $\theta$ or... Obviously if you call a "scale" parameter $\mu$ then no the sample mean does NOT estimate this value. However, if the mean is a well defined quantity, it is some function of the parameters and you will consistently estimate this value with the sample mean.
