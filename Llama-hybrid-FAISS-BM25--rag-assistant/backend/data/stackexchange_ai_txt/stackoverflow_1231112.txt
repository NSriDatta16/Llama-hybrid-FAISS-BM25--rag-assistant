Definitely do not teach outdated methods. You used to teach in just one step, HTML with styling tags. Now, just teach in 2 steps. First teach a few basic semantic tags such as headers, paragraphs, and lists, then teach them how to make a stylesheet to style those. Then move on to more tags and more advanced styling from there.
