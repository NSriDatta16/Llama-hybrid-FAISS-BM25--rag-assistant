BIC is estimating the asymptotic marginal likelihood under a Bayesian model. Since its an asymptotic argument, the choice of prior doesnt matter which is why the BIC formula is prior-independent. See the original Schwartz paper: https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344136 "But AIC and BIC have different asymptotic properties (consistency of BIC and efficiency of AIC). Any insight on this would be helpful." AIC is inconsistent when comparing nested models, when the simpler model is the true one. This is because the out-of-sample prediction error of both models is asymptotically equal, since the more complex model can reduce to the simpler one. Suppose we are doing variable selection and have: Model 1: Y = B0 + B1 X + error Model 2: Y = B0 + B1 X + B2 X2 + error If model 2 is correct then the AIC will correctly identify it. But if Model 1 is correct then Mddel 2 is reducible to Model 1 by taking B2=0 (which will be its asymptotic estimate), so the AIC may not be consistent. BIC will be consistent in this scenario. However the advantage of AIC comes when all of your models are false (i.e. when none correctly capture the data). In this case, AIC will asymptotically choose the model which is most similar to the true model (in terms of KL divergence) whereas the BIC generally doesnt have such well-defined nice asymptotic behavior.
