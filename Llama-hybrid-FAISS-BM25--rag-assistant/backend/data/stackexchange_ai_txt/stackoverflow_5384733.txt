I've found the best approach to this problem is to make the property a string instead and do the necessary string to integer conversion in your property setter. If the conversion is invalid, then you could reset the TextBox value to a default value. This way your property setter will always get fired. If your model has an integer property, then it makes sense to place the string version on the view model, as this is only really related to the UI, rather than business logic. If you don't wish the user to be able to input non digit characters, then you can use a masked text box, such as the one included in the Extended WPF Toolkit , or in a third party control suite such as those offered by Telerik or Infragistics.
