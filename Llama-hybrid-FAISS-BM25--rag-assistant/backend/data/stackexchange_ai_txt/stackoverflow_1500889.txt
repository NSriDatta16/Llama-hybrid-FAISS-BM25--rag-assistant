Just a couple of troubleshooting questions: Is this problem specific to your machine? Can you duplicate the problem from another machine? If you log into the server itself and use its version of SSMS, does it also have the problem? Have you tried reinstalling SQL Server 2008 on the server? Are you able to the see File System and MSDB folders under Stored Packages or does it just never expand Stored Packages at all as you implied in your post? If you run the following queries, do they return any values? The first query should display the list of folders including a Maintenance Plans folder and a blank folder. The second query should show all of your deployed packages if you are relying on server storage. select * from msdb.dbo.sysssispackagefolders select * from msdb.dbo.sysssispackages
