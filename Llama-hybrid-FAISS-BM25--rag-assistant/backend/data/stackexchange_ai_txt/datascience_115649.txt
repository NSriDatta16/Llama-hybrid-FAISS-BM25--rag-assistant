Hierarchical Classification - machine learning model with NLP

I have a Pandas DataFrame which consists of a body of text in 1 row. Each body of text is assigned labels for Category (in 1 row) and a Topic (in a separate row). Example of DataFrame below: Text Category Topic cognitive training ... Category A Topic 2 correlation between ... Category F Topic 56 There are 8 Categories with a total of 60 unique Topics. These Topics are not equally shared amongst the Categories, for example Category A can have Topics 1-18 and Category B can have Topics 19-27. A basic diagram has been added below demonstrating the levels. ____________|______________________ / | \ \ ... Cat A Cat B Cat C / / | \ \ | \ | 1 2 3 4 5 ... 19 20 ... 28 I would like to know the best approach(s) for generating a Hierarchical Classification where both the Category and Topic are generated in the prediction. So if a new body of text is received both levels can be predicted e.g. Category and Topic. I have been using TfIdf on the body of text and how next to proceed is troubling me. from sklearn_hierarchical_classification.classifier import HierarchicalClassifier Attempting to use this library isnt providing me with both levels as a prediction. Any help or ideas in implementing such a model would be really appreciated :) Many thanks!
