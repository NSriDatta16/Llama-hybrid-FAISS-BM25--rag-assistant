The PRO for keeping all fields in one table is that you get rid of JOIN 's which makes your queries faster. The CONTRA is that your table grows larger which makes your queries slower. Which one impacts you more, totally depends on your data distribution and which queries you issue most often. In general, splitting is better for OLTP systems, joining is better for data analysis (that tends to scan the tables). Let's imagine 2 scenarios: Split fields. There are 1,000,000 rows, the average row size is 20 bytes, the split field is filled once per 50 rows (i. e. 20,000 records in the split table). We want to query like this: SELECT SUM(mainfield + COALESCE(splitfield, 0)) FROM maintable LEFT JOIN splittable ON splitid = mainid This will require scanning 20,000,000 bytes and nested loops (or hash lookups) to find 10,000 records. Each hash lookup is roughly equivalent to scanning 10 rows, so the total time will be equivalent of scanning 20,000,000 + 10 * 20,000 * 20 = 24,000,000 bytes Joined fields. There are 1,000,000 rows, the average row size is 24 bytes, so the query will scan 24,000,000 bytes. As you can see, the times tie. However, if either parameter changes (field is filled more often or more rarely, the row size is more or less, etc), one or another solution will become better.
