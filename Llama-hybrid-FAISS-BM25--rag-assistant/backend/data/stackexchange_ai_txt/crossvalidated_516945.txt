The question is not about the MCMC method, is not about the R code, but is rather about Bayesian inference . The sampling model is a Gamma model $$x_1,\ldots,x_n \sim \mathcal Ga(\alpha,\beta)$$ whose parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are unknown and inferred from the data $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ using Bayesian inference. The specific prior distribution on the parameter $(\alpha,\beta)$ is made of two Gamma distributions: $$\alpha \sim \mathcal Ga(\lambda_\alpha,\nu_\alpha)\qquad \beta \sim \mathcal Ga(\lambda_\beta,\nu_\beta)$$ The MCMC algorithm reproduce therein is a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm that produces a Markov chain converging to the true posterior distribution $$\pi(\alpha,\beta|x_1,\ldots,x_n,\lambda_\alpha,\nu_\alpha,\lambda_\beta,\nu_\beta)$$ (Disclaimer: this is explained in more details in the tutorial written by Theo Kypraios , I just did not check the link before answering!) Question 1: Why is the Gamma Distribution appropriate? The Gamma distribution appears three times, as a sampling distribution and as two prior distributions. There may be a particular reason for picking a Gamma as the distribution of the data, but the other two Gammas are choices of prior distributions, hence do not correspond to a "truth". They may reflect some prior knowledge , or else be chosen for computational convenience. In particular, the Gamma prior on $\beta$ is a conjugate prior , meaning the posterior is also a Gamma distribution. In any case, the MCMC algorithm is adapted to this specific choice of prior (and all choices of $(\lambda_\alpha,\nu_\alpha,\lambda_\beta,\nu_\beta)$ and would obviously need be modified for other classes of priors. When mentioning "the MCMC converges to the true parameters" it should be stated as converging to the true posterior . Question 2: What values should I pick up to use in the MCMC simulation? As stated above, the algorithm formally operates the same for all values of the hyperparameter $(\lambda_\alpha,\nu_\alpha,\lambda_\beta,\nu_\beta)$ . And the outcome of the MCMC algorithm is reflecting this choice. Changing the hyperparameter and re-running the MCMC algorithm does not bring any information on the choice of these.
