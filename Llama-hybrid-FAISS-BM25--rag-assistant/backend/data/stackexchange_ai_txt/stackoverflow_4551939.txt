The JPEG standard is extremely complex. I am thinking it may be an issue with padding the output of the DCT somehow. The DCT is done to transform the content from YCrCb 4:2:2 to signal space with one DCT for each channel, Y,Cr, and Cb. The DCT is done on a "Macroblock" or "minimum coded block" depending on your context. JPEG usually has 8x8 macroblocks. When on the edge and there are not enough pixel it clamps the edge value and "drags it across" and does a DCT on that. I am not sure if this helps, but it sounds like a non standard conforming file. I suggest you use JPEGSnoop to find out more. There are also several explanations about how JPEG compression works. One possibility is that the sample rate may be encoded incorrectly. It might be something exotic such as 4:2:1 So you might be pulling twice as many X samples as there really are, thus distorting the image.
