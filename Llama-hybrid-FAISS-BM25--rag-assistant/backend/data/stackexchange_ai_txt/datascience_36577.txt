What companies would be great for entry level data science/ machine learning programmers to help fight for a good cause?

I am just starting to learn about machine learning, and I have taken some intro classes in MATLAB and Python. I want to know about fulfilling careers and fields programmers can pursue to help me determine my career direction. Thank you for your time!
