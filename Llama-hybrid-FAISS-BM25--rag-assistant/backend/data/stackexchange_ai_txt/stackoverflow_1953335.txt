Just the same. myClass::operator()(string) is a regular method. If you have several overloaded operator() methods (e.g. a const and a non-const version) gdb should offer the choice where to set the breakpoint: http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/gdb-5.0/html_node/gdb_35.html#SEC35 You may have to make sure that method operator()(string) is actually compiled. Edit: I've tested the following file test.cpp: #include #include class myClass { public: void operator()( int i ) { std::cout Compiled with g++ test.cpp -o test , ran gdb test (version GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1344)), typed start and only then could I set breakpoints. b 'myClass::operator()(string)' and b myClass::operator() both worked.
