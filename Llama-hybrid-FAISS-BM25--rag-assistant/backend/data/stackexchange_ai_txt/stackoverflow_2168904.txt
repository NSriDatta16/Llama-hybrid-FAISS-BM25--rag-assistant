Throwing multiple exceptions in a method of an interface in java

I wanted to ask that how to mention this in my interface public class find(int x) throws A_Exception, B_Exception{ ---- ---- --- } i want to say that i can mention One exception in an interface but how to mention in my interface that my method will throw Two exceptions Namely A and B... the code fragment mentioned above works only for A and not for B... Help public interface dictionary{ public void insert(int x) throws Dictionary_FullException, Duplicate_Element_FoundException; } ... public class SortedArray implements dictionary{ public void insert(int x) throws Dictionary_FullException, Duplicate_Element_FoundException { --------- } but when i compile it ... it says.. SortedArray.java:66: insert(int) in assign.SortedArray cannot implement insert(int) in assign.dictionary; overridden method does not throw assign.SortedArray.Duplicate_Element_FoundException public void insert(int x) throws Dictionary_FullException
