Can you add a UITableViewController's TableView to another View?

I've inserted a UITableViewController and it's corresponding UITableView into a simple IB document. The goal is to include the UITableView inside of a parent UIWindow (or UIView) with other "stuff" (anything really) adorning the table. Here's what that might look like in Interface Builder. I've tried this numerous times and always get to the same place. Build a working subclass of UITableViewController filled with data Customize the UTableView and it's cells including tap targets Add the newly created UITableViewController into an IB document Drag the UITableView out of the UITableViewController and into the main UIView Wire up the UITableViewController to the UITableView Note: adding the UITableViewController in code results in the same problem When running the app in the iPhone emulator or on a device the table displays correctly, but crashes the first time you try and interact with it. A scroll, a tap, anything crashes the app. This seems to be a delegate problem, like the UITableView doesn't know how to communicate back to the UITableViewController, but I have no idea how to correct the problem. So far I have been able to get by by customizing the tableHeaderView to get layouts that suffice, but I'd really prefer to have the other technique work.
