Ethernet packets can be up to around 1500 bytes (and that's not counting jumbo frames). If you send broadcast messages with a payload of only 4 bytes, they shouldn't get fragmented at all. Fragmentation should only occur when the packet is larger than the Maximum Transmission Unit (so about 1500 bytes over Ethernet).
