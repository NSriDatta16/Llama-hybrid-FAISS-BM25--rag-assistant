I might be missing something, but the trio WizardSpells, LoadedSpell, SetSpell seems like it could be clarified. Specifically, I don't see the list being used in your code so far. I would probably add spells available to the Wizard to the list, with LearnNewSpell(Spell newSpell), and check that LoadSpell uses a spell from that list. Also, you might consider at some point adding some extra info about the type of caster on the Spell, if you are going to have multiple types of Casters.
