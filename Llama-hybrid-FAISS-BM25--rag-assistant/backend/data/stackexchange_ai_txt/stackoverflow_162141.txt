The funny thing is: I host projects in Subversion Repos, but access them via the Git Clone command. Please read Develop with Git on a Google Code Project Although Google Code natively speaks Subversion, you can easily use Git during development. Searching for "git svn" suggests this practice is widespread, and we too encourage you to experiment with it. Using Git on a Svn Repository gives me benefits: I can work distributed on several machines, commiting and pulling from and to them I have a central backup/public svn repository for others to check out And they are free to use Git for their own
