Flex canvas scrolling problem

I have a canvas in my Flex project. It has one child element. I made the element's y property to 500 and a scrrollbar appeared on the canvas. I dragged the scrollbar to bottom to see my element. I moveed element to y = 200 After that the scrollbar is still on the same place. How can I update the scrollbar and move it to the top? Thanks
