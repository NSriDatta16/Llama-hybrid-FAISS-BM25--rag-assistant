Store text files safely in JAR

Is there any way in Java to store external files (inside jar) safely? Java files are compiled to .class files and not readable. I'm planning to use this meganism to store sql files, which hold queries, however i dont want those to be readable when one extracts the jar. External files are pre, cause we then have syntax highlighting while developping instead of putting them into a string.
