When creating a project with the webapp archetype in Maven, they subtly advise not putting any Java source in the webapp project by not including the "src/main/java" folder. That's not really true. When you create a project with the maven-archetype-quickstart, you don't get a src/main/resources directory. Would that mean you should not put resources in this project? No. What do you name your Maven projects? There is no general rules, nor conventions. Use something that makes sense for your organization and your team. But as I said above, your initial assumption is not true and putting Java code inside a maven war module is a common practice (except for code you want to share between modules).
