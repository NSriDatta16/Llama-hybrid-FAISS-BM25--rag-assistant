Using UIButtons as replacements for your UIImageViews is a great idea that Morion mentioned as you can just drag a connection from each button to an outlet in your view controller and handle the action. You can set the background image on the buttons as you are doing currently with the UIImageViews. Set your button type to custom and you'll be good to go. If, however, you are set on using UIImageView, you will have to subclass UIImageView and override the touch methods you want to intercept. For example: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Call super to make sure you don't lose any functionality [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; // Perform the actions you want to perform with the tap. }
