Backbone.js is a JavaScript framework that helps you organize your code. It is literally a backbone upon which you build your application. It doesn't provide widgets (like jQuery UI or Dojo). It gives you a cool set of base classes that you can extend to create clean JavaScript code that interfaces with RESTful endpoints on your server.
