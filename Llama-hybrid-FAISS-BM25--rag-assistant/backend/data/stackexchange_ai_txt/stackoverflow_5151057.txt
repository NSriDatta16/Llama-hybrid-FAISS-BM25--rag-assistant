problem with storage format of date in mongodb

I am using mongodb's date type to store date.. I am getting following data from my server's nginx log [17/Feb/2011:00:07:03 +0000] it means date is 17/Feb/2011 and time is 00:07:03 and time zone is UTC/GMT. I am using perl's datetime module to format date and store it in mongodb..problem is in mongodb it is storing like this.. { "_id" : ObjectId("4d6c8b2ff991e70412000000"), "date" : "Thu Feb 17 2011 05:37:03 GMT+0530 (IST)" } why it is storing it in IST ..i want the date to be stored as UTC/GMT my perl code is this use DateTime; use MongoDB; use MongoDB::OID; my $conn = MongoDB::Connection->new(host => 'localhost', port => 27017); $dt = DateTime->new( year => 2011, month => 2, day => 17, hour => 00, minute => 07, second => 03, time_zone => 'UTC' ); $conn->testing->logs->insert({"date"=>$dt}); Please guide me
