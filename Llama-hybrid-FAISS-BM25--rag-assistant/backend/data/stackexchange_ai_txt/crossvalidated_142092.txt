Understanding Model Credibility with True/False Positive/Negative

I am currently going through a tutorial with regards to a evaluation for a Logistic Regression Model in regards to Bike Buyers (Microsoft Azure) For the scored Model the True/False Positive/Negative come out as follows. T/P = 3 F/P = 2 T/N =2716 F/N = 276. So from this I can take that 3 people that bought bikes were predicted correctly 2716 that didn't buy bikes were predicted correctly 2 people that didn't buy bikes but the model states did were predicted incorrectly 276 that did buy bikes but the model states didn't were predicted incorrectly. Overall the model predicted 2719 out of 3000 correctly. My question is although the model did a reasonable job at predicting the data, because the target of the model is to find those that did buy bikes, I can't help but think if this was presented to a business they would focus on the 276 that were bike buyers that the model didn't predict correctly. How would you go about explaining the model to the business?
