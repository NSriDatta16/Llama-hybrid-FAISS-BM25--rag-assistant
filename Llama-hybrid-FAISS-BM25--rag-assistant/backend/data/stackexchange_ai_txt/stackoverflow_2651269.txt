I have just tried this using some tables I have linked to an SQL server and it work just fine (sorry I donâ€™t have an oracle DB to test against) however I have a few things for you to try. Firstly on your DIM line you are not specifying a type for cnn and rs. This is generally bad practice so change it to something like this Dim cnn as ADODB.Connection Dim rs as ADODB.Recordset Secondly do you need to close the connection in between statements? It is best to keep it open and just reuse it. Also as a force of habbit I also tend to close any object I open and also set them to nothing i.e. Set cnn=nothing If you must close it and reopen it try setting it to nothing see if that helps
