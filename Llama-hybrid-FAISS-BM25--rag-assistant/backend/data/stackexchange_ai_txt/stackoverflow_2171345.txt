http://www.example.com/question-10/what-is-this#a_20/?page=2 Answer There is no mechanism of path parts ( / ) or query strings ( ? ) in a fragment identifier. Is the pagination parameter supposed to be sent to the server-side? If so, that's an easy fix: http://www.example.com/question-10/what-is-this?page=2#a_20 If not; if you're doing client-side pagination, which is why the query was appended as part of the fragment identifier, then you've got trouble. You can't link to part of a document and include extra parameters for client-side-scripted pagination: you can have a fragment identifier that points to a real identified element on the page, or a fragment identifier being used as a hack to pass parameters to script, but you can't have both at once. The fragment you have specified is a single long string, and can only be matched by: foo (I used the old-fashioned name attribute here instead of the usually-preferred id attribute because this: foo is invalid. id attributes cannot include arbitrary punctuation characters; they are NAME tokens which may only be alphanumerics, _ , . , - and : (though the latter is inadvisable). If you wanted to specify other types of character they would have to be encoded in some application-specific way.)
