Can I use std deviation on a time series?

From what I remember, std deviation is a measure of how spread apart data is from a mean. What Im trying to do is determine whether time series data is tight enough that I can use it for proper forecasting. Im using Linear Trend Forecasting with seasonality index to forecast my sales data and Id like to know if the data im using is "good enough"?
