Logistic regression to a decision tree

Having a regression model, how can I convert it into a decision tree? I am curious about a formal/systematic way rather than a sampling-fitting approach that can work for arbitrary conversion of two black-box models. A reasonable simplification is to consider a "crisp" activation, that is 0 and 1 only. We may know the distribution of the input space and all inputs may be binary (either 0 and 1 coded or -1 and 1).
