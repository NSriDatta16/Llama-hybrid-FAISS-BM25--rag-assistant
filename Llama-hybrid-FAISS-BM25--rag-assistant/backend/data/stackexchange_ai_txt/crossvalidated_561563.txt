When can I say there is no clusters?

I am trying to do cluster analysis for a very small data set ( I tried to use PCA, but I can come up with examples where the 2D embedding has clusters but not the original feature space, and vice versa. My question is: When can I safely conclude that there is no clusters in my data? Update In this notebook , I try to generate examples where PCA is misleading.
