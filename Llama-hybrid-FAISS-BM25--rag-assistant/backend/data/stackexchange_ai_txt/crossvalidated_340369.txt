IRT can be used in many ways and there are many different models. First, many tests that use IRT are also computerized adaptive tests. In these, you don't have a choice of which questions to answer. You answer each question in turn and you will get different subsequent questions depending on whether you get it right or wrong. This is a good thing because it means you spend more time answering questions that are approximately the right level of difficulty for you. Second, whether you should guess depends on how the test works. Most IRT tests will use a method that penalizes you for wrong guesses but rewards you for right guesses in such a way that if you are making pure guesses, you won't gain or lose on average. However, if you can eliminate some answer choices as being incorrect, then guessing will help. Third, if the test is not a CAT and you have a choice of which questions to answer and you don't have time to answer them all, then getting harder questions right will help you more than getting easier questions right. However, usually, answering easier questions is much quicker than answering hard ones. If you have the ability to do really well on the test (which is implied if you can answer the harder questions right) then you will probably have time to answer all the questions. Any gain from skipping around and answering only some questions is probably offset by the additional time it takes to do this and the increased chance of filling in the wrong bubble.
