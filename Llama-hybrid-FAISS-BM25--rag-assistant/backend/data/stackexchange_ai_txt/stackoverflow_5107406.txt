How can I launch an invisible browser window from an android application

I am trying to do cookie tracking for android installs. So, when someone clicks on my link I set a cookie, than when they first open my application I load an image tag or an iframe in the phone's safari browser to pass the cookie information back to my server. I would like it to be an invisible process, is there a way to launch an instance of the browser behind the scenes and close it? or a way to access the cookies from the android browser? Or is there any reliable way to pass information from before the get to the android store, into the application? Thanks! My solution my tracking solution takes the useragent and IP and creates a hash of it, than I load an invisible webview in my first activity that loads an IMG pixel, this sends back the IP and useragent which I can match up. It's not perfect because phone carriers share quite a few IP's but it does the job.
