Refresh combo box in Windows Form

HI, This question has been asked a lot on the web but all of them seems to be confused with windows forms and asp.net forms so I had to finally come here for answer. I have a Main form (a window form) in VB.NET which has a Combo Box to display a list of countries. A sub form activated from a "Button" on the Main form allows users to add Countries to their list. But After Adding a new entry the Combo Box on the Main form does not show the update (while it is still open). I have to exit the main form and relaunch it to see the update. The populate function in shown below. I call this method after adding new countries but still; not good. I have used Invalidate function of combo box but of no use as well. Any Help is appreciated. Thanks Public Sub PopulateCountry() Dim rsLocal As New ADODB.Recordset Try Dim sSQLCommand As String Me.CountryList.Items.Clear() 'get the list of countries from the local database sSQLCommand = " SELECT * FROM CountryList order by CountryDesc" rsLocal.Open(sSQLCommand, cnn, ADODB.CursorTypeEnum.adOpenStatic, ADODB.LockTypeEnum.adLockOptimistic) 'Display All the countries While rsLocal.EOF = False Dim Country As New modGV.cbItem Country .ID = rsLocal.Fields("CountryID").Value Country.name = rsLocal.Fields("Country Desc").Value.ToString.Trim Me.CountryList.Items.Add(Country) rsLocal.MoveNext() End While rsLocal.Close() Catch ex As Exception Debug.WriteLine("PopulateCountry: exception occurred " & ex.Description) Finally If rsLocal.State = ConnectionState.Open Then rsLocal.Close() End If End Try End Sub
