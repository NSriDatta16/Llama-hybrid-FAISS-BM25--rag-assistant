When would one use Gibbs sampling instead of Metropolis-Hastings?

There are different kinds of MCMC algorithms: Metropolis-Hastings Gibbs Importance/rejection sampling (related). Why would one use Gibbs sampling instead of Metropolis-Hastings? I suspect there are cases when inference is more tractable with Gibbs sampling than with Metropolis-Hastings, but I am not clear on the specifics.
