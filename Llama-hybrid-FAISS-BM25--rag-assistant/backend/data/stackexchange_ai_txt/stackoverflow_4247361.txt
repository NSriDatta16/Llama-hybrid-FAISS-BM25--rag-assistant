Display PDF as HTML Form

I want display a PDF as an html page - where the user will be allowed to enter the fillable data. My problem is not how to import/fill data (I was able to do it using FDF/XML and ITextSharp). My only concern is how to show it to the user so that he/she can see the form, fill/edit data, and should be done with it. I tried saving the PDF as an image file, and showing it as an background-image - but it was very crude! - Iam hoping that there should be some elegant solution. Thanks for you help!
