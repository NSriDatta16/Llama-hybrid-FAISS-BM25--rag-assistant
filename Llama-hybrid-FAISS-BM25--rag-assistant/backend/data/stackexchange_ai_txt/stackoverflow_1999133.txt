Rhinomocks, how to verify that a stub/mock was never called at all?

Using Rhinomocks, how can I verify that a Mock/stub was never called at all? Meaning no methods was called on the mock/stub? I am aware of the AssertWasNotCalled method, but this method requires that I mention a method name. (Perhaps I have a class with 10 different methods that could be called). Log.AssertWasNotCalled(x => x.LogAndReportException(null, null), x => x.IgnoreArguments());
