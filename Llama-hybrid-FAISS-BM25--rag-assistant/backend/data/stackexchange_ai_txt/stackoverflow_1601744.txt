Strange behaviour with a pl/sql query and .net

I run this query to read the count of the Records with an output parameter using OracleCommand: var query = "declare MyCount number; begin SELECT COUNT(*) INTO :MyCount FROM T_ISSUE; end;"; this one works fine. But if I split the query into two lines like this: var query = @"declare MyCount number; begin SELECT COUNT(*) INTO :MyCount FROM T_ISSUE; end;"; I get the follwoing Exception: System.Data.OracleClient.OracleException: ORA-06550: line 1, column 25: PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol "" when expecting one of the following: begin function package pragma procedure subtype type use form current cursor The symbol "" was ignored. Anybody know why? Thanks for your help.
