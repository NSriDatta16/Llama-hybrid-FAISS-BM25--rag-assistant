Softmax and logistic multinomial regression are indeed the same. In your definition of the softmax link function, you can notice that the model is not well identified: if you add a constant vector to all the $\beta_i$ , the probabilities will stay the same. To solve this issue, you need to specify a condition, a common one is $\beta_K = 0$ (which gives back logistic link function). But you can of course specify something else, like the sum of $\beta_i$ to be $0$ for example. Then the parameters of the softmax regression will be different from the parameters of the logistic regression, but there will be a one to one transform to go from one to another. Meaning that making inference with one model is equivalent.
