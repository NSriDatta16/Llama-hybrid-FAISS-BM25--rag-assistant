how to get a action from one point to another point?

I have to find the set of action of my agent in wumpus. In this case my agent can turn left, turn right and go forward. Now I have one method that can find the adjustcent of my agent. I also have another method that can find the direction of my agent(North,East,West,South) Assuming agent stand at 2,2 position and the current direction is north and I want to go to 2,3 the step are turn right follow by forward. How can i generate this in JAVA. Another example is agent stand at 3,3 and current direction is south and I want to go to 2,3 the step are turn right or turn left 2 times follow by forward. Ps 1. The left up conner is 0,0 and the right down conner is 3,3
