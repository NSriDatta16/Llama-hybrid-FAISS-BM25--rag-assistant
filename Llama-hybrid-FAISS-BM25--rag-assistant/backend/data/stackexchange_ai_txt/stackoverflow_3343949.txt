ImageIO causes more memory to be allocated than the size of the images

I have 5 UIimageViews which display .png files, each max 200kb, but ImageIO allocates around and average of 1.3 mb for each. totaling 7.3 mb for the view when loaded. What is causing this to happen? I have another class with same amount of images and that allocates only 2 mb max.
