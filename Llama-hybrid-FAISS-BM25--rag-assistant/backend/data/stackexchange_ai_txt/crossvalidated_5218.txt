In logistic regression, highly skewed distributions of outcome variables (where there are far more non-events to events or vis versa), the cut point or probability trigger does need to be adjusted, but it will not have much of an effect on overall classification efficieny. This will always remain roughly the same, but you are currently under-classifying events since the "chance" probability in such a data set will always make you more likely to classify into non-events. This needs to be adjusted for. In fact, in such a situation it's not uncommon to see the overall efficiency of classification go down,since it was previously inflated by misscalculation due to chance. Think of it this way, if you have an event where 90% don't do it and 10% do it, then if you put everyone into the "don't do it" group, you automatically get 90% right, and that was without even trying, just pure chance, inflated by the skewness of it's distribution. The issue of interactions is unrelated to this skewing, and should be driven by theory. You will most likely always improve classification by adding additional terms, including simply adding interactions, but you do so by often overfitting the model. You then have to go back and be able to interpret this. Matt P Data Analyst, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign
