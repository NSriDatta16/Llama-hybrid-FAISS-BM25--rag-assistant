You are overthinking the problem a bit. Based on your description, you have two samples from populations $A$ and $B$ where you want to show $\mathbb{E}(A) . Assuming you drew enough samples and the populations do not follow distributions that are extremely skewed, you plan to use a $t$ -test which is practically applicable. A standard (read: conventional) way to do so is to specify $$ H_0: \mathbb{E}(A) = \mathbb{E}(B),\quad H_1: \mathbb{E}(A) and run on your Python: scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=False, alternative='less') (Note equal_var=False is copied directly from the question - you should consider whether this is actually the case, as it changes the result a bit). Why your proposals do not work $H_0: \mathbb{E}(A) = \mathbb{E}(B)$ . The p-value returned by scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=False, alternative='two-sided') Here you are testing against a two-sided alternate hypothesis $H_a: \mathbb{E}(A) \neq \mathbb{E}(B)$ . Rejecting the null hypothesis in this case technically tells you nothing on which expectation is greater than which. Moreover, from a practical perspective the p-value you get from the same samples will be double than that you get if you use $H_1$ as your alternate hypothesis, as you are also required to consider the other extreme in this hypothesis. $H_0: \mathbb{E}(A) > \mathbb{E}(B)$ . The p-value returned by scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=False, alternative='greater') Firstly, the Python code you've suggested does not match the null hypothesis you have written, but the following $$H_0: \mathbb{E}(A) = \mathbb{E}(B),\quad H_b: \mathbb{E}(A) > \mathbb{E}(B)$$ This is confirmed on the documentation for scipy.stats.ttest_ind , "This is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values." there is no guarantee that the result (i.e. p-value) will extrapolate to the null of $\mathbb{E}(A) > \mathbb{E}(B)$ . Secondly, for such composite null hypothesis there is quite a lot of work involved to integrate the test statistic, p-value, etc. for every possible value in the set. As you can probably imagine, this gets pretty messy quick and I would not recommend doing so given the existence an easy alternative.
