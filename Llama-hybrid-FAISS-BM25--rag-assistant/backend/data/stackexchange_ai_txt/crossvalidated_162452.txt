It's definitely possible. Look into seasonality-adjusted time series models, such as Holt-Winters. These can deconstruct univariate time series into their base components: level, trend and seasonality. There is a two-year minimum for initialization period for HW so you may need to consider ARIMA models, which would require creating a host of dummy variables for the various date components such as day-of-week, month, and year. Good luck.
