What algorithm is behind STL's find?

I just created a custom finding function for strings in a map. I developed some kind of the linear search algorithm (which I found out later) and was not satisfied with the speed of the function. So I searched for a faster function and found map's own function: map::find . This was incredibly faster than the linear algorithm I was using. In another example STL's function find was also much faster than another linear function I am using. But how is this possible? If you use the binary search algorithm you need to sort the map first which would take (hypothetically) more time the bigger your map is. Also how to find out the algorithms behind those core functions? Is there a list or some kind of database to find this out? Thanks for all your answers! I upvoted the best answers and accepted Max Lybbert's answer because it was the most detailed one. Paul :)
