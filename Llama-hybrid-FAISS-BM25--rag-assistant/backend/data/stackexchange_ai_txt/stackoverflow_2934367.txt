Are you sure you're building the test correctly? Here are the steps you'll need to take: Create a file named Test.java, because it will contain the class named Test Paste the Java code from the Getting Started section into this file and save it Download the sqlitejdbc-v056.jar file and put it in the same directory as the Test.java file Use javac to compile Test.java into Test.class Run the command from the Getting Started section You should see: name = Gandhi job = politics name = Turing job = computers name = Wittgenstein job = smartypants as output.
