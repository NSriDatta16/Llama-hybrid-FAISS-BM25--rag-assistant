C# Link Analyzer getting Bad Request Errors?

I have a rather simple program which takes in a URL and spits out the first place it redirects to. Anyhow, I've been testing it on some links and noticed gets 400 errors on some urls. I tried testing such urls by pasting it into my browser and that worked fine. static string getLoc(string curLoc, out string StatusDescription, int timeoutmillseconds) { HttpWebRequest x = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(curLoc); x.UserAgent = "Opera/9.52 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en)"; x.Timeout = timeoutmillseconds; x.AllowAutoRedirect = false; HttpWebResponse y = null; try { y = (HttpWebResponse)x.GetResponse(); //At this point it throws a 400 bad request exception.
