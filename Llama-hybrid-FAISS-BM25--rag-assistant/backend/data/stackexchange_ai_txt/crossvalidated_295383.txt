Why is data augmentation classified as a type of regularization?

In deep learning papers, data augmentation is often presented as a type of regularization. For example, this is explored in Chiyan Zhang and coauthor's presentation at ICLR17, Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization . Why is this classification given? Intuitively, I see data augmentation as a way of expanding a dataset , but regularization as a means of modifying a training algorithm to (hopefully) improve the generalization error.
