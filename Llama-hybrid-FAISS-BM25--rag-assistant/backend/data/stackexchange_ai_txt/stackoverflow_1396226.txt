If you already have your design layed out and planned, then implementing it should be the easy part. With WinForms, it really is drag and drop (and setting some properties, such as for docking and anchoring). The trick I found that really helped getting through implementation is to completely and totally mock out the interface on paper. I mean EVERYTHING: every menu, button, label, grid, etc. should be sketched out. After that, it's just a matter of dragging the controls on to a form, renaming them to something sensible, and making sure that window sizing doesn't throw your controls out of place. If you don't have a fully realized design to work from when creating the GUI, you will have a very hard time since you will still be making design decision that will get in the way of the construction. EDIT: If you're willing to pay, http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/ has several videos on the topic of making simple GUIs for a basic application, usually oriented towards a particular control (DataGridView, ListView, etc.).
