All of Ada's language-defined attributes (the stuff introduced by the ' character, are documented in Annex K of the LRM . They are a full part of the language, so there's no package or library you have to manually import. I know for a beginner at first it always seems like a new language is oddly documented, because you are so much more used to how things are looked up for your old languages. However, as somebody who knows both Ada and C++ quite well, I can tell you that one thing Ada has all over C++ is how much better documented it is. You can't even get hold of a copy of the C++ LRM without paying money to ISO. Even if you pay them, what you get isn't nearly as readable by a layman as what I just linked you. For starters, I'd suggest you save those two links above I gave you, and read entirely through Annex K. There's loads of good stuff in there. You will also want to read through Annex L (language-defined pragmas) and skim through the stuff in Annex A (predefined language environment).
