I think that using code coverage as a blocker is not the way to go. The reason is that having a nice coverage is not the primary objective and that that it can turn into a goal itself. It is pretty easy to just "run stuff" to get the metric up instead of actually test it. So, in my experience, the most important thing is that you actually do something while running the code. In other words, the important thing is that your tests test and not just run code. But by any means, use code coverage as a metric and celebrate appropriately when it increases :-)
