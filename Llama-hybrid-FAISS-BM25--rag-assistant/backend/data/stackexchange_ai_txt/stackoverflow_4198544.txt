You need to open it in Excel and resave it before running the second bit. xlwt/xlrd don't actually work out the formula themselves, so you'd need Excel to do that. I've just tested with OpenOffice, and it works after resaving the file. Also, please tell me you are not using this method just to calculate an average? You can do that in Python very easily: average = float(sum(mynumbers))/len(mynumbers) (In Python 3, you can leave out the float())
