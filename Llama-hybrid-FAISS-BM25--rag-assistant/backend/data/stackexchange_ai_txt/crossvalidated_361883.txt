Constructing credible interval for store opening times

Overview : Suppose I have a log which records the time at which customers visit a store. For the sake of this example, say I have 10 stores in the dataset. Example data for Store 1: Customer 828: 9:34 am Customer 383: 10:34 am Customer 154: 4:45 pm etc.. I'd like to construct a, say, 95% credible interval for the opening time. Ideas : In vague terms, I have though that it should be possible to formulate this in Bayesian terms. Namely, I could start with some prior that the start time is 540 minutes from 12am (i.e., 9am) and update that belief based on the data [EDIT: see comment below]. The problem is that I am unsure how to formulate this technically. It would be trivial if I were trying to estimate the true mean visit time. Here however, I am using data that is inherently one-sided (in reality, a person cannot visit a store before it opens) and trying to construct a (two-sided) credible interval about the point. EDIT: it occurs to me that this problem could be thought of in terms of quantiles. That is, one where the goal is to estimate, say, the 1st and 99th percentile of a population from a sample. Ex: estimating the shortest person (opening time) and tallest person (closing time) in a population from a sample.
