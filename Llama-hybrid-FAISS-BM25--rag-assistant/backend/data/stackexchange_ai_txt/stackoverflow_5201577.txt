WinPcap - LibPcap - packet_handler notification

I am using libpcap (Windows Packet Capturing Library) in C. I was wondering if i could be notified before the packet_handler function is called. Right now packet_handler is called everytime you receive a packet. Any suggestions how i can monitor when packets stopped incoming with a 10 second break. I just need to know 'hey we started sending packets again - reset your settings or whatever'
