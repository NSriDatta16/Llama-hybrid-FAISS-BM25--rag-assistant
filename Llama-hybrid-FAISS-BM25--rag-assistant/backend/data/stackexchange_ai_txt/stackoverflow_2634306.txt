You're using waaaaay too much "reactor calls" (for example, there's a good chance that agent.request calls into the reactor) from the main thread. I'm not sure if that's your problem, but it's still not supported -- the only reactor calls to make from the non-reactor thread is reactor.callFromThread. Also, the whole architecture seems strange. Why are you not running the reactor on the main thread? Reading a whole file with 10,000 requests, and splitting them, should not be a problem to do from the reactor, even if you do it all at once. You can probably hit a pure-Twisted solution not using any threads.
