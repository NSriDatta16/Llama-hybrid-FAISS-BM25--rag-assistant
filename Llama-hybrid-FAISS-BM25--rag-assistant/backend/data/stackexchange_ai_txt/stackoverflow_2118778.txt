Provided that you use a good padding scheme, then there is no known reason why e=3 should have worse security than any other public exponent. Using a short exponent has issues if you also do not use a good padding scheme, but the problem more lies in the padding scheme than in the exponent. The "gut feeling" of many researcher is that e=3 is not better than any other public exponent, and e=3 might turn out to be slightly weaker at some unspecified future date, although nothing points at such a weakness right now. Key length has a much higher practical impact on security. A 768-bit RSA key has been cracked recently (this was not easy ! Four years of work with big computers and bigger brains). A 1024-bit key is deemed adequate for the short term, but long-term uses (e.g. the encrypted data has high value and must still be confidential in year 2030) would mandate something bigger, e.g. 2048 bits. See this site for much information on how cryptographic strength can be estimated and has been estimated by various researchers and organizations. If you are after very fast asymmetric encryption, you may want to investigate the Rabin-Williams encryption scheme which is faster than RSA, while providing at least the same level of security for the same output length (but there is no easy-to-use detailed standard for that scheme, contrary to RSA with PKCS#1, so you are a bit on your own here).
