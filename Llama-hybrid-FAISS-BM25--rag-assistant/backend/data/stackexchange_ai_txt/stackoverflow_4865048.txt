AS3 Drag and drop items on webcam

I'm making a little thing in AS3, a "wanted" poster generator. I load the webcam inside my poster ("container") and put an attributesContainer next to it. There I have a hat, a mustache, ... people can drag and drop on the webcam instance. No problem here, but now I want to send it to Facebook. I know how that works, but I'm having some difficulties with keeping the position of the hat/mustache/... where the user wanted it. For example: I drag the hat onto my head (middle of the poster), I hit the "take picture" button to draw Bitmapdata, and my hat is at coordinates 0,0 again. I believe I have to work with a Matrix, but I tried everything now and it just doesn't show up or stays at 0,0. Any help? Here's some of my code. private function sendHandler(e:MouseEvent):void { var bmd:BitmapData; var bmp:Bitmap; // "container" contains poster+webcam img bmd = new BitmapData(container.width, container.height, true); bmd.draw(container); //var hatMatrix:Matrix = new Matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, hat.x, hat.y); bmd.draw(hat); bmp = new Bitmap(bmd, "auto", true); sendToFacebook(); }
