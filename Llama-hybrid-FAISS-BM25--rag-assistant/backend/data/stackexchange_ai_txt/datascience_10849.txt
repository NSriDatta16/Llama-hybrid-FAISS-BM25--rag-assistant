What are the relationships/differences between Bias, Variance and Residuals?

I've been trying to find an answer to this question for a long time. What are the relationships/differences between Bias, Variance and Residuals? I think I do understand Bias, Variance and Residuals as separate concepts. Correct me if I'm wrong - Bias is the difference between the average expected results from different runs of the model and the true values from data. Variance is the variability in the expected results (predictions) of a given data point between different runs of the model. Residual is the difference between the expected results from a model and the true values from data. y - y^ Residual seems somewhat similar to Bias. But is that my misunderstanding? Please explain to me in plain words and also simple equations the relationships or differences between these three.
