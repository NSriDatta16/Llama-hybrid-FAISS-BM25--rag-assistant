Remember checkbox value

Hi I would be so grateful if anyone could shed some light on this, Basically I have a iphone app built using jqtouch and phonegap which has a list of standard checkboxes and when they are selected a strikethrough effect will be applied, easy enough (kind of like a simple checklist) this is all dealt with on the client side and nothing will be getting sent anywhere. However, when the user closes the app the checkboxes revert to their original sate i.e all unchecked and i would like them remain as the user left them. I guess local storage would be the way to do this, however, i have gave it a go and i am getting a bit confused. Any help would be great, and thank you in advance. kyle
