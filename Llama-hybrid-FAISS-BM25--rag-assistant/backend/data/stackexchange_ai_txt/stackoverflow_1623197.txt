Receiving data in TCP

If i send 1000 bytes in TCP, does it guarantee that the receiver will get the entire 1000 bytes "togther"? or perhaps he will first only get 500 bytes, and later he'll receive the other bytes? EDIT : the question comes from the application's point of view. If the 1000 bytes are reassembles into a single buffer before they reach the application .. then i don't care if it was fragmented in the way..
