Your code reads past the end of the array. The maximum value of outer is 10, and the maximum value of inner is 9, so a[inner+1] will read a[10] . This will give you undefined behavior , which explains why different compilers give different results. As for the variable name making a difference: It probably doesn't. It's possible that if you run the same code twice (using the same variable name), you will get different results. Basically, when invoking undefined behavior, you can't be sure of anything that your program will do, so it's best not to try and find meaning in things like variable names. There's also a chance that the variable name does make a difference. That depends on the implementation of the compiler: For example, using a different variable name might make the compiler organize memory differently somehow, which could cause the program to bahave differently. I think most compilers would output the same code if you change variable names though, so it was probably just a matter of luck.
