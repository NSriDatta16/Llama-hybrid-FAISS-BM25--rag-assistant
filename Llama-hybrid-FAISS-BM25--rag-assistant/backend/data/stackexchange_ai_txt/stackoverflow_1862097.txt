Storing Images in DB - Networked Desktop Applications

Related: Storing Images in DB - Yea or Nay? After reading the above question, it seems the preferred method for image storage with databases is to store only the filepath within the database. However, most of these answers seem to focus on web servers. In my case, I'm developing a desktop application that will be used across multiple computers within an intranet. A dedicated server will host the database, containing information related to performing tests on various equipment. Images need to be stored on the server in some way. Would storing the images in the database be the correct approach in this case, or even the only approach? Pros: Backup is limited to only the database. No need to open up the server's file system to the network. Single protocol for server information access. Protected file access. (User can't go in and delete all the images) Cons Performance issues in future if there's too many images. Edit: As stated in the tags, the application is being written in C#/.NET. If writing the images to the file system is an option in this case, I could use some help understanding how this is done. Edit 2: As elaborated some in the comments below, for now I'm assuming a MySQL database, although the FileStream capabilities of SQL Server 2008 could potentially change that. Also in my case, images will be added often, and can be considered read-only after this point since they should never be changed, and will just be read out when needed. Images will likely be small (~70k each), and I'm also considering some other binary format storage on the server, files which are ~20k each which I can likely apply the same approach for storing and retrieving.
