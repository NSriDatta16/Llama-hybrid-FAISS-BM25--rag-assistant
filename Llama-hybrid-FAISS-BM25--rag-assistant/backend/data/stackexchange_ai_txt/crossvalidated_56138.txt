I think your DV is "correct identification". When you have a dependent variable, regression is often a good method. Here, since your DV is a dichotomy (correct, incorrect) you should look into logistic regression. You would have several IVs: Line-up method, target status and line up variation. Each of these would be dummy-coded.
