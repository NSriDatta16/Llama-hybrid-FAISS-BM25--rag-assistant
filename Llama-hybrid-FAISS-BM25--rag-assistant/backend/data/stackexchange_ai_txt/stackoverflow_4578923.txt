Animation Library

I'm new to programming games, so I'll make it short and sweet: Is there any standard practice for Flash/AS3 for organizing sets of game Sprites, especially related to movement. For Example, if I am moving left, and then down, there should be a fill in animation...if we want that fill-in animation, do we need to create an animation for every permutation of all 8 directions our character can move? Also, if we want to have dynamic shadows for our 2d sprites, do we have to draw a light source for every one of those 8 directions for all 8 directions?
