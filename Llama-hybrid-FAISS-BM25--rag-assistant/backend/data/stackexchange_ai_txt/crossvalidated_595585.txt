Preselect explanatory variables with PCA for a further multivariate analysis

I have dataset composed of samples (here corresponding to sites), species, environmental variables linked to the species (e.g.: species biomass, abundance and size) and explanatory variables (Temperature, oxygen,â€¦). The number of explanatory variables is quite consequent. So I wanted to do a PCA on the explanatory variables of the different sites to do a data reduction of explanatory variables. And after include the selected variables on an MDS or a dbRDA with the sites, species and the environmental variables. Does it make sense? In my reasoning, if the explanatory variables are not considered as important in contributing to the selected components of the PCA (and then does not influence the dissimilarity among sites). By extension, they will not contribute to influence environmental variables.
