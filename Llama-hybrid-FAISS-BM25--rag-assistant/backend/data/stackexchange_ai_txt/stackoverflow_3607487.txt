A compiler is a program which translates one language into another. Compiler construction is the process of creating a compiler. The tag compiler-construction should be applied to questions concerning the programming of compilers or for questions about the detailed inner workings of compilers. One language to another? I thought they made executables! Few compilers do exactly that: They mostly translate a human readable computer programming language (like Fortran, Cobol, Algol, PL/1, Pascal, C, C++, C#, etc.) into an object-code file which has to be subsequently linked. Many real world compilers translate a high level language into assembly code which is subsequently assembled by a separate program and then linked. The standard Java compiler translate Java code into JVM bytecode, which must be run by a dedicated program (the JVM) which may include a Just In Time (JIT) or HotSpot compiler that translates the bytecode into native machine instructions on the fly. Early versions of Unix came with a Fortran-to-C compiler. The earliest versions of the language that became C++ were compiled into C by a program called cfront . Many other examples of source-to-source compilers exist. Some languages such as JavaScript and many other 'scripting' languages don't have compilers at all, but are executed directly from source code.
