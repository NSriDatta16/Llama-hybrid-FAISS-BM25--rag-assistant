Open Automator.app and create a new service. Select "Utilities" from the left-hand actions list, then drag the "Run Shell Script" action into the workflow. Choose /usr/bin/python as your shell. Type some python. For example: : import sys for f in sys.stdin: print "Hello World: " + f, Save the service as, say, "Test" Try it out in TextEdit.app. Type some text, select the text, then choose TextEdit -> Services -> Test from the menu. It should prepend "Hello World: " to each line of the text (as per the python code for f in sys.stdin ) The above example works with text. Presumably, it could be modified to work with other data types provided through the OS X Services system.
