What is the distinction between paired and unpaired time series?

I am a little bit confused by the distinction. What are the formal definition of paired and unpaired? More specifically, if I have 2 time series measuring the same quantity (e.g. vacancy rate) with slightly different underlying data, are the data paired or unpaired?
