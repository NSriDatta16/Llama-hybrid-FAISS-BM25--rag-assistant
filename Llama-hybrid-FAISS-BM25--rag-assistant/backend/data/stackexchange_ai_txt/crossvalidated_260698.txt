It's hard to say in general whether overfitting or underfitting is less desireable â€” this probably depends on your application. In practice though, it's probably better to start with a model that has enough capacity to overfit your training data since there are lots of techniques for dealing with overfitting (e.g., regularization, dropout, dimensionality reduction, etc.)
