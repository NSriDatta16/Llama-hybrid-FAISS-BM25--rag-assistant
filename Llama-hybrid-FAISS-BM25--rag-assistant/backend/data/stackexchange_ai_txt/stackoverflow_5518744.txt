The short answer is that yes, you will need a Facebook app . See caveats towards the end of this answer. All external interactions with Facebook happens via the user of an access token , as you have found. To get an access token for a user, an application must forward the user to a special URL based on your applications App ID and App Secret , which is where they would be presented with the permissions dialog: Facebook Connect http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/mockupstogo/AIcVc2qmfB9qDwOBuQp4vdylKkM2wZiWhjQezBjTO1L0qym0agkSWQFNNobe/Facebook_Connect.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJFZAE65UYRT34AOQ&Expires=1301690929&Signature=cwibcaeH6GGbVA3gC2AAyvcEco0%3D Once the user approves the application, Facebook sends them back to a callback URL with a special code attached. This code can be used to get an access token for the user, which can then perform actions on Facebook as that user (based on the permissions your Facbook application requested). Since you only want your own account/app to be able to post to the wall, one good idea would be to get a permanent access token and store that token in your app somewhere. While OAuth 2 does support a "user-agent flow" for non-web-applications, Facebook does not support it directly. See the "Desktop Apps" section of https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ for more.
