Error diffusion along a Hilbert curve. It's a simple idea - suppose that you convert an image to a 0-1 black & white bitmap. Converting a 55% brightness pixel to white yields a +45% error. Instead of just forgetting it, you keep the 45% to take into account when processing the next pixel. Suppose its value is 80%. Normally it would be converted to white, but a neighboring pixel is too bright, so taking the +45% error into account, you convert it to black (80%-45%=35%), keeping a -35% error to be spread into next pixels. This way a 75% gray area will have white/black pixel ratio close to 75/25, which is good. But if you process the pixels left-to-right, the error only spreads in one direction, which yields worse looking images. Enter space-filling curves. Processing the pixels along a Hilbert curve gets good locality of the error spread. More here , with pictures.
