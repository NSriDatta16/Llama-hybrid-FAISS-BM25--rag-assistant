Topics to learn in Neural Network

I have recently started learning Deep Neural Networks and was going through the tutorials online. Everywhere I saw that the topics post Image classification using CNN is a little hazy. No one seems to follow a guide as to what topics should one learn after learning image classification. I would really appreciate if someone could guide me so as to learn advanced topics and become good to get started with research in this field. The topics i have covered so far are: Basic Machine Learning Linear Regression Logistic Regression SVM Decision Trees Optimization Algorithms Regularization Methods Different Loss Functions Different Metrics during Training Feature Extraction HyperParameter Tuning Basic Neural Network ANN CNN Image Classification Image Augmentation before training Visualizing Filters I have started learning Object detection using CNN but I have this feeling that I am missing some topics which can strengthen my foundation. Thanks in advance. Any guidance is appreciated.
