The final layer can be seen as a generalized linear model (such a a logistic regression) on extracted features. Consider a basic network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Draw it out and then cover up the input layer. Now it looks like a linear or generalized linear model (such as logistic regression) on some features. That’s what’s happening and what the author means: the network uses early layers to figure out the features. Then the network regresses on those features.
