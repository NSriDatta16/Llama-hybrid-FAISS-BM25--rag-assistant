Finding N-Most Similar Organizations to a Given Organization

I am looking to provide a model with one data point and have it return the observations most similar to that given data point. I am in the process of developing peer groups from a dataset of 240 nonprofit organizations and I have performed several types of cluster analysis on the data, including hierarchical and k-means, but I am not too happy with the results so far. However, I do have in mind a few organizations that I feel would be a perfect fit to build a peer group around. My question: what technique would I use to find the n-most similar organizations to a given, single organization? I am not concerned with cluster size. I am looking to provide the model with one data point and have it return the observations most similar to that given data point. Is this something as simple as k-nearest neighbor, and the training set consists of the one organization that I want to use to identify similar organizations? In other words, can I specify the cluster center as one organization? I use R for my analysis.
