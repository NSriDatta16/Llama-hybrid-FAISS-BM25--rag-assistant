Hummm this could be solved if there were a method in the delegate that tells you when a component is gonna be scrolled right? So when your left (Years) component is gonna be scrolled the right (names) component stops. A crazy approach that might work is to implement â€“ touchesBegan:withEvent: and check if the touch position is inside the left component. if yes then stop the right component using [picker selectRow:aRow inComponent:1 animated:NO]; if no then it means the touch is somewhere else like the right component or surroundings.
