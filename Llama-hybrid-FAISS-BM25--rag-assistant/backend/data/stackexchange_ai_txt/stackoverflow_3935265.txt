I know revision sets is all the rage these days ( hg log -r "::." ), but the little-known --follow flag lets you do what you want using any version of Mercurial. The hg log help says (my emphasis in bold): [...] Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow history across renames and copies. --follow without a filename will only show ancestors or descendants of the starting revision. [...] If no revision range is specified, the default is tip:0 unless --follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is used as the starting revision. [...] So, in other words, adding -f will do the trick for you. You can add -f to your defaults: [defaults] log = -f or better yet, you can create an alias for this: [alias] logf = log -f That avoids changing a core command like hg log , which will probably confuse you or your colleagues sooner or later.
