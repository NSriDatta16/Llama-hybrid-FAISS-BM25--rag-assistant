While I agree that it's not a good idea to install an IDE on a CI or build server, unfortunately you are correct. To install Mobile SDK 5 you need to install Visual Studio (2005 or 2008). You will also need to install Mobile Device Center / ActiveSync depending on your build machine OS. If you are running a server OS for your build machines (such as Windows Server 2008) you will have to enable "Desktop Experience" and/or install windows media player to install the SDK (yeah that's an odd one) which is required to install Mobile Device Center / ActiveSync. We currently have Windows Server 2008 build machines building and testing our product which includes a significant Windows Mobile / .NET CF codebase. Our build even creates mobile CAB installs, so yes it is possible . We are currently using TeamCity for CI, which is an excellent product and I'd highly recommend. Using TeamCity allows the build agents to be on separate machines.
