Say I have textboxes, dropdownlists and submit buttons. They are all inline-elements. Which means that "officially" margin, padding, width and height properties should be ignored (in practice not really). If I were to go the right way to set the height to a button I would write something like display:block and then define the height. But there are considerations that a block level element would expand itself unexpectedly so I'd better set its width to some fixed value. The problem is that I don't know its width since it can be dynamically defined upon the text of the button. Unless you're referring to Internet Explorer's box model quirks , you shouldn't be worried about anything expanding or contracting unexpectedly. As long as you take care of normalizing for browser variation , you will be fine. If you have an unexpected and unwanted side-effect along the way to design glory, you debug it, as that is programmer error you contend with. CSS can be quirky, but that is not an appropriate excuse 95% of the time for most major browsers. The other 5% we don't talk about. This is how I understand your problem: You want a menu of floated so that you have a horizontal menu that spans the width of the viewport (what your user sees 'in the browser window') to be consistently the full width of the viewport. It sounds like you are thinking in terms of a fixed width design, when really what sounds like it would suit your purposes is a fluid-width design. This means you create a design that is 'elastic' and expands and contracts relative to the size of the user's browser window. If you created your design anticipating pixel widths being set on each element, you can probably find an elegant way to maintain a fluid-width header and navigation, but have a fixed-width main content area. You can find a happy medium without a full redesign. This walkthrough will likely be what you're looking for. A good explanation of the terms fixed-width and fluid-width can be found here if you're unfamiliar with the jargon and want a closer look at these ideas. One more for the road: Setting a width on all floated elements is not only recommended, but is a part of the CSS2 standard as per W3C. Angelina
