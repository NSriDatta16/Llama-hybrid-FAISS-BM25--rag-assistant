LABjs conditionally loading scripts

I would like to start incorporating LABjs into my project but I want to know if there is anyway to conditionally load scripts. For example, something like: $LAB .script('framework.js').wait() .script(function(){ if(es){ return 'es.js'; }else{ return ''; } }) I have not tried this but am sure it will not work. Is there a more elegant way of doing this? Thanks
