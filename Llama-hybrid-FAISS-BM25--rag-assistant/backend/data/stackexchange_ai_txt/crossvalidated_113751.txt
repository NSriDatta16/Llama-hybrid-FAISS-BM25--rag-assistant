you should consider a matrix of samples $X\in \mathbb R^{n\times p}$ where each column is a different variable and each rows is a different samples that is a discrete representation of your time series. After that you can train a neural network with input $X$ and output $y$ as if it is a simple polynomial interpolation. The problem is actually more complex but this could probably be a starting point
