Probably none of them is "correct", because of your data. there is no elbow , this is pretty much the expected behavior on random data. all Silhouette scores for k>2 are very low, so none of these results is good C-H seems to max out at 6, why do you choose 4? In particular when the methods disagree and do not give clear indications, this usually means that simply none of the results is good! See my preprint: Schubert, Erich. " Stop using the elbow criterion for k-means and how to choose the number of clusters instead. " arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.12189 (2022). https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12189 and pay attention in particular on the section titled "The true challenges of k-means" and Figure 4 (because the earlier results are on easy data sets). You do not need to choose k if k-means cannot solve your problem - have you considered that your data does not contain k-means type of clusters? Be open to the answer being " k-means cannot cluster this data set well ". As you are using PCA, beware that PCA may even destroy some signal. Plot the data. If you cannot identify clusters in your plot, k-means probably cannot, either.
