Android read text raw resource file

I have a text file added as a raw resource. The text file contains text like: b) IF APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY. (c) NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY VIRTUAL ORIENTEERING, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR EMPLOYEES SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY PROVIDED HEREIN. (d) (USA only) SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. On my screen I have a layout like this: The code to read the raw resource is: TextView txtRawResource= (TextView)findViewById(R.id.txtRawResource); txtDisclaimer.setText(Utils.readRawTextFile(ctx, R.raw.rawtextsample); public static String readRawTextFile(Context ctx, int resId) { InputStream inputStream = ctx.getResources().openRawResource(resId); ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); int i; try { i = inputStream.read(); while (i != -1) { byteArrayOutputStream.write(i); i = inputStream.read(); } inputStream.close(); } catch (IOException e) { return null; } return byteArrayOutputStream.toString(); } The text is shown but after each line I get the strange characters [] . How can I remove the characters? I think it's a newline.
