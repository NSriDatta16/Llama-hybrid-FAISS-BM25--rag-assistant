Calibration for random forests

I want to evaluate the calibration of the random forest using val.prob (rms package, R). I have no problems using it and getting an output, but I feel the results may not be accurate because I don't believe that the class membership probabilities outputted by the random forest (predict.randomForest, also in R) are proper predicted probabilities for use in calibration. I don't believe it is a true probability for calibration in the following sense: I think a random forest score is NOT equivalent that event taking place (i.e. score of 30% doesn't mean you have 30% chance of having a disease). My main question is : what is the appropriate way to use class membership probabilities when trying to assess model calibration? If it is possible to use the class membership probabilities, what methods allow one to improve the calibration?
