Should I be using a random slope? and are my random effects right?

I am unsure of the random structure in my mixed-effects design, and a bit confused on whether is a cross design or a nested one. My experimental design is between 2 groups ( AgeGroup , n=30), all tested in 3 experimental conditions ( SocialCondition : N, Com, Coop) and in each of these the three tasks were applied ( TestCondition : Con, Inh, Swt). 60 children were tested overall. Reaction time and Accuracy was averaged between trials for each task. My final model looks something like this: Model Should I have added more of the fixed effects predictors to the random slope? What happens if a model with random slope has a worst fit than a model with just the intercept? I have been reading about it and the random structure mentioned is (1|Subject)+(1|SocialCondition) but I am not sure if that is completely right.
