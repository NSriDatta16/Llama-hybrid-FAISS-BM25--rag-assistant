A custom module is probably overkill for this. Module means a very specific thing in Magento. It's a mechanism for inserting custom code into Magento's standard operations. All you want to do is add a button to the cart page. Editing the file at ./base/default/template/checkout/cart.phtml (substitute your theme/site name if not using base or default) is the place you'll want to start looking. Just find the phtml file that corresponds to the place you want to insert your custom HTML and have at it.
