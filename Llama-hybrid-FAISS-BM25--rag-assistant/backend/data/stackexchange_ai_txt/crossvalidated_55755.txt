The standard approach for such a meta-analysis is to compute an "effect size" for each study that reflects the size (and the direction) of the group difference. If the same continuous variable was measured in each study, then you can stick with raw units and just compute the mean difference for each study. In addition, we need to compute (estimate) the corresponding sampling variance of each mean difference. For the example data you provided, you can easily do this with R and the metafor package: library(metafor) dat which yields: study n1i m1i sd1i n2i m2i sd2i yi vi 1 A 30 15.5 3.2 31 17.9 3.0 -2.4 0.63165591 2 B 60 17.3 1.1 60 18.2 0.9 -0.9 0.03366667 3 C 40 15.1 3.5 44 18.0 2.8 -2.9 0.48443182 Variable yi provides the mean differences and vi the corresponding sampling variances. A basic meta-analysis of these data can then be carried out with: rma(yi, vi, data=dat) which yields: Random-Effects Model (k = 3; tau^2 estimator: REML) tau^2 (estimate of total amount of heterogeneity): 1.0121 (SE = 1.3609) tau (sqrt of the estimate of total heterogeneity): 1.0061 I^2 (% of total variability due to heterogeneity): 77.21% H^2 (total variability / sampling variability): 4.39 Test for Heterogeneity: Q(df = 2) = 10.5510, p-val = 0.0051 Model Results: estimate se zval pval ci.lb ci.ub -1.9072 0.6692 -2.8499 0.0044 -3.2189 -0.5956 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 The value under estimate is the estimated average mean difference. Next to it, you get the standard error, the test statistic for the test whether the average mean difference is zero, the corresponding p-value, and the 95% confidence interval bounds. Above, you also get information about the "heterogeneity" in the effect sizes, that is, variability in the observed effects that is not accounted for by sampling variability alone.
