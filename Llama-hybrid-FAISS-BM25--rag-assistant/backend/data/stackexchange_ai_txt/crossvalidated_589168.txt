Definition of directional variance

We are currently adding some basic functionality for directional statistics to SciPy. Directional statistics refer to data whose magnitude does not matter such as unit vectors. While implementing the directional variance, we noticed that there are competing definitions in literature. We would like some more opinions about this to see what the most useful functionality for SciPy users would be. Directional variance is always related to the mean resultant length $R$ : for circular data, elegantly illustrated here . For circular data, the canonical definition of variance is then $1-R$ . For general directional data though, some sources define it as $1-R$ $2(1-R)$ The question is now if SciPy should directly implement one of those or just expose the mean resultant length. Choices are: scipy.stats.directional_variance : $1-R$ scipy.stats.directional_variance : $2(1-R)$ scipy.stats.mean_resultant_length scipy.stats.directional_mean should return both directional mean and mean resultant length We would appreciate some thoughts of the statistics community. Thanks in advance!
