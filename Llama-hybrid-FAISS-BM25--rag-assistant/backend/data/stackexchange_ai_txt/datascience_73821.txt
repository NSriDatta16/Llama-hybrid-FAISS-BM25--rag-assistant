Your MFCCs are a time-series, 2d representation. scikit-learn transformers like StandardScaler only works with 1d data (plus one dimension for the individual samples). So you need to implement the standardization yourself. And then convert the data to 1d. Or summarize the entire MFCC time series into a single vector. For example using mean/std.
