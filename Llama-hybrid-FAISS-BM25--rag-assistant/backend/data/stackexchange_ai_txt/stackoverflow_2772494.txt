"remote file operation failed" on Hudson

I am running a Windows slave for Husdon 1.337 (Linux master). When running a project on the Windows node, it fails with the following message: Building remotely on winTestSlave Checking out a fresh workspace because there's no workspace at C:\hudson\***\ejb remote file operation failed It did work yesterday and I have not upgraded Hudson or changed its configurations (or the slave's configurations) in any way. I establish the connection between the slave and the master by running the following command on a cygwim prompt on the slave: java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://myserver/computer/winTestSlave/slave-agent.jnlp I saw the issue http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5374 and did as instructed in the work-around but that did not work. I also tried with a newer version of slave.jar (version 1.356) but that did not work either. The user connecting to the master is the same user who owns the concerned files/catalogs and has full access rights to them. Does anyone please have any idea of how to fix this? I really cannot find more information anywhere else!
