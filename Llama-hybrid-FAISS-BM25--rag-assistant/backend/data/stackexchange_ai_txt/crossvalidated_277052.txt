Master List of ML algorithms by type

I was asked today if there was a master list of machine learning algorithms broken down by type. I searched for one, but didn't find a good list. I was going to write one for my friend, but decided I would ask here first if someone has a good reference for a list like this. I didn't just want to direct him to Andrew Ng's videos.
