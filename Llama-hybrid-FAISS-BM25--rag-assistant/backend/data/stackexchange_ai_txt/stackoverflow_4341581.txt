Autoconf: Check if a program in an unsupported language compiles

To conditionally enable a part of an autotooled project, I need to check whether a short program stub in a language not supported by autotools out of the box compiles or not. I need something like AC_TRY_COMPILE with an arbitrary compiler executable â€“ create a temporary file, write a piece of code to it, and try if invoking the compiler (found via AC_CHECK_PROGS before) returns an exit code equal to zero or not. What is the most elegant/common way to do this?
