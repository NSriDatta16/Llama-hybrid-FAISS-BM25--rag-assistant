Yes, assuming you have met your causal identification assumptions for the ATE, an ML model where you predicted the outcome for each individual under different values of treatment status and then average it would give you back your ATE. Once the causal identification assumptions are met the problem of counterfactual estimation simply becomes an imputation problem (Xu 2017). The cited paper is an example of where the language of imputation is used to discuss counterfactual estimation. Xu, Y. (2017). Generalized synthetic control method: Causal inference with interactive fixed effects models. Political Analysis, 25(1), 57-76.
