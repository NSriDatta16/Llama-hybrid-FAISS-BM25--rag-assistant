Code coverage is a useful metric but should be used carefully. Some people take code coverage, specially the percentage covered, a bit too seriously and see it as THE metric for good unit testing. My experience tells me that more important than trying to get 100% coverage, which is not that easy, people should focus on checking the critical sections are covered. But even then you may get false positives.
