Magento - where's the php file subscribe.phtml calls once the form is submitted

When you submit the newsletter subscription form (subscribe.phtml), the form actions aclls a php file. Does anyone know where it is located? EDIT: And how can I send the form action to a custom php which does the mail sending bit? for example, I want the form handling to be done by a file called sendmail.php i'm trying to have something like this - instead if the default action getUrl('newsletter/subscriber/new') ?>"> thanks
