I didn't realize until Mike Daniels pointed it out that your issue is with visited links, not normally-colored links. Visited links have traditionally blended in more, it's not really a new concept. I think the theory is if you've already visited the link you must know it's there, so there's no reason to draw your attention to it anymore; there are other links you haven't visited yet that you're likely more interested in
