Robots.txt not working

I have used robots.txt to restrict one of the folders in my site. The folder consists of the sites in under construction. Google has indexed all those sites which are in testing phase. So I used robots.txt. I first submitted the site and robots.txt is enabled. Now the status is success for the www.mysite.com/robots.txt. But the google is still listing those test links. Here is the code i have written for robots.txt... User-agent: * Disallow: /foldername/ Can anyone suggest me what the problem may be? Thanks in advance
