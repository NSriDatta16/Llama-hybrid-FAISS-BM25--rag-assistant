From my experience and from this article it appears that SimpleRNN simply uses the hidden state as output. It does not compute any separate output. This is not stated explicitly in the official documentation. Using the code below you can see it for yourself that the state and output are always the same. inputs = np.random.random([2, 3, 1]).astype(np.float32) simple_rnn = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(4, return_state=True) output, state = simple_rnn(inputs) print(output) print("====") print(state)
