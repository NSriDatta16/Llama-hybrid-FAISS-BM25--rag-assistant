accessing a subarray in vb.net (or the equivalent)

I read a an array of bytes from a file I pass this to a class that then assigns various bytes from that array to various members of varying sizes. Ideally i would like to do something like this memberThatIsAUShort = bitconverter.ToUShort(tempArray.subArray(3,5)) memberThatIsAShort = bitconverter.ToShort(tempArray.subArray(6,8)) Instead of looping through the array, copying the bytes to new shorter array and passing them in.
