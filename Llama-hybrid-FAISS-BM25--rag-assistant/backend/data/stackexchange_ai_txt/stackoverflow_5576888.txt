URL rewriting for mobile devices

I know that this question has a been asked many times, but I still can't figure out what's going wrong in my code. I have a stylesheet link on my HTML And I want to redirect to another file if the user is on a mobile device. I did it this way: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/style.css$ RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} "android|blackberry|ipad|iphone|ipod|iemobile|webos|googlebot-mobile" [NC] RewriteRule (.*) /mobile.css [L,R=302] My files are all in the root of a subdomain, so I guess that the rule !^/style.css$ should be correct. When I try to reach /style.css , I don't have a redirection, but when a try to reach / , Firefox tells me there is a redirection loop. Do I miss something? Thanks
