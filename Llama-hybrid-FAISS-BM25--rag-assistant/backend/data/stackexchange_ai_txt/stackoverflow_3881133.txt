Drupal Views and Content Taxonomy

I have been searching all morning and have yet to come across the solution for my problem.. problem is: I have successfully created a CCK content type using the content taxonomy module (which allows me to use a vocabulary as the content). the user is asked to select his/her preferred cultures. so in simple terms form holding a series of checkboxes which the user merely selects their preferred cultures. problem comes when I wish to display the selected cultures by that user for them to then sort into their top 5 cultures. the sorting bit I can do using draggable views. however actually displaying the users selected cultures is something im finding difficult. sorry for my novice of a question.. but its been one of those days.
