You want dissimilarities as percentages but do not specify of what. The seqdist function has a norm argument for specifying one of several normalization options. If your are interested in dissimilarities as percentage of the maximum possible dissimilarity given the alphabet and the sequence lengths, you just pass the argument norm="maxdist" to the function. twitter.om Be aware that with this normalization you may lose the triangle inequality in some circumstances. See seqdist help page (by typing ?seqdist ) for other possible normalizations. Gilbert
