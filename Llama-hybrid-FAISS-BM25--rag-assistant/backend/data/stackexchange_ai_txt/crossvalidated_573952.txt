Multinomial logistic regression would be for predicting something like the animal in a photograph: dog, cat, horse, or alligator. A multivariate logistic regression would be to predict if the photograph contains a dog or a cat AND if the photo is in the daytime or at night. Notice that that there are two distinct variables to predict: the animal and the time of day. (Time of day could be argued not to be binary, but letâ€™s say it is.) It sounds like you are in a situation like the latter.
