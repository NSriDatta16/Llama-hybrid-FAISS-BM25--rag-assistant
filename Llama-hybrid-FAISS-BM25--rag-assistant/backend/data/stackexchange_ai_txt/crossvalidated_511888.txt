A forest consists of a large number of trees. A random forests consists of a large number of decision or regression trees. Each of these trees will be grown with a different random set of the data. Thus with a sufficiently large number of trees all the data will be accounted for in the construction of the forest but not in the construction of each tree. Obviously there is a chance of a single datapoint not being represented in any of the trees, but every tree will on average contain about two thirds of all the data (cd https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/88994/117812 ) and the preset for ntree in the randomforest package in the randomForest R package is 500.
