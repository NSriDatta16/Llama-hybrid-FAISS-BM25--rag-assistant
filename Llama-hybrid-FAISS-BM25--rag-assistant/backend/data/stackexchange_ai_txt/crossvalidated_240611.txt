(I assume the models with fewer features are nested in the models with more features, otherwise these sorts of hypothesis tests won't work) Classification accuracy is a kind of count proportion. You would not normally use ANOVA on count proportions. Logistic regression is one common choice for comparison binomial proportions. If the classification accuracy differs by category within the larger model (but were constant within it), then the overall success counts would be a sum of binomials, one for each category (but they could be separately modelled if the data were available that way). (Alternatively, quasi-binomial models may suffice to capture the variance) Another possibility would be to use Welch-Satterthwaite style adjustment to degrees of freedom to deal with the heteroskedasticity.
