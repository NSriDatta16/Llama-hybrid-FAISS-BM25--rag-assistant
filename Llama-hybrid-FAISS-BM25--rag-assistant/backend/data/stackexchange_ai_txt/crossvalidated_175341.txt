Learn how to arrange subsets

I have the following problem and I'm looking for a way to solve it with an machine learning algorithm or something like that. I got a huge dataset and the data looks like that: Row 1 = {{0},{4,4,4,4,4}} Row 2 = {{1}, {0,4,5}, {5,5}} Each set has the same number of values, but they can be "bundled" differently. With that I mean that the subset can be structured differently like in the example above. I can move the subsets inside the set but can not move single values inside a subset. For example: I can move the second subset from the row 1 set like that "{{4,4,4,4,4}, {0}}". Thats all I can do. After that I have to build a summation through the columns (vertically summation). I displayed that in the table below. $$ \begin{array}{c|lcr} & \text{} & \text{} & \text{} & \text{} & \text{} & \text{}\\ R1 & 0 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 \\ R2 & 1 & 0 & 4 & 5 & 5 & 5 \\ \hline SUM & 1 & 4 & 8 & 9 & 9 & 9 \\ \end{array} $$ The standard deviation of the summation values should be as low as possible. I don't want to have outliers. I solved that problem using an evolutionary algorithm. But the problem is that the algorithm needs several hours and I have to do it every day. And because I have to do it every day I got a lot of training data. And now I'm looking for an machine learning algorithm which can maybe detect a structure and give me the result faster. The result would be the arrangement of the subsets. The result does not have to be perfect.It should be good and fast.
