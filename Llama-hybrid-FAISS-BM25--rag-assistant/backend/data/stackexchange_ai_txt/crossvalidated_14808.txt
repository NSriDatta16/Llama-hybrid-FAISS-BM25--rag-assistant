Just about any form of imputation is going to require extra assumptions (because you will always need conditional models that you wouldn't need without the missing data). The stronger the assumptions you are willing to tolerate, the less impact the chosen imputation will generally have on the confidence of your final results. Thus, if you have some reason to believe in a model linking your missing data to regressors that are indeed present: do go ahead, just mention it when you publish and if possible: check what happens if you change your assumptions somewhat (not always easy): this can give you an idea for how dependent the result is on your assumptions. Finally, and more importantly: never use single imputation: whatever assumptions and models you use, impute a lot of times (since this typically happens in a random fashion, this will result in several similar but not identical datasets), run your analysis on all of the imputed datasets, and look what happens to your result (typically, average the results). This is called multiple imputation. There are also proper ways of accounting for the added uncertainty due to multiple imputation. BTW: some of all this also depends on whether you data (missing and/or present) is categorical or continuous, or (worst case scenario): both. All of the above can be found in the book "Statistical Analysis with Missing Data" by Little and Rubin. I suggest you read it. As an extra incentive: something in the back of my mind is screaming: I seem to recall reading about a situation very similar to yours in that book. Good luck!
