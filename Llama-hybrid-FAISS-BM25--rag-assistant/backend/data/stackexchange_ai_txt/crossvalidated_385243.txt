Group events based on start time and duration

I have a data that look like: +-------+------------+----------+ | Event | Start time | Duration | +-------+------------+----------+ | A | 0 | 2.5 | | B | 0.5 | 2.6 | | C | 1.7 | 2 | | D | 3 | 1.6 | | A | 3.2 | 2.2 | +-------+------------+----------+ I need to group these events based on Start time and duration. I have seen time series clustering problems that consider the start time only. How do I do this one? Edit: It is expected that the events that start and end together is supposed to be in one group. That is if 'A' start at time=0.0 and 'B' at time=0.5. Both have a similar duration also. If this pattern happens every time, we can say that 'A' and 'B' falls into a group. I do not want any prediction. I just need to group these events.
