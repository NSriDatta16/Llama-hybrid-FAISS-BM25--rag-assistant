Plot of errors from a Logistic regression

I have fitted a logistic regression on my data, for which I have below example, library(dplyr) data(mtcars) Model = glm(vs ~ wt + disp, data = mtcars, family = "binomial") Pred = predict(Model) Pred_Prob = exp(Pred) / (1+exp(Pred)) Error = (mtcars[, 'vs'] - Pred_Prob) / sqrt(Pred_Prob * (1 - Pred_Prob)) plot(Pred_Prob, Error) This gives below plot I wonder if this is a natural plot expected from fitting a logistic regression ? Why am I seeing 2 converging lines? If not, what else can be done to improve the model fitting for above dataset?
