How to set the Android Live Wallpaper icon (aka "thumbnail")

I built my first Android app. It is a Live Wallpaper designed for 2.2. When I press and hold the screen, select Wallpapers and then select Live Wallpapers , my live wallpaper has what looks like a default icon with the name of my live wallpaper overlaid. How do I set this icon? My manifest file has an application icon specified as @drawable/icon Update I think I need to add some info to this question as it poorly describes my problem (sorry). I have all the res/drawable-[hml]dpi/ icons. I named them all icon.png . My manifest file contains I have also tried creating a 48x48 icon in res/drawable/ called icon.png . I have also tried explicitly adding icons in other manifest tags if they are allowed. eg. service, activity, intent-filter (It should be obvious that I don't know how this manifest file really works, so I was trying anything) In Manage Applications , the icon is displayed correctly . When selecting the Live Wallpaper, the icon is not displayed correctly . mdpi icon is 48x48, ldpi icon is 36x36 and hdpi icon is 72x72
