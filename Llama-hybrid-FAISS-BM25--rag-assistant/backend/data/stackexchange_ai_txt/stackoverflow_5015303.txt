Have a look at DocumentFragment (the blog post is written by Resig himself, so the template API mentioned will most likely use DocumentFragment). It is the best way to append DOM Elements without using innerHTML. Although innerHTML will almost always be the fastest method. If $ul is an already existing Element in the DOM Tree, you might speed things up by removing it from the tree, adding LI elements to it, and re-append it. This will however not guarantee better performance: using a profiling tool is the only way to measure the impact.
