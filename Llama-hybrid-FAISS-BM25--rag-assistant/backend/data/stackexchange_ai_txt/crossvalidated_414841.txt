How to deal with binary predictors in a logistic regression model?

I'm building a logistic regression model in R using glm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4, data = train.set, family = binomial(link = 'logit')) . Among 4 predictors x1, x2, x3, x4 , they all are categorical. However x1, x2, x3 are on a scale of 0 to 10, and x4 is binary (0 or 1). My question is how should i properly pre-process x4 ? I'm asking because I know it is a really important variables in terms of prediction, but it's showing a pretty low importance in the summary() due to the fact that it's on a different scale as the rest of predictors. Could someone who has experienced similar situation share your approach? Thanks a lot! edit: all predictors x1, x2, x3, x4 are factors. I do understand that as long as they are all factors, it shouldn't matter what values each predictors they have. but we expect x4 to be a more important predictors, but varImp shows the opposite.
