Shared Preferences uses IO - as it just an xml file in data folder of your application. Choose the one which simplier for you to implement. I would use Shared Preferences. As for "home for data" - it is ok. The storage possibilities are already well-designed for you, so you shouldn't be worry about it. Just use the one which fits your purposes the best.
