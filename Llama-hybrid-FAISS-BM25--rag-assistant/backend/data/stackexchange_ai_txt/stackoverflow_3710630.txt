If you were following an MVVM pattern then I would have said as a property of the Customer model, with an instance of the customer model being accessed via the ViewModel. Even if you aren't I would say within the application code and use binding where its needed in the UI. Otherwise you run the risk of changes to your UI causing the loss of customer ID storage at somepoint in the future. If needed in more than one place then just create a repository that stores all of your data and have that accessed as needed (this way you can decouple your UIs from each other even if they use the same data source.
