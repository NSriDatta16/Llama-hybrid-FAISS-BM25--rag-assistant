Outliers can affect your decision about whether the feature is irrelevant, so you have to remove them first. More importantly, even if outliers are not a problem, you are going to overfit your model by pre-selecting the relevant features. What you can do is to reduce the dimensionality of feature space by using a method that does not need the response, eg, PCA.
