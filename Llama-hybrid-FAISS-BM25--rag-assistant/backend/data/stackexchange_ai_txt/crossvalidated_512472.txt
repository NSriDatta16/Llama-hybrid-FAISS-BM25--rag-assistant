Estimating risk ratio instead of odds ratio in mixed effect logistic regression in `R`

glmer is used to estimate effects on the logit scale of y when the data are clustered. In the following model fit1 = glmer(y ~ treat + x + ( 1 | cluster), family = binomial(link = "logit")) the exp of the coefficient of treat is the odds ratio of a binary 0-1 treatment variable, x is a covariate, and cluster is a clustering indicator across which we model a random effect (intercept). A standard approach in glm 's to estimate risk ratios is to use a log link instead, i.e. family=binomial(link = "log") . However using this in glmer I get error Error in (function (fr, X, reTrms, family, nAGQ = 1L, verbose = 0L, maxit = 100L, : (maxstephalfit) PIRLS step-halvings failed to reduce deviance in pwrssUpdate after calling fit1 = glmer(y ~ treat + x + ( 1 | cluster), family = binomial(link = "log")) A web search revealed other people had similar issues with the Gamma family. I am not sure if this is due to my data or a general problem. My question thus is: how can I estimate risk ratios using a mixed effect model like glmer , preferably in R ? I saw that stata has a function meglm which seems to allow this link and family. Not sure if this works there.
