In the project folder, there should be a file under the .settings folder named org.eclipse.wst.common.component that contains an XML fragment like this: You should be able to change the source-path under wb-resource to your share folder. I'd make these changes with the Eclipse project closed to be safe. This is a setting that you pick when you first create the Dynamic Web Project in Eclipse - I can't find how to change the value in an existing project thru Eclipse itself. If you want the share folder to be mapped to a different path when deployed, such as /share/ in your webapp, you can probably just add another wb-resource element.
