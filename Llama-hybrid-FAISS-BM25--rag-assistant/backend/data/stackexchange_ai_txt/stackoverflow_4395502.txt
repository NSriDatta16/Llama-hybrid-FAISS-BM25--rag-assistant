I will suggest you use something NIST approved, like Rijndael or AesManaged encryption in conjunction with a password-based key derivation encryption method (PBKDF2). Also make sure you use cyphers of at least 256-bit keys (NIST approved for storage and transmission of top secret information). You may also want took into tokenization of your sensitive content with truly random tokens (never cryptographically based tokens). The implementation of AES is an industry standard and you can find many implementations for each of your client platforms online. The important aspect is for your server to be able to decrypt the encrypted information sent by the clients. Since you are using .NET web services, you can explore the System.Security.Cryptography namespace and in particular the AesManaged class and the RinjndaelManaged algorithms. Here are some implementations on different languages: AES for Java and C# AES for Objective-C and PHP
