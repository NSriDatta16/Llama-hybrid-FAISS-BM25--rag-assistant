Critical appraisal of survival paper

I must make a critical appraisal of a cancer survival paper. I hope someone here can give some hints. The paper investigates person-level markers of socio-economic status as exposure and looks for association of these with survival and also comorbidities, disease/prognostic factors and treatment using Cox proportional hazards for survival and logistic regression for mortality. I think the paper is a good one and I can't find the criticisms. I am not sure if Cox proportional hazards is the best model for use; maybe a full paramteric model of relative survival is better, but I don't known. Thank you for a hint if you can. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315055
