Basically you check the User Agent String see http://www.hand-interactive.com/resources/detect-mobile-javascript.htm Detect iPhone: navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().search("iphone") > -1 In general feature detection is better than browser detection it is better to know what the user's browser can do than what he's using. Modernizer is a good tool for that.
