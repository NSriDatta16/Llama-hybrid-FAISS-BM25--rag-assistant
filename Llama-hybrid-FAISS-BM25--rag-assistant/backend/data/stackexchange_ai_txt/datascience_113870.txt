combine xgb feature importance

Is it possible to combine the results from the xgb.boost importance function. For example, due to one hot encoding, I have a feature age=35 and another age=60. Is there a way that I can add these to get an overall importance of age, and not just age at every value? In case it matters the model is a binary:logistic one. library(xgboost) imp_matrix= xgb.importance(features,model=mod)
