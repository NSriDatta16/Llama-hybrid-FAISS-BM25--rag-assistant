960 grid, img problem

recently downloaded the 960 grid system to play around with. Now the problem im having is that the image is not coming across to the left after the singer songwriter tag is closed off. Both columns before the image add up to 12 exactly The following code should display a logo image up top, singer songwriter description to the right of it. Then on a new line i should see image placeholder in gray and a paragraph of text to the write of that. However it is currently mixed up Can anybody advise me if i need to change anything to accommodate images heres a link to the page http://digitalgenesis.com.au/sites/alice and heres a link to how i basically want it to flow http://digitalgenesis.com.au/sites/alice/img/960img.gif Page code Singer/Songwriter Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
