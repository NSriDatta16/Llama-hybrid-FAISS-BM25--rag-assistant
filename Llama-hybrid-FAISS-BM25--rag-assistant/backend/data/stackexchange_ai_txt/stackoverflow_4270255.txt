You could do it through Java Image API but I discourage this because it's not so powerful neither so cool to use. A better solution would be to interface to ImageMagick through JMagick . It will be somewhat more complex to get into but you will have a fully fledged flexible engine to work with images (under many formats).. If you want to keep it the old way then start from the Oracle tutorial here
