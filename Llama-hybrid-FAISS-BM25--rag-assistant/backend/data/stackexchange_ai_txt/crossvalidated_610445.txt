Attempt #2, with a different focus as I suspect this is more a machine learning context rather than a healthcare context. I'm still going to reinterpret your question as "why might we prefer an arithmetic mean over a harmonic mean for sensitivity and specificity?" because it's far easier to suggest why X is a thing rather than why X is not a thing, since I have to consider one case with the former and nigh infinite cases with the latter. Suppose I'm deciding whether 1000 people have cancer, but I win $1 for each correct guess and I want to maximise money. Unlike positive predictive value, sensitivity and specificity and purely measures of how good the *test* is and are independent of the *data.* Suppose I want a test that will be good regardless of the data because I have no idea whether 90% or 10% of the 1000 have cancer. If I use a test with 80% sensitivity and 30% specificity (higher arithmetic mean), I win either $ 350 or $750, average $ 550. If I use a test with 50% sensitivity and 50% specificity (higher harmonic mean), I win $500.
