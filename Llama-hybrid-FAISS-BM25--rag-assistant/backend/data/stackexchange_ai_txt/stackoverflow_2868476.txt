Applescript, basic help please! (Trying to control Elgato EyeTV)

I am very new to applescript and am working based off of a script I received from someone else, but I am having issues changing the channel with an application I created using Interface Builder from XCode for the application EyeTV by Elgato. I keep getting an error saying "command /usr/bin/osacompile failed with exit code 1". I included the code below global theChannel global theApp global theMachine property theMachine : "10.0.2.2" on change_channel(channel_number) set theChannel channel_number as integer tell application "EyeTV" of machine theMachine «event EyTVChch» given «class Chnm»: theChannel end tell end change_channel on clicked theObject set theApp to application "EyeTV" of machine theMachine if name of theObject is "fox" then change_channel(2) else if name of theObject is "cbs" then change_channel(3) else if name of theObject is "nbc" then change_channel(4) else if name of theObject is "pbs" then change_channel(5) else if name of theObject is "cw" then change_channel(6) else if name of theObject is "abc" then change_channel(7) else if name of theObject is "twc" then change_channel(9) else if name of theObject is "bt" then change_channel(10) else if name of theObject is "fs" then change_channel(11) else if name of theObject is "cs" then change_channel(12) else if name of theObject is "espn" then change_channel(13) else if name of theObject is "espn2" then change_channel(14) else if name of theObject is "espnu" then change_channel(15) else if name of theObject is "dh" then change_channel(20) else if name of theObject is "dc" then change_channel(29) else if name of theObject is "tlc" then change_channel(30) else if name of theObject is "sc" then change_channel(31) else if name of theObject is "ng" then change_channel(32) else if name of theObject is "hc" then change_channel(33) else if name of theObject is "fn" then change_channel(34) else if name of theObject is "msnbc" then change_channel(35) else if name of theObject is "cnbc" then change_channel(36) else if name of theObject is "hn" then change_channel(37) else if name of theObject is "cnn" then change_channel(39) else if name of theObject is "cspan2" then change_channel(41) else if name of theObject is "cspan" then change_channel(42) else if name of theObject is "rc" then change_channel(53) else if name of theObject is "wolv" then change_channel(55) else if name of theObject is "rham" then change_channel(56) else if name of theObject is "rctv" then change_channel(57) else if name of theObject is "rlc" then change_channel(58) end if end clicked on will finish launching theObject tell window "Main" set theAddress to text returned of (display dialog "Enter the IP of the remote computer:" default answer "10.0.2.2" default button 2) set theMachine to "eppc://" & theAddress end tell set theApp to application "EyeTV" of machine theMachine using terms from application "Script Editor" tell theApp activate if «class Fuls» is true then set title_fullscreen to "Exit Full Screen" else if «class Fuls» is false then set title_fullscreen to "Enter Full Screen" end if set theChannel to «class Crch» end tell end using terms from tell window "Main" set title of button "fullscreen" to title_fullscreen set the contents of text field "channel_number" to theChannel set title of button "eyetv_quit" to "Quit EyeTV" set isOpen to 1 as integer end tell end will finish launching on will close theObject quit end will close
