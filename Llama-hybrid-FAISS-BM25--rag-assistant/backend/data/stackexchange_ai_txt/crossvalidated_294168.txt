Normalized data on a rolling window

I have a whole set of data on [0,T] with an observation variable y(t) , and a feature x(t) , the two being univariates with no missing data. For a given period [t, t+h] , I am applying a dynamic linear regression: y(t) = a(t) + b(t) * x(t) + w(t) a(t) = a(t-1) + w_a(t) b(t) = b(t-1) + w_b(t) Where w, w_a, w_b are the variance of the last term on these 3 lines (following a centered normal distribution). What matters is that for window [0, h] , I normalize my data (x, y) - aka zero mean and 1 std - and then will have a series of estimated parameters a and b after maximum likehood estimation: time a b 0 0 0 1 0.41 0.72 ... h-1 0.432 0.55 h 0.435 0.567 I am interested in the last couple a(h), b(h) giving the intercept and the slope. Then I take as training set x(1), x(2) ... x(h+1) and y(1), y(2), .., y(h+1) , normalize thse two series, and have as well some best estimations for the parameters a and b . I take parameters a(h+1) and b(h+1) . And so on. By rolling the window, I thus have a set of slopes b(h), b(h+1), ..., b(T) and intercept a(h), a(h+1), ..., a(T) However the normalization differs between each rolling windows. So that I am not sure at all it is a good way to deduce some behaviour about the time series a and b of the "last estimation". What would be the best method: still perform some analysis on a and b timeseries despite (x,y) normalisation is different on each window? apply the above by normalizing the data on each window [t, t+h] with the means/std of y and x on [0, T] ? applying the above without normalizing the data?
