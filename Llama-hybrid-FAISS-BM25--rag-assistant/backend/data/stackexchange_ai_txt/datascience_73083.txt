Speech imitation with different language?

I want to train a neural network in Python which should be able to imitate the voice of a given person. I found this Project on Github which seems quite good for my case. The only problem is that the person I want to imitate the voice of is speaking Japanese. I was wondering if it's possible to train a model on Japanese voice data and get it to speak English in some way. If it's pronouncing some words the false way it shouldn't be a problem for me to be honest. P.S. In case you're wondering which voice should be cloned. I want to clone the voice of Shiina Mashiro from the Anime "Sakurasou no pet na kanojo".
