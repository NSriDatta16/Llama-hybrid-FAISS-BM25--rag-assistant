There are various strategies to achieving the desired goal. I will not revisit those already mentioned, but instead outline several more. 1) Information can be placed in the manifest of an archive. It can be retrieved using methods of the java.lang.Package class. String title = pckg.getImplementationTitle(); String vendor = pckg.getImplementationVendor(); String version = pckg.getImplementationVersion(); The Package class also has the ability to identify all loaded packages. Package[] package = Package.getPackages(); Iterate that looking for your packages and you can gain a list of all the packages currently loaded. The best way to put the information into the manifests is using Ant or some similar build tool. That way the version can be set to the date - easy done. 2) Add a property to the resources section of the JNLP. .. .. BTW - that use of ${href} is intended to mean the exact same string used as the JNLP href attribute. Use the BasicService.getCodeBase() method to obtain the codebase. Form an URL to the JNLP file using .. URL urlToJnlp = new URL( basicService.getCodeBase(), System.getProperty("jnlp.href") ); Load the JNLP file and parse it using one of the plethora of XML APIs of the J2SE. (And if it does not load in the XML APIs of the J2SE, it strongly indicates it is invalid or malformed - and should be checked using a tool such as JaNeLA .) Once it is loaded and parsed, the basic information can be obtained & presented.
