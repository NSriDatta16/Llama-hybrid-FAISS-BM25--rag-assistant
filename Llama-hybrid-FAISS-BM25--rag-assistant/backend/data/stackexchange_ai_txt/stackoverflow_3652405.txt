Capture devices - Mono c#

I'm looking for a way to list all capture devices (audio and video) with Mono under Linux: microphones, webcam, etc... but I couldn't find anything. Under windows, it's easy doing this with DirectShow, but couldn't find anything like this under Linux. Of course I could list those devices with a system command line, and parse the string, but before doing this I wanted confirmation that nothing like this exists for Mono. Thks for your attention.
