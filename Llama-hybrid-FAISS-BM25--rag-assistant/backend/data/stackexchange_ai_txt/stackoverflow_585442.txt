I've administered both Bamboo and Hudson, and I would recommend Hudson. They are both great, but Hudson has better report support, for instance publishing your coverage reports etc. is so much easier inside Hudson. This is likely to change in the near future, but despite Bamboo's integration w/ JIRA etc. and it's statistics, Hudson, for ease of use and third-party support, is better regardless of dollar amount (it is free, Bamboo is not).
