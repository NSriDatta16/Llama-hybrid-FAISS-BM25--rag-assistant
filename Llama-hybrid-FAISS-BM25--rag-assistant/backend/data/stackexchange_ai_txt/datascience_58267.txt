Each PCA component is a projection of your centered data onto a line. Centering puts your origin into the center of the multidimensional data. Then each component line direction is chosen so that the projection has the greatest variability. Successive component directions are orthogonal by construction. Generally, PCA is intended for continuous data (as opposed to categorical). It can also work with categorical data when there are many categories and the categories are ordered (i.e. approaching continuous data). What you are seeing is the categorical nature of your data. Your first component is the 12 months and your second component is the 7 days of the week. It appears that these two variables have the largest variance in your data. They are equally spaced because their numerical representation is equally spaced. Possibly the best book on PCA is http://cda.psych.uiuc.edu/statistical_learning_course/Jolliffe%20I.%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(2ed.,%20Springer,%202002)(518s) MVsa .pdf
