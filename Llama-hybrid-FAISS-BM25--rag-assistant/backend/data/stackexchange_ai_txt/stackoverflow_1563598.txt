Manage muliple windows forms in c# app

Any thoughts,recommendations, patterns on a good way to manage an app with multiple forms. First page is login, that loads a "main form", from there a user could launch a number of other "sub forms" (could grow over time). User should be able to cancel out of whole app at any point. I know the way I do it right now is not always elegant. Cody
