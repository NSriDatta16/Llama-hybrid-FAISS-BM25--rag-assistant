What is Data Encapsulation? Data Encapsulation is binding the data and the functions that operate on the data in a single unit. How do u implement Data Encapsulation? By creating a Type. ex: Class, Structure etc. What is Data Abstraction? Data Abstraction is hiding the complexities of your type from the external world. How do you implement Data Abstraction? By using Access Specifiers. Ex: Public, Private, Protected. Whom do the Access Specifiers hide data from? The Access specifiers hide the data(by not providing them direct access to the data) from the users of the objects of the class/structure. Consider your class in the Game as an separate unit, Which is used by the other functionality(source code) to perform some functionality. Usually, A class has a state and methods which perform operation on the state. The access specifiers hide members of the class from other source code (maybe classes or maybe structures). The other code can create objects of your class and can modify the state stores inside class data members through the public methods exposed by your class. Thus the Access specifiers provide a organised way of accessing class members.
