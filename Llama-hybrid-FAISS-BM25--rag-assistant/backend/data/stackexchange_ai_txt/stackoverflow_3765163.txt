I'll trot out the same advice I've used in the past when it comes to dealing with "corporate types" (as opposed to "technical types"), and that is: talk about risk. What risks come with IE6 that they can understand? Talk about age: IE6 was first released in August 2001. Microsoft's support of it will end in the near future ( if it hasn't already ). There have been two major revisions of IE released since then, and the IE9 beta was officially released last week. What risks do an old browser bring to the table? Two, as I see it: security holes and the difficulty in finding qualified developers to continue to maintain old IE6-dependent intranet apps. Talk about developing for yesterday's technology: IE6 doesn't support the range of features that other browsers such as Mozilla, Google Chrome and Safari do. Don't talk about CSS or HTML support (as this will likely make their eyes cross) but talk about what user-friendly eye candy and functionality these other browsers support that IE6 just can't , at least without moving heaven and earth. The risks here? The inability to deploy more advanced third-party intranet applications (if they no longer support IE6) or an additional cost to develop workarounds for functionality a more advanced browser might support (such as a SVG or Canvas-based Gantt chart application). Talk about standards, and the risk of vendor lock-in. Is your company really better off by going "all Microsoft", or is going with more modern, standards-compliant software from a more diverse set of sources a safer approach? Point to general Internet usage of IE6 versus other browsers, and talk about how most Internet savvy people already use a different browser, so "retraining" corporate staff isn't as great a problem as it may seem. I suspect that if your "corporate types" come to the table with an open mind, you'll be able to sell an upgrade to another browser, assuming there isn't an IE6-coupled intranet app holding everything up.
