Typically, before doing PCA, features are standardized so that they're at similar scales (actually same variance) because the first principal components will try to capture as much variance as possible and if some dimension has a large variance, the first PC will be dominated by it not because it explains the data very well but because the variance is abruptly high. So, having the same scales is not a problem at all. The utility of PCA is having other axes (PCs) that are linear combinations of your original features. This means you'll get two new axes in the form: pc1 = a * slvpen + b * slvunemp pc2 = c * slvpen + d * slvunemp pc1, (the first principal component), will exploit all the correlation between the original axes and show you a direction that the data varies a lot. Since the data is 2D, I strongly suggest you to plot your data and principal components to make the most sense out of it.
