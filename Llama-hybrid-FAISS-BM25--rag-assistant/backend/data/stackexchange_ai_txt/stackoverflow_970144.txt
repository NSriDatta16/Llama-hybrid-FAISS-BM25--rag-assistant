[window setContentView:customView] will also do the job. You also need to add IBOutlet variables for your window and custom view to the header file for your controller, and drag that onto the Interface Builder document window. Then control drag from the controller to the window and view, and select the variables. (and you need to change the controller to be an instance of your custom controller class, which you do by selecting it in Interface Builder and going to the Inspector)
