As long as your system is running inside your group and there are no plans to expand it (and plans do change, so keep that in mind), it is just fine to setup your own simple PKI infrastructure. If you do end up expanding beyond your organization, all you need to do is distribute your root certificate to the parties you will be communicating. This gives actually a fine grained control to your partners how much trust they want to put in you vs the public CA infrastructure.
