You want to estimate $\psi = \int_a^b h(x) \, dx$, using Monte Carlo integration. This means that samples $X_1, X_2, \dots X_n$ were obtained and an appropriate estimator $\hat{\psi}$ was constructed. The CLT then states that $$\sqrt{n}(\hat{\psi} - \psi) \overset{d}{\to}N(0, nVar(\hat{\psi})) $$ If you desire an accuracy of say $\delta$, that means that you want $\hat{\psi} - \psi confident is to made a confidence interval for $\psi$ around $\hat{\psi}$ that is of size $\delta$. For example a $95\%$ confidence interval for $\psi$ is $\left(\hat{\psi} - 2\sqrt{Var(\hat{\psi})}, \hat{\psi} + 2\sqrt{Var(\hat{\psi})} \right)$. This interval has half width $2\sqrt{Var(\hat{\psi})}$ and thus accuracy is established when $$2\sqrt{Var(\hat{\psi})} A way to interpret this confidence interval is that if you repeated this experiment many times, on an average 95% of the intervals will contain the true $\psi$. Thus if your $\delta$ is $10^{-4}$ and $\hat{\psi} = 0.149415$, then you are 95% confident that the true $\psi$ has the first four digits $.1494$. You being 95% confident means that if you repeated the Monte Carlo experiment many times, then 95% of them will have $\hat{\psi}$ of the form .1494.....
