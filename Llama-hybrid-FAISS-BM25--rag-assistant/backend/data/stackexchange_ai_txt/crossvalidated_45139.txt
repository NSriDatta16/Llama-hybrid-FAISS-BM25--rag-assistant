This might be the core of a recommendation engine...so: 1. please see Machine Learning book from Manning ( a quick and dirty recommendation engine done in Python ) ...this is a nice blue print and starting point ...there is no silver bullet for recommendation engines recipes ( see Netflix case) 2. to scale up you will need to work with matrix decomposition and other linear algebra / algorithms (e.g. SVD ) or/and to work with parallel programming ( on power machines CUDA/OpenCL or in cluster e.g Hadoop)
