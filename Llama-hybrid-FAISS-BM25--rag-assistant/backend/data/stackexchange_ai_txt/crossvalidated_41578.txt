What is a 'bagplot', or 'bivariate boxplot'?

I've found a paper which introduces the multidimensional (bivariate here) version of the boxplot - a bagplot. What is that bagplot exactly? I can see the series of nested polygons based on vertices, one of those polygons being declared as a bagplot. What is the idea of nested polygon building? Which of the polygons is the bagplot (central or holding the average number of points)? Do the edges of a bagplot possess some useful properties (like specifically dividing the point set)?
