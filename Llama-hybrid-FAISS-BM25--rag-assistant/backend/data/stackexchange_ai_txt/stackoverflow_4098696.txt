How do I store a parameter in Search so I can retrieve it when showing results? (Magento)

I need to search for some products' custom options (set in Manage Products|Edit Product|Custom Options), the only way I've found is manually filtering the results returned by Magento's search function. The question is: How do I store the info I need, so I can remove products not matching my criteria --once Magento returns its results? Thanks!
