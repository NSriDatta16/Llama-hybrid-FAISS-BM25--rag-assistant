That's the magic of data science. There is no way to know a priori! It is true that you cannot see everything in one simple visualization with more than 2 variables, but you can find some workaround. For example, represent each of the interest variables separately in different plots (or maybe, use color for some of them insted of position on an axis!!) If the data is still way too high-dimensional, split your data into training and testing sets, fit each model and look for significant differences in predictive performance for the test set.
