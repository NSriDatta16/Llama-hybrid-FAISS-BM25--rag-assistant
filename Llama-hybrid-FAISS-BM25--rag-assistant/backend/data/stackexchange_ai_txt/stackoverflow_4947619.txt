Enumeration in iphone is not working

i am developing an iphone application in which i have 3 classes => main class , abc class, pqr class. On main view , i have imageview on which i am displaying image. when user touch at the center of image on main view , new view will be pushed (depending on condition mentioned below) a) if user came from abc view then new view will not be pushed b) if user came from pqr view then i have to push new view . My problem is how can i detect from which view user came to main view. I create 1 class in which i have following code in .h file typedef enum { abcViewSelected, pqrViewSelected } SelectedViewType; @interface Enumeration : NSObject { SelectedViewType selectedViewType; } @property(nonatomic) SelectedViewType selectedViewType; In . m file i have @synthesize selectedViewType; When user select table cell from abcView & pqrView , i am pushing main view & setting view type in didSelectRowAtIndexPath as follows :- enumObj.selectedViewType = abcViewSelected; enumObj.selectedViewType = pqrViewSelected; In main view's touchBegan method i am compairing which view is selected by writing this if(enum.selectedViewType == pqrViewSelected) => push new view else do nothing. But this is not compairing & in none of case new view is pushed. I have imported all the required header files everywhere. Plz help me ....Thanks in advance.
