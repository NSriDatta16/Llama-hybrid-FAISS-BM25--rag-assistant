Oversampling in logistic regression

I was trying to find out whether an oversampling can really make a model better. On this blog page , it says that it can improve a decision tree, but it shouldn't improve a logistic regression. Quotation below: Standard statistical techniques are insensitive to the original density of the data. So, a logistic regression run on oversampled data should produce essentially the same model as on the original data. Question: Is it really true that using an oversampling in a logistic regression will not improve results?
