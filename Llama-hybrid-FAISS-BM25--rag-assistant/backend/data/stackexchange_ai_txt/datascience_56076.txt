It's impossible to change the number of channels. The weights of the model depend on the number of channels. Changing channels is changing weights. Changing weights is having a completely new model. You can only change the image size (in purely convolutional networks - without Flatten - the image size does not affect the number of weights). But: Frames are not channels. Take care with this. Frames are entire images, not channels of images. But it's impossible to help further without knowing the code of the original CNN. I don't know if the net is purely convolutional, if it uses the frames as samples, if it uses TimeDistributed frames, or if it uses recursive layers.
