Different unsupervised machine learning algorithms have different assumptions. K-means clustering requires computing euclidean distance thus all encodings have to be consistent with euclidean distance computation. Encoding categorical variables into a continuous embedding space (e.g., word2vec) would be consistent with euclidean distance computation. One hot encoding is not consistent with euclidean distance computation.
