Help translating the following PCA results into layman's terms?

As a non-maths doctoral candidate, I would be absolutely thrilled to bits if anyone here might be willing to take a stab at translating the following PCA results into layman's terms. There are only two sets of raw data: TOEIC test scores and DMIS stages. Additionally, I also need to be able to state the significance, if any, of this PCA analysis (e.g. I have to answer the perennial dissertation question "so what?") Lastly, I must assert that it was definitely not me who performed this PCA, but rather a friend who is conversant with SPSS. Thank you in advance, even if you're not actually in a position to assist me: Communalities Initial Extraction TOEIC 1.000 .546 DMIS 1.000 .546 Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis. Total Variance Explained Component Initial Eigenvalues Extraction Sums of Squared Loadings Total % of Variance Cumulative % Total % of Variance Cumulative % 1 1.092 54.579 54.579 1.092 54.579 54.579 2 .908 45.421 100.000 Extraction Method: Principal Component Analysis.
