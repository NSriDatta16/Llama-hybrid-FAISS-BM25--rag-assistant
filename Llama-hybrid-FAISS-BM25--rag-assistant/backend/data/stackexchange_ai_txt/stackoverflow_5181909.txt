Windows Azure Connection Strings - How to Handle Local vs. Production?

I'm in the process of deploying some windows azure projects and I've noticed that it's a bit of a pain to constantly switch my role configuration settings from using LocalStorage to actually use my Windows Azure Storage connection strings. For local development, I want to use this: UseDevelopmentStorage=true But for deployed apps, I want to use something like: DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=myAccountName;AccountKey=blah I end up either changing my role's configuration connection strings just before I deploy, or if I forget to do that, I'll attempt to go into the Windows Azure portal and change them (but that usually happens after I watch my role instances start and stop over and over). I feel like I'm missing something basic, but is there a straight-forward way to have the deployment process switch my role connection settings to use the production storage accounts instead of local storage?
