How to use pcap_stats in libpcap?

I added the following function to the sniffex code ( http://www.tcpdump.org/sniffex.c ): typedef struct pcap_stat mystat; mystat *mystatp; /* Put the interface in statstics mode */ if(pcap_stats(handle, mystatp) Sniffex code is working fine for me - but as soon as I add this code, I am getting a segmentation fault error :( Can anyone please help me out ? Thanks a ton.
