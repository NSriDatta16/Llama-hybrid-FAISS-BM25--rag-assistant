How to Calculate Median?

I need to calculate a median on a set of data, so I created a temp table and have tried to follow some articles online with zero success, here is what I am working with: CREATE TABLE #QuizTemp (QuizProfileID INT,Cnt INT,TotalScore INT) INSERT INTO #QuizTemp SELECT QuizAnswers.QuizProfileID, COUNT(QuizAnswers.QuizProfileID) AS Cnt, SUM(QuizAnswers.AnsweredYes) As TotalScore FROM QuizAnswers INNER JOIN Quizzes ON QuizAnswers.QuizID = Quizzes.QuizID WHERE (Quizzes.PartnerID = 16) GROUP BY QuizAnswers.QuizProfileID HAVING COUNT(QuizAnswers.QuizProfileID)= 5 SELECT COUNT(*) AS CNT, Avg(TotalScore) AS AvgTotalScore FROM #QuizTemp DROP TABLE #QuizTemp The average works great and now I need the Median.
