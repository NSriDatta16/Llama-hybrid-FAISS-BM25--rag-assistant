Learning Elisp - what are the highest quality libraries to read source code?

When learning a new programming language, "read source code" is a common advice received by the experts. However, with such a huge system like emacs, build over decades by many people, it is not so easy for the beginner to figure out which libraries are the best examples of idiomatic Elisp progamming. Therefore I would like to get some recommendations with regards to the following criteria: idiomatic elisp programming style adherence to emacs programming guidelines clever use of the cl-package in accordance to emacs guidelines clever use of eieio-package exemplary organisation of a single .el file library exemplary organisation of a multi-file/multi-package library any criteria you consider important Giving the reasons why you recommend certain libraries for auto-didactic studies would certainly be informative to beginners in Emacs lisp programming.
