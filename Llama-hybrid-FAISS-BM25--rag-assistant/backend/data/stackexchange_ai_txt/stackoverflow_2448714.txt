Getting average from 3 columns in SQL Server

I have a table with 3 columns ( smallint ) in SQL Server 2005. Table Ratings ratin1 smallint, ratin2 smallint ratin3 smallint These columns can have values from 0 to 5 . How can I select the average value of these fields, but only compare fields where the value is greater then 0 . So if the column values are 1 , 3 , 5 - the average has to be 3 . if the values are 0 , 3 , 5 - The average has to be 4 .
