There are a few possible explanations. First, as a couple of people have noted, it might be because read() necessarily returns an int, and so it can be seen as elegant to have write() accept an int to avoid casting: int read = in.read(); if ( read != -1 ) out.write(read); //vs out.write((byte)read); Second, it might just be nice to avoid other cases of casting: //write a char (big-endian) char c; out.write(c >> 8); out.write(c); //vs out.write( (byte)(c >> 8) ); out.write( (byte)c );
