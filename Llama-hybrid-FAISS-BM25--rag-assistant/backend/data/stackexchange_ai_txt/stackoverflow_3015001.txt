SQL Server indexes not working

I've set some indexes on an a test server and on my own machine, and it worked great. But when I tried to put the data on a production server (copying all the test data through import/export wizard, and after setting the primary keys, and then the FK and indexes), the indexes seems not to be working. They are there, but the queries are really, really slow, as the indexes weren't there at all. What can I be missing? I noted that the production indexes are a little bit more fragmented than the test indexes. I've tried to rebuild and reorganize the indexes, but it didn't work. I'm using SQL Server 2005 (90).
