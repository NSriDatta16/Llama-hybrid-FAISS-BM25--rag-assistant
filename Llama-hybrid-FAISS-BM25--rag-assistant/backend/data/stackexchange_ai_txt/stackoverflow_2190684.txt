Framework is a part of architecture implementation. Say, our app will be organized according to MVC architecture and will use SpringMVC framework for that. Different frameworks are organized according to different architectural patterns. Someone can say, that term "framework" is itself describes architectural pattern. Its "opposite" is "library", because libraries are directly controlled by your application while frameworks use inversion of control and they control execution of your code. Though, there are controversies in using term "framework".
