Sonar (wonderful tool by the way) with Build breaker plugin can break your Hudson build when some metrics don't meet specified rules. You can setup such a rule in Sonar that would trigger an alert (eventually causing the build to fail) when the coverage is below given point. The only drawback is that you probably want the coverage to grow, so you must remember to increase the alert level every day to the current value.
