First, I'd remove all the == true parts, that would make it 50% shorter ;) When I have big condition I search for the reasons. Sometimes I see I should use polymorphism, sometimes I need to add some state object. Basically, it implies a refactoring is needed (a code smell). Sometimes I use De-Morgan's laws to simplify boolean expressions a bit.
