This is called sentiment analysis, which is a type of problem in natural language processing. Sentiment analysis is just a classification problem with a particular type of input. Any of the usual methods for doing feature extraction from text data and classification based on those features (the usual ones will be available in Python) is a possible approach, complete with the usual concerns about model construction, validation, overfitting, etc. You wrote that you have already tried to use Python sentiment analysis tutorials and have not gotten the performance you want. This is pretty typical of the beginning of a machine learning problem, and many resources on Data Science and on the statistics Stack address improving model performance, such as this post by one of the mods over there.
