The answer is simple. If you do not need to persistent to an out of date format (like MSWord, etc.) then you should be using Core Data. Raw SQLite is a headache that is not worth the effort 99.999% of the time. Core Data is more efficient than plists and allows greater flexibility if the project ever evolves. It is also very easy to pre-populate a Core Data sqlite file using a OS X machine; you know, the machine you are using to develop your application in the first place :) NNW's use case is a singular exception to this rule that, if I were a betting man, I would bet has the Core Data team's attention and will be corrected in a future update. An update, by the way, that you will get for free if you use Core Data.
