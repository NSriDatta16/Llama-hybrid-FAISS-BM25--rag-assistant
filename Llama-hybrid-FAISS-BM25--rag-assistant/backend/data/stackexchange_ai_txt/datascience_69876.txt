Yep, you are understanding it right. The Hyperparameter search is another optimization problem. You have to search along with all the parameters. If it was continuous you could apply gradient descent for example. But since it is discrete you canÂ´t search the space this way. There are other strategies considered here, random search, grid search, Bayesian or even genetic algorithms to try to find the optimal parameters
