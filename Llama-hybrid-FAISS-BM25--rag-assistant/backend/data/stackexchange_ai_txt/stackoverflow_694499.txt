How to find out how much java code is really executed for a given use case in a program?

is it possible to hook up an agent or something to the jvm before starting up an application (or an appserver) and have a report showing how much of the code base in the classpath is actually executed for a given use case ? I want to figure out how much code is left out unexecuted for my simple servlet application running in an appserver which doesn't use many j2ee technologies like JCA, JMS, CMP, etc. Best regards, Bulent Erdemir
