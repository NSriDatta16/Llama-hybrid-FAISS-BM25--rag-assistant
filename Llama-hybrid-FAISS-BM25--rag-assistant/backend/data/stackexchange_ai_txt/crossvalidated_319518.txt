Deep Learning: Condition Number and Poor Conditioning

I am reading the following section of the book Deep Learning . Can you provide an intuitive explanation of the above section? I don't quite understand the statement "When this number is large, matrix inversion is particularly sensitive to error in the input" and "This sensitivity is an intrinsic property of the matrix itself, not the result of rounding error during matrix inversion. Poorly conditioned matrices amplify pre-existing errors when we multiply by the true matrix inverse"
