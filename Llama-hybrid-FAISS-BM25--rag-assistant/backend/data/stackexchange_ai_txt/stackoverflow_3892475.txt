Inconsistent behaviour when attempting to highlight C# TextBox

I'm building a C# WinForms program, and my textboxes do not allow the user to highlight the text consistently throughout the program. In some places, the highlighting works normally: you type something in the box, click and drag over some text, and it highlights where you dragged. In other places, clicking and dragging does not select the text. The only way to do it is by double clicking on the text. I haven't changed any default properties of these textboxes or messed with any event listeners. I placed brand new textboxes in different places, and they behave differently. I'm wondering if it has something to do with the properties of the Form the TextBox is contained in, since it seems to appear that either all textboxes in a particular form work, or none do. However, as far as I can tell the properties look to be the same across the board, and I don't ever remember changing anything. To me it seems like it's happening randomly. I can't find any information on the topic. Does anybody have any idea what I'm talking about? EDIT: Ok, I figured out where the problem lies, but I still don't know how to fix it. It happens only in forms which have been added to a SplitContainer in my main window like so: myForm.TopLevel = false; this.splitContainer.Panel2.Controls.Add(myForm); myForm.Show(); EDIT 2: I now know that this is the same issue encountered here: Windows Forms: Unable to Click to Focus a MaskedTextBox in a Non TopLevel Form . The accepted answer isn't useful to me, and the other answers seem impractical, since I'd have to add event handlers to every single textbox...
