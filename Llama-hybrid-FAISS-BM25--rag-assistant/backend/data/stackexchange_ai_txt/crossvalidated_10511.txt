Chris Fraley has taught a whole course on the history of the debate (the link seems to be broken, even though it's still on his official site; here is a copy in Internet Archive ). His summary/conclusion is here (again, archived copy ). According to Fraley's homepage, the last time he taught this course was in 2003. He prefaces this list with an "Instructor's bias": Although my goal is to facilitate lively, deep, and fair discussions on the issues at hand, I believe that it is necessary to make my bias explicit from the outset. Paul Meehl once stated that "Sir Ronald [Fisher] has befuddled us, mesmerized us, and led us down the primrose path. I believe that the almost universal reliance on merely refuting the null hypothesis as the standard method for corroborating substantive theories in the soft areas is a terrible mistake, is basically unsound, poor scientific strategy, and one of the worst things that ever happened in the history of psychology." I echo Meehl's sentiment. One of my goals in this seminar is to make it clear why I believe this to be the case. Furthermore, I expect you, by the time you have completed this seminar, to be able to articulate and defend your stance on the NHST debate, regardless of what that stance is. I'll copy in the reading list in case the course page ever disappears: Week 1. Introduction: What is a Null Hypothesis Significance Test? Facts, Myths, and the State of Our Science Lyken, D. L.
