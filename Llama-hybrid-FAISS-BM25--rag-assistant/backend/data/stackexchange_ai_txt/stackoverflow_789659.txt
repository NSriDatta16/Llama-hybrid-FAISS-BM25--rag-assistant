What is the best approach for a Java developer to learn C++

I consider myself an experienced Java developer and am planning to get started with learning C++. If you had same experience, i.e learn C++ after Java, I would like to hear your thoughts on what is the best approach at doing this. [Update] "the best approach" was not well quantified. What I am looking for is to leverage my existing java knowledge and programming experience so that I can quickly ramp up on C++.
