Your observation is not always true. And, the choice of ASCII is largely human factors rather than technical or security issues. For most of the case, it is just for the ease of programming. A programmer never know that all software, libraries, utilities in website will break or not with some characters. Why risks the website development while ASCII works well? Also, some packaged web software would hinder the use of Unicode in user name. This contributes the issue that many websites only support usernames in ASCII. Theoretically, all current software can handle 8-bit data well. There is no problem in storage or transmission nowadays. Even if some protocols not, they can translate in UTF-7 or with other transformation schemes. There are some issues with Unicode. It is more on the side of data processing. It might be display, fonts, readiness of software and software libraries for non-BMP characters, collation, comparison, input methods, writing directions. Administrators might not knowledgeable enough to handle them. Depending on the nature of website, it could be a problem, but mostly not. For admin purpose, it is not easy to type some exotic characters. It makes admin hard to search for users. It is also hard for an admin to keep offensive usernames in foreign languages off the website. However, it is not uncommon that Chinese usernames are used Chinese website. It might not always in ASCII. So do other cultures and languages. Some global projects accept nearlly all kinds of Unicode characters. Wikipedia is an example.
