CapsNet Generative adversarial network

I have a very interesting question. It's one month ago Geoffrey Hinton release his CapsNet paper. It's a complete new way for visual computing in the neural network stack. But my question is. Is it possible to use the CapsNet as a GAN. I only understand the concept of the CapsNet but not technical limitations. So could this be possible? This sounds for me for a nice field to research:)
