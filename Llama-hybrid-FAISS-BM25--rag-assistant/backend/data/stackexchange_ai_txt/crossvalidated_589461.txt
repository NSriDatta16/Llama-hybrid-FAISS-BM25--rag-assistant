My data is widely dispersed across the X axis for both my 1s and 0s however there is slightly more 1s the higher the X and slightly more 0s the lower the X. So the probabilities listed in a standard Logistic regression I feel are over/understated on both ends of the X axis. I feel you have misunderstood logistic regression. The model is fit to your data, so if at extremes of your training data you don't approach 0/100% in the raw data, then you won't with logistic regression either. But clearly if your training data is between +/-1 there will be some range outside your data set where you approach 0/100%, maybe its at +/-10, maybe its at +/-100...
