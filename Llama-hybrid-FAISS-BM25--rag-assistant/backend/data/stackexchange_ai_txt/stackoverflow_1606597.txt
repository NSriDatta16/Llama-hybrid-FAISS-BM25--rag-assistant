GZip encoding - what are the potential issues (old versions of IE etc)?

I can vaguely remember that there are certain older versions of certain browsers that do weird things with GZip encoding - in particular I seem to recall a bug in IE which resulted in JavaScript sent over GZip getting mangled. Vague recollections aren't much practical use though. Does anyone know exactly what kind of issues there are and which user agents they affect?
