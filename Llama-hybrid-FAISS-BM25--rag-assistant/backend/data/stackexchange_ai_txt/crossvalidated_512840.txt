Weighted average of units sold at different timeframes

I have this weighted average: $ S_{wavg} = 30\% * sales_{7d} + 50\% * sales_{30d} * 20\% * sales_{365d} $ Where $ sales_{xd} $ are units sold in the last X days. A good approximation of this formula could be the sales of the last 90 days? because $ 0.3 *7 + 0.5*30 + 0.2*365 = 90 $ What's the timeframe of the final value $ S_{awvg} $ ? 90 days? Could I say that $ S_{awvg} $ are units sold in the last 90 days?
