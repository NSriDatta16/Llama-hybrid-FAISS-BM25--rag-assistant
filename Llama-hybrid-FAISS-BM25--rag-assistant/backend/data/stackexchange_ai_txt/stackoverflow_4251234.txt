should i split it based upon words or based upon each character The requirement is to make tokens, so you should split them based on words. Each word becomes a unique String key. It would make sense for the value to be the count of each token. If the file you are reading has these three lines: int alpha; int beta; float delta; Then you should have something like (The semicolon may or may not be considered a token.) Your average length would be ( 3x2 + 3x1 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 6. Your length of tokens starting with "a" would be 5.0. Look elsewhere on this forum for keySet and you should be good to go.
