Maybe I'm not understanding your question, but if we're talking about the same thing... In my flash (which was written in AS2 so you may need to look up how it's different in AS3, I notice you're not using the security class of System... they may have removed that), I have this line... System.security.loadPolicyFile("xml_root.socket://" + _root.HOST + ":" +_root.GAME_PORT ); I'm pretty sure this simply goes and fetches the static crossdomain.xml from the docroot of my server. On the server side of things your socket code (what is that written in?) can deliver the crossdomain policy directly. Here's the piece from my Perl socket that responds to the flash socket's initial request. I wrote this a long time ago but it would appear that the socket sends this tiny xml fragment as its initial communication to the socket " " in response to which you want to do the following... if($input eq " "){ #if the string arriving on the socket == " #assemble the printed response to look just like a crossdomain policy file. Set permissions as you normally would. #if you don't know perl, the qq~ is just a way to provide a chunk of multiline code in one fragment. But note the \0 at the end. All socket messages have to be null terminated manually by you. $MESSAGE = qq~ \0~; } print "$MESSAGE"; #send the string back on the socket Make sure this is actually what you need. Sometimes all you need is for the server to just have the crossdomain.xml policy file sitting at the docroot.
