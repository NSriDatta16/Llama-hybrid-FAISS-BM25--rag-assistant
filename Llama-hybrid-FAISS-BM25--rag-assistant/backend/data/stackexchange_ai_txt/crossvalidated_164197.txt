Here is an elaboration of my comment above. Let's rewrite the multilevel model into a single model, $$ y_{ij}=\boldsymbol x_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol\beta+\boldsymbol z_{ij}^{'}\boldsymbol u_j+e_{ij},$$ where $j$ denotes the cluster, $\boldsymbol u_j=(u_{0j},u_{1j})$. The variance of the residual errors $e_{ij}$ is specified as $\sigma^2_e$ and the variances of the residual errors $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$ are specified as $\sigma^2_{u0}$ and $\sigma^2_{u1}$. Note that there is a typo at the end of the paragraph below equation (3). In the first paragraph on Page 89, the authors followed the notation in Busing (1993) and referred $\sigma_{00}$ and $\sigma_{11}$ to $\sigma^2_{u0}$ and $\sigma^2_{u1}$. Their simulation procedure for $\sigma^2_{u0}$ and $\sigma^2_{u1}$ is: Calculate $\sigma^2_{u0}$ based on $\sigma^2_e=0.5$, the intra-class correlation (ICC = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3), and the ICC definition in equation (6) below $$\rho=\frac{\sigma_{u0}^2}{\sigma_{u0}^2+\sigma_{e}^2}.$$ Set $\sigma^2_{u1}=\sigma^2_{u0}$ by following Busing (1993). Note that the ICC definition above is for random-intercept-only model. There are several more rigorous ICC definitions for mixed models with both random intercept and slope. One of them is defined by Goldstein et al. (2002) . As shown in the second formula after equation (2) in their paper, ICC depends on predictors in the model.
