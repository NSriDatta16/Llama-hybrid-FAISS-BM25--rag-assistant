Statistical analysis of polygons QGIS : find areas of statistical difference

I have polygons for the country divided into E.D. areas. These polygons illustrate the average annual rainfall in their ED area. Is there any way to statistically tell if one polygon area has a statistically higher or lower volume of rain compared to its surrounding areas? or if I extract points from these polygons and make a smooth surface raster via interpolation - is there a way I can I assess my layer for statistically higher or lower rainfall ? Amendment: I have a data set of polygons. Each polygon is an area in the county and each polygon has an "Average annual rainfall in mm.". The range of values is between 1-20 mm For example, If I had a polygons or even a raster grid as follows: 01,01,02,02,03,04,04,04,06,08,11,13,15,20 01,12,02,02,03,04,04,04,06,08,11,13,15,20 01,01,02,02,03,04,04,04,06,08,11,13,15,20 01,01,02,02,03,04,04,04,06,08,11,13,15,20 In the second line the number 12 is much bigger than any of the surrounding values or any of its neighbours. However, the values range from 01-20 so it is not large by comparison to the rest of the dataset.
