Converting Categorical Data to Numerical by Sampling

Suppose I had sampled $1000$ individuals from a population in order to learn about two different questions, both of which had categorical, binary answers. (For the sake of this hypothetical, let's say those two variables are the responses to the questions "Do you have a car?" and "Do you change your outdoor dining behaviors in the winter?") The results of any individual could therefore be mapped into the Cartesian plane as $(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)$ ("no" = $0$ , "yes" = $1$ ), and suppose that I want to create a regression to see if there is a correlation between my $x$ and $y$ values. I know that we could create $2\times 2$ contingency table and run a logistic regression on that data based on the total responses. However, I was curious if we could take arbitrarily many samples from this sample with replacement (let's say $1000$ samples of size $10$ ), and then map the frequencies of the two variables on a plane and regress that data. In other words, we would have data ranging from $(0,0)$ to $(10,10)$ , with all values in between. My question is whether or not this is a legitimate way to draw inferences from our data set, and whether or not this "conversion" from categorical to numerical data actually provides a relevant picture as to the relationship of our two original variables. Any insights would be sincerely appreciated. Thanks!
