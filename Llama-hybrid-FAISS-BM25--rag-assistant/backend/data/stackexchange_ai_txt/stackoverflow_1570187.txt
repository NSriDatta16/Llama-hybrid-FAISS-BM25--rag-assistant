multiple word Predictive/autocomplete textarea?

I'm lookin for a javascript plugin (for js/any framework) I want to create a textarea that while I type will using a supplied data array, check for predictive matches to the current word im typing and try to suggest a solution. All solutions I've found so far (for jquery) only match one word, then end... I want to write like a sentence or paragraph but have autocomplete ability.
