Returning early from a function in classic ASP

Is there a way to return early from a function in classic ASP rather than it run the full length of the function? For example lets say I have the function... Function MyFunc(str) if (str = "ReturnNow!") then Response.Write("What up!") else Response.Write("Made it to the end") end if End Function Can I write it like so... Function MyFunc(str) if (str = "ReturnNow!") then Response.Write("What up!") return end if Response.Write("Made it to the end") End Function Note the return statement which of course I can't do in classic ASP. Is there a way to break code execution where that return statement sits?
