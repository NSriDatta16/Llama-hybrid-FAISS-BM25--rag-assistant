I thought views/layouts/application.html.erb was meant to apply to all layouts?

I am trying to design my ruby on rails app at the moment. I created views/layouts/posts.html.erb which styled my PostsController 's views. I want to add a main bar that is always at the top of the page no matter what view the user is looking at. I thought this was what the views/layouts/application.html.erb was for. This seems to agree with me: http://jacqueschirag.wordpress.com/2007/08/02/rails-layout-and-nested-layout-basics/ The entire Rails application (all views of all controllers) will use this layout: views/layouts/application.rhtml All views within a single controller will use this layout. For example, the layout for weclome_controller.rb will use this layout. Notice, the ‘_controller’ is left off for the layout: views/layouts/welcome.rhtml What am I doing wrong? Here is what I have in the body of my application.html.erb
