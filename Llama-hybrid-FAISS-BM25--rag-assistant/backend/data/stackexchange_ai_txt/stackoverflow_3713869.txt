Before attempting to write this kind of logic yourself, I would check to see if you can leverage NDepend to meet your needs. NDepend is a code dependency analysis tool ... and much more. It implements a sophisticated analyzer for examining relationships between code constructs and should be able to answer that question. It also operates on both source and IL, if I'm not mistaken. NDepend exposes CQL - Code Query Language - which allows you to write SQL-like queries against the relationships between structures in your code. NDepend has some support for scripting and is capable of being integrated with your build process.
