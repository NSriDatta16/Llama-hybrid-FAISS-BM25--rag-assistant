As I'm building my first site with CodeIgniter, what resources should I have handy?

I'm building an organization's website, that is a mixture of static and dynamic content with a bit of functionality (login, search and results, a few forms etc) Usually I build from scratch using MySQL and PHP but I'm interested in using CodeIgniter. Obviously the official user guide is a good place to start - Any other suggestions? I want to make sure that I'm building it in an elegant, secure and best-practice sort of way. Though I also don't want to complicate things and bite off more than I can chew just yet :)
