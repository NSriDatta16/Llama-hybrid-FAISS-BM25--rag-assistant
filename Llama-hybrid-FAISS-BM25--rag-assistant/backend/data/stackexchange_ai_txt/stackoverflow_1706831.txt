You can change the fill factor of the index to reduce fragmentation. The default fill factor value is 0, which is basically treated as a fill factor of 100%, i.e. there is no extra space reserved for inserting new index records. This is ideal if you only add index records at the end of the index (like an identity field), but not if you insert records in the middle. You can set the fill factor to 80% for example, that will reserve 20% free space in each index page for inserting new index records.
