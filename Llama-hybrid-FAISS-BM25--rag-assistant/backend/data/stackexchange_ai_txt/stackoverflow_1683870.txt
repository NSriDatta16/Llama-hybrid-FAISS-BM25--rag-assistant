I just ran into this myself today. I just needed to recompile the MonkeyAgent.SWF. As per a note on the FlexMonkey site, I used the Easy2BuildMonkeyAgent project to do this. I didn't look into why they recommended this, but it worked for me. Beware, I ran into a problem compiling this because I use the standard 3.4 SDK that was installed separate from Flex Builder. The the standard 3.4 SDK, the automation.swc file (and others) aren't there, so I had to grab copies from the FlexBuilder 3.0 SDK folder into the 3.4.
