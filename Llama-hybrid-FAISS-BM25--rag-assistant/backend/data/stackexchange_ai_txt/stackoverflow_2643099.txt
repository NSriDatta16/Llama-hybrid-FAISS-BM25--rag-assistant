Assuming that the assembly is signed using Authenticode technology and X.509 certificates (and not just strong-named), you need an Authenticode reader code (or component) to extract the certificate and validate it. After that you will find organization name in one of the fields of certificate's SubjectName or SubjectRDN record. We offer Authenticode reader class and certificate manipulation class in PKIBlackbox package.
