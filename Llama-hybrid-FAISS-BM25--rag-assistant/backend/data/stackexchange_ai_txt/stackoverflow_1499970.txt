How do I configure proxy settings for Java in Solaris to handle Proxy Auto Config (PAC) scripts?

I would like to configure Java proxy settings on Solaris to use a Proxy Auto Config (PAC) scriptt. I have found instructions for making the settings on a Windows machine using the Java control panel , but am having trouble finding where/how to make the same setting changes on a Solaris Java install. I would like to use the Proxy Auto Config (PAC) script, rather than manually setting proxy info per connection, or using a single proxy. I have a need to leverage multiple proxies for different types of URLs.
