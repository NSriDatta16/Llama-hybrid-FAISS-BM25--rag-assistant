Yes, your understanding is essentially correct. When simply comparing rates or proportions with only one independent variable (Group or whatever) then all the information you have about a subject is group and whether they did whatever it is you are measuring (convert, in your case). Sometimes, though, you will have more information and, to incorporate that, you will need the individual data. E.g. you might want to incorporate demographic information into your analysis of conversion. Then you would probably want to do logistic regression.
