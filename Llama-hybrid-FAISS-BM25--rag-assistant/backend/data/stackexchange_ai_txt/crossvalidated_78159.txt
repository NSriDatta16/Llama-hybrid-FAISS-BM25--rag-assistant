How to integrate "prior knowledge" about the sun stability in the frequentist methodology? Very interesting topic. Here are just some thoughts, not a perfect analysis... Using the Bayesian approach with a noninformative prior typically provides a statistical inference comparable to the frequentist one. Why does the Bayesian has a strong prior belief that the sun has not exploded ? Because he knows as everyone that the sun has never exploded since its beginning. We can see on some simple statistical models with conjugate priors that using a prior distribution is equivalent to use the posterior distribution derived from a noninfomative prior and preliminary experiments. The sentence above suggests that the Frequentist should conclude as the Bayesian by including the results of preliminary experiments in his model. And this is what the Bayesian actually does : his prior comes from his knowledge of the preliminary experiments ! Let $N$ be the age of the sun in days, and $x_i$ be the status of the sun (0 = exploded / 1 = not exploded) at day $i$. Assume the $x_i$ are i.i.d Bernoulli variates with probability of succes $\theta$. The realizations of the $x_i$ have been observed : $x_i=1$ for all $i =1,\ldots,N$. In the current problem, we have $N+1$ observations : the $x_i$ and the result $y=\{\text{Yes}\}$ of the detector. The natural question is : what is the probability that the sun has exploded, that is, what is $\Pr(x_{N+1}=0)$ ? This is $\theta$ and estimating $\theta$ from the available observations $x_1, \ldots, x_N$ and $y$ yields an estimate highly close to $1$ because $N$ is huge, and the "unexpected" value $y=\{\text{Yes}\}$ has a negligible impact on the estimate of $\theta$. And the Bayesian intends to reflect this information through his prior distribution about $\theta$. From this perspective I don't see how to rephrase the question in terms of hypothesis testing. Taking $H_0 =\{\text{the sun has not exploded}\}$ makes no sense cause it is a possible issue of the experiment in my interpretation, not a true/false hypothesis. Maybe this is the error of the Frequentist ?
