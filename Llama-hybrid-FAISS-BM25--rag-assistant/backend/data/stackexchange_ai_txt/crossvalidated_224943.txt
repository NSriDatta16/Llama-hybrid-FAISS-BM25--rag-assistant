Mean reversion of performance

I have a data set split into two time periods with the same subjects in each group. In the first 5 years they show above average performance. In the follow 5 years they perform averagely. How do I statistically prove that this is mean reversion? So far I only have the graph described above to show the relationship. Thanks a lot for helping!
