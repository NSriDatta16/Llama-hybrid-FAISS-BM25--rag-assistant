Instead of max pooling you can use 2D average pooling with stride (2,2) and kernel size (2,2), optionally concatenating it with itself to get 512 features instead of 256. The benefit of this is that average pooling is linear operation which does not prevent gradient propagation and does not lose any information. The problem with the 1x1 strided max pooling is, as you said, that 3/4 of the information gets discarded. The problem with your proposed solution is that the max pooling is still non-linear, which is contradictory to the aim of residual networks: finding residual function to a linear mapping.
