You should normally (IMO, at least) be mocking dependencies rather than other methods within the class that's under test. For example, you could have an IPasswordEncoder interface which is used for the EncodePassword call. You could mock that , and verify that the method had been called... but within the same class it doesn't make as much sense. I dare say many mocking frameworks can do this sort of mocking, but I personally wouldn't encourage it. If you've found places you want to be able to inject different functionality, consider making them separate dependencies.
