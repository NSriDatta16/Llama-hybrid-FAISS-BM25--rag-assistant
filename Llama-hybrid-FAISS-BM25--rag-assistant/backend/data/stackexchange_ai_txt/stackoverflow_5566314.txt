In case you are using Visual Studio, see here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc953fe1.aspx The C++ compiler treats variables of type char, signed char, and unsigned char as having different types. Variables of type char are promoted to int as if they are type signed char by default, unless the /J compilation option is used. In this case they are treated as type unsigned char and are promoted to int without sign extension. [Edit] Straight from the ISO C++0x Standard, paragraph 3.9.1 (page 71, http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3092.pdf ): Characters can be explicitly declared unsigned or signed. Plain char, signed char, and unsigned char are three distinct types.
