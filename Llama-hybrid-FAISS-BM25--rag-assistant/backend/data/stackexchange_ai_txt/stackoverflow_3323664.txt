get location from iphone mapview

I am doing a map based application in iphone and i am need to get the location of the center of the map view. I need to get the location updated when the user Drags/Moves/Zoom the mapview. So that I can get the lat/lng information from the map and can sent these information to the google api to get the address info. Can any one have any idea about how this can be made possible? Please help. Thanks in advance Shibin M
