FInding relevant features for a time series segmentation

I have a time series data, where each of the data point belongs to one of the known clusters. What I am interested is to perform a HMM so that we can obtain hidden states that further abstracts out the clusters. Now for the HMM each observation i.e. data point is given as a feature vector where the features belongs to the properties of the cluster, for eg: the mean inter arrival time of the cluster, inter quartile range (shifting from third to 4th quartile) and lifetime of a clsuter (span). Now what other features can be used for the task. I am new to time series analysis. My each data point is an image and is a social media post.
