Why is curl sending the command-line before the message body in an HTTP PUT?

I'm issuing the command (line broken for readability): curl -H"X-RequestIsAbsolutePath: F" \ -T /tmp/out \ -H'Content-Type: application/xml' \ "http://localhost:8182/metadata/036-Rotated.JPG" I'm sending a message body of XML. I get a complaint from the XML parser on the server about content not being allowed in the prolog. I added a --trace-acii option to the command line and see: => Send header, 270 bytes (0x10e) 0000: PUT /metadata/036-Rotated.JPG HTTP/1.1 0028: User-Agent: curl/7.19.4 (i386-apple-darwin9.6.0) libcurl/7.19.4 0068: OpenSSL/0.9.8i zlib/1.2.3 0083: Host: localhost:8182 0099: Accept: */* 00a6: X-RequestIsAbsolutePath: F 00c2: Content-Type: application/xml 00e1: Content-Length: 235 00f6: Expect: 100-continue 010c: == Info: Done waiting for 100-continue => Send data, 235 bytes (0xeb) 0000: curl -v -H"X-RequestIsAbsolutePath: F" "http://localhost:8182/me 0040: tadata/036-Original.JPG". . . . . 00c0: . . . Why is curl sending the command-line itself as part of the message body? Of course the XML parser will complain. How can I get curl to stop doing that and send only the contents of the file passed as an argument to the -T option? FYI: I've captured the raw text being sent on the server and, yes, the command-line really is being sent. FYI#2: I'm using the latest curl (7.19.4) on Mac OS X.
