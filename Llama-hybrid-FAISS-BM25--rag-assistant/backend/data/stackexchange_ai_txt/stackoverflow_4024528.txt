If you really want to play MPEG (non-MP4) or AVI in a web page, yes, you will need to embed a Media Player, with all the consequent codec, compatibility and stability problems that led people to using Flash video (and latterly HTML5) instead. Non-Windows machines can play these files if they have suitable plugins and codecs installed, as long as you include a standard , or old-school tag inside the IE-specific ActiveX media player embedding. However, yes, for viewer convenience most video-sharing sites do convert uploaded files into FLV, or—these days more likely—MP4 (which plays on recent Flash players as well as some HTML5 implementations), possibly with OGV or WebM as well (for HTML5 browsers that don't implement MP4 for licensing reasons).
