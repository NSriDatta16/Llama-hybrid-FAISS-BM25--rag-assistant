You can try and dig into Markov chains , formed from words of sentences. Also you'll require both-way chain (i.e. to find next and previous words), i.e. store probable words that appear just after the given or just before it. Of course, Markov chain is a stochastic process to generate content, however similar approach may be used to store information you need.
