It really depends on what you are creating. But for the most part no. You are going to need some backend storage, this is usually done through PHP/MySQL. However, the actual application is created with html5/css3/javascript, and lots can be done just with that. Why you hear about backends is if there is a lot of data to process or some type of expensive computation it is sometimes better to do it serverside with C++ or Java or some other programing language. I hope this answers your question.
