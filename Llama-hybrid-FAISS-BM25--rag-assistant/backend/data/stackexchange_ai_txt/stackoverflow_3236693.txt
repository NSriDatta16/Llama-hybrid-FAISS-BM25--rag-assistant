The browser doesn't send the webserver that information (called the "fragment") when requesting a web page. In fact, it may even not make a request at all (if you click on an link to the same page, but a different fragment). The only way to do this is with Javascript. You can fetch the fragment with self.document.location.hash . Then you can make a separate request (e.g. ajax) to send the server that information. This would be useful e.g. to store statistics on which sections users have landed when they followed a link, but you can change how the page rendered server-side based on the fragment (you could of course, with javascript, redirect the user to another page, or to the same page passing the fragment in the query string so that it could then be rendered differently).
