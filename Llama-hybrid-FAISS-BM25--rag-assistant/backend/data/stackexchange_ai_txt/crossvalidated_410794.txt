How to interpret impulse response analysis in VAR when using standardized variables?

How to interpret impulse response analysis when using standardized variables (ie., subtracting the mean and divide by standard deviation) in vector autoregression analysis? The reason why I standardized variables is because I am using variables with different measurement units. I want to add that the size of the positive shock is the average of the stochastic volatility during the study period. (ie., not the usual 1 standard deviation).
