From what I can tell, due to the documentation if you are going to choose between those two, there is no point to go with the 32. However, my gut tells me that if you are building for desktop applications only, and you want to get the best range of colors for those with 32 bit color I would use either Format32bppArgb or Format32bppPArgb , as per the MSDN documentation these are going to provide more bits for color storage.
