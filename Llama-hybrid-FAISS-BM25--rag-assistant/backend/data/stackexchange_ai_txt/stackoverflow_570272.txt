Well your question is pretty vague. What do you need help with exactly? It isn't clear. I wrote a PHP application that integrated with Google Maps, and I just finished porting it to Django. My original code was just plain old Javascript, but during the port to Django I started leveraging jQuery, which cut the code I had to write down by half. All my application does is allow site users to place a marker for their location on a map along with a short message and their avatar. Without any specifics, I can recommend learning something like jQuery to help reduce repetitive Javascript code that you have to write. Otherwise it is just manipulating the Google Maps Javascript API, which, as you note, and I agree with, is documented pretty well and easy to use.
