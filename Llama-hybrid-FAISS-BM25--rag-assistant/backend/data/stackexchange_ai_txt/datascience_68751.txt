Categorical feature as output and perform a classification

I have a database in which the output feature Y is categorical, for example (oversimplification) A B C Y 1.0 0.2 5.1 Car 3.0 1.1 0.1 Car 7.6 6.9 2.7 Bike 2.5 3.8 0.3 Train 6.1 9.5 8.4 Car 8.4 0.7 5.6 Train and so on....... I would like to run a classification algorithm like kNN, Logistic Regression or Random Forest using as the output feature the column Y, i.e., to predict which transport was used. How could I implement that in python since the output is not numerical?
