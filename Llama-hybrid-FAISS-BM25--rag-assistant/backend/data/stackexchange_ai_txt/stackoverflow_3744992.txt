Firebug is still my personal tool of choice. As for a way of killing your endless loops. Some browsers will prevent this from happening altogether. However, I still prefer just going ctrl + w , but this still closes the tab. Some of the other alternatives you can look into: Opera : Dragonfly Safari / Chrome : Web Inspector Although, Opera has a nice set of developer tools which I have found pretty useful. (Tools->Advanced->Developer Tools)
