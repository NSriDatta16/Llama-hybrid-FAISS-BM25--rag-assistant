Well the thing is ... Your solution will have to include a for loop and some sort of error/exception handling process, so you will probably have to embed a try catch statement in your for loop. If an exception is thrown, there is no way you will complete that one iteration as you would if the exception wasn't thrown. However by using an try catch you can make sure that your loop executes all those iterations that don't throw exceptions. If you need help with embedding exception handling in a for loop, just use the example posted by teedyay!
