It is not the only one as the Omegahat project also has the RSJava package. But as many of the other brilliant innovations from Omegahat (which practically speaking is really just Duncan Temple Lang), this one may not build as easily or reliably. The rJava package on the other hand is used by almost thirty other packages CADStat, Containers, Deducer, JGR, RFreak, RImageJ, RJDBC, RLadyBug, aCGH.Spline, ant, arulesNBMiner, colbycol, cshapes, dynGraph, farmR, gWidgetsrJava, glmulti, helloJavaWorld, iplots, rSymPy, rcdk, rcdklibs, scagnostics, spcosa, RKEA, RWeka, Snowball, openNLP, wordnet which I take as quite the endorsement.
