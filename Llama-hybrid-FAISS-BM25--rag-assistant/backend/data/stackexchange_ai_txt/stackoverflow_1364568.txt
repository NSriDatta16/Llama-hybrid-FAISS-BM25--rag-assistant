Detecting Popup Blockers Or better yet, use SWFAddress v2.3 (javascript and AS3) modules. The AS3 has SWFAddress::popup() facade that proxies the poup call to the javascript. You can modify the SWFAdress.js popup function to use Andrew's logic and return a status. This would be a best practice: leveraging superlative SWFAddress library from flex for deeplinking, google analytics, and popups.
