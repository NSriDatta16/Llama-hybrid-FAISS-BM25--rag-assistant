First my understanding of your problem. You want to find the best hyperparameters for a Random Forest. For that, you want to first adjust n_estimators parameter and then the rest of parameters in different runs. Before answering to your question, you will only want to do a thorough search of hyperparameters when you want to have an improvement of around 1%. So it will be a small improvement. If you want to improve your model, probably feature engineering or data engineering will give you a better improvement. Or even a different algorithm. You can print the results of your GridsearchCV with pd.DataFrame(clf.cv_results_) The answer to your question: No you shouldn't run a GridsearchCV in different runs you have to explore the whole parameters if you want to find the global minima. A small change in one parameter can affect other. At the end you are exploring a search space.
