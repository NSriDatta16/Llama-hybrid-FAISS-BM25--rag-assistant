How to compare the performance of ARIMA and LSTM for time series forecasting?

I am facing some challenges in comparing LSTM and ARIMA for soma datasets. I would like to know if there are some general expectations regarding the differences between ARIMA and LSTM regarding how they deal with outliers. In general, LSTM deal better with outliers tham ARIMA? Or is not possible to say that for the general case? Besides that, I read some papers that state that differences in MAE and RMSE, in general, are due to outliers in forecasting. Is it possible to measure in some way the degree of such impact of outliers, by considering the MAE and the RMSE? What can I conclude if model A is better than model B regarding MAE, but model B is better than model B regarding RMSE?
