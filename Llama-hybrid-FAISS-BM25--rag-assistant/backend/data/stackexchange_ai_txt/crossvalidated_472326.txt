forecasting with optimised theta method (otm) using time series cross validation with R

I want to do an out-of-sample forecast experiment using the optimised theta method (otm) on a time series. Further, time series cross validation with a fixed rolling window size should be applied. Therefore i tried to combine the tscv function with the forecTheta package: ## [Updated] library(forecTheta) library(forecast) library(tseries) #y is the time series y1 = 2+ 0.15*(1:20) + rnorm(20,2) y2 = y1[20]+ 0.3*(1:30) + rnorm(30,2) y = as.ts(c(y1,y2)) #10 obs in the test set, and 40 obs in the training set ntest However when i try to run this code the e1 vector, which includes the forecast errors, only has NA values. First I thought this would be due to no limit in the theta parameter, therefore i restricted this parameter. But this diddnt help. Also i tried to implement/execute the forecast in the forecTheta package, but it diddnt work. [solved] I have another question regarding the predicted values. For the 1-step ahead forecast the predicted values are obtained with the following: #predicted values for h=1 fc1 However IÂ´m curious whether the predicted values for the 3-step ahead are coded correctly. Since the first 3-step ahead forecast is the prediction of the 43th observation, i guess the following line is wrong: fc3
