Is there an R package which uses neural networks to explicitly model count data?

Ripley's nnet package, for example, allows you to model count data using a multi nomial setting but is there a package which preserves the complete information relating to a count? For example, whereas an ordinal multinomial model preserves the ordering of the integers that make up the count, a fully developed model of count data as a GLM such as Poisson or Negative Binomial Regression includes how large the integer counts are in relation to each other. Another phrasing might be, 'What kind of models come closest to combining the advantages of neural networks, in terms of, as an example, easily modelling non-linearity in the predictors, and count data GLMs, which are good at taking into account that the data is in fact a count?'
