Acting Oddly

I'm seeing this odd issue where &nbsp is being turned into some odd "?" symbol. Like it's some unknown character I've typed. (I'm using &#160; in the xsl). Once pass through the XSL just leaves this as &nbsp. Another "pass" through the XSL makes this odd character show up, the "?". The "?" even shows up when doing inspect element. So odd! What could do the XSL transformer be doing to cause such a thing? I've thought it was the different CSS templates being applied on the problem "pass" but the css I see through inspect element is identical for both cases.
