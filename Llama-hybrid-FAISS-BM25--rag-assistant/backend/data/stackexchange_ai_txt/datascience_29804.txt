First, neural networks are good in dealing with"label noise". I'm currently on mobile/vacation, so remind me to search the paper on Friday. Second, the more important question is how to get a good ground truth. Without a good ground truth you can't evaluate your models, no matter how good they might be. I see the ways: (1) have multiple experts label the stuff. Then you can make the ground truth a probability, not a simple label. If 9 experts say it is cancer and 1 says it is not, you would label it with 90% (2) wait. If you can access the patients data, it will likely be more obvious in a year (especially if it was not treated) (3) other diagnostic methods: I'm not a medical doctor, but I'm pretty sure there are invasive methods to diagnose cancer which are reliable
