Non linear regression? Which model to use?

For my analysis I am predicting an effect like the following (the IV being 'ideology' on a continuous scale). I'm predicting a different effect for when it's low, middle or high. Unfortunately all I have seen so far are linear regressions that go in one direction. Is linear regression still a good model to test this? If not, what are more suitable alternatives? To offer a bit of a context: For my research, participants will have to read an article that either talks positive or negative about the colonial past of their country. In addition, we expect that their level of ideology (on a continuous scale) will have a moderator effect on their evaluation of colonial history. Their evaluation is measured via multiple likert ratings (scale from 1-7). The different items were regrouped through a factor analysis. So: DV: evaluation of colonial history IV: article (positive, negative) moderator: ideology We suspect that participants react differently to the article based on their ideology. Participants with a high level of ideology will contest the article if it talks positive about the past (the past BEFORE the colonisation began). As a result, they will evaluate the colonial past HIGHER than in the situation where they read a negative article (and vice versa for the ones with a low ideology). However, we think that those with a mid-level of ideology (so those who are not strong in either direction and 'don't really care') are not as influenced by their ideology (who is a moderator effect), but will be more influenced by the article. I know it's a bit of a complicated description, but I hope you can take the explanation like this to understand my statistical question.
