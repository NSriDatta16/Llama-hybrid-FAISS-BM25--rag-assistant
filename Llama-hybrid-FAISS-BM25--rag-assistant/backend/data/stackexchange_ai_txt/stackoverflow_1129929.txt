Here's a slightly shorter solution. Maximum: /foo/bar/@score[not(. Minimum: /foo/bar/@score[not(. > ../../bar/@score)][1] I've edited the predicate so that it's applicable to any sequence of bar , even if you decide to change the path. Note that parent of attribute is the element to which it belongs. If embedding these queries in XML files like XSLT or ant scripts, remember to encode and > as &lt; respecting &gt; .
