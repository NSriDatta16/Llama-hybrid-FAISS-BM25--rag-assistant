can some one give me a sample gzip code for htaccess?

I'm keen to get started experimenting with gzip, but like i used to find php.net when i first started learning php, the apache documentation confuses me a bit. http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_deflate.html I'd really appreciate a sample htaccess file to have a look at if anyone's got one? Also are there things which should be changed in the httpd.conffile instead of htaccess if I'm enabling gzipping server-wide? Sorry i'm a newb with apache! edit: so i enable mod_deflate in the httpd.conf and then putting the following into an ht access file will work (as an example)? # Insert filter SetOutputFilter DEFLATE # Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine # BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # NOTE: Due to a bug in mod_setenvif up to Apache 2.0.48 # the above regex won't work. You can use the following # workaround to get the desired effect: BrowserMatch \bMSI[E] !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Don't compress images SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \ \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-gzip dont-vary # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary
