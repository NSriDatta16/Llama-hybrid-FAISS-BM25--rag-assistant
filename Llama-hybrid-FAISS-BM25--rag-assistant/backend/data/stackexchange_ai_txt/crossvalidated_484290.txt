Why do neural networks outperform SVMs on image recognition if SVMs have the less generalization error?

Why do neural networks outperform SVMs if SVMs have the less generalization error according to Vapnik? Is generalization error only useful in data scarce environments? Is it because neural networks are unfairly given an advantage by GPUs?
