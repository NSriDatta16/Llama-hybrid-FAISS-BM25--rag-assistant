How to detect multiple digits in one image using CNN

The network in CNN recognize one digit for one image, how can I recognize two or more digits in one image . A proper way I've thought about is modifying the weights in the FC layer. In other words, if there is two three digits in a image, the fully connected layer's weight can be expressed as (in tensorflow): w_output = __weight_variable([1024, number_of_digits*number_classes], stddev=0.1) If we want to recognize one digit in one image, just remove the number_of_digits in the above statement. Another question occurred when the number of digits is unknown(Maybe two or more). How to modify the network to recognize all the digits in the image?
