Like others have said, you already clearly know what you need to do. A VCS is a must, CI or bug-tracking may be overkill (for a single developer a spreadsheet might suffice for bug-tracking). One thing that might benefit you greatly is keeping an organized product backlog. In solo development, I find keeping focused on the high-priority features and avoiding feature creep to be one of my biggest challenges. Keeping a backlog helps immensely. It doesn't have to be much more than a prioritized list of features with some notes about the scope of each. At my workplace, we keep this info in Trac, but here again, a spreadsheet may be all you need. And I want to put in a plug for unit testing, particularly Test Driven Development (TDD). Kent Beck's book is a good place to start. I find that TDD helps keep me honest and focused on what I really need to do, particularly on a single-developer project without QA. Sometimes it seems like the code writes itself.
