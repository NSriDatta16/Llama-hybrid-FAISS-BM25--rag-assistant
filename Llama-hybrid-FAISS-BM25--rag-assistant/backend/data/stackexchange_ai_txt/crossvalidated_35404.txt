It sounds like you want to use a method such a LMT (logistic model trees) or perhaps Joao Gama 's functional trees. The former uses standard decision tree splitting criteria at the interior nodes and additive logistic regression functions at the leaves, and the tree is pruned using the CART pruning method. The latter also can have logistic regression functions at the leaves and also at the interior nodes (for oblique splits). Weka has implementations of both: weka.classifiers.trees.LMT and weka.classifiers.trees.FT.
