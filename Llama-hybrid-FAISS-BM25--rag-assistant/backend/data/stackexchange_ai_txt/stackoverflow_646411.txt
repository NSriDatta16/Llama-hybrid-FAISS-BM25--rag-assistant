Not sure if this is exactly what you're asking, but, for example, the PCAP file format specifies a variable endianness: http://www.winpcap.org/ntar/draft/PCAP-DumpFileFormat.html The concept is that you can write a "marker" byte, such as 0x12345678, to the header of your file. On a "big endian" machine such as a PowerPC, it will be written as follows: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78 On a "little endian" machine such as an x86, it will be written as follows: 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 Then, when reading your header, you could tell by what your machine read out to determine if you need to swap bytes while reading the file. Or you could specify an endianness, such as big endian. Then you would always swap bytes in on a little endian machine. In the case of the PCAP format, this was done for performance reasons. But it's probably simpler to specify and endianness and stick to it.
