I've started an open source project, Kona, to wrap the ADOMD.Net lib, and try to bring ADOMD.Net into the 21st Century. You can get it up at http://www.codeplex.com/kona , but it does need some more love and attention. The task of converting lambdas to MDX isn't a small one, so I haven't even tried to to that, yet. I've tried to encourage MSFT to write a LINQ to MDX provider, but considering how few .Net developers are actually trying to work with OLAP/SSAS (outside of the SSRS space), I don't think it will be high on anyone's priority list at the moment. But that doesn't mean to stop trying. I've been doing my "BI for the .Net Guy" talk at the local user groups and Code Camps, trying to spread the love.
