If you do not use Google's own WebApp framework, but rely on more standardized tools (I'm not saying Django here), there are only few things to isolate from core application logic and make pluggable/swappable: storage, this seems to be most annoying part, but doable if you do not use GQL too much (datastore API resembles enough other ORMs available for Python to try); authentication, seems to be easy part but requires writing complete backend; in-memory cache, memcache API is somewhat different from Memcached (differences are small so this should be straightforward, as operations of both systems are identical); application startup, you'd have to write your own WSGI launcher (pretty easy with Werkzeug ). In my opinion - worth a try.
