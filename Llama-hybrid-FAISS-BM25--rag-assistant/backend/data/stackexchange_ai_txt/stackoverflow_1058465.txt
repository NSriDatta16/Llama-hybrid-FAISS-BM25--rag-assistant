You have a few options: Set up WebDAV and use HTTP. Use the SVN client library and integrate using it. I've done both approaches in the past. The SVN client library is actually quite easy to use. Edit The subversion client library is described in Version Control with Subversion . Pay particular attention to Chapter 3 and Chapter 8 . I started by grabbing a source snapshot from subversion.apache.org and reading the source code for the command line client. It's in /subversion/clients/cmdline . I found that the source is easy enough to follow.
