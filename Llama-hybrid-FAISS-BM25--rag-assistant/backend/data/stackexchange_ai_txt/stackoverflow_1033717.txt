It depends on how elegant you want to make your application, it seems. You might try something with chained actions, chaining the doc action to every action that you'd like to append '/doc' to. AFAIK, catalyst does not support chaining an action to multiple other actions, but that may have changed. Alternatively, could they not all take one additional argument? Or, modifying the code above: sub auto : Private { my ($self, $c) = @_; if ((my $path = $c->req->path) =~ /\/doc$/) { $path =~ s/\/doc//; $c->detach($path); } } That's really probably poor practice, though...
