rpart uses a specific cost function which involves a complexity parameter mixed with a base cost function which could be infogain or accuracy. None of these functions optimize for mape. It is no surprise that when you optimize for some error function (aka. some specific form of errors) you get something different for other loss function (mape for your case). Different loss functions have minimum at different points, otherwise the idea of modeling errors through loss function would be meaningless. All of this leaving aside that cart with pruning it is not the most robust way to get a classifier, less better than random forests, for example.
