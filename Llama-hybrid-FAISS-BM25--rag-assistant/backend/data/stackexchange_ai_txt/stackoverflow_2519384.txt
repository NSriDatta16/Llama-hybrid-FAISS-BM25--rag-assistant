The maximum data rate of USB is way higher than what you will actually get. Webcams will probably use isochronous transfer, which under USB 2 can only get about 40% (if I recall correctly) of the bus time, and this also has a good bit of overhead. I don't know for sure, but I suspect that this is why usb webcam resolutions and data rates seem to have hit a ceiling several years ago. They may start to increase again with the use of USB 3. I'd suggest that you attach each of your cameras to it's own USB 2 port, as the 40% is shared among all isochronous connections. One of those connections sharing bandwidth with a keyboard or even a usb mass storage device should be ok, because they would only use parts of the remainder of the bandwidth.
