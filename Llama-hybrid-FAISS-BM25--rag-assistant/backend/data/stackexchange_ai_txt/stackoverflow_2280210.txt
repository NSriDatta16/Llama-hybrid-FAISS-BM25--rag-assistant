The get_browser function can be used to extract a couple of information the User-Agent HTTP header sent by the browser. Amongst those informations, it seems there is some data about the operating system the browser's running on -- i.e. about the client OS. Quoting the example given on the manual page of get_browser : Array ( [browser_name_regex] => ^mozilla/5\.0 (windows; .; windows nt 5\.1; .*rv:.*) gecko/.* firefox/0\.9.*$ [browser_name_pattern] => Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; ?; Windows NT 5.1; *rv:*) Gecko/* Firefox/0.9* [parent] => Firefox 0.9 [platform] => WinXP [browser] => Firefox [version] => 0.9 But note that the User-Agent HTTP header is sent by the client, which means : It can be disabled It can be faked (i.e. you can get any kind of garbage in it ^^ )
