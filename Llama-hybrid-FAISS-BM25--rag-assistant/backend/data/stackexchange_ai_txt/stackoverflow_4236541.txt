Sounds like your trigger gets fired when the replication agent applies the updates. Normally the trigger should run only at the publisher (or more precisely, at the site which inserts the original data). Then replication will replicate the effect of the trigger. I think that all you need is to mark the trigger as NOT FOR REPLICATION . See Controlling Constraints, Identities, and Triggers with NOT FOR REPLICATION .
