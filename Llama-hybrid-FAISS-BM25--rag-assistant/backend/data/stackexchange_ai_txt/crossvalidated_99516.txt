Applying PCA to your data has the only effect of rotating the original coordinate axes. It is a linear transformation, exactly like for example Fourier transform. Therefore as such it can really not do anything to your data. However, data represented in the new PCA space has some interesting properties. Following coordinate rotation with PCA, you may discard some dimensions based on established criteria such as percentage of total variance explained by the new axes. Depending on your signal, you may achieve a considerable amount of dimensional reduction by this method and this would definitely increase the performance of the following ICA. Doing an ICA without discarding any of the PCA components will have no impact on the result of the following ICA. Furthermore, one can also easily whiten the data in the PCA space due to the orthogonality of the coordinate axes. Whitening has the effect of equalizing variances across all dimensions. I would argue that this is necessary for an ICA to work properly. Otherwise only few PCA components with largest variances would dominate ICA results. I don't really see any drawbacks for PCA based preprocessing before an ICA. Giancarlo cites already the best reference for ICA...
