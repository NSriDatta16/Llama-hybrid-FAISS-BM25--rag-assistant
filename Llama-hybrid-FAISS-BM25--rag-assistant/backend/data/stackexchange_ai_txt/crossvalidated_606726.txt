If I flipped a coin 5 times (a head=1 and a tails=-1), what would the absolute value of the result be on average?

I.e., if I flipped five non-absolute values, then averaged them, then got the absolute value as the result, and I did that infinite times, what would be the average value of the result? What mathematical method would I use to calculate this? I've only taken up to precalculus and I anticipate that calculating this would involve something I haven't learned yet but I don't know what it is.
