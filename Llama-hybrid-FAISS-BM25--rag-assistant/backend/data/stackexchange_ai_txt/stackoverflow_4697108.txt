According to RFC 3986 the = sign is a reserved character used to delimit parameters and parameter values and you shouldn't use it at this part of the URI. The closest you might get is http://localhost:####/?q=value . As a matter of fact you could use a route like this as an incoming URL and ASP.NET MVC will correctly parse it and dispatch to the correct controller action. The problem is with the tag. There are two possible verbs: GET and POST. If you use POST parameters entered in the form will be sent in the request body and not shown in the URL. If you use GET according to the specification, user agents will send a request by appending key/value pairs of input fields to the action of the form after appending ? . So you cannot achieve the desired effect unless you use some javascript which would handle the onsubmit event of the form, cancel the default submission and change the window.location to the desired format. The question is: do you really need to go that far?
