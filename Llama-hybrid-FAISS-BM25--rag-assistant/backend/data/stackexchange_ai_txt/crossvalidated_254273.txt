Machine Learning Correlated Records

I am just getting started with machine learning and I have a question that I have had a hard time researching as I am not sure how to refer to it. If I have a dataset: TIMESTAMP X Y Z A VAL 170103 10 20 21 2 6 170102 11 19 21 3 8 170101 9 19 18 2 10 161231 10 20 19 1 14 I want to predict VAL by training a regression model. I know that VAL is influenced by previous records, X, Y, Z and A. X, Y and Z are also coordinates so they are spatially correlated. How can I pre-process the data to account for the correlation between the rows or could someone please point me in the direction of some articles to read?
