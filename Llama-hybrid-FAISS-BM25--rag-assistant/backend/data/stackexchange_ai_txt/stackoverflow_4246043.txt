how can I reset all css of all elements in a div without external css file?

I have a widget which is injecting a popup into different web sites, as an absolute positioned div. I want the popup to look the same on all. however, the paragraphs and other html elements inside the div are effected by the hosting site CSS. Is there a way to reset all the properties of elements in the div in an efficient way without a css file which will have to consider all the options and element types? Note: I need a clean javascript/css/html solution, Cant assume jQUery is available.
