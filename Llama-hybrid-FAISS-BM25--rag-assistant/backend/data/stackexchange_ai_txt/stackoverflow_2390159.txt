Character encoding problem

I was recently editing a Unicode-encoded text file that also includes Thai characters (alongside "normal" characters). For some reason, after each sequence of Thai characters, a new line appeared. After some mucking around with C, trying to remove all newline characters, I fired up vim to inspect the file. Apparently, after each Thai character sequence, there appears a "^M" string (without quotes). Why is this happening, and what's that "^M"? I've found that I can fix the problem by removing the last three characters from the Thai string, but there surely must be a more elegant way to fix this ...
