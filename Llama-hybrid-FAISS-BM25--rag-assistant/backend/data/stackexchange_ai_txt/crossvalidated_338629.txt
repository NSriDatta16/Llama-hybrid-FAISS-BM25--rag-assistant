If you need just one number, then I suggest taking the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. This is also an explained variance of the first principal component in PCA. It tells you how much of the total variance can be explained if you reduce the dimensionality of your vector to one. See this answer on math SE. The idea's that you collapse your vector into a single dimension by combining all variables linearly into one series, ending up with a 1d problem. The explained variance can be reported in terms of a percentage of the total variance. In this case you'll immediately see if there is a lot of linear correlation between series. In some applications this number can be 80% and higher, e.g. interest rate curve modeling in finance. Meaning that you can construct a linear combination of variables that explains 80% of variance of all variables.
