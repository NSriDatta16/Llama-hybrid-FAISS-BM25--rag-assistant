If you have a room full of capable developers, what can be done to encourage those developers to become excited and enthusiastic about software and software development The correct question is actually "What can be done to encourage those developers to become excited and enthusiastic about software and software development in our company ". It's quite simple actually. The answer has never been a secret. It's just nobody listens to it. Very simply elements: Let those enthusiastic developers work among other passionate people. Remove those who don't care from the team. Otherwise they will act like diseased cells proliferating apathy and depression to the other team members. Aspire to develop a quality and professional product Establish a professional and effective process Trust and respect people. Value their knowledge. Respect their opinions. Actually, it's part of a bigger strategy: let your developers be able to make a difference and let them see they can really influence and change things. Let them grow professionally and let them see this growth is appreciated and needed by you Now what doesn't help at all. Pay them badly. Developers are also humans (for the most part) and they also have their bills to pay. Reject their initiatives, proposals and improvement suggestions. Tell them each time they come up with something that their attempt to introduce change make them a foreign und unwelcome element in the company. Have low quality product and have no interest to make it better. Hacks, copy/paste code, accumulating technical debts, things falling apart after each release, that does not motivate developers. Have badly run development and chaotic process. Tasks, projects and small decisions taking a new vector every few days will finally remove desire to be involved from anybody. Failing schedules because of unpredicted work load and feature set, they all go down the road. It will suffice to run out of coffee some day for some of them to start moving elsewhere. Have a boring and uninteresting social environment. Developers having nobody to talk to to share their interests will finally feel dull. Not everyone is interested in taxes, football and kindergarten issues as the only topics on social gatherings.
