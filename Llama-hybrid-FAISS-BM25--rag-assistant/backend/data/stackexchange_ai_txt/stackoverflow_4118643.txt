PHP: Using a string table / resource table for changing brand and i18n

It's common on many platforms to, instead of embedding strings directly in the code, make a resource table or string table, which lists all the messages, and have the code reference them. This makes it easy to translate the app, or have a non-developer change the message wording. What's the recommended way to do this in PHP? Are there any good, simple standard solutions, or is it role-your-own? A simple table is easy - my concern is that the PHP files I have use PHP, HTML, and JavaScript all together, and it's not always easy to know where you are...
