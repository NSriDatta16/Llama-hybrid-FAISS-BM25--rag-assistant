Does there exist any android api that returns mediafile bitrate, framerate etc?

I'm trying to build an android app which generates media file statistics e.g. bitrate for audio & bitrate, frame rate, codec information etc for video. I have been able to create playlist based on the files available on external storage on mobile device and play them using MediaPlayer apis. But I haven't found any api so far which lets you extract the above mentioned information from the media files. I checked AudioTrack class but it doesn't serves the purpose. It will be absolutely great if some one can share some insights on this.
