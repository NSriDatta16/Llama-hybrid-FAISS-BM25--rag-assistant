Neural networks are not a kernel, they are a learning algorithm. Plenty of kernel functions exist, such as: sigmoid, popular in the early days of kernel methods due to their influence in neural networks; not really used heavily now Tanimoto/Jaccard/diffusion, popular for binary features tree/graph kernels, popular in natural language processing histogram kernel, popular in image processing -- essentially it's a very fast approximation to the RBF kernel The right kernel depends very much on the nature of the data. Often the best kernel is a custom-made one, particularly in bioinformatics. The Gaussian/RBF and linear kernels are by far the most popular ones, followed by the polynomial one.
