This isn't an answer so much as a lengthy comment. I will edit as I get more information. Because you're modelling an exponential phenomenon, you can do linear regression on the log outcomes. This allows you to leverage the rich theory of linear regression. In OLS, the variability of the coefficients is given by $$ \operatorname{Var}\left(\hat{\beta}_{j}\right)=\frac{\sigma_{y \mid \mathbf{x}}^{2}}{(n-1) \sigma_{x_{j}}^{2}} $$ Here $\sigma_{x_{j}}^{2}$ is the sample variance of the predictor (in your case, time), $n$ is the sample size, and $\sigma_{y \mid \mathbf{x}}^{2}$ is the noise in the outcome. There are then 3 ways to increase precision: Use an outcome with lower noise Increase your sample size Use a more spread out predictor. It sounds like all three are out of the question, am I right? You only have about a half hours worth of data to train any model? Can you sample as frequently as you like?
