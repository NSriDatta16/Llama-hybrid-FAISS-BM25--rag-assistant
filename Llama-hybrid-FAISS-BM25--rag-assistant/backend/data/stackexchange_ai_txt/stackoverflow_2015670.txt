Can you give some example output? I think this usually happens when using Collections. Without seeing the output, my best guess is that you need to register aliases: xstream.alias("blog", Blog.class); See http://x-stream.github.io/alias-tutorial.html for more in-depth coverage. Again, paste in some sample output.
