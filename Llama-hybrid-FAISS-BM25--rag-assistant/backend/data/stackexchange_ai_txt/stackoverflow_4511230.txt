Use jQuery to write width and height attributes to image tags

Hey folks, I have a page that has a long list of images. These images do not include either the width or height attributes. Unfortunately I don't have the ability to change how the images are coded in the HTML. The issue is, I am linking to various parts of the page using anchors from other pages. When the page loads it jumps down to that anchor. However, because the browser is not able to correctly determine the height of the images the anchor jumps down further and further as the images start filling in. So, I was thinking, can jQuery determine the height of the images and append the width and height of the images on all image tags in a specific div? Or, is there a more elegant solution to this issue? Let me know your thoughts!
