I would argue that it's the other way 'round - unit tests are preferable to programming by contract constructs. I say that because PoC checks are often expressed as asserts that can be turned off at will in production. (Even Eiffel, Bertrand Meyers' language that has built-in support for PoC, recommends turning them off in production.) I'd rather have a complete suite of unit tests that test "happy path", exceptional, and edge conditions. They're useful when refactoring in a way that PoC is not.
