I will agree with Remou's response, with one small edification. Crate a new form, and drag all of the fields from the relevant query or table onto this form. Alternatively, you can drag them from the field chooser if the form has already been bound. Then, create your combo-box, and choose "Find a record on my form based on the value I select in my combobox" from the wizard options.
