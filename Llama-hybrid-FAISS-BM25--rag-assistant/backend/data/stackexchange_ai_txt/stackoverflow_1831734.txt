iPhone Web App disable cache

I have built an iPhone webapp using PHP. The main (and only) page includes the apple-mobile-web-app-capable and apple-touch-fullscreen meta tags so that it can run fullscreen once added to the homescreen. However, it seems every time I launch the app from the homescreen, the cache version of the page is used instead of refreshing the page (and of course, I need the page to be updated on startup, and cannot use Ajax here - need to dynamically authenticate the user with SSO phpCAS). I did not use any manifest file and tried adding meta tags about cache without success. Does anybody know how to fix this? Thanks
