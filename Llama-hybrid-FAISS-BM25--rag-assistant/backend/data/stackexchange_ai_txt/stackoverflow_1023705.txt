You may try changing the action attribute of your form using JavaScript, just before form submission. Unfortunately, most browsers do not support POST redirection. Even RFC notes : RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request. However, most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client. So, IMHO, the choices are limited to either JavaScript action modification or re-POSTing data from your server (your server accepts the POSTed data, analyzes it and performs POST by itself). Storing data in session (or just returning it on POST) and then re-POSTing it from the client requires either JavaScript support (to automatically submit the form) or making user click "submit" button one more time. You may consider using this method as a fallback, though. Make default action point to your fallback script. If you succeeded to modify action before submission — everything is okay at this point. If something failed, like in case JavaScript being disabled — make your fallback script output page with a hidden data field (so it should not be modified anymore) and visible submit button, POSTing data to a proper location.
