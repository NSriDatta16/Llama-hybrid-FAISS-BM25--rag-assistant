dotnetnuke event logging - Synchronous? Potential speed issues?

I'd like to leverage the DotNetNuke logging system (both Event Logging and Exception Logging). However, I'm concerned about potential performance issues if we begin logging too many Events. Does the logging system write events to the database asynchronously? If not, is there an efficient way to make this happen? I'd hate to make an end-user wait on several database writes just to view a page. Thanks
