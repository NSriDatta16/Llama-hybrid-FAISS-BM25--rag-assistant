Is frequentist statistics concerned with expectation?

Frequentist statistics sees probability as the expectation of the value. Expectation is the long-term average. Do Frequentists interpret probability as the expected value for that parameter? EDIT: From what I understand, Frequentists interpret probability as the long-run average of this value. Well, isn't that what the expectation is? Okay - frequentists interpret probability as the expectation for that value. QED right?
