Re-hosted workflow designer - read-only view

I have re-hosted the workflow designer in my own application. Now I want to make the workflow view read-only. I know I can disallow drag&drop but delete and move should also be disabled. I still want the user to be able to scroll in the view. Can anyone help. Best regards, Michael
