Some linear algebra should be enough : Write the average squared difference between inputs and outputs ( the sum of the squares of each difference between each input and output value ). I assume this as definition of "best approximate" This is a quadratic function of your 9 unknown matrix coefficients. To minimize it, derive it with respect to each of them. You will get a linear system of 9 equations you have to solve to get the solution ( unique or a space variety depending on the input set ) When the difference function is not quadratic, you can do the same but you have to use an iterative method to solve the equation system.
