Being in a startup, you don't have the liberty to make many mistakes and loose time in experimentation. My advise would be to focus on the following aspects: Time to Production is utmost: Don't wait to be perfect, Implement something that starts delivering value for your customers at an early stage. Shorter iterations and early feedback while in development phase. keep improving and be in constant touch with your stake holders. Other Skills: Software Development, Data Engineering, ML-Ops and Cloud support : Sooner you realize the importance, good for your growth in medium to longer term. Keep in mind, great DS people are rarely good production level software developers. You need to create team around the value producing part of your startup. Documentation: Version control, scientific framework and onboarding: Helps you with both reproducibility, collaboration, workflow management and quickly bring new members up to speed. All the very best!
