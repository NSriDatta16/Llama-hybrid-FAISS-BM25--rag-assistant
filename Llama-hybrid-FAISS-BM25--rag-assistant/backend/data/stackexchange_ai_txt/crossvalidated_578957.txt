What does capital D above an equal sign mean?

I was beginning to self study time series and came across this notation: $\stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=}$ . I wonder what it means? (I have limited access to the textbooks for the moment, so I have to post a question here.) For more context, it was in the definition for a strongly stationary sequence, where the article states the condition for such a sequence being $(X_{t_1},...,X_{t_k})\stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=}(X_{t_1+h},...,X_{t_k+h})$ for all $\{t_1,...,t_k\}$ and $h$ .
