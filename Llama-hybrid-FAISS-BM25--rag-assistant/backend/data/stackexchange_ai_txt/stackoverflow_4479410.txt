There are several possible causes: (which apply to any memory manager) your main program loop leaks memory, but does so to something that is freed on shutdown the simplest case is logging to a memo. The memo gets bigger and bigger, but is destroyed on shutdown. the memory is allocated outside fastmm's control directly allocating from windows memory allocated in dlls etc. Heapfragmentation. A memory manager keeps large blocks allocated (e.g. because it still contains a small % of allocations). Result: The app doesn't use it, but it is not release to the OS either. The runtime/memorymanager keeps it around. fastmm should be more resilient against this phenomena, but in doubt try to print heapmanager info to see if this is the case.
