Determining line orientation using vertex shaders

I want to be able to calculate the direction of a line to eye coordinates and store this value for every pixel on the line using a vertex and fragment shader. My idea was to calculate the direction gradient using atan2(Gy/Gx) after a modelview tranformation for each pair of vertices then quantize this value as a color intensity to pass to a fragment shader. How can I get access to the positions of pairs of vertices to achieve this or is there another method I should use? Thanks
