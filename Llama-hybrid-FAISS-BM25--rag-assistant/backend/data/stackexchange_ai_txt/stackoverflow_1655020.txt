If it's using reflection, it's probably a really bad idea. Leaving that aside, I believe you can additional inner classes at runtime, so it doesn't make sense to list classes that may not have been thought of yet. Listing currently loaded classes would, I guess, require going through Java agents or similar. Anonymous inner classes have made up names, an enclosing method and additional synthetic fields for copying external local variables that have been copied. One class is pretty much the same as another at runtime. Remember that 1.1 introduced inner classes, but class files have barely changed since 1.0.
