I have used an ANOVA on proportions, for example, when measuring the proportion of daily activity spent doing a particular activity(primate behavior). I did not have binary data, however, but had time in activity divided the total time observed on a particular day. As such, I had a proportions for each day and for each animal. Since the proportions were close to being normally distributed and variances did not differ substantially, I used an ANOVA. In your case, it sounds like you have a binary response from which the mean is the proportion of successes. In this case, I would consider a logistic regression with a Bernoulli distribution. For this model, since you have a categorical predictor with 12 levels, you'll have to pick a level to be the reference catergory. All levels will be compared to the reference category. In case I am reading your question wrong, can you post an example of what your data looks like?
