The more lightweight approach is to add sublayers to your UIView's layer. Use hitTest: to dispatch touches you receive on you UIView to the CALayer instance that needs to receive it. If you need more of the UIResponder behavior (touchesBegan etc.), you might want to go with subviews instead of sublayers as that would allow you to handle the events directly in the objects rather than having to dispatch them from a central responder (your main UIView). Consequently, the essential bit may be just how much of the behavior associated with your individual buttons should be known (handled) by the your main UIView. If it makes sense to have everything controlled from a central place, you can put all the logic in the UIView and just use sublayers for lightweight display purposes. If it makes more sense to put the behavior into the buttons themselves, they shoudl be UIResponders and as such subclass UIView and be added as subviews of your main view.
