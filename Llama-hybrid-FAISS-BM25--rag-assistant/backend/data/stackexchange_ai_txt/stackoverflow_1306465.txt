From the sounds of this, it would be a one-time operation. I strongly discourage the actual process of loading the entire setup into memory, that just does not seem like an efficient method of doing this at all. Also, depending on your needs, you might be able to extract directly from Access -> XML if that is your true end game. Regardless, with a database that small, doing them one at a time, with a few specifically written queries in my opinion would be easier to manage, faster to write, and less error prone.
