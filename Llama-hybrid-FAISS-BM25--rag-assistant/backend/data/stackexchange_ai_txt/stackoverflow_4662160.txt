WebSphere Integrational Developer / Eclipse Console Bug

I'm working with WebSphere Integration Developer v6.2 (actually it is an Eclipse with a huge plugin). Once I had a mistake in my program and a big stacktrace was typed to the console. So that, I clicked the right button of a mouse and chose the Clear... menu item. It is where the problem began. Now the console is often empty except the situations when I use SVN. Restarting, rebooting and deleting temp files chandged nothing. If somebody knows the solution (except reinstalling =) ), please, help me!!!
