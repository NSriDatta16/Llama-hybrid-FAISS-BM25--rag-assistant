For my own part, this is quite possibly one of the most annoying designs in existence. Scrolling the EULA is not the same as reading it - if you want to really be sure they read it, you'll have to quiz them on the content. One question on the content of each paragraph should do it, with four multiple-choice answers for each... :-) They're either going to read the EULA, or not. Making them scroll is not going to change that.
