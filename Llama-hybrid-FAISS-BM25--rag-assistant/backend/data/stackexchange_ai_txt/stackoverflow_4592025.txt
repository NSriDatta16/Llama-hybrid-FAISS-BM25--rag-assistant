The Delphi integrated debugger is powerful enough, even in Delphi 7, to handle most debugging tasks. It can also debug an application remotely. Anyway, there are situations where you may need to track different kind of issue: To check for memory leaks, you can switch to a memory manager like FastMM4 which has good memory leak reporting. Profilers like AQTime have also memory allocation profilers to identify such kind of issues. To investigate performance problems, you need a performance profiler. There are sampling profilers (less invasive, although may be less precise) and standard profilers (AQTime again, not cheap but very good, and others). To trace exception, especially on deployed applications, you may need tools like JCL/JVCL (free), MadExcept or EurekaLog or SmartInspect To obtain a log of what the application does, you can use OutputDebugString() and the IDE event viewer, or the DebugView standalone application. There are also dedicated tools like SmartInspect. You can also convert Delphi 7 .map files to .dbg files and use an external debugger as the WinSDK WinDbg, and look at application calls in tools like ProcessExplorer Some debugging tools may also offer features like code coverage checks (which code was actually executed, and which was never), platform compliance (check API calls are supported by a given platform), resources use and so on, but may be useful for larger developments.
