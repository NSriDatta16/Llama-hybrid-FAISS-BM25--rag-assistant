What do you exactly mean by "static metaprogramming"? Yes, C++ template metaprogramming is impossible in Java, but it offers other methods, much more powerful than those from C++: reflection aspect-oriented programming (@AspectJ) bytecode manipulation (Javassist, ObjectWeb ASM, Java agents) code generation (Annotation Processing Tool, template engines like Velocity) Abstract Syntax Tree manipulations (APIs provided by popular IDEs) possibility to run Java compiler and use compiled code even at runtime There's no best method: each of those methods has its strengths and weaknesses. Due to flexibility of JVM, all of those methods in Java can be used both at compilation time and runtime.
