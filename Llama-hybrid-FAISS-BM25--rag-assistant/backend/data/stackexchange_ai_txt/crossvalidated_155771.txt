How to compare performance of regression and classification?

I built a linear regression model and evaluated it with respect to R-Squared and RMSE (the latter cross-validated). Then, I built a logistic regression classifier on the same data. It answers the same question, but discretized of course. I wanted to test whether this simplification of the problem increased prediction quality. The classifier is evaluated with respect to accuracy (cross-validated). How do I compare the performance of the two models? Can I simply compare the ratios $1-RMSE/RMSE_{baseline}$ and $Acc/Acc_{baseline}-1$. That feels kind of wrong, though.
