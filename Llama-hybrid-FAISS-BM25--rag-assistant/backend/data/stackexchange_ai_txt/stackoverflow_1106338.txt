Out of curiosity, you might check to see if that computer has a lower value set for dom.max_script_runtime than the others. Not that this should ever need to be set really high, but if it's set really low for some reason on that machine it could cause this inconsistent behavior. I can't imagine this has anything to do with Ext. How much data is getting loaded into the grid? Although I disagree that the Ext grid is a "bad piece of engineering" (sigh), it is known to bog down page rendering when used with large data sets and/or large column sets. Unfortunately, sometimes tradeoffs need to be made between performance and functionality in the world of JavaScript rich widgets. The Ext grid supports drag/drop columns, customizable nested row layouts, the ability to fit seamlessly into Ext layouts, etc. Supporting all of this in today's browsers is not always simple or quick (although Chrome gives me hope for the future :)
