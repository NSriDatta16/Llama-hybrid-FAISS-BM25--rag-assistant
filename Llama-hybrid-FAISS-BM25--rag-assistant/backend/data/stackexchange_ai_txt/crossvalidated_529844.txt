On the one hand, you can forecast each series separately. There is little you can do for time series with only ten observations. You can try the historical mean, or the historical median, or use the last historical observation as a forecast. No special tools or libraries are necessary. See Best method for short time-series . On the other hand, you may be able to do some kind of cross-learning, so you can learn from the other 599 individuals when you forecast individual #600. There are a number of ways of doing this, e.g., fitting a mixed linear model or possibly setting up an appropriate neural network (although 10 observations each on 600 individuals is again not a lot of data for a neural network). You would need to provide more information about your specific use case.
