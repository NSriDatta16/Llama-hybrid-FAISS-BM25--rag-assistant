correct type of statistical correlation test for aggregated dataset

I was wondering if you can suggest a statistical test that can be applied to this sort of dataset. I am staying away from machine learning techniques as the dataset is small, and due to the aggregated data values might not benefit for ML techniques I have users, list of stores a users visits and number of items he buys from that store, and total number of returns for that user. The problem would be much easier if I knew which items the user return to which stores but unfortunately I don't have that information, I only know the total number of items returned by the user. This is what the data looks like. userID items bought at store A items bought at store B items bought at store C total items returned UserA 10 5 3 6 UserB 15 4 4 8 I understand that this is not the best / most accurate data, and there might not be a suitable test, but can we infer something about the stores, and the total items returned by the user in a case like this? If we assume a return rate per store, like 20%, can we say that for user A 2 items were returned for store A, 1 for store B, and so on? Thank you
