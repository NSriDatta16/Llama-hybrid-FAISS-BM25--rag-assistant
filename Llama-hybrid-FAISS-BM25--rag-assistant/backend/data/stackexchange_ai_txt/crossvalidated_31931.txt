Kedem and Fokianos in their book "Regression Models for Time Series Analysis" have a whole chapter (Chapter 2) on binary time series models with many examples of plotted series and periodograms. In response to whuber's request I am adding some description of the plots in the chapter. page 63 Fig 2.3 This figure is in the section on logistic autoregression. A model for a logistic autoregression with a sinusoidal component is give by the formula Logit(πt(β))= β1 + β2 cos(2πt/12) + β3 Yt-1 They plot Yt with the time series plotted below it where the particular function is Logit(πt(β))= 0.3 + 0.75 cos(2πt/12) + Yt-1 fig 2.4 page 62 is similar but for a different series fig 2.5 shows sample autocorrelation for 4 such logistic autoregressions with sinusoidal components. fig 2.9 page 70 plots level of percipitation at Mount Washington NH over 107 day period with the binary time series Yt (rain yes or no). fig 2.14 (looking at logistic models for sleep data Yt awake vs asleep) figure provides cumulative periodogram for raw residuals from a model and Pearson residulas from the model. fig 2.15 shows observed series for logistic model for sleep data with model prediction of the series below it.
