I think, you need to look carefully through popular ranking algorithms. I would suggest to start from Elo , at a glance, it could help you to solve the problem. I worked only with "classical" "1-vs.-1" version. But here are some thoughts on your case. Consider every bundle as a team of two players; every customer's choice as a duel. The main issue here would be the "teams randomness", as you have no constant team compositions. But you can try to solve it, using average ratings of team members. With the large number of duels and "teams" you will get enough data to predict the outcome for brand new mixtures of fruits.
