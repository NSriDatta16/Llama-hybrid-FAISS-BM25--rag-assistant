I came from a Java background to Ruby to. I found this tutorial helpful http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/to-ruby-from-java/ . When it comes to learning rails I cannot say how much I use script\console. It allows you to play with the code and learn how to do things that you are not sure about. The only book I ever bought was Agile Web Development with Rails, Third Edition http://www.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition . It was quite useful and provided a good overview of the Rails framework. In addition to that I regular watch Railscasts( http://railscasts.com ), which is a great screen casting blog that covers all kinds of Rails topics. I personally prefer using Linux (because git works better). But, I have also used windows and besides git I do not think the OS choice will impact your programming. I use netbeans for my IDE and occasionally vim (with the rails plugin). I like netbeans but, I find that it can still be a little flaky when it comes to the Rails support (not all the features work all the time).
