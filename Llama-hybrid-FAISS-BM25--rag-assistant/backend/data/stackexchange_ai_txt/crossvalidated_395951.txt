Next to what Kjetil says, hypothesis testing is a form of statistical inference , i.e., you do not only describe a sample, but try to draw inferences about features of an underlying population. E.g., a sample average may tell you that average height in a dataset of men is 181 cm, which is a descriptive statistic. You summarize the dataset and in so doing do not remember or report each data point. You might use that sample average to test the hypothesis that the true mean height of men in the population from which you consider the sample to be drawn (what that is will depend on the problem - e.g., the height of all European men, all European male basketball players, etc.) is, say, at most $\mu=180$ cm. Example: > x mean(x) # sample mean will be some value likely somewhat close to but different from 0 [1] 0.2188956 > t.test(x) # performs a test of whether mu=0 vs. that it is not. A rejection of the null would be a type-I error One Sample t-test data: x t = 0.60125, df = 9, p-value = 0.5625 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.6046832 1.0424744 sample estimates: mean of x 0.2188956
