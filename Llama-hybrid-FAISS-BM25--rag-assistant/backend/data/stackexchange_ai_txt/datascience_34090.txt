There are many options, and the choice is driven by the domain at hand. That been said, without any prior knowledge or preferences, I think that the default choice is python . Python has a strong ecosystem and many open-source libraries you can leverage. There are considerations for other options, like Scala/Java as it has a strong Machine Learning community as well as big-data technologies (For example - Apache Spark, Apache Kafka). While it's arguable how well python is suited for building large scale applications, it becomes much simpler with Java world. In each of these choices, you can still use R as you can execute R code from within Java/Python (for example using Spark).
