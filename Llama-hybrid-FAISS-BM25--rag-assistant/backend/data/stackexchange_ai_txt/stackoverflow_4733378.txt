Disable annotation processing, but enable web-fragments feature in servlet api 3.0 (Tomcat7)

I am giving a try on Tomcat 7.0 and Servlet API 3.0. I had an application for Servlet API 2.5. So I edited web.xml to configure it for Servlet API 3.0. After the change the start time of Tomcat increased by 14 seconds. So I set and the start time of Tomcat got back to normal, because tomcat does not scan every class for annotations. This is good, but web-fragment.xml feature is also disabled by this. I wonder if it possible to disable annotation scanning of Tomcat, but to enable processing of web-fragment.xml.
