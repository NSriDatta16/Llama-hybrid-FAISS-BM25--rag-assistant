Based solely on the fact that you want to offer BAs the possibility to dynamically update the coverage rules, it seems that Drools would offer you a big head start. Regarding performance, it seems very unlikely to me that the performance would be an issue, as you're talking about a small number of facts and rules really. Biggest performance penalty is usually the parsing of the rules, which can be done on start-up and cached/shared afterward.
