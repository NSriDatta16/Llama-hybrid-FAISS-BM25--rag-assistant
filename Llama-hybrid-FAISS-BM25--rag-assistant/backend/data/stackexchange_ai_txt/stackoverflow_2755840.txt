Does Watir work under ruby 1.9.1?

Here is the .rb program: require 'watir' b = Watir::Browser.new the 2nd line will trigger a ""The program can't start because msvcrt-ruby18.dll is missing from your computer!" error. I am using 1.9.1p378 on win32 ruby 1.9.1p378 (2010-01-10 revision 26273) [i386-mingw32] How can I fix this? Thanks for your attention.
