Exactly right. Session data is kept in-memory until the end of the request (or until session_write_close() is called). The contents of $_SESSION are then written to the configured storage mechanism. On the next request, when session_start() happens, the data are loaded from storage to $_SESSION, where they stay, until the request is finished. Otherwise, PHP would be reading/writing to the database (in your case) every time you touched anything in session.
