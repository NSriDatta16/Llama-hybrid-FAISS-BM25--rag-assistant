What is the probability of rejection in rejection sampling?

Context: I'm reading up on sampling in MCMC for Machine Learning . On page 5, it mentions rejection sampling: repeat sample xi ~ q(x) and u ~ U(0,1) if uMq(xi) (where $M$ is chosen such that $p(x) \le Mq(x)$ for all $x$) Question: In the analysis, the paper says that it may work bad for high-dimensional settings. While I can see that, the paper gives a reason that I don't understand: $P(x \text{ accepted}) = P \left(u
