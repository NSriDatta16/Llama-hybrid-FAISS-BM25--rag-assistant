For regression trees, there is some recent work that allows to include random intercepts, especially for dealing with clustered data. See e.g.: Hajjem A, Bellavance F, Larocque D (2011). "Mixed Effects Regression Trees for Clustered Data." Statistics & Probability Letters , 81 (4), 451-459. Sela R, Simonoff J (2012). "RE-EM Trees: A Data Mining Approach for Longitudinal and Clustered Data." Machine Learning , 86 (2), 169-207.
