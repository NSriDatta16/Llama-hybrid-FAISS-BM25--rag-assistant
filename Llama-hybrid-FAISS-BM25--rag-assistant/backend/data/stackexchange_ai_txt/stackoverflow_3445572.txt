Customer credit, at least as you envision it here, isn't really the best fit for EE. Its credit system is based on issuing store credit for refunds, and doesn't stand alone well as the sole payment type. As to your questions, the first should be possible with little or no modification to the code. As you said, turn off user registration to prevent users from signing themselves up. If you want to keep the catalog a secret, you may need to add a little code to redirect all unauthenticated requests back to the homepage or a login page. I don't have specific experience with the plugin you mentioned, but adding new payment types is one of the better thought out systems in Magento, so if it doesn't work you can code a new one in a reasonable amount of time. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
