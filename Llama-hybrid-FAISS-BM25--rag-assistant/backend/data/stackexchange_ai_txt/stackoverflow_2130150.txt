What are the factors to consider when choosing between interfaces and abstract classes?

When designing my software, I began with interfaces since this seems to be the "standard". Then I switched to abstract classes because they seem better suited to the problem at hand. However I'm not sure if I've missed out on some considerations when making this design choice. Other than domain specific issues which I have thought about what are the more general factors to consider when choosing between interfaces and abstracts classes?
