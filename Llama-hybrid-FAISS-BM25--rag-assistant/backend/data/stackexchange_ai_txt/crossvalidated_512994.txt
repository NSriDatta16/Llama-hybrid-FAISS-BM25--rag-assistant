How do I properly weight an uneven (spacing) distribution of the numbers?

I have a set of numbers (depths actually) and I need to take the mean of another variable over these depths. For example, take the mean of temperature over a range of depths, however these depths are not evenly spaced. How should I weight them properly to make sure I am keeping into account the uneven spacing of the numbers before taking the average of temperature over these range of depths? The numbers are: 5.02159 , 15.07854 , 25.16046 , 35.27829 , 45.44776 , 55.691494, 66.041985, 76.54591 , 87.27029 , 98.31118 , 109.806175, 121.9519 , 135.02855 , 149.43373 , 165.72845 , 184.69746 , 207.42545 The first 6 values have an approximate difference of ~10, but how would I take into account the spacing difference between 207.42545 and 184.69746 where the difference is ~28.
