How is the sigma^2 value (or MSE) for the link function computed in logistic regression in R?

For example, if you have a logistic regression on certain dataset: fit If you do predict(fit, newdata, type = "link", se = TRUE) , you will get a column named se.fit , which is the standard error for each predicted y value. My questions are: How is the MSE value for the link function is computed here? The variance of the fitting coefficients are basically the MSE times the variance-covariance matrix, there should be a way to compute the MSE value first. But for response variables that have 0 and 1 values, the link function corresponds to 0 and infinity. In this case, how does the model compute this value? Is there any way I can get the MSE value for the glm fitting in R? Is se.fit the standard error for the link function value of the fitted line at point x0 , or the standard error for the predicted link function value of y at point x0 ?
