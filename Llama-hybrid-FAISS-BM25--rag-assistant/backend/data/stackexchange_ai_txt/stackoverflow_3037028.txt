Azure storage - double decimal point ignored on save

I have a value that is correctly stored in a property of an object, but when I save the changes to the Azure storage database, the double value is stored to the database ignoring the point (7.11000000003 is saved as 711). Also, the property is changed to 711.0. How do I solve this problem? The field is already set to double in the class and the database table.
