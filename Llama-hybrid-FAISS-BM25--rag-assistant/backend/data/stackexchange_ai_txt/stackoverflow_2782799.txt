where are the frameworks for creating libraries?

Whenever I create a PHP library (not a framework) I tend to reinvent everything every time. "Where to put configuration options?" "Which design pattern to use here?" "How should all the classes extend each other?" and so on... Then I think, isn't there a good library framework to use anywhere? It's like a framework for a web application (symfony, cakephp...) but instead of creating a web application, this framework will help coder to create a library, providing all the standard structure and classes (observer pattern, dependency injection etc). I think that will be the next major thing if not available right now. In this way there will be a standard to follow when creating libraries, or else, it's like a jungle when everyone creates their own structure, and a lot of coders just code without thinking of reusability etc. There isn't any framework for creating libraries at the moment? If not, don't you agree with me that this is the way to do it, with a library framework? Because I am really throwing a lot of time (weeks!) just thinking about how to organize things, both in code and file level, when I should just start to code the logic. Share your thoughts!
