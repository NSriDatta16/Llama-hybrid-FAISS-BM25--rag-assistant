Eclipse syntax highlighting preferences save and restore

I spend some time customizing the colors for syntax highlighting in Eclipse (Java, JSP, HTML, CSS, etc.) but whenever I try to export these settings via File|Export|General|Preferences and reimport them, the settings never completely get imported back. Some colors are restored and others are left unchanged, leaving me in an 'in between' state - very frustrating. I'm using Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede, by the way. Has anyone found a reliable way to save and restore Eclipse syntax highlighting settings?
