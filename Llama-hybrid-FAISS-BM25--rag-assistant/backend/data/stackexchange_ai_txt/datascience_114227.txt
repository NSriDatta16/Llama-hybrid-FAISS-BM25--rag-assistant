Encoder Decoder model for parameter extraction from text input

I have an input as text from which I want to extract parameters as given in example below. Input: "client need to pay penalty of 10% of amount if there is delay in project for more than 3 months" and output: penalty = 10% and delay = 3 assuming there are N number of such parameters. Here I have thought of using encoder and decoder model . Where I use RNN as encoder for text input Now I wonder what would be decoder architecture that will output N parameters and their values. what is alternative architecture to solve this problem. Thanks in advance
