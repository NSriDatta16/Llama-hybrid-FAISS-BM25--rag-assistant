What you are looking for is commonly dubbed Sentiment Analysis . Typically, sentiment analysis is not able to handle delicate subtleties, like sarcasm or irony, but it fares pretty well if you throw a large set of data at it. Sentiment analysis usually needs quite a bit of pre-processing. At least tokenization, sentence boundary detection and part-of-speech tagging. Sometimes, syntactic parsing can be important. Doing it properly is an entire branch of research in computational linguistics, and I wouldn't advise you with coming up with your own solution unless you take your time to study the field first. OpenNLP has some tools to aid sentiment analysis, but if you want something more serious, you should look into the LingPipe toolkit. It has some built-in SA-functionality and a nice tutorial . And you can train it on your own set of data, but don't think that it is entirely trivial :-). Googling for the term will probably also give you some resources to work with. If you have any more specific question, just ask, I'm watching the nlp-tag closely ;-)
