as Stephen pointed out, gradient descent is mainly an optimization algorithm used as part of many (I would say most of, and its variances as adam) machine learning modelling use cases. Nevertheless, it is good to try to understand it first by applying it to a linear regression model as you asked for. You can take a look at an explanation from scratch in this post: https://medium.com/@German_CM/real-use-case-with-regression-supervised-learning-a3cb69a3ec0d You can also use the scikit learn linear model library , in this case both SGDRegressor and LinearRegression (the classic Ordinary Least Squares) can be used.
