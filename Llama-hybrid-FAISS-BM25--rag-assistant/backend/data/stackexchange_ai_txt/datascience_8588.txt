You can get a reasonably good approximation of steps for exploratory data analysis (EDA) by reviewing the EDA section of the NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook . Additionally, you might find helpful parts of my related answer here on Data Science SE . Methods, related to EDA, are too diverse that it is not feasible to discuss them in a single answer. I will just mention several approaches. If you are interested in applying classification to your data set, you might find information, mentioned in my other answer helpful. In order to detect structures in a data set, you can try to apply principal component analysis (PCA) . If, on the other hand, you are interested in exploring latent structures in data, consider using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) .
