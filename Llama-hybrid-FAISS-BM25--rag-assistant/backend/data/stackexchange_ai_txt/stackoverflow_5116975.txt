If the code for getters and setters is generated, I would assume it is correct. This is a major drawback of not having properties at language level - you have a lot of generated code that is checked-in into source control and should be tested because it screams red in coverage reports. On the other hand, even a simple getter might be incorrect, for instance due to C&P error: private String foo; private String bar; String getFoo() {return foo;} String getBar() {return foor;} My final thought: getters and setters are implicitly tested when appropriate logic using them is tested. Setter not covered in tests? - probably you are never setting this field and it might be final? Only setter but no getter called? - useless field?
