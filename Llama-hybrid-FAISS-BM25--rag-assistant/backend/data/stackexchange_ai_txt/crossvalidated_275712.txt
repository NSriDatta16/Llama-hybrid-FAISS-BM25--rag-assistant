Machine learning algorithms "from the book"

The prolific combinatorialist Paul Erd≈ës used to say that God keeps the most elegant proof of each theorem in "The Book". This inspired the following attempt to capture what some of the book might look like. Currently I'm getting into machine learning, and I was wondering what people think would be the most elegant algorithms and proofs in this area that one should absolutely know (if for noting else than for their pure aesthetic appeal)? All sorts of suggestions are welcome, both classical results and cutting-edge concepts (though for the latter it may be tricky to evaluate their eventual relevance at this point).
