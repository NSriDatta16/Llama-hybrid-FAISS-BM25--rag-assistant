No, data->mono_channel and *mono_channel are not the same thing. *(data->mono_channel) is the same as *mono_channel. I really wonder how you got by with *mono_channel in your program if you wanted to pass a pointer to a double instead of a double. Clearly mono_channel was a pointer to a pointer to a vector of doubles. Most likely mono_channel was a pointer to an array (which is actually a vector) of doubles. double *mono_channel[1000]; // let's say Anyway, if you're crashing, it's probably because you haven't allocated any storage and pointed mono_channel to it, instead you've just defined it as a member of your struct that is a double * and are using it. You either need to point mono_channel to a predefined global array or allocate it with malloc/new.
