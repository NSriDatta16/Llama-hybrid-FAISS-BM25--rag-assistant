Foreign key name in DataMapper associations

I'm currently working on a new app based around an existing database, making use of DataMapper for the data access. However, its conventions when dealing with foreign keys are not what the database uses. Example: class Invoice include DataMapper::Resource storage_names[:default] = 'invoices' property :id, Serial # ... more properties ... has n, :items end class Item include DataMapper::Resource storage_names[:default] = 'invoiceItems' property :id, Serial # ... more properties ... belongs_to :invoice # this should use 'invoiceId' instead of 'invoice_id' end Is there any way I can get the foreign key used by DataMapper to be 'invoiceId' rather than the 'invoice_id' it tries to use at the moment (as indicated by the comment above)? I know this can be done with normal fields by adding :field => 'fieldName' but I have found no such way for associations.
