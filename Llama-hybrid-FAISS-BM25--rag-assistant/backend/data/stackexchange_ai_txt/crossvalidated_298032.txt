Can Linear SVM be used to build a lexicon for a specific set of categories?

I want to build a lexicon for a specific set of educational set of categories. For example: Math, Medical and Economics. So I've manually collected 150 websites per category. I used the Python library Scikit-learn to implement the algorithm. I basically just followed the tutorial from scikit-learn but instead of using their data, I've used the websites that I collected. This is a supervised task so after preprocessing (removing stop words, using TfidfVectorizer), I fed it to the LinearSVC model of scikit-learn. What I realized is that LinearSVC weighted each word in the input vector for each category. Here is an example of what it looks like: So my question is, can this be considered a lexicon for Math, Medical and Economics?
