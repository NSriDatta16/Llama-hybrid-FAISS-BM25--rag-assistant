I will be brutal: I think you are on the wrong track. Your description of the problems with binning timestamped data is correct in principle. However : The timestamps themselves are imprecise, so the exact same situation could have resulted in slightly different timestamps if the caller hadn't dropped their mobile phones in the excitement. Optimizing a model to capture random fluctuations in data collection is not a good idea. Yes, binning makes a difference here. But you won't be looking at just five calls for ambulances. You will be looking at multiple years of data. (At least I hope so, because you won't be able to capture the New Year's Eve effect otherwise.) One-off effects like this are effectively noise once you look at all your data. And see below on what to do with noise. You appear unhappy that time series forecasting methods "only" give you smooth predictions. In the absence of any predictors that give you advance signals about spikes, that is precisely what they should be doing. Please take a look at the threads here. If all you know is the day of week, the hour of day, and the day of year, it makes no sense to predict a spike, because based on all this information, there is only a small difference between this hour and the same hour one week earlier or later, or the next hour, or the same hour tomorrow or yesterday - and all these differences should be captured in your model via seasonality. If you have information about an active shooter, by all means include that in your model, and that will likely give you a spike. (And you likely won't need a model for this kind of disaster response.) I would argue that if you are forecasting for ambulance service provision, you should not pay overly much attention to the mean forecast. Rather, aim for sufficiently high quantile forecasts. You will not be able to predict when there is a pileup on the local interstate (beyond including the weather, but even with the worst of weather, often enough nothing beyond fender benders happens, simply because people adjust their driving to the weather). But you can capture the probability of high ambulance demand, and plan accordingly. Quantile forecasts are especially important in highly granular time series, because these are usually intermittent, and a mean forecast of a demand for 0.3 ambulances per hour is much less useful than a quantile forecast that tells you that the demand will not exceed 3 with 90% confidence. Anyway, I do hope you account for the multiple-seasonalities involved. Here are a few ideas , and we did use ambulance demand as an example, though on much less granular levels. With your highly granular data, it may well be that the signal is so weak that modeling it makes your forecasts worse ( Kolassa, 2016, Foresight ). On how to improve forecasts, you may want to look at How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Finally, if you really do want to address the binning issue, I would recommend that you run 12 different models, where each one shifts the hourly bins by five more minutes (60/5=12), then reconcile the forecasts in a temporal aggregation framework ( Boylan & Babai, 2016 or Kourentzes et al., 2014 ). However, I reiterate that I believe this to be the wrong direction.
