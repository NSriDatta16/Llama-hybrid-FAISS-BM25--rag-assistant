Is Poisson model in R appropriate here?

I am graphing a dataset in R that is whether a customer makes an unplanned purchase which can take values from 0-infinity, against customer path length which may take only positive values. The Unplanned purchase represents the unit measure of unplanned purchases made by a customer (This is UNPCATEGORY). I have used R to model this by using the following code: fit2 Is it appropriate for me to adjust UNPCATEGORY by +1 here? I assumed it was necessary since I am using a long link. Additionally, since UNPCATEGORY can take these 0 values is it more appropriate to use a NB model? Here is my model: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.113e-01 7.362e-02 2.871 0.00409 ** PLD$PATHLEN 6.320e-04 3.643e-05 17.345
