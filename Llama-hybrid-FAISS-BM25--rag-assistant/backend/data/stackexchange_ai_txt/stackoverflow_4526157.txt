a fairly new (and popular with over 3000 downloads) Magento module is Fishpig's Magento/WordPress Integration extension that does exactly what you want. I have used it on a few client sites and have found it to be quite useful. It integrates all aspects of the WordPress blog, uses the Magento theme, supports WordPress plugins and shortcodes (although support is only limited to popular plugins) and adds extra functionality such as the ability to associated WordPress blog posts with Magento products. You can can download and easily the module from the following link (Magento Connect): http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/fishpig/extension/3958/fishpig_wordpress_integration If you are unable to use Magento Connect, I think the author provides manually download and installation instructions on their website (I can't remember the link but it will be on the Magento Connect page).
