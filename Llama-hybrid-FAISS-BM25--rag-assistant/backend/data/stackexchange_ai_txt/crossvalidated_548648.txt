Sign change in LASSO and RIDGE of coefficients

I am estimating in total three models: Logistic regression without any penalization (as benchmark model), logistic regression with L1 penalization (LASSO) and with L2 penalization (RIDGE). Now i recognize that the coefficients compared to the benchmark model sometimes flip the sign. Is this a possible effect? - Up to now I only thought they could be zero (LASSO) or go towards zero (RIDGE). Thanks.
