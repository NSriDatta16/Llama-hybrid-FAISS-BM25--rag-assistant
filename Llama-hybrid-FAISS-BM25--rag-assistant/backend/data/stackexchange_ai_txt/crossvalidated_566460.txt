Obligatory xkcd : The difference is that with system of equations you are looking for a solution , while in statistics you are trying to estimate and approximate something given the data. There is a notion of random variables and noise, contrary to solving equations. You are not looking for a solution, but for an estimate that is assumed to be a random variable. Same applies to the constraints you mention, $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ is a fuzzy constraint (under the "constraint" any value on real line is possible, some are just more likely), as compared to hard constraints in solving equations. Those are subtle, but important differences. For a general framework, as you noticed, you can treat everything as a random variable and use statistical methods even for things that are deterministic. One example is Laplace who over two hundred years ago used Bayesian approach to estimate the mass of Saturn . Finally, notice that the problems are not exchangeable. When solving the equations, you are given the equations, with statistics you are given the data, but the equations are not known, so your problem is broader than solving them.
