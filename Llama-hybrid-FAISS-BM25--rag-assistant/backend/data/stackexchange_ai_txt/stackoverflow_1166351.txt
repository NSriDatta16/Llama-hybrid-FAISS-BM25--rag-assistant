It sounds like you're asking which pieces go in which files. Is your project a Web application? In that case you would most likely use the system of organization imposed by your framework (Rails, Merb, Sinatra, etc.) Other kinds of projects also have their own typical structure that you can just follow. E.g. gems are usually set up in a certain way. If it's a console app, there's no strict rule. Usually people put no more than one class or module in a file. You could have one main file that requires all the others.
