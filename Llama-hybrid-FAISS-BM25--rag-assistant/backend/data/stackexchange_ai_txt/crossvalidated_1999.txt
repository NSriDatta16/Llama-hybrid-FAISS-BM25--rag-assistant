Generally, speaking a hierarchical bayesian (HB) analysis will lead to efficient and stable individual level estimates unless your data is such that individual level effects are completely homogeneous (an unrealistic scenario). The efficiency and stable parameter estimates of HB models becomes really important when you have sparse data (e.g., less no of obs than the no of parameters at the individual level) and when you want to estimate individual level estimates. However, HB models are not always easy to estimate. Therefore, while HB analysis usually trumps non-HB analysis you have to weigh the relative costs vs benefits based on your past experience and your current priorities in terms of time and cost. Having said that if you are not interested in individual level estimates then you can simply estimate an aggregate level model but even in these contexts estimating aggregating models via HB using individual level estimates may make a lot of sense. In summary, fitting HB models is the recommended approach as long as you have the time and the patience to fit them. You can then use aggregate models as a benchmark to assess the performance of your HB model.
