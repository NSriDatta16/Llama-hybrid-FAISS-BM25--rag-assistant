You can use VideoLan and I'd recommend it. I've had direct experience in a C# application with VideoLan doing these two things: Embedding a VLC viewer in my C# application (there are 3-4 C# "wrappers" for the VLC veiwer). Using vlc.exe in a separate Process by sending it command-line arguments. The fact that VideoLan has a command-line interface is a great thing. And VLC supports a command-line option that disables any visual element; so the VLC GUI doesn't pop up and neither does a command-line window. Thus, in a C# application you can farm out the video-related work to the VLC client. C# has the Process class which can manage your vlc.exe instances for you. It ends up being a pretty neat solution.
