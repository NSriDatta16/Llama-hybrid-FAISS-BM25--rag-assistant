Curve based clustering of multivariate data (time series like data)

Possible Duplicate: Reducing no of variables subsetted based on depth for PCA I have a question, I am trying to apply a method to my research area, which has not been aplied yet, based on publications and literature I could find. The case is the following: I have a dataset with x variables and these variables are changing with depth for every observation. I will show a simple dataset: Sorry I had no idea how to enter a table so I eneterd a pic. It is important how the curve looks like, so it would be nice to cluster the observations based on their curves(characteristic), which reoresents the x variables. My questions are: What would be the most appropriate method? Can I reduce the number of curves with PCA? Can I combine the curves of the x variables to one? Or is there a method, which can cluster my observations based on their x curves? I'd prefer an R or Python solution, because I have no acccess to matlab. Thank You in advance -v
