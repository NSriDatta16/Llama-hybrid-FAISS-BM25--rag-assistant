3d flipping/rotation in flex-actionscript 3

I want to make an flipping card object which has three sides, basic requirement is like below as in image, I want to rotate from horizontal center of card but I can not find any way to change orientation of rotation except put card in an container and set its x to -(width/2) I am using appendRotation method after setting its z component to 1 and everytime appending -5 rotation on Y axis. How to achieve this elegantly? any suggestions appreciated...
