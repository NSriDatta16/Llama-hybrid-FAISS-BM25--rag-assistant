FIFO queue (or stack) implemented on disk, not ram (preferably in C++)

Basically what I'm after is the equivalent of the Standard Template Library queue implemented in such a way as to use the disk for storage. The volume of data that will need to be in the queue is far greater than can be stored in the ram of most computers today. Ideally, I'm after a library to use. However, any recommendation on how to implement this queue would be useful.
