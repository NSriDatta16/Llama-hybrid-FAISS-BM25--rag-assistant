Sure, since it's a table it makes sense to have an array of objects. Note that an object is surrounded by curly braces and an array is surrounded by brackets: var myArray = []; // Initialize empty array var myObject = {}; // Initialize empty object This should accomplish what you need: // Initialize variables var newEntry, table = []; // Create a new object newEntry = { id: '', price: '', description: '' }; // Add the object to the end of the array table.push(newEntry); Which is the same as this: // Initialize array var table = []; // Create object and add the object to the end of the array table.push({ id: '22', price: '$222', description: 'Foo' }); You can now access properties like this: table[0].id; // '22' On modern browsers, if you want the data to persist across sessions (like cookies) you could use the sessionStorage or localStorage objects. When you want to send the data to the server, you'll send a JSON version of the table across the wire: var data = JSON.stringify(table);
