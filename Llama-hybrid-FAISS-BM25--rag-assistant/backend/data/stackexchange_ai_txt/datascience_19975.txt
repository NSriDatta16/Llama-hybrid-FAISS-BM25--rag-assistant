Did you include scaling in your pre-processing step? I had this issue when running my SVM. My dataset is ~780,000 samples (row) with 20 features (col). My training set is ~235k samples. It turns out that I just forgot to scale my data! If this is the case, try adding this bit to your code: scale data to [-1,1] ; increase SVM speed: from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler scaling = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(-1,1)).fit(X_train) X_train = scaling.transform(X_train) X_test = scaling.transform(X_test)
