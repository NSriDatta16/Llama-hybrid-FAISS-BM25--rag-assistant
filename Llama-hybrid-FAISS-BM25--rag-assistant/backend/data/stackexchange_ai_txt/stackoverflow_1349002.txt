Retrieval of input type=password Request.Form["strPassword"] gives null

Are there any special considerations trying to read up data from an HTML form where the element is an input type="Password"? When a ColdFusion page POSTs my handler with form data I am getting null for the password instead of the typed value. Here is the key line from the larger block below: string password = context.Request.Form["strPassword"]; I have an HTTPHandler.ashx code file that performs an upload of a file when posted. Here is the key snippet of this code: string username = context.Request.Form["strUsername"]; if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(username)) { IdentifyInvoker = GetUserInfo(); brokerService = new Broker.FileService(); } else { string password = context.Request.Form["strPassword"]; string domain = context.Request.Form["strDomain"]; IdentifyInvoker = GetInvokerInfoFromForm(username, password, domain); brokerService = new Broker.FileService(username,password,domain); } The form from which the above code is posted (from ColdFusion) looks like this: User Name Password Domain I was able to trap this with the debugger and was shocked to see that after this: string password = context.Request.Form["strPassword"]; ... password = null In the immediate window, sure enough: ?context.Request.Form["strPassword"] null If I examine the entire Form collection in the debugger, I see the proper values laid out (separated by &) and none of the important data elements is null (but strangely the data contains a plus sign in front of the equal sign)! Here is a snippet from the immed window: &strUsername=johna&strPassword+=xxxxxxxx&strDomain+=cbmiweb} I have an ASP.NET client that POSTs to this same HTTPHandler and that works fine. Here the same form data shows without the interfering PLUS signs: &strUsername=johna&strPassword=xxxxxxxx&strDomain=cbmiweb} Any ideas on what causes this and how to retrieve the form data when it's formatted with the intervening PLUS signs? EDIT: Both the ASP.NET form and the ColdFusion form specify enctype="multipart/form-data" yet the latter embeds these PLUS signs.
