One factor that can complicate inserts as a database grows is the number of indexes on the table, and the depth of those indexes if they are B-trees or similar. There's simply more work to do, and it may be that you're causing index nodes to split, or you may simply have moved from, say, a 5-level B-tree to a 6-level one (or. more generally, from N to N+1 levels). Another factor could be disk space usage -- if you are using cooked files (that's the normal kind for most people most of the time; some DBMS use 'raw files' on Unix, but it is unlikely that your embedded system would do so, and you'd know if it did because you'd have to tell it to do so), it could be that your bigger tables are now fragmented across the disk, leading to worse performance. If the problem was on SELECT performance, there could be many other factors also affecting your system's performance.
