Monte Carlo experiment to estimate coverage probability

I'm working on a problem as follows for a course that I'm auditing: Suppose a 95% symmetric t-interval is applied to estimate a mean, but the sample data are non-normal. Then the probability that the confidence interval covers the mean is not necessarily equal to 0.95. Use a Monte Carlo experiment to estimate the coverage probability of the t-interval for random samples of $\chi^2(2)$ data with sample size $n = 20$ . Here is the current state of my R code: alpha = 0.05; n = 20; m = 1000; UCL = numeric(m); LCL = numeric(m); for(i in 1:m) { x = rchisq(n, 2); LCL[i] = mean(x) - qt(alpha / 2, lower.tail = FALSE) * sd(x); UCL[i] = mean(x) + qt(alpha / 2, lower.tail = FALSE) * sd(x); } # This line below is wrong... mean(LCL > 0 & UCL The problem is that the result is $0$ . Am I approaching this question incorrectly? What exactly does coverage probability mean...?
