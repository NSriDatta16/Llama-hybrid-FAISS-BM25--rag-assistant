I have done this by modifying the admin/index.html template. You may also need to modify admin/base_site.html (depending on what you want to do, exactly). These templates are found in the django/contrib/admin/templates/admin folder in a Django installation. Update: That's exactly what I've done, see the screenshot fragment below. The section marked in red is the section I added, via HTML in admin/index.html . However, you don't say which version of Django you're using - my example is from a 1.0 installation.
