Need help understanding Hard SVM quadratic program equation

This is from the textbook "Understanding Machine Learning" by Shalev-Schwarz p. 169. Can anyone help me understand why the solutions to this optimization problem need to be divided by the norm of w? (Other resources online mention this translation to quadratic programming, but omit the division part.) Thank you very much!!
