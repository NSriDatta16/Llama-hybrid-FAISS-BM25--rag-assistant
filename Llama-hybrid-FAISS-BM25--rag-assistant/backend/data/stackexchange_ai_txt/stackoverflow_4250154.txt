The best way to get up to speed quickly on Umbraco is to look at the screencasts made from Umbraco corporate: http://umbraco.tv/products/umbracotv After that, the Umbraco community is quite good at answering questions and helping out: http://our.umbraco.org/ As far as your specific question: I could be wrong, but I think the thing that you aren't leveraging is inheritance. This makes things easier in Umbraco. First, DocumentTypes can have parents and they inherit the data fields from those parents. For example, a Content Page DocumentType could have the meta information, main content area, and intro text. Many pages within your site will likely go no further than that. Basically a rich text editor page (think "About Us") Then when you add the News Item DocumentType, it can inherit all of those fields from Content Page and simply add a Date and Image field (as an example). DocumentTypes can have many templates available to them. So if the data doesn't change, but the markup (design) does then you can set a new template in the Properties tab. Templates can have parents as well. So you can build them up like this: Main Template |____One Column Layout |____Generic Content Page |____News Area |____Two Column Layout |____Product Compare This works just like master pages in ASP.NET. So this is pretty long winded. Maybe I'll think about a blog post. Does this help at all?
