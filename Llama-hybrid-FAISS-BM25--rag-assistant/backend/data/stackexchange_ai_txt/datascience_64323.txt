How to load the pre-trained BERT model from local/colab directory?

Hi i downloaded the BERT pretrained model ( https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/cased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip ) from here and saved to a directory in gogole colab and in local . when i try to load the model in colab im getting "We assumed '/content/drive/My Drive/bert_training/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/config.json" . tried to laod the model in local machine and getting same error . this is how i loaded the model: from transformers import BertForMaskedLM BertNSP=BertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained('/content/drive/My Drive/bert_training/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/') is this the correct way of loading model from the directory when i have downloaded the pretrained model ? Im getting error " '/content/drive/My Drive/bert_training/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/config.json' " the downloaded model had these naming conventions where file name start with bert_ but the BertForMaskedLM class is expecting the file name to be config.json . bert_config.json bert_model.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001 bert_model.ckpt.index vocab.txt bert_model.ckpt.meta FULL ERROR: Model name '/content/drive/My Drive/bert_training/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/' was not found in model name list (bert-base-uncased, bert-large-uncased, bert-base-cased, bert-large-cased, bert-base-multilingual-uncased, bert-base-multilingual-cased, bert-base-chinese, bert-base-german-cased, bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking, bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking, bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad, bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad, bert-base-cased-finetuned-mrpc, bert-base-german-dbmdz-cased, bert-base-german-dbmdz-uncased).
