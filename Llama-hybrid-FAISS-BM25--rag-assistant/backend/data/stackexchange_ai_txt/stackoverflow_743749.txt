In CString, the string actual size and allocated buffer are held by signed ints (check out CStringData). The string buffer itself is dynamically allocated. This means the theoretical limit is 2^31 characters. Practically, on a 32 bit environment you'll be able to get much less due to memory fragmantation. Also, if you're using Unicode CString, each character is two bytes, which means the CString buffer will hold less text. On a 64 bit environment you might be able to get as much as 2^31 characters. Having that said, are you really trying to work with strings that long? There's probably a lot to do before you hit the CString length limit.
