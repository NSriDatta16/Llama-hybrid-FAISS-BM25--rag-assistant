It is very opaque feedback - sounds to me like they're saying "you didn't do well this time - try harder next time". The only way to understand it is to be brave, and ask your lecturer for a meeting to discuss things further. Your lecturer seems to be disappointed with your choice of research questions perhaps? I think they may have been looking for some "buzz words" like "auto-/serial-/correlation" "time series" "seasonal effects/adjustment" "business cycles" "trend". I don't know what you were expected to know when doing the assignment. Anyway, here's what I think. Your assignment shows a good ability to perform a statistical test, but from a data analysis perspective shows a strange choice of examples. Analysis should be about telling a story. Personally I liked the choice of male vs female employment as a theme. However, I would have put the "second example" first, as it is a simpler question "is there a gender difference now ?". After showing that there clearly is a difference (as you do), you could have then gone to the more complex question of "has there been a consistent gender difference over time?" Of course this question may be beyond the scope of your "statistical toolbox" to answer in a formal manner. One way you could do this with linear regression is to model the odds of being employed vs unemployed (or log-odds if this gives a better fit) for males and females. You then have a simple ols model of $$ y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i +e_i $$ Where $ y_i $ is the ratio "employed"/"unemployed" and $ x_i $ is a dummy variable equal to one if the ratio is for males and zero otherwise, and $ e_i $ is the residual. You then test if $\beta_1=0 $. You could take the model further, and include a time covariate as well as an interaction between time and gender. This is all part of building your analysis work as a story ("the plot thickens" so to speak). This of course depends on knowing about multiple regression ( which may be outside the course content). I wouldn't have used that first example at all, of course linear regression was inappropriate. Your lecturer (probably) wants to see an example of a good use of linear regression. Of course, the ols example I gave above may also not be appropriate - this depends on assessing the model.
