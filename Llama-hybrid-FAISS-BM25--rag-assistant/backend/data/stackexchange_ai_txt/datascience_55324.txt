I understand you don't have the images, only the features. In the end, it's still a binary classification (same object / different object). If both objects have the same structure, you should apply the Siamese Neural Networks concept, that means, the same network pre-processing both objects before the decision layer. This network don't need to be a CNN. It could something as simple as fully connected neural network. You just need to be sure both networks are exactly the same (share the same weights) all the time.
