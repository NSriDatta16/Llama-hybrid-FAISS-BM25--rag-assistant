I think the only way this may happen if your JVM terminates before System.exit(1) actually executed. Do you think this may be possible in your system? Either, the code with System.exit(1) is being executed in a daemon thread, and so when all other live (non-daemon) threads finish working JVM exits cleanly (or not cleanly, as you can still get 0 exit code if you program throws an exception!) Alternatively, as @Erick Robertson suggested, maybe something is modifying the exit status from a hook or something, although I am not sure how this is possible. Note: please disregard my previous comment. Calling System.exit(1) will terminate all currently running daemon/non-daemon threads all-together.
