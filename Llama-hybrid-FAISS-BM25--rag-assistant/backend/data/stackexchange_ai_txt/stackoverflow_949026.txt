WCF Service Security for Authentication and Authorization

First of all I apologize for my english... As I wrote in title I need to secure my WCF Service. I always used message security mode using ClientCredentialType="Certificate", checking in this way: This configuration worked well, but now I need to assign different privileges to the authenticated clients, I need Authorization in other words. Any idea? Thanks, Alberto
