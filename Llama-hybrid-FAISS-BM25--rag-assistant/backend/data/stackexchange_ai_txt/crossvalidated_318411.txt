What regression models can choose between more than two categories?

Logistic regression creates a model that predicts one of two possible responses for a given set of predictors. What if I want to choose between three responses? I tried this by using a logistic regression, except instead of defining my two outcomes as 0 and 1; I defined a third outcome at 0.5. This seemed to be going great, until I realized that this model would never produce an estimate of probability in all three categories. For example, if outcome A = 0; B = 0.5; and C = 1, and if the regression result for a certain set of predictor variables is 0.75, I could interpret that as saying the probability of B is 0.5 an the probability of C is 0.5. However, the observed probability of all three outcomes is > 0 for any set of predictor variables, so this model is not so useful. What sorts of regression-type models will estimate probabilities for three or more outcomes, the way that logistic regression estimates probabilities for two outcomes?
