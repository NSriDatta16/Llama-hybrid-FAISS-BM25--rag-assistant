MVP Implimentation - Smart Client Software Facotry (SCSF) vs. The MVC# Framework

I came across these two tools to help in implementing the MVP pattern in Microsoft .NET: Architecting Applications for the Enterprise . The book just has a few paragraphs about them, so I'd like to explore them more in-depth. I currently am only concerned with .NET Windows Forms development. I haven't used either tool yet, and was curious if anyone has had experience with both/either of them. What are the pros and cons between the two? Are both comparable, or is one more "De facto" than the other. Links for those unfamiliar about the tools: SCSF MVC# Framework
