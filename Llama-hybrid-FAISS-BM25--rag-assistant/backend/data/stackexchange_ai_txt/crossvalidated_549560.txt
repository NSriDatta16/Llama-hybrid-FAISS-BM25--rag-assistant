Tuning parameters for multiple regression models

I am trying to compare multiple regression algorithms to estimate biomass (dependant variable) : KNeighborsRegressor, GaussianProcessRegressor, LinearRegression, BayesianRidge, Ridge, SGDRegressor, PassiveAggressiveRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, SVR, AdaBoostRegressor, BaggingRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, MLPRegressor, Lasso, CatBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor, OrthogonalMatchingPursuit, HuberRegressor, Lars, LassoLars, ElasticNet. If I want to be rigorous, I am gonna have to tune every parameter of every regression model using gridsearchcv. Since I am new to machine learning, I want to know if there is a code out there that can help me facilitate the procedure by : automating the hyperparameter tuning procedure across all the regression models, creating the dictionaries for the parameters for each regression model instead of manually creating them...?
