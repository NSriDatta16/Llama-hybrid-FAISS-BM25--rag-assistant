Multinomial with small counts and many cells

I have data distributed as multinomial, with $N= 1,000$ observations divided among $n=10,000$ cells, with unequal probabilities $p_i$ , for $i=1,...,n$ . I would like to assess how likely it is that an observed $x$ arose from this distribution. I cannot use the Pearson's chi-squared test, as my expected cell counts are way too small. I don't think Fisher's exact test can be used in this setting either. How can I go about computing this p-value? Some background, per the comments: I have a dataset consisting of several thousand observations $x_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$ , where each $x_i$ is a sample from a multinomial distribution, possibly with different probabilities. My overall goal is to determine if all the $x_i$ derived from the same distribution. I thought to approach this by estimating $p$ as a weighted average of all the observations in the dataset and then determining the probability that $x_i$ could have been generated from Multinomial $(p, n_i)$ . It is not clear to me how to accomplish this, and that was what inspired this question.
