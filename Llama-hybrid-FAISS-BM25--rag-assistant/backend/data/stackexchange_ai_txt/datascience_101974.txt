Which steps are involved in sentiment analysis with Huggingface Transformers?

I want to perform a sentiment analysis of a dataset of (Spanish) tweets about COVID-19 vaccines. I've already scraped the tweets and identified a pretrained model I can use for Spanish. What I don't really understand - and don't seem to find the right resources either - is what steps are involved in the whole process? I know I have to fine-tune the model which I'm not exactly sure how to do. Do I necessarily need a labeled dataset for this or can I just train the model on my scraped tweets (that don't have a label yet)?
