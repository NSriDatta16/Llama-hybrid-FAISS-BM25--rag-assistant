JQuery: updating tooltip

I have a tooltip attached to a div. the div is also draggable on dragstop event i need to change the value of the tooltip. However, since its on dragstop the mouse is still over the div and consequently the title="". I was wondering if anyone knew a way to accomplish this? Shawn
