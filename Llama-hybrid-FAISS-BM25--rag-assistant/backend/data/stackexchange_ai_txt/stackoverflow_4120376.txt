I don't know about myths, but I agree that having business people maintain rules is not a slam dunk. I think expecting business folks to have the patience and anal retentive attention to detail required to do IT's job is a fantasy. It's been in play ever since 3G languages (graphical approaches to programming) have been offered as a way to get secretaries to write code so the programmers could all be fired. I'd point out that as the size of the rule set increases, the possibility of ensuring that it's correct and self-consistent goes down. If your rules set has thousands of rules it'll be hard to test. Speaking of which, combinatorial explosion of combinations will make it hard to test a rules engine. Rules engines are terrific technology, but be careful.
