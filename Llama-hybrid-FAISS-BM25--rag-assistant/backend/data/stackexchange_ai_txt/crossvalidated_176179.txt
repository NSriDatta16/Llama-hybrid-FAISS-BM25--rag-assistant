Interesting. I've been working on a similar question recently. First, as is well known, the full periodogram isn't needed since the Nyquist frequency is N/2. Then, if you rank the set by decreasing Amplitude, you could select that subset of frequencies that best represents the periodicities. I'm not aware of any theoretical motivations for selecting a cutoff...but a judgement-based heuristic would work. My approach was a little different, expanding on the FFT. Obviously, there is likely to be some autocorrelation to the time series as well. Why not fold in a measure to capture that, e.g., the DW or related metrics? Then, there can be issues with trend, cointegration and unit roots...why not use measures such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller or Philips-Perron to express those relationships? Then, Rob Hyndman put out a paper on clustering time series a couple of years ago that decomposed the time series into the moments of the distribution, and clustering on those metrics. Anyway, those are some thoughts...
