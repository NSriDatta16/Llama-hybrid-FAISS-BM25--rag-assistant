Comparing general search engine and a meta search engine. Paired t test or independent t-test?

I have built a domain-specific search engine, a meta-search engine. This search engine, of course, take its results from other search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo and stuff. Then does some classification to filter the results. Now, I'm doing an evaluation on the precision of search results returned by this search engine towards the precision of search results returned from a general search engine. So I queried a number of queries to my search engine, count the precision of each result returned, and compute the average of the precisions. I do the same queries to a general search engine, which in this case is Google. And by so compute the average of the precisions. I use t-test two see if the difference between these precisions statistically significantly differ. What I can't understand now, is it paired t-test or independent one? I heard from my professor that it should be independent t-test, since the sample sets come from two different search engines. But in my mind, since the sample (search results returned) are displayed based on same queries in order, and meta-search engine takes its results from several general search engines, it should be paired t-test. On the other hand I know it as well, that paired t-test should be done on SAME sample, different treatments. Which do I choose? Need help. I enclose the screen shoot of the search results as well, to make my question more clear and understandable. Thanks.
