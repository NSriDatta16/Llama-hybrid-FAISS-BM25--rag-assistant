Storing Images : DB or File System -

I read some post in this regard but I still don't understand what's the best solution in my case. I'm start writing a new webApp and the backend is going to provide about 1-10 million images . (average size 200-500kB for a single image) My site will provide content and images to 100-1000 users at the same time. I'd like also to keep Provider costs as low as possible (but this is a secondary requirement). I'm thinking that File System space is less expensive if compared to the cost of DB size. Personally I like the idea of having all my images in the DB but any suggestion will be really appreciated :) Do you think that in my case the DB approach is the right choice?
