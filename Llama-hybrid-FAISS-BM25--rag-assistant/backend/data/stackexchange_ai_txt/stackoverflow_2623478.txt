Drag and Drop into another div and move in the div only using jquery

I have a dragable div, I want to be able to drag a div and drop into another div. It should only move inside the, dropped div. Currently I have this code $(document).ready(function(){ $("#move").draggable(); $("#move1").draggable(); $('#contain').droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { // update the draggable to be only moveable inside the droppable ui.draggable.draggable("option", "containment", this); } }); }); where #contain is the div that #move and #move1 has to be placed in and moved about. Thanks Jean
