Steps for balancing data using SMOTE

Right now I'm doing sentiment analysis (classification) with TF-IDF and SVM linear. My data is not balanced and I want to make data balance using SMOTE from imbalanced-learn . The problem is SMOTE can't convert string to float so steps what I do right now is: Imbalance data. Split data into data train and test. Apply TF-IDF. Use SMOTE. I want to ask. If I change my steps like this: Imbalance data. Apply TF-IDF. Apply SMOTE. Split data into data train and test. Is it okay?
