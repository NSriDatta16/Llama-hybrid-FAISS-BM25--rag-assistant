.NET SVM for regression

I'm looking for a Support Vector Machine library that I can use in my .NET projects. The two promising ones I've found so far are NPatternRecognizer , but it only supports classification (not regression). LibSVM supports regression, but the .NET wrappers don't seem to. Are there any good recommendations for .NET SVM libraries that support regression?
