How can I build a model that could predict that a credit card transaction is fraud or not based on previous transactions of the same card

I am working on a project where I am supposed to detect fraud in credit card transaction. I generated a dataset that looks like this: supposedly this is the transactions in a database. The job consists in taking the decision to perform an OTP verification or accept the transaction directly. My thought is to put a condition on the credit card number if it's present in the database then I could compare it to previous transactions automatically through a machine learning model. if the informations in the transaction ( ip address, billing address...) are identical to the previous transactions of the same card in the trained model then it's normal. Else, depending on the different fields it could be classified as an anomaly. I tried to use the Isolation Forest algorithm as it looks more convenient for this task, but I don't get the results I want. Any suggestions are welcome. Ps: note that the dataset contains fully repeated rows, as well as repeated rows with the same card and different other fields ( supposedly fraud).
