How to get the topic coverage for a document using LDA?

I have three distributions of topic obtained by Latent Dirichlet allocation: theme_1 = {cat*0.7, dog*0.2, pet*0.1}, theme_2 = {salad*0.5, fish*0.3, chicken*0.2}, theme_3 = {cuisine*0.4, food*0.3, tomato*0.3}, I need to calculate the coverage of each item in a document having a word count vector for example: d1 = {Dog: 4, Fish: 6, Cooking: 2: Tomato: 0, Chicken: 5, Meal: 2} to result in a topic vector instead of the word count vector in this way: d1 = {theme_1, theme_2, theme_3}. I was calculating this way: theme_1 in d1 = probability(dog in theme_1) * # Occurrences(dog in d1) Because only "dog" occurs in the topic "theme_1" and in the document and so on. Is it the right way to do it? Because I also understand that the coverage of topics in a document must be equal to 1.
