Sampling time series that are X distance away from a given time series

Given a time series $T_1$ , I want to sample time series that are a $\epsilon$ -distance away from $T_1$ . Let's assume the distance metric is Dynamic Time Warping. The specific problem is, I have a limited dataset of time series. I want to generate artificial data such that those are not far away from the given time series. One idea is to sample time series that are a $\epsilon$ -distance away from given time series. One meaningful distance measure for time series is Dynamic Time Warping. Any ideas on how to mathematically model this?
