It is not sufficient to list the folder in which MyStatic.lib can be found. You have to explicitly tell the linker that Dependant.vcproj is using MyStatic.lib. In VS2005 you do this by project properties->Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies. You can also sprinkle some preprosessor stuff in the .h file to tell the compiler to tell the linker to use MyStatic.lib. Edit: The preprocessor magic goes like this #pragma comment(lib, "MyStatic.lib")
