Why is the proposal in the MALA algorithm always normally distributed?

Notation: $\pi(x)$ is the target density. $(x_n)_{n=1}^{N}$ is the chain generated by the MCMC method. At the moment, I am doing some research in MCMC methods. Before, I was planning to dive into the recently developed non-reversible MCMC methods, I revisited some 'simple' ones and I came across MALA (Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm). The algorithm is generally the same as Metropolis-Hastings but instead of basing the proposal on the previous value, $x_n$ , it bases the proposal on $x_n + h\cdot \nabla\log\pi(x_n)$ for a certain step-size $h$ . However, in Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, they do not specify the family of the proposal density, it can generally be anything (usually centred around $x_n$ though). In the MALA algorithm, they actually do specify the family of the proposal density, namely they fix it to be Gaussian where the variance depends on the step-size $h$ . My question is: Why do we make the Gaussian assumption? Or maybe a bit more instructive, why can't we use any distribution with mean $x_n + h\cdot\nabla\log\pi(x_n)$ (where the variance may be fixed as function of $h$ ) as proposal for the new value $x_{n+1}$ ?
