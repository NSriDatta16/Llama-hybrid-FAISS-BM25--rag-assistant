Yes a perceptron (one fully connected unit) can be used for regression. It will just be a linear regressor. If you use no activation function you get a regressor and if you put a sigmoid activation you get a classifier. Actually, with neural networks, classification is a special case of regression where we "regress" the probability of belonging to a given class. That's why the loss function for classification is called "logistic regression".
