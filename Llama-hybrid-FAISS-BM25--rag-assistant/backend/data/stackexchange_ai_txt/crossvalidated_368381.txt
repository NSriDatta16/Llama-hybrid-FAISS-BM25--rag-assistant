How to recreate a particular image from PCA from a database of images?

Please forgive if this is a repeat but I couldn't find a similar question (at least as it pertains to me). I have a database of 30,000 images of digits (0-9). Every image is 28*28. So, every image is represented by a row of 785 columns with the first column as a label (whether the digit is 0 or 1 or â€¦ 9) and columns 2: 785 having a value of black(from 0-255). Now, I have the pca using pca with 784 PCAs. I also have a mean of all the digits using meanDig (I don't know if this mean is useful or not). Now, I am being asked to recreate the '100th' image from the database using first 15 PCs. I understand from this question and other related questions how to recreate one single image from the PCA of that single image. But if I have PCA of a collective of 30000 images, is it possible to recreate the one single image? I tried: recreation $x[, 1:15] %*% t(pca$ rotation[, 1:15]) # which gives me a matrix of 23520000 elements. # I am not sure how I can recreate a 28*28 image? # Then I thought maybe I can do this for the "15th" row: recreation $x[100, 1:15] %*% t(pca$ rotation[100, 1:15]) # but I am not sure what this even means. Any suggestions? Edit #1 I am adding more information after taking @chechy_levas suggestions into consideration. # Read the data: df # The 15th image for reference: # recreate the image at row 15 with 15 PC. img15 $x[15, 1:15] %*% t(pca$ rotation[, 1:15]) img15 # recreate the image at row 15 with 100 PC. img15 $x[15, 1:100] %*% t(pca$ rotation[, 1:100]) img15 # Image with 200 PC
