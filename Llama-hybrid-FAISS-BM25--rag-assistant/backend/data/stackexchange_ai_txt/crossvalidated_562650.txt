Imbalanced classification vs anomaly detection

Currently I have a dataset with a class distribution of 75:25. While the 1st thought that came to my mind was to use the binary classification using logistic regression. Of course, I can upsample using SMOTE etc to make reliable predictions for minority class. However, I had another question. Why can't this problem be formulated as anomaly detection? Meaning, since I have too much of positives (to learn from), is it okay to consider that anything that doesn't fall with the positive examples, can it be considered as negative? So, would anomaly detection work? q1) Is there any disadvantages to this? q2) can help me understand why do you think classification would be the best approach for imbalanced classification? If not, why do you think anomaly detection would be the best approach? q3) when to choose binary clf or anomaly detection?
