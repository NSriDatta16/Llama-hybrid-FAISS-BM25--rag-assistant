I think that between your original post and norbertB's additions you've covered just about everything. Start with the absolute constraints (and remember, that just because a client says no to something once - even if they say it's absolute - that doesn't mean you can't help change their mind...). Once you've narrowed down the field with the absolute constraints look at the other things. One thing that did seem to be left out was flexibility. For example, if I were trying to choose between two similar technologies and I knew that one could support updateable views and the other couldn't, even if I had absolutely no need for updateable views at the time I would still lean towards that one "just in case".
