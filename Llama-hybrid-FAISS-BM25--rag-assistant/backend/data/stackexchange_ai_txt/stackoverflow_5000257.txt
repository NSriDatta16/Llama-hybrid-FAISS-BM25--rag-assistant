c# declaring a variable as a parameter, novice question

I've been working a week on teaching myself C# (with no C++ or Java), on a project of making an elaborate poker-hand parser. I'm finally caving in and posting my first simple question. I think I've seen variable declarations in various ways (new to my VB/A experience). Here's the general idea of what I'd like to do. public class CompareHandsClass : IComparer ... public class clCardsHeld { protected List _liCards = new List (); public clCardsHeld(List CardsList) { _liCards = CardsList; } ... public class clHiHand : clCardsHeld { public clHiHand(List CardsList) : base(CardsList) {} List _liTempCards; CompareHandsClass HandComparer = new CompareHandsClass(); ... if (_liTempCards.Count >= 5 && HandComparer.Compare(clHiHand x = new clHiHand(_liTempCards), clHiHand y = new clHiHand(_liFlushCards))) So my problem is down at the end with HandComparer.Compare. I've got two Lists of my clCard type, but I can't send them to .Compare() because that takes clHiHand objects. So I'm trying to send the lists as arguments to constructors of temporary clHiHand type variables all at once. I can do this somehow can't I (aside from using several lines of declarations)? Thanks for any beginner's help (I'm kind of disappointed I get stumped on this little thing of all places...) Oh and, PS, I hope I didn't mess up anything else in this sample code, since I've gotten away from my last working version with these extensions.
