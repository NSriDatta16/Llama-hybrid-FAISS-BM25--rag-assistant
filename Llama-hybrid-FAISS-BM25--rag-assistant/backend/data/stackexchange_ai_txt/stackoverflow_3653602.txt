Is there a unique column among the ones you're pulling? If so, you can GROUP BY both Category_name and it, which will group the categories together but avoid losing any rows to it. You would then have your data organized by category, which would be easier to loop over, the database having done the bulk of the organizational work for you. If you don't have a unique column you're already pulling, it can't hurt much to add the primary key column. In that case, your GROUP BY would probably look like: GROUP BY Category_name, p.id
