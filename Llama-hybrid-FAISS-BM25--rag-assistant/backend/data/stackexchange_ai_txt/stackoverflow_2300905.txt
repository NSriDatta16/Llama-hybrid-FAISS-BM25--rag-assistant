If it helps, the bug submission link in your crash report has this disclaimer: In addition, Sun Microsystems respects your desire for privacy. Personal data collected from this program will not be sold, given or shared with organizations external to Sun. We will use this data for communications with you to clarify issues regarding the report you submitted and/or status of that report. The issues that you report may be made available to other JDC Members or Sun customers, however your personal data will be kept confidential. If you are not comfortable with the above conditions, please do not press the Submit button. If you have any questions, please refer to our Privacy Policy . Personally, I would report it if it was feasible to hand over the code segment in question with logs, if the data is not too sensitive (perhaps data can be masked or obfuscated in logs?). It's impossible for you to really judge if the bug is "important" or not for others unless you can know what actually causes it. Reporting it might be the first step in Sun's engineers finding out the cause of something serious.
