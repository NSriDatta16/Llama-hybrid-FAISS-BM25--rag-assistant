How to improve performance on SQLite3 iPhone program

I am (still) working on an iPhone program which uses SQLite3. I have managed to optimize the database writes as far as I can. The problem I have now is that "END TRANSACTION" is killing me as it's taking very long. The journal file is usually about 50k which might be a problem, but I'd like to know your ideas. I tried using "PRAGMA synchronous = 0", but that caused some data corruption. My latest attempt at optimizing is "PRAGMA journal_mode=TRUNCATE" but I do not know if that helps a lot. Any suggestions at this stage?
