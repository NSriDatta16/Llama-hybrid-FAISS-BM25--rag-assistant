The documentation states that the term extraction transformation supports only English, and there's no mention of a mechanism for adding other languages. Therefore, I would assume that you need to find some sort of tool that can do term extraction with Ukrainian text, and work out how to integrate it into SSIS. Finding a tool like that isn't really an SSIS issue, it's a general NLP or linguistics question, so you might get a better answer in another forum.
