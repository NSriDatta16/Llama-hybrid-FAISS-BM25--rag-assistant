Importance of complicated linear algebra for data scientist

I've already finished Andrew Ng's machine learning course and now working with textbook 'The Elements of Statistical Learning'. I'm successfully implementing equations and concepts described there using MATLAB, but I don't get all the things going on there with linear algebra, like why are degrees of freedom for ridge regression are defined that way or why can we write least squares fitted vector using singular value decomposition another way. I get common sense of that equations and understand where and for what reason they should be used, but I can't perform the same transformations of them, like where they come from. Is it a big problem for beginning data scientist? I mean, does it appear in practice that junior data scientist should create some formula himself/herself? I know basics of linear algebra, but equations and transformations given there are far higher level than basic or intermediate.
