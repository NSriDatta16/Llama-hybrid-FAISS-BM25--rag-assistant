How to use m2ecipse and maven in Idea IDE correctly?

Currently, I found that it's very inefficient use of Maven in our team. So I have this question. We have a large project consists of 300-500 modules which are organized by Maven 3, I have divided it into 10 sub-projects, so each sub-project have a root pom.xml . Say they are project1, project2, .. projectN. I mainly work on project3 consists of 30 modules, they are then depended by project4 and project5 . project3: module3-1 SNAPSHOT module3-2 SNAPSHOT module3-3 SNAPSHOT module3-4 SNAPSHOT module3-5 SNAPSHOT module3-6 RELEASE ... module3-30 RELEASE In project3, some not so often changes modules are released, and some (module3-1..3-5) are changed very frequently, so I use SNAPSHOT versions here. We have run an Archiva server to manage all the artifacts, include both released and snapshots version. Now the problem is, when I changed something in my project3 , generally I would like to deploy the whole sub-project: [my-ubuntu] ~/project3/$ mvn clean; mvn deploy ... EVERYTHING SUCCEED [my-ubuntu] ~/project3/$ For what I expect is, all the snapshot versions should be automatically downloaded & updated in other people's machines. In command line, it's worked as expected: [john's ubuntu] ~/project4/$ mvn package ... download http://archiva-server/snapshots/project3/...-SNAPSHOT... [SUCCEEDED] ... EVERYTHING SUCCEED [john's ubuntu] ~/project4/$ However, Gin hate command line, so he use M2eclipse, but M2eclipse won't automaticlly update the snapshots. I have tried: TRY 1: Disable dependency resolution Enable dependency resolution (This take maybe 30 minutes, and make eclipse hang, so I don't like. And it seems not work most of time, not download the latest snapshots sometimes) TRY 2: Update all dependnecies Refresh projects (This take about maybe 5 minutes, but not work some time, not download the latest snapshots sometimes) TRY 3: Delete all projects from eclipse workspace Re-import all projects (This take maybe 10 minutes, and most "clean" way, though not very fast but okay) (But not download the latest snapshots sometimes) TRY 4: [gin's ubuntu] ~/project4/$ cd ~/.m2/repository/../project3 [gin's ubuntu] ~/.m2/repository/../project3 $ find -name 'resolve-*' -delete Refresh eclipse projects (This take about maybe 5 minutes? Well I haven't time it, though.) (This is the best resolution in my experience, it downloads all snapshots everytime, so it's the final-resolution, well sounds like problem-killer.) So, I my personal experience, to delete resolve-* files in local repository seems the best resolution, but it's just not feel good. Compared with command-line invoke mvn , all IDE sucks.. Well maybe I didn't manage Maven in a correct way? I'd like to know the best workflows to use Maven correctly in Eclipse/Idea stuff IDEs.
