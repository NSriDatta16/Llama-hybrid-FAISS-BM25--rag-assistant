There is no real support for data models with the zend framework. But weierophinney does a realy good job to show how they could be implemented. Another very good description is this one . Usually a model represents the data and includes the logic. The data model is a backend independed way to write/get data. For the model and the application it doesn't matter from where the data comes. Thus the datastorage can be exchanged without having to touch anything else.
