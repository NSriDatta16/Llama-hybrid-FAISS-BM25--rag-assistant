Option 2: Develop a clever "rebalancing strategy", that would keep track of data being loaded together and tries to put stuff together that gets loaded together often. This could include keeping copies of rows in multiple chunks. Pros: can be almost arbitrarily smart could be made very effective performance-wise allows for an evolving strategy Cons: can be almost arbitrarily hard to develop, test and debug might suffer from poor performance until the self-optimization has kicked in multiple copies of records could bloat storage somehow I feel this should be done by the database
