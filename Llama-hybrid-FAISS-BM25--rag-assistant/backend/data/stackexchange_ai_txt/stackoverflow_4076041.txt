Paperclip - how do you upload PDFs?

I've got a model that uploads both images and pdfs to Amazon S3 - the images work, the pdfs don't. This is what my model looks like: validates_attachment_content_type :photo, :content_type => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'] has_attached_file :pdf, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{::Rails.root.to_s}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/userpdfs/:id/:basename.:extension" has_attached_file :photo, :styles => {:medium => "200x300>", :thumb => "100x150>" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{::Rails.root.to_s}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/userphotos/:style/:id/:basename.:extension" Amazon is showing userphotos but no userpdfs . Both types have four fields in my database: pdf_name pdf_type # could also be a word doc pdf_size pdf_updated_at Why aren't the resumes uploading (the images do!) How can I validate the :pdf field to only allow .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt? Edit Uploading any image to the :pdf field works! Something about pdfs themselves seem to mess up the system. My server says it has saved the files to S3 but they don't appear in the directory. PDFs now work only if they have no spaces in the title . With spaces, I get the following error: Errno::EPIPE: Broken Pipe .
