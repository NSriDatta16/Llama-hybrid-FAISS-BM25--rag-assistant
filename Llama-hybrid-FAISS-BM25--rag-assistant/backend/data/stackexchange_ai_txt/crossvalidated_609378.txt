You can (most likely) not apply standard DAG learning algorithms to time series data A way to think about DAG learning algorithms that are not tailored to time series (such as FGES) is this: All variables are all observed at an initial time $t_0$ . Then you let the system variables interact until they have reached an equilibrium at time $t_1$ , where you measure the variables again. If the starting value of one variable affects the equilibrium value of another one, they are causally connected. The causal relationship between the variables simultaneously encodes the dependency between start and equilibrium, which are the only time steps that exist. This logic breaks once you have a time series where causal networks iteratively relate past states to future states through Granger causality. So you are correct in assuming that such algorithms most likely won't be applicable for your case. Note of caution Causal structure learning algorithms tend to come with heavy assumptions (e.g. additive noise, no unobserved variables, acyclicity, ...) and have trouble returning useful results at the best of times (even FGES just returns a CPDAG that may not be correct even if all assumptions are met). So just beware that causal structure learning from multivariate time series is a tall order!
