Why are oyu mixing usage of $_FILES and $HTTP_POST_FILES? Usage of the later suggests that you're using an old and outdated tutorial. You'RE also not checking whether multiple files have been successfully transefered and using copy() for this purpose is not encouraged. See move_uploaded_files() which has an example about handling multiple uploads.
