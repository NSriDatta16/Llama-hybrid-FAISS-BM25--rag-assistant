Binding to IsolatedStorageFile variable AvailableFreeSpace in Silverlight

I am trying to display a simple text block that shows the value of AvailableFreeSpace from IsolatedStorage. That is: System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication().AvailableFreeSpace It needs to dynamically update as the available storage changes. I know this is probably basic but I can't figure out how to bind to this variable. Any hints?
