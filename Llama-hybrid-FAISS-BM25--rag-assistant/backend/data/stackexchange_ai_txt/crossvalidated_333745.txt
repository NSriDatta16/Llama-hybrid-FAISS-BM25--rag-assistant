Object classification is something very different from object detection/localization. I recommend you having a look at some papers that do object detection using neural networks. The prominent examples are: Faster RCNN Single Shot multibox Detector YOLO All of these networks have publicly available implementations in various neural network frameworks and there are also many blogs explaining them in detail.
