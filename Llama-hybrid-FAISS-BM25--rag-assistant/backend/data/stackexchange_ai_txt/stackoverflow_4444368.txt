From the MSDN documentation on SortedDictionary : The SortedDictionary generic class is a binary search tree with O(log n) retrieval, where n is the number of elements in the dictionary. From the docs on Dictionary : Retrieving a value by using its key is very fast, close to O(1), because the Dictionary class is implemented as a hash table. Therefore it should not be surprising that Dictionary can outperform SortedDictionary in many cases.
