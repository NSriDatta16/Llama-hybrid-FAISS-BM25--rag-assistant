As others mentioned, a decoupling/refactoring is in order here - stdafx.h is not meant to hold all header files your application has. Your problem is that renderengine.h also includes stdafx.h . This time the renderengine.h include is ignored due to #pragma once and rmodel.h is included next - at the top of renderengine.h . The simplest thing in your case would be to: remove renderengine.h & rmodel.h from stdafx.h rmodel.h includes renderengine.h ... done
