How to identify a country from a normalized phone number?

I have a list of international phone numbers and a List of Country calling codes . I would like to identify the Country from the numbers but I can't find a fast and elegant way to do it. Any idea? The only I got is to have an hardcoded check (Eg. "look at the first number, look at the second number: if it's X then check for the third number. If the second number is Y then the Country is Foo", etc.). I'm using PHP and a DB (MySQL) for the lists, but I think that any pseudocode will help.
