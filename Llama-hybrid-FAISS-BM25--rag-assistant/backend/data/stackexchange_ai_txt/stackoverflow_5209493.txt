Computers are really fast these days . An entire days-worth-of-stats can be generated lickity-split, even without using discrete formulas -- if the app isn't open then the pet doesn't need to "get hungrier" and any stats changes or "daily events" can be generated as soon as the application is active again -- no need to even worry about background events for an inactive application. However, I suspect that for a more friendly game would use additional "soft" logic to encourage the user to play with the pet without having it starve to death during a business meeting: it's a game and games can make their own rules as long as the user keeps playing. Happy coding.
