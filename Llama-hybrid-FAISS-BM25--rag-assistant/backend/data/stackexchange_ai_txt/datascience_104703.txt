One thing you can do is take all the features you consider to be important from a clustering point of view using your domain knowledge, and then use PCA to capture all the features which have high variance. Those are the features that you would use in the clustering algorithm. Here is a link that does that. Another article which although does not use PCA, but is an excellent article for different types of clustering. You can use PCA in this article if you want. The reason the articles you mention convert to 2 dimensions is because they want to visualize the clusters on a 2-d graph. We can instead convert the dataset into 3 dimension (i.e only 3 features) using PCA and plot them on a 3-d graph but that is the limit. Beyond 3 features, we cannot plot 4 features on a graph (for obvious reasons). But if you don't want to visualize the clusters, then you can take all the features with the highest variance and use them in your clustering algorithm. Cheers!
