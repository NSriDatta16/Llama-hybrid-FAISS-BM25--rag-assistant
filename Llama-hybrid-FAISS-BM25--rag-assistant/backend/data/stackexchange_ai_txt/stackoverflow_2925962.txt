The problem in this example is that there are two instances of dostuff , so the version being set to false in operator() is different then the one in main. From the thread management documentation : A new thread is launched by passing an object of a callable type that can be invoked with no parameters to the constructor. The object is then copied into internal storage, and invoked on the newly-created thread of execution. If the object must not (or cannot) be copied, then boost::ref can be used to pass in a reference to the function object. In this case, the user of Boost.Thread must ensure that the referred-to object outlives the newly-created thread of execution. If you don't want to copy the object, use boost::ref : thread t(boost::ref(doer), 4);
