While a number of answers have hinted at (what seems to me) the real problem, none has really given it directly. The real reason "smoke and mirrors" is an anti-pattern is that it's confusing the distinction between a prototype and a finished product. Creating a prototype is perfectly fine. One of the major problems that many (most?) of us have run into is managers saying something like "well, that seems to work well enough, let's ship it." Creating a prototype is usually a good thing -- but you must always be extremely careful both internally and (especially) to the outside world to be clear about the fact that it is a prototype, not a finished product. Management generally wants to believe that the prototype is a finished product (or at least can form the basis of one) anyway. Encouraging such a belief is a really bad thing.
