SimplePie html rssfeeds Codeigniter

I wanted to ask, I have a div that I would want to place RSS feeds from the BBC or CNN. Now that works but I wanted to paginate the feeds that come in, display 5 at a time with the others showing when the links are clicked. I am starting to write the code now but I was hoping I would get either inspiration or have an example I could glean from.
