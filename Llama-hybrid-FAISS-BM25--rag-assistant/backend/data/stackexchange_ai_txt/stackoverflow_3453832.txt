If you don't need an instance then 'terminate' it and you won't be billed. You can also persist an instance image to disk -- you'll only be billed for storage (cheap!), and you'll be able to restart your machine in the future, if need be. If you want to be able to easily stop and persist images, and also to quickly restart an image, then I strongly recommend that you stick only to EBS-backed machines. The other image types can be a hassle to stop, persist and restart, and can take up to 2 hours to launch.
