I don't know the specific reason you are finding JNLPAppletLauncher will not find your applet, but I can give some background: JNLPAppletLauncher was a signed jar designed to be usable with untrusted code. Mixing trusted and untrusted code like that is actually a vulnerability. Under the 6u19 mixed code fix, mixing code like this should cause a security warning dialog. The likes of the JNLPAppletLauncher jar should now be marked with Trusted-Library: true in the manifest. The code may need changes (cited in the question) to use the applet class-loader rather than the parent trusted-library class-loader. In order to avoid the security warning dialog appearing using certain pre-6u19 jars, some are recognised (using the same implementation as the blacklist feature) and are executed as if they had opted into the Trusted-Library feature. If you rebuild the jar, it will not be recognised and will require the manifest entry. Kind regards, Tom Hawtin
