I was looking into something similar recently and stumbled upon these papers: About "situations where the observed sample consists of a combination of correlated and uncorrelated data due to missing responses (partially correlated data).": Samawi, H.M., Yu, L., & Vogel, R. (2015). On some nonparametric tests for partially observed correlated data: Proposing new tests. Journal of Statistical Theory and Applications , 14(2), 131-155, available at http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/download_paper.php?id=23226 Editorial that mentions repeated measures data with data points missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR): Samawi, H.M., & Vogel, R. (2015). On inference of partially correlated data. Biometrics & Biostatistics International Journal, 1 (2), available at http://medcraveonline.com/BBIJ/BBIJ-02-00019.pdf " Partially correlated data are the result of a matched pair which is missing one of the two correlated values or when a subject in a repeated measures design is missing at least one of their repeated observations, but not all observations .": Hani M. Samawi & Robert Vogel (2014) Notes on two sample tests for partially correlated (paired) data, Journal of Applied Statistics , 41:1, 109-117, DOI: 10.1080/02664763.2013.830285 They didn't fit my case, so I didn't study them thoroughly enough to explain them properly. But hopefully these papers will bring you closer to your answer!
