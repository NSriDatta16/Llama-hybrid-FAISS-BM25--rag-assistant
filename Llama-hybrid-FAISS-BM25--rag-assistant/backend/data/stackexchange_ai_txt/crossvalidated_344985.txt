Fist of all, CV is not a feature selection algorithm. Rather, stepwise selection is used, and CV is used to validate its results. In general the methods you mentioned don't have to yield similar results. If you want to try LASSO without the interpretation difficulties, you may run a LASSO model first, and then run a non-regularized Logistic regression only on the features with non-zero coefficients from the LASSO model.
