IIRC, the Delphi memory manager does not immediately return free'd memory to the OS. Memory is allocated in chunks of small, medium and large sizes, called blocks. These blocks are kept for a while after their contents have been disposed to have them readyly available when another allocation is requested afterwards. This limits the amount of system calls required for succesive allocation of multiple objects, and helps avoiding heap fragmentation.
