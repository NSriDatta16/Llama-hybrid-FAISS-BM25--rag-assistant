A partition is a division of a storage device described in the partition map, which may contain a volume. A volume comprises the bytes that contain a filesystem. An unpartitioned device, such as a floppy, contains a volume but does not contain a partition. I've never heard of "segment." Google gives http://evms.sourceforge.net/terminology.html , which defines that as any logically contiguous range of sectors.
