Calculus with quadratic B-spline

After fitting a quadratic B-spline in R with the cobs package : Rbs I would like to do some calculus on the fitted splines, like calculating the derivative, or the average value on an interval (which is linked to its integral). For exemple I got : > Rbs $knots [1] 1 40 100 > Rbs$ coef [1] 1 2 3 5 > Rbs$degree [1] 2 How one would go to build a B-spline approximated function with knots and coefficients ? (note that I looked at https://github.com/cran/cobs/blob/master/R/splines.R for the predict function but couldn't find exactly where it is build and how). For derivative and integral, is there any easy way to find their expression based on those knots and coefficients, to express them in terms of knots and coefficients ?
