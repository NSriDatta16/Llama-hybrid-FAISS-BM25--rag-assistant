Looking at the SoapAnyUri constructor with Reflector, it doesn't perform any validation at all. The anyURI data type is defined as follows : [Definition:] anyURI represents a Uniform Resource Identifier Reference (URI). An anyURI value can be absolute or relative, and may have an optional fragment identifier (i.e., it may be a URI Reference). This type should be used to specify the intention that the value fulfills the role of a URI as defined by [RFC 2396], as amended by [RFC 2732]. So you can simply use Uri.TryCreate with UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute to verify that a string represents a valid value: Uri uri; bool valid = Uri.TryCreate(anyUriValue, UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute, out uri);
