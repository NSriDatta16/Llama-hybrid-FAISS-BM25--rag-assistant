Optimal way to create a feature set?

I have a time series data (say weather data for each day for one week) that changes at each time step. Along with this, I have some data that is fixed (eg - the latitude and longitude of this place where weather measurements were taken). Is it wise to repeat this fixed data at each time point to train my LSTM family model?
