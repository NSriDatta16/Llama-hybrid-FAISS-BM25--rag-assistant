How and where should I store my own YUI3 JavaScript files?

I'm planning to write some JavaScript modules that should be loaded with YUI3. How should I organize my files and folders? Is there a recommended folder structure? If I store my files similar to the "core" or the "gallery" there should be an easy loading - or not? Do I have to list every single module in the "YUI().use ..." call if I store my scripts in the following way? de-mylib-www/mymodules/mod1/mod1-base.js de-mylib-www/mymodules/mod2/mod2-base.js de-mylib-www/mymodules/mod3/mod3-base.js de-mylib-www/mymodules/mod3/mod3-class1.js de-mylib-www/mymodules/mod3/mod3-class2.js
