Difference between CoxPH and logistic regression; data preparation for each model

I'm working on a research project of which the objective is to predict the customer churn probability in the next month. We have a dataset of monthly records for each customer with variables including (the list below is not exhaustive): month : month customer_id : customer ID tenure : number of months the customer has stayed gender : whether the customer is a male or a female churn : whether the customer churned or not A part of the dataset looks like: month customer_id tenure gender ... churn 1 2022-01 1 6 1 1 2 2022-01 2 15 1 0 3 2022-01 3 12 0 0 4 2022-02 2 16 1 0 5 2022-02 3 13 0 0 5 2022-02 4 0 1 0 6 2022-03 2 17 1 0 7 2022-03 3 14 0 1 8 2022-03 4 1 1 0 Currently, I have problems with model selection and data preparation. Problem 1: should I choose a CoxPH model (Cox proportional hazards model) or a logistic regression model? CoxPH : the tenure variable can be considered as time to event (churn) and we can also easily determine if a record is censored. Then with the survival function $S(t \mid x) = S_0(t)^{\exp(x^\top \beta)}$ , we calculate the probability of survival (non-churn) at time $t$ for a customer. Logistic regression : the logistic regression seems also suitable for this case. The tenure will be an explanatory variable and the churn will be the target variable. Problem 2: how should I prepare data for a model? If we choose Cox regression, we need and select only one line (maybe the last one) for each individual customer. So that would be like: month customer_id tenure gender ... churn 1 2022-01 1 6 1 1 6 2022-03 2 17 1 0 7 2022-03 3 14 0 1 8 2022-03 4 1 1 0 If we choose logistic regression, we fit the model with all data rows (every month for every customer). Am I thinking correctly about the problems?
