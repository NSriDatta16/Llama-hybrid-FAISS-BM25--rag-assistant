No no no, with all due respect to Josh Bloch, never throw an AssertionError unless it's from an assertion. If you want an AssertionError here, throw it with assert(false) . Then someone reading the code can find it later. Even better, define your own exception, say CantInstantiateUtilityClass . then you'll have code that says try { // some stuff } catch (CantInstantiateUtilityClass e) { // react } so that the reader of the catcher knows what happened. Let me just note that the standard still defines AssertionError as the result of a failed assertion, not as what some beginner thinks ought to be thrown in place of a well-defined informative exception. Sadly, good exception discipline is perhaps the least encouraged skill in Java programming.
