$B$ is not a number or a matrix. It's an operator . You can think of it as a function, or a mapping: it takes a time series and backshifts them, $Bx_t=x_{t-1}$ . We could have used functional notation, $f(x_t) = x_{t-1}$ , it's just that $B$ (for "backshift") became more common, and that by convention we do not use brackets. (Incidentally, sometimes you also see a nabla $\nabla$ instead of $B$ .) So just like for any function $g$ you can define the function $3g$ by $$(3g)(x):=3\times g(x),$$ i.e., multiply functions by a scalar, you can also multiply $B$ by a scalar: $$3Bx_t = 3\times (Bx_t) = 3x_{t-1}.$$ And just as we can concatenate functions, $$f^2(x) = f\circ f(x) = f\big(f(x)\big), $$ we can concatenate the backshift operator: $$B^2x_t=B(Bx_t)=Bx_{t-1}=x_{t-2}. $$ So in your example, $d$ is presumably some scalar variable, like the $3$ above. So $$\bigg(1-dB+ \dfrac{d(d-1)}{2!}B^{2}\bigg)x_t = x_t-dBx_t+\dfrac{d(d-1)}{2!}B^{2}x_t= x_t-dx_{t-1} +\dfrac{d(d-1)}{2!}x_{t-2}.$$
