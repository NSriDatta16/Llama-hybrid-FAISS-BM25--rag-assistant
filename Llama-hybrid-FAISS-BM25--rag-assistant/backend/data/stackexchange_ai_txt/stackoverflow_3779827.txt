My personal suggestion if you are after maturity and support would be Processing - very flexible, open source, well documented and a great community . Syntax is C-like so you should have no difficulty picking it up. One slightly more cutting edge solution that looks very promising (but I haven't got round to testing yet!) is Penumbra - a Clojure library for OpenGL development in a dynamic functional programming style. Here's a elegant little snippet: (enable :light0) (push-matrix (translate 0 0 -10) (draw-quads (vertex 0 0 0) (vertex 0 1 0) (vertex 1 1 0) (vertex 1 0 0))) Note that thanks to lots of Clojure macro cleverness, it automatically and transparently handles things like popping the transformation matrices at the right time. Other things that look good are things like GPGPU support.
