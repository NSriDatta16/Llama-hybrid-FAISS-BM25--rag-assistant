How come I can find hundreds of examples of jquery slideshow navigation and zero w/ prototype/scriptaculous?

magento comes bundled with scriptaculous so I figured I'd use those for a simple slideshow with navigation to jump between slides. -what a mistake, I can't find anything other than pause/play controls. Why? EDIT: To clarify what I mean by "jump between slides" is - i'm looking for buttons like 1 2 3 4 NOT pause, prev, next.
