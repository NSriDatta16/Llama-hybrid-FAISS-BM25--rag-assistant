Honestly I wouldn't persist the data in the field, I'd do it in an array. function AddToHiddenField(source, hdnFieldId) { //create storage if it doesn't exist if (typeof(window.hiddenFieldData)=='undefined') { window.hiddenFieldData = []; } var srcList = document.getElementById(source); for(var i=0, n=srcList.length, value; i Rule of thumb: if you have to deserialise a string to maintain integrity, you shouldn't be using a string as data storage. note: if your original source was in a hidden field for some reason, I'd still do it like this but I'd init my array with a string.split
