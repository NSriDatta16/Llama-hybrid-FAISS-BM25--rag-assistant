Happens when your destructor or error handler throws an exception. That can happen for multiple reasons depending on your exact setup and method for session storage you're using. For example the session directory is not writeable or does not exist, database is not accessible or fields are invalid, redis does not respond, etc. So, check your settings and look for something that would prevent saving the session data. More elaborate description can be found here .
