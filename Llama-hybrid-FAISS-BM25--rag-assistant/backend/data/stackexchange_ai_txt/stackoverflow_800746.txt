simple RoR forum to integrate into my application?

Wanted to know if someone had a suggestion on code or maybe there's a plugin (!) which would allow very basic forum functionality that I can integrate into my application so that it is single sign-on? Otherwise...maybe a tutorial on how to build one from scratch and I just leverage our existing authentication? Thanks! I looked at the following thread but no answer was selected so just checking: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2549/what-is-good-forum-software-to-add-to-an-existing-rails-application Hi, did more research, this so far seems to be the best, anyone had experience and a sample site I can check out? http://github.com/radar/rboard/tree/master Has anyone worked with this plugin? http://github.com/bscofield/bagpipes/tree/master
