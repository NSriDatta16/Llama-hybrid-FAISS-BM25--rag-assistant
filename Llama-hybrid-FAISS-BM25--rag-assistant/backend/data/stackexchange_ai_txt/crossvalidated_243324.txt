Stuck on a Monte Carlo Simulation of Confidence Intervals

I'm trying to run a Monte Carlo simulation to check the coverage of Wald confidence interval, with n=40, p=0.2, and nominal confidence levels of 95%, with 10,000 simulation runs. I need to calculate the empirical coverage. I am not sure what I actually need to do to answer. I think I have the majority of it done, but I'm not sure on how to complete it. n After running this I have 10,000 upper limits and 10,000 lower limits, should my next step be to average each one?
