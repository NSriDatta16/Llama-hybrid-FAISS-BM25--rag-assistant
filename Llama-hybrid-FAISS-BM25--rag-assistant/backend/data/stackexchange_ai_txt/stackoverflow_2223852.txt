You can maximize the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): BIC(C | X) = L(X | C) - (p / 2) * log n where L(X | C) is the log-likelihood of the dataset X according to model C , p is the number of parameters in the model C , and n is the number of points in the dataset. See "X-means: extending K -means with efficient estimation of the number of clusters" by Dan Pelleg and Andrew Moore in ICML 2000. Another approach is to start with a large value for k and keep removing centroids (reducing k) until it no longer reduces the description length. See "MDL principle for robust vector quantisation" by Horst Bischof, Ales Leonardis, and Alexander Selb in Pattern Analysis and Applications vol. 2, p. 59-72, 1999. Finally, you can start with one cluster, then keep splitting clusters until the points assigned to each cluster have a Gaussian distribution. In "Learning the k in k -means" (NIPS 2003), Greg Hamerly and Charles Elkan show some evidence that this works better than BIC, and that BIC does not penalize the model's complexity strongly enough.
