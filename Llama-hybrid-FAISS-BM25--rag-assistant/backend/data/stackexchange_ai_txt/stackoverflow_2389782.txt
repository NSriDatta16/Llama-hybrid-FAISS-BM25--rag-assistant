The only thoughts I have are either the interviewer expected printing month strings, ignoring locale using your own const char array of month names, or one of those ill-defined " interactive " questions where you are suppose to stop and keep asking questions to clarify what the interviewer actually wants. Explicitly you want to express that you want to know what type of answer the interviewer is looking for. For example, just a short code fragment, ignoring details like error-checking and locale or reentrant issues, or an answer for some non-standard embedded or legacy environment, looking for another Standard C Library functions (ctime??), or a platform/OS specific answer? ObCode: const char* months[] = { "Jan", "Feb", ..., "Dec" }; ... printf("Month: %s\n", months[i]); Or if a wildly "lateral thinker" on a Unix/Linux system: char str[PATH_MAX]; ... assert(i >= 0 && i Pure bad idea. :)
