Of course you can do a fit on a moving average. That is your right. But the statistical diagnostics are not reliable anymore. The reason is that the IID property required in standard OLS are violated when you apply plain regression on a quantity that is highly autocorrelated. Your $r^2$ will be artificially high and will insinuate a false sense of statistical significance. Think about this case, instead of a moving average do a linear fit on your original data in time first. And then do it a gain, you will get 100% $r^2$ . These models are not reliable ex-ante predictors and will have very low out-of-sample qualities.
