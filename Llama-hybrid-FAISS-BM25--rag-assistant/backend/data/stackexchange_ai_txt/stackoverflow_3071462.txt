Cookie not accepted on IE when authenticating with Graph API (oauth) - iframe app

I started playing with the new graph api with the python sdk. I'm trying to use the python-sdk in an iframe app to make the authentication (I successfully did it with JS - although the popup is blocked on IE and chrome by default). I'm following this example: http://github.com/facebook/python-sdk/blob/master/examples/oauth/facebookoauth.py It works on chrome and firefox, but in safari and IE it only works if I set the cookie permissions in the browser to the lowest possible (which is impractical for average users) Any ideas ?
