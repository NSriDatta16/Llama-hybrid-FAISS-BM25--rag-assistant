Optimal way for django template to get random line from included file

I want to add a random slogan to my base template. I realize the easy way to do this is to have a db table with my slogans, get a random one, and pass it to the template. The question is, how do I do it without using the db? In my base template, I want to include a file with a bunch of slogans, one on each line, and have the template randomly pick one. I know the random filter will pick a random value from a list, so somehow, I need to include the slogan file, but as a list.
