Shared network folders usage by PHP scripts - is this possible from outside the domain?

I am having the following difficulties: Three servers A,B,C : A,B in the same network domain; C in another. PHP scripts executing on server A write to a shared folder on server B. The same scripts executing on server C fail to write to server B. PHP looks something like this: oject->Output('\\\\serverB\\sharedfolder\\file.dummy'); Is there any way I can make this script work elegantly on server C? When I remote-desktop to server C and want to see the contents of \\serverB\sharedfolder , a login prompt pops up and asks for a user name and password. This I can provide and subsequently access the shared folder on server B. But how could I do this from a PHP script? Is it possible?
