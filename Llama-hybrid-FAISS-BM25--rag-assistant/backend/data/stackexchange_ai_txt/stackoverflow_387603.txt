Lightweight Store Mechanisms

I'm about to write a small utility to organze and tag my mp3s. What is the best way to store small amounts of data. More importantly, are there databases which exist where I don't need to install a client/server environment, I just include the library and I'm good? I could use XML, but I'm afraid that the file size would become large and hard to handle, not to mention keeping the memory footprint small. Thanks EDIT: I haven't decided on the language, I wanted to make my decision independent of platform. If I had to choose, most likely .NET, second Java, third C++. My apologies, this is for a Windows App.
