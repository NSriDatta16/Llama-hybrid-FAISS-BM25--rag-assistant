Best way to offload heavy processing (like image resizing) out of PHP request

I'm working on a PHP web interface that will receive huge traffic. Some insert/update requests will contain images that will have to be resized to some common sizes to speed up their further retrieval. One way to do it is probably to set up some asynchronous queue on the server. Eg. set up a table in a db with a tasks queue that would be populated by PHP requests and let some other process on the server watch the table and process any waiting tasks. How would you do that? What would be the proper environment for that long running process? Java, or maybe something lighter would do?
