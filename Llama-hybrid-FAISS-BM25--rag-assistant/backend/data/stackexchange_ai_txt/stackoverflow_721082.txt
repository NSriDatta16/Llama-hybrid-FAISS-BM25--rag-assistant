Django sees the object internally as having two spaces (judging by the two underscores and two spaces in the repr output). The fact that it only shows up with one space in the template is just how HTML works. Notice how, in the question you just asked, most of the places where you entered two spaces, only one is showing up? From the HTML4 Spec : In particular, user agents should collapse input white space sequences when producing output inter-word space. As S.Lott suggested, you can verify that my guess is correct by adding debug logging, or using the Firebug plugin for Firefox or something similar, to see exactly what's getting sent to the browser. Then you'll know for sure on which end the problem lies. If multiple spaces are really important to you, you'll need to use the &nbsp; entity, though I don't know offhand how you'd get Django to encode the output of that specific object using them.
