I don't know Excel charting ( Jon Peltier's site is a good resource for Excel) but you should be able to apply some preprocessing and get Excel to make something like the chart below as a Gantt chart or horizontal stacked bar chart. In my fake data, I encoded each time slice as one of three states, each corresponding to a different color: no error, lone error, error coincident with other errors.
