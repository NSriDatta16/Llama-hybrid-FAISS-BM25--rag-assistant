I found Melanie Mitchell's book, An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms , to be very good. For a wider coverage of evolutionary computation topics, Introduction to Evolutionary Computing by Eiben and Smith is also worthwhile. If you're just starting out, I recently wrote an introductory article that may be of use. There are further links both in that article and also on the home page for my evolutionary computation framework.
