posix pthreads in c

Iam new to c programming and needs some help. long *taskids[NUM_THREADS]; for(t=0; t This code fragment demonstrates how to pass a simple integer to each thread. The calling thread uses a unique data structure for each thread, insuring that each thread's argument remains intact throughout the program. Iam not able to understand how this is happening can somebody explain it??
