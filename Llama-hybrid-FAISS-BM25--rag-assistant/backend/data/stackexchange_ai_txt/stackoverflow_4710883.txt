#Jiglib AS3#Away3d press down event listener on object3d

My personal project uses Away3D as 3D engine and Jiglib as physic engine. And Jiglib supports Away3D as a plug-in just like PaperVision3D. Basically, I managed to create cubes bouncing and colliding with each other. However, I need more user interactive whenever user press down on the cube, in more specific term: able to throw away or drag the cube when user hold down to the cube. In Jiglib combined with PaperVision3D, some managed to do that by using: mesh.addEventListener(InteractiveScene3DEvent.OBJECT_PRESS, objectPressHandler); private function objectPressHandler(event:InteractiveScene3DEvent):void { //get ref. pActive = event.displayObject3D; //create constriant jMouseConstraint = new MouseConstraint(pActive, new Number3D(0, 0, 1), camera, viewport); //add listener for mouse up. stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, removeMouseConstraint); } private function removeMouseConstraint(e:MouseEvent):void { //kill listener stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, removeMouseConstraint); //kill the contraint jMouseConstraint.destroy(); //garbage jMouseConstraint = null; } However I don't know how to achieve the same thing with Jiglib combined with Away3D. Any help?
