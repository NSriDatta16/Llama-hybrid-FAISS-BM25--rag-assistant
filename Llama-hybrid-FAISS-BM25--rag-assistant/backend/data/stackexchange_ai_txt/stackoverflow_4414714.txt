You may still need to tell XCode where to find the header files for the kal.h library. Go to Project->Edit Project Settings. Select the "build" tab. Scroll down to the Search Paths. **Double clicking User Header Search Paths brings a dialog box. NOTE: In Xcode 4 I found that you actually need to add the path to "Header Search Path" NOT "User Header Search Path" Drag directories from Finder into the dialog box or click the + button to add manually. ** I've not really gotten the hang of xcode yet so Im putting the same search paths in Framework, Header and User Header. So far it's worked out fine, but I shall expect (and deserve) a scolding from the xcode savvy individuals for such behavior.
