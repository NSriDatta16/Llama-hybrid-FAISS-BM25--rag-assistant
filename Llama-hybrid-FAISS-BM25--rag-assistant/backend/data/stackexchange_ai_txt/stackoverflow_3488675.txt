How can JVM implementations like Jython and JRuby beat their native counterparts?

I was watching this video here , where Robert Nicholson discusses P8, an implementation of PHP on the JVM. At some point he mentions that they aim to surpass native PHP in performance some time in the future. He mentions JRuby and Jython, which started out slower than their native counterparts, but eventually surpassed them. Quercus, another PHP interpreter on the JVM claims to be 4x faster than mod_php and is also worth of note. Does that mean that the general idea that the JVM is slower than C is wrong, or are there flaws in the original C implementations?
