how to choose classifer

is the best way to create the most accurate classifier to train a bunch of classifying algorithms like ANN, SVM, KNN, etc, and test different parameters to get optimal parameters for each classifier, and see which classifier has the least testing error? Or is it better to use ensemble method and choose the "majority" decision of different kinds of trained classifiers?
