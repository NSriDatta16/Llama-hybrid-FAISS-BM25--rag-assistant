Psychotik's and Amjad Masad's are both right - depending on the situation. Typically the less separate resources to download, the better. One thing you want to keep it mind is that if you always aggregate all files you are not going to leverage the full benefits of caching, or end up loading more JavaScript than needed. For instance, if you have a site consisting of multiple pages (eg. not one RIA / Web application) you would typically not want to aggregate your common scripts together with your per-page custom scripts. I usually create a common.js containing the JS toolkit of choice and scripts used on every page, and an aggregated bundle for each page (or per component in the case of complex RIA / Web Applications). Compressing related pieces of JavaScript in separate bundles allows for optimal caching while still having a minimal amount of client/server interaction.
