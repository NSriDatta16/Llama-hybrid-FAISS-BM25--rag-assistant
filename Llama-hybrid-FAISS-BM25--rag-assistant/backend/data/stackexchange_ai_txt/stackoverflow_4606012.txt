You will have to create that organization manually. In this case, you would have to Remove the "Test" project from the solution; Rename the Test/Test folder to Test/src; Add the project back to the solution.

It is good practice to do that because that ensures that your project is self-contained - it does not depend on files from other external folders and it carries the correct version of the dependencies.
