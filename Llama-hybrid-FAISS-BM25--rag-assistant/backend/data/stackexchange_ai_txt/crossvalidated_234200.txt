Learning WinBUGS programming for network meta-analysis

I'm currently interested in learning NMA using WinBUGS. I studied the general concepts behind multiple treatment comparisons and i have a good base on classic pair-wise meta-analysis. I can also do a network meta-analysis using the frequentist approach with the netmeta R package. However i see that most of the publications are based on WinBUGS models within a bayesian approach, i tried learning alone WinBUGS programming but I can't find a good place where to start and I can't afford workshops because I'm still a student. Can someone recommend a good pathway for learning NMA programming with WinBUGS?
