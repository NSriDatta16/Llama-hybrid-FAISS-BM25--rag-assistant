I guess if you're looking for a one-liner, one-liner find -name "*.java" -exec sed -i \ -e 's/private static final Logger \([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*).*$/private static final Logger \1 = LoggerFactory.make()/g' \ -e 's/import org\.apache\.log4j\.Logger;/&\nimport path.to.LoggerFactory;/g' \ {} \; I would back up your code before trying this. It's probably broken in a couple places, but with a few corrections will get you what you're looking for. If you're using svn or something, you'll have to tweak find to exclude the .svn directories, otherwise your commits will be really messed up. The gist: don't even bother trying to capture class names. Incorporate the solution indirectly linked to by Alexander . But replace your initial Logger declarations with factory calls. The only thing you need to capture is the name of the local variable. Then you need to find where your imports are, which I'm assuming you can do pretty exactly because you're importing log4j (or java.util.logging ). Find that import statement and import your factory right below it. BTW, all the warnings you're getting about automating this are correct and equally apply to this solution. You need to be prepared to javac everything right after trying this at the very least. Really, you should have some test suites with monster code coverage to automatically run at this point.
