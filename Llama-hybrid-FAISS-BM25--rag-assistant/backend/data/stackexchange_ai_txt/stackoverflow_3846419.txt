Apart from what the comments already said, you can't have two header files include each other. There is no reason for Agent.h to include Environment.h, so if a .cpp file includes Agent.h first, it'll fail (since it will first go through Environment.h, which requires Agent). IF you have a situation where two header files depend on each other's definitions, use forward declarations where you can, or split your header files up into more header files.
