Preferences (including SharedPreferences) are stored in files under your application's private data directory. No other application can read or write there, unless the phone has been rooted. This internal storage is flash-based and survives the phone being turned off... not much would work if it didn't. :) As a general security principle you should never store a password. Secure systems store and compare password hashes , not the passwords themselves. It's fine to store application state in preference data... personally I'd read it in onCreate() and thereafter write the value back to preferences either at the point it changes or in onPause().
