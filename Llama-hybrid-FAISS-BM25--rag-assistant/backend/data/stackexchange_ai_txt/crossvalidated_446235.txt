First, I'd try to answer the questions. Are the cost/distance relationships between each lane statistically different? If yes, are the differences large enough to matter for our application / problem? If no, use the aggregated data. Otherwise, we need to do some simple thought experiments to see what using aggregated / non-aggregated data means. Suppose 50% of lanes cost \$10/km and 50% \$2/km. The average would be \$6/km. But does this mean anything for making predictions? I'd say a \$6/km prediction for a previously unseen lane is wrong. If all lanes are similar, than it's either going to cost \$10/km or \$2/km. But the average of hundreds of new lanes will be close to \$6/km. Using aggregated or non-aggregated data answers different questions. Hope this helps a little.
