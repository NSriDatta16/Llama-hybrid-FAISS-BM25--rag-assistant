Other answers are more elegant and efficient, but the easy way out is change the file extension from .js to .cfm as such: The createUuid() is there to prevent caching, assuming file output will differ, most likely based on variables from the session scope. The client loads this as JavaScript, while the server processes it as ColdFusion. You can do the same thing with style sheets as well. Now, if your JavaScript depends on values from the calling page you can pass them along on the URL: In this situation you can actually can take advantage of caching when the same URL parameters are passed. Overall, this approach can be a lot less effort than refactoring code to keep the .js file "pure", while outputting variables it depends upon in a block beforehand.
