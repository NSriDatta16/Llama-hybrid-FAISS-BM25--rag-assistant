There are a number of methodologies for eliciting expert knowledge. E.g. one example is SHELF (that one e.g. has the associated SHELF R package), but there are also others like the Cooke performance-based method or Delphi . These try to obtain a full distribution, to varying degrees try to account for the usual human biases (e.g. too narrow uncertainty, anchoring etc.) and vary in complexity of implementation. I would guess any of those could be applied to specific forecasting problems. If you directly asked for the forecasts of interest, you might be done after an elicitation. Otherwise, you may want to combine distributions for different parameters (based on elicitation, previous data/modeling and/or known information) through simulation (presumably would have to be bespoke for your problem) or Bayesian MCMC sampling (e.g. general MCMC sampler like Stan and the rstan package may serve you well here).
