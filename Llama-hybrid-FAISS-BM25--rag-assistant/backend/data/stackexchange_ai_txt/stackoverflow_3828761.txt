Instead of while (i didn't you mean while (i More Edit: That's actually ok, i overlook the * in the assignment. Edit: Some more things: there is no check that the range of int is not exceeded in getNum there is no check in getLine that more than 7 values are read (which would blow int line[7] the matrix calculation in my opinion assumes that there are 3 values read, getLine can deliver up to 7 matrix[i+(3*j)] = *(point+(i+(3*j))); ?? point is only 7 int big!!! so for the second value it will read beyond defined data. Shouldn't it read matrix[i+(3*j)] = point[i]; hth Mario BTW: I strongly recommend: resort to std-lib functions better naming (i and j in the same source are strongly discouraged)
