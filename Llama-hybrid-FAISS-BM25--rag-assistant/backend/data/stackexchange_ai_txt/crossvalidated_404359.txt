The question is actually relating to the identifiability of mixtures : if $$\rho_0 f(x;\theta_{00})+(1-\rho_0) f(x;\theta_{01}) = \rho_1 f(x;\theta_{10})+(1-\rho_1) f(x;\theta_{11})$$ this means that two mixtures produce the same sampling distribution, i.e., that the mixture is not identifiable. There exists a consequent literature on the topic, from Teichler (1961) who shows that a mixture is identifiable if and only if there exist $x_1$ , and $x_2$ such that $$\left|\begin{matrix} F(x_1;\theta_{00}) &F(x_1;\theta_{01})\\F(x_2;\theta_{00}) &F(x_2;\theta_{01})\\\end{matrix}\right|\ne 0$$ As a consequence, he shows that all Gaussian and Gamma mixtures are identifiable. Therefore, in this settings, imposing the condition \begin{equation} F_{01}(c)\times \rho_0+F_{00}(c)\times (1-\rho_0)=F_{11}(c)\times \rho_1+F_{10}(c)\times (1-\rho_1) \end{equation} implies that the components are equal two by two, e.g. $$\rho_0=\rho_1\quad F_{01}=F_{11}\quad F_{00}=F_{10}$$ or $$\rho_0=1-\rho_1\quad F_{01}=F_{10}\quad F_{00}=F_{11}$$ This is thus no an issue with MCMC but with the constraints themselves.
