Divs and spans are kind like wildcard tags that have no semantic meaning. You can use them to group or identify elements when no other tag is appropriate (like tables, lists or headings). Their differences are: div it's a block level element default display property is block which means: its as wide as its container always makes line breaks before and after can contain other block level elements like p , h1 , table , ul , blockquote , div can contain other inline elements like img , strong , em , input , a , span span is an inline element default display property is inline which means: is as narrow as its content does not makes any line break if not necessary) you can use the css property vertical-align with it can not contain block level elements can contain other inline elements like img , strong , em , input , a , span You can always change their default display property with css, but you cannot change the type of elements they can contain, regardless of the display property value. For instance: this will be displayed like a div, but still cannnot contain block level elements Because they are "generic" tags, they're usually used for microformats in conjunction with classes. For instance: 555-5555 , because there is no tag. As for the image wrapping, if the image is directly related to the text, you could use: Long paragraph. And no divs or spans would be required. However, if it is not, then you could use: unrelated to the image Long paragraph. Here div is necessary because p is a block level element. Finally, for more information you can check the official W3C spec topic about divs and spans.
