A model is built on a specific set of features, which may include categorical features encoded using one-hot encoding. If you have new data with additional categories, your model has no idea how to interpret the significance of those categories. You should either map the new value to none of the 1-hot values identified in training, or to an 'other' value. For example, say you trained on data that had color=[blue,green]. Your one-hot fields would have color_blue and color_green. You could also have a field called color=other, that you might use to encode very infrequent values. That's a data preparation choice. So for 'red', you could encode that as either: color_green = 0 color_blue = 0 or color_green = 0 color_blue = 0 color_other = 1 Using either of these techniques will work with xgboost, but as xgboost only accepts numeric inputs, you will have to choose one of these methods as a data pre-processing step.
