Linear Regression aims to separate the data that is linearly separable, yes you may use additional third> degree polynomials but in that way you indicated again some assumptions about the data you have since you define the objective function's structure. In Neural Net. generally you have input layer that creates the linear separators for the data you have and hidden layer ANDs the regions that bounds some classes and last layer ORs all these regions. In that way all the data you have is able to be classified with non linear way, also all these process is going with internally learned weights and defined functions. In addition increasing the feature number for Linear Regression is opposed to "Curse of dimensionality". In addition some applications need more probabilistic results than constant numbers as output. Thus a NN with logistic function will be more suitable for such purposes (Of course there is also logistic regression suffers form the facts I told).
