For account creation, you may want to use Captchas. I personally am not terribly fond of them and I don't think they are that effective. But if you use them, I strongly suggest you use a service instead of trying to whip up your own. Re-captcha comes to mind. Not sure if there are wrappers for Ruby or Rails, though. To prevent spam content , however, I strongly suggest Defensio (disclaimer: I've worked there in the past). It uses state of the art spam filtering techniques like what's used for email, such as bayesian filtering. There are plugins for many blogging platforms, including Mephisto (made with Rails). The API is simple and you can look in a few places to get working examples of how to use it with Ruby.
