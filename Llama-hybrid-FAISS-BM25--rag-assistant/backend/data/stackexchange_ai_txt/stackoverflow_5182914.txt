I noticed you asked a similar question yesterday and I looked at it then but couldn't really work out what you wanted to achieve. I have had some more time to think about it and do some research and have a solution. Credit to Robert Biggs on his post on css3wizardry for a solution building the slider and thumb from tags and prototype . But since you wanted an HTML5 solution I have attempted to do the same with that element. Please have a look at the demo . Note that it uses jQuery events , but currently only updates the background-color on the mousedown . It is not initialized correctly and also does not update the colour on mousemove but thought it would be a good exercise to implement that yourself :) The demo works on Chrome 11 and Safari 5. Please also read this comment and the comments on your previous question about the drawbacks of styling form elements.
