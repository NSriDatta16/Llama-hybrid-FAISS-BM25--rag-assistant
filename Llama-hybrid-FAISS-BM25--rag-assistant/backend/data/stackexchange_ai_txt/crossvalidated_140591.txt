OK, then... It's either start a bounty, or think really hard, and continue with what seems to be a budding tradition of answering my own questions - hopefully it can help someone else out there. Picking up on Chris Novak's suggestion, here it goes: tab In this way the table created would behave as follows... Let's call on tab[849:856,] : pair Method.A pos 849 425 1 1 850 425 0 0 851 426 1 1 852 426 0 0 853 427 1 0 854 427 0 1 855 428 1 0 856 428 0 1 The "pos" column transitions after pair 426 from 1 - 0, 1 - 0 to 0 - 1, 0 - 1. The first pattern aligns the "1's" in the "Method.A" column with the "1's" in the "pos" column. The "Method.A" acts as a dummy variable, and "counts" the positives in the second cell of the contingency table (positive Method.A / negative Method.B). After pair 427 we are in the third cell, where Method.A is negative, and that is coded in the offset between the "1's" in "Method.A" and "pos" columns. Following this, we can apply the suggested conditional logistic regression clogit in the package {survival} with the results: fit |z|) pos -0.38006 0.68382 0.09515 -3.994 6.48e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 pos 0.6838 1.462 0.5675 0.824 Rsquare= 0.008 (max possible= 0.5 ) Likelihood ratio test= 16.24 on 1 df, p=5.566e-05 Wald test = 15.96 on 1 df, p=6.485e-05 Score (logrank) test = 16.15 on 1 df, p=5.857e-05 So now I only need to interpret these results. To do this, I just changed the values in the table randomly (I don't have some elegant code with for loop, but it would be welcome), realizing that the exp(coef) in the output of clogit fulfills: Method.B Method.A pos neg pos a b neg c d $exp(coef) = b/c = odds\,ratio\,McNemar's\,exact\,test.$ And the interpretation would be the odds ratio of the odds of getting a positive result with Method.A conditioned on Method.B being negative ($b/d$) over the odds of obtaining a positive results with Method.B conditioning on Method.A being negative ($c/d$), which nicely returns the ratio of $b/c$. So clogit in this very peculiar setting may be equivalent to performing a mcnemar.exact {exact2x2} (?).
