I've got it! I had this issue just a few minutes ago... what it is, is ... well... maybe it's easier to show. Tell firebug to load in a new window, and it should go away. If not, then read on and I'll try to describe what's going on. You see how the correct view had two panes? A 'quickview' is on the right. What's happened, is that pane somehow go dragged all the way to the left. If you hover your mouse over on the left hand side of the pane, you should be able to drag the pane back to the right. The separator between the panes is almost invisible when you drag it to far to either side, so you just need to make sure you don't do it. That said, it makes a great prank on other developers who don't notice it... mwahahahaha.
