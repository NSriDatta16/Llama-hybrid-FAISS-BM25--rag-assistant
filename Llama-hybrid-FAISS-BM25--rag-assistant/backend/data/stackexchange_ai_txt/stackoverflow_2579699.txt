Here is what I ended up with for a C++ development environment on Windows 7. Compiler & libraries Nuwen MinGW Distro . It includes the Boost libraries which are necessary for the unit testing framework. A big thanks to Stephan T. Lavavej for making this distribution available. Debugger The GNU debugger as built for Windows . I copied the file gdb.exe into my C:\MinGW\bin folder and it worked well. Thanks for Equation Solution for providing win32 and win64 binaries of the GDB executable. IDE Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers . Unit testing framework CUTE (C++ Automated Unit Testing Easier). Download the Eclipse plug-in using Eclipse’s software installation . Add this URL to “Available Software Sites”: http://ifs.hsr.ch/cute/updatesite. The CUTE Website has excellent installation and usage instructions. I failed to find a round-trip modeling tool that was useful to me. Exploring free UML tools was like wandering through a city that had been bombed. Dozens of projects stood in various states of usability. Some projects were clearly active, some were clearly abandoned, but most were somewhere in between. Visio continues to be my pragmatic choice for creating UML models.
