How would one carry out principal component analysis in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic space?

This is a follow up to a comment by @whuber in response to this question: Is there an extension of PCA for data embedded in hyperbolic spaces? Sorry, I would have posted it there as a comment but it required 50 reputation points. What property of the Beltrami-Klein model makes it more suitable for PCA than any of the other models of hyperbolic geometry?
