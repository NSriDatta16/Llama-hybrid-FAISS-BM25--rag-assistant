CNN-LSTM for price estimation

I have some pictures that I would like to extract features from using ResNet, and then apply another model like LSTM with extracted features to estimate the price. I have made two folders, one containing all the pictures, and the other containing the price of each of them. input = Input(shape=(480, 720, 3)) base = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False) x = Flatten()(base(input)) x = tf.expand_dims(x, -1) x = Dropout(0.2)(x) x = LSTM(100)(x) x = Dense(1)(x) model = Model(inputs=input, outputs=x) Now I do not know how I can label the prices of the pictures? I have the pictures and prices ordered, but I would like X = features extracted and Y = corresponding prices.
