When your title doesn't fit on your business card because you wear too many hats, then someone wordsmiths a nifty title for you. e.g. Programming/IT/Project Management/Strategy/Business Analyst Other ways to receive an architect title: You spend more time on the phone and at the whiteboard than you do actually developing working software. You spend more time helping people set up Outlook/Entourage than you do actually developing working software. You're really not that good of a coder to begin with.
