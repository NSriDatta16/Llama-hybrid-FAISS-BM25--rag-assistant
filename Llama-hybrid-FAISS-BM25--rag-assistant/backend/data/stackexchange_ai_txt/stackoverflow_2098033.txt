Check out the Weka machine learning lib for Java . The API is a little bit crufty but it's very useful. Overall, what you seem to want is an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm, which is exactly what Weka contains. You're apparently looking for something relatively easy to interpret (you mention that you want it to deduce the relationship between A and B and to tell you that C is just noise.) You could try a decision tree, such as J48, as these are usually easy to visualize/interpret.
