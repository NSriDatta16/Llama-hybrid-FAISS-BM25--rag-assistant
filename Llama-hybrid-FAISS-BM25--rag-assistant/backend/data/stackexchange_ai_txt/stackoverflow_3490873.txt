Using HTTP long polling when sockets are available (e.g. iPhone, Blackberry)

I'm currently writing a simple cross platform app with Node.js on the server and web/iPhone/Blackberry clients. Bandwidth and latency requirements are similar to something you would see in an IRC "party game" or any chat system. I've developed the web client using HTTP long polling (speaking JSON both ways). For iPhone/blackberry I could use the built in HTTP libraries to talk to my current implementation, or I could write a socket listener on the server and talk to it using sockets. Is there any advantage to doing so? Why do non-browser HTTP clients seem to be discouraged?
