jquery draggable options

i want the draggable object to revert back to its original position when i click a button. i used 'destroy' option but it doesnt seem to work. it disables the dragging but doesnt revert back to original position. can someone help? EDIT PART: $('#Zoom').toggle(function() { $("#draggable").draggable({});}, function() { $("#draggable").draggable('destroy');}); this is a toggle button that i am using to enable dragging. the destroy option only disables dragging and does not revert the object back to the original position. also this is the button i want to make the object come back to its original position: nextImg.addEventListener('click', function() {img.setAttribute("src", "img"+(++imgnum)+".jpg");}, false);
