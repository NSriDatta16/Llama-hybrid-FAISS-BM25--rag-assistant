Interesting question. I don't know SWT too well to brag about it (unlike Swing and AWT) but here's the comparison done on SWT/Swing/AWT. http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/10936_2179061_2/Swing-and-SWT-A-Tale-of-Two-Java-GUI-Libraries.htm And here's the site where you can get tutorial on basically anything on SWT ( http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0280__SWT/Catalog0280__SWT.htm ) Hope you make a right decision (if there are right decisions in coding)... :-)
