Combining multiple imputation and survey non-response adjustments (IPW)

Imagine the following scenario: A population cohort (assume no or equal sampling weights) of say 10000 people had various demographics and health factors measured at baseline $X_{base}$ (with some missing data). At a later timepoint all cohort members were asked a follow-up questionnaire which included further factors $X_{fu}$ and a binary outcome measure of a certain health indicator, $Y$ . Let's say there was 50% non-response to this later questionnaire. I want to impute missing baseline data (assumed MCAR/MAR) using multiple imputation (R package mice ) and then adjust for non-response bias using a propensity-score/IPW based method (logistic regression of response $R=1$ vs no-response $R=0$ ) as there may be a pattern of non-response associated with a certain combination of the demographic/health factors in $X_{base}$ . You can assume we ultimately aim to fit a further logistic regression to investigate associations between $Y$ and factors $X_{base}$ . This general question was considered by Seaman et al. (2012) and if my reading is correct has been used elsewhere in the literature . The R package MatchThem for weighting multiply imputed datasets would seem perfect if I were looking at a treatment/exposure vs an outcome. I do not understand if I could however also use it in the above scenario. Using this package or otherwise, any help how to implement the combination of both MI and IPW steps would be great . Some of my concerns are: If I should impute the missing $Y$ s as well as $X$ s together? It might help the subsequent IPW because it would keep more of the non-responders' data included $X_{base|R=0}$ I think the final logistic regression for associations should only be done on those responding ( $R=1$ ) independent of their imputed $Y$ , indeed as recommended by Paul von Hippel ? Makes sense to me as otherwise I could just MI all $X$ and $Y$ and not have to worry about the non-response or IPW. Example R code for a fake cohort in case it helps with any answers N_cohort = 10000L set.seed(235) Response = rep(c(1L,0L), each=N_cohort/2) Y = c(sample(0:1, N_cohort/2, replace = TRUE, prob = runif(2)), rep(NA, N_cohort/2)) sex = gl(2, 1, N_cohort, labels = c("F", "M")) age = round(rweibull(N_cohort, shape= 10, scale=55)) edu = factor(sample(letters[1:5], size = N_cohort, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.01, 0.05, 0.2, 0.3, 0.44))) inc = factor(sample(c(seq(0,1e5,2e4), NA), N_cohort, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.03, 0.07, 0.26, 0.28, 0.14, 0.02, 0.2))) A = round(rweibull(N_cohort, shape= 1, scale=5)) B = rnorm(N_cohort) C = rnorm(10000, 24, 3) D = ifelse(is.na(Y), NA, runif(N_cohort/2, 0, 20)) df = data.frame(Response, Y, sex, age, inc, edu, A, B, C, D) df[,6:10] = as.data.frame(lapply(df[,6:10], function(.x) .x[ sample(c(TRUE, NA), prob = c(0.85, 0.03), size = length(.x), replace = TRUE)]))
