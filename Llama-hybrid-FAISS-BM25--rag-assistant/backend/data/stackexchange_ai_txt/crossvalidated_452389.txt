Is it possible to obtain the input from these hidden layer representations ? Note that we are moving in the opposite direction (i.e. from representations to input) You can find an approximation of the input from the latent representation, that is how an auto-encoder is train. The purpose is to find something as close as possible to the input after compressing the information. Is there a utility/function available in Keras ?
