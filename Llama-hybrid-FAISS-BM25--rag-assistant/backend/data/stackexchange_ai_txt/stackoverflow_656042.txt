Best practice: Asp.net WebApp requires user authentication - what to do during development to avoid logging on again and again?

When I develop an ASP.Net webapp, it almost always requires some kind of authentication - ie. the user must log in for stuff to work. But when I am developing it, I don't want to have to log in every time I make a change to some code. So right now for instance, I have a codeblock in my login.aspx, that automatically authenticates me as a certain userId - and redirects me back to the requested page. I have a few other ideas that are more elegant for handling development vs. live - but I would like to hear how you handle the same situation.
