I’ve used this technique on several data warehouses I look after. I have not noticed any performance degradation when running reports based off of the views versus a table direct approach but have never performed a detailed analysis. I created the views using the designer in SQL Server management studio and did not use any automated approach. I can’t imagine the schema changing often enough that automating it would be worthwhile anyhow. You might spend as long tweaking the results as it would have taken to drag all the tables onto the view in the first place! To remove ambiguity a good approach is to preface the column names with the name of the dimension it belongs to. This is helpful to the report writers and to anyone running ad hoc queries.
