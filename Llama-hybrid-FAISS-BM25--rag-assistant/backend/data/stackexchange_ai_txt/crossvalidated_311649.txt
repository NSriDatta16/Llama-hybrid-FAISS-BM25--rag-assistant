There could be several reasons: You may have a coding error; next time please include both input and output. (I would have mentioned this in a comment, but I don't have the repuation.) Even though a logistic model is typically better than a linear model for binary response data, you can still have a data generating process such that a linear fit is a better fit than a logistic fit. Edit: In general, one should expect smaller standard errors with a smaller model fit. Of course, the parameters in different models have different interpretations and therefore there is no reason to expect them to be the same and therefore no reason to expect them to have the same p-value, even if the standard errors are the same. Logistic regression is subject to rare events bias. See, for example, King and Zeng 2001: https://gking.harvard.edu/files/0s.pdf This may also bias coefficient estimates and cause standard error problems.
