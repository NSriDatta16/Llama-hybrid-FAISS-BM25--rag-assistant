It seems you want to test whether all four categories are equally likely. An appropriate test is a one-sample chi-squared test of the null hypothesis that the four Class probabilities are all $1/4.$ In this case the test statistic is $$Q = \sum_{j=1}^4 \frac{(X_j - E)^2}{E},$$ where $X_i$ are the frequencies $X_1 = 328,362,$ and so on, and where the expected count in each Class is the average $E = 327,915.2$ of the four frequencies. Under $H_0,$ the test statistic $Q \stackrel{aprx}{\sim} \mathsf{Chisq}(\text{df}= 5-1=3).$ (For your large counts, the approximation is quite good.) In R, the procedure chisq.test computes the test statistic $Q$ and its P-value as follows: x = c(328362, 328129, 327950, 327220) chisq.test(x) Chi-squared test for given probabilities data: x X-squared = 2.2257, df = 3, p-value = 0.5269 Because no probability vector was provided the default probability $1/4$ are used for each Class. Because the P-value $0.527 > 0.05$ we have no evidence at the 5% level to reject $H_0.$ So the data are consistent with the null hypothesis that all four groups are equally likely. The P-value $0.527$ is the area to the right of the solid vertical line at $Q = 2.2257$ under the $\mathsf{Chisq}(3)$ density function. We would have rejected $H_0$ at the 5% level if $Q > 7.815,$ the "critical value" at the vertical dotted line. 1 -pchisq(2.2257, 3) [1] 0.526904 qchisq(.95, 3) [1] 7.814728
