Embedding Windows Python in Cygwin/GCC C++ program

I am currently working on a Cygwin/GCC application written in C++. The application requires embedding of python to run plug-ins, I've successfully embedded using the Cygwin python libraries and was able to run simple python files as part of the program. However, the python files now require the use of a windows GUI framework (wxPython), and so I need to be able to embed the Windows Python environment, otherwise I cannot use the framework in the python files. In an attempt to do this, I created libpython25.a using step 2 of these instructions . I then used the library/header files of the windows installation to compile it. However, when I run it the program crashes with some strange debugger output (debug info is on, strangely enough). gdb: unknown target exception 0xc0000008 at 0x77139a13 Program received signal ?, Unknown signal. [Switching to thread 2216.0x119c] 0x77139a13 in ntdll!RtlLockMemoryZone () from /cygdrive/c/Windows/system32/ntdll.dll (gdb) where #0 0x77139a13 in ntdll!RtlLockMemoryZone () from /cygdrive/c/Windows/system32/ntdll.dll #1 0x030c1c7c in ??

()' If anyone has done this successfully, I would greatly appreciate the help. Is embedding Windows python in a Cygwin/GCC program possible? If not what are my other options? (Right now I can only think of moving over to VC++ but this would be pretty drastic, also I do not want to use X11 for the GUI).
