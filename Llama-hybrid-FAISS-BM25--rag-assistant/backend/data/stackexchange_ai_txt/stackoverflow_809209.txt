It depends on your OS. Up through Windows Server 2003 you need to: Right-click on "My Computer" (on the server) and select properties Select the "Computer Name" tab Click "Change..." In "Member of" select the "Domain" radio button Enter the name of your domain A popup will then appear asking you to provide the credentials of someone that has access to join a computer to the domain (ask your administrator about this one - many organizations allow employees to join computers to domains) Reboot your machine when it prompts you to. If it's Windows Server 2008 you'll have to select "Advanced System Settings" from the menu on the left after you select "Properties" on "My Computer".
