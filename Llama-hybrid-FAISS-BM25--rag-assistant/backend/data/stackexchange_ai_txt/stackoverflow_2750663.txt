Memcached and Rails Fragment Caching Issue

When I have 2 views that fragment cache the same query BUT display them differently, there is only one fragment and they both display it the same way. Is there any way around this? For example... #views/posts/list - cache(@posts) do - for p in @posts = p.title #views/posts/list_with_images - cache(@posts) do - for p in @posts = p.title = p.content = image_tag(p.image_url) #controllers/posts_controller def list ... @posts = Post.all end def list_with_images ... @posts = Post.all end
