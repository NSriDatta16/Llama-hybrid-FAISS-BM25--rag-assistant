What if CancelIo fails?

There are a number of reasons to call CancelIo , but in my particular case I'm calling it in order to know that the system is no longer writing into a buffer. Once I know that, I can safely free the buffer. But what if CancelIo fails? What I do now is explicitly leak the buffer and throw an exception. Are there better ways to deal with this? P.S. Analogous calls for Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto seem to be missing. Should I file a bug?
