openmp sections running sequentially

I have the following code: #pragma omp parallel sections private(x,y,cpsrcptr) firstprivate(srcptr) lastprivate(srcptr) { #pragma omp section { //stuff } #pragma omp section { //stuff } } According to the Zoom profiler, two threads are created, one thread executes both the sections, and the other thread simply blocks! Has anyone encountered anything like this before? (And yes, I do have a dual core machine).
