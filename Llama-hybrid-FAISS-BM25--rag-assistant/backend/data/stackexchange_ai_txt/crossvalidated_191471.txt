Periodicity and seasonality of a time series

I have a time series and I have done some spectral analysis on it. When doing an autocorrelation and periodogram it shows that the time series is periodic. However when I do a Dickey-Fuller test it shows that the time series is stationary, which brings the question of which method to use to investigate periodicity and seasonality of a time series. I think (I am not really a time series expert) that the first question to ask is if the time series is autoregressive or not. So the question is, is there a way to find if my time series is autoregressive and if not which methods to use to check the periodicity and seasonality? For example, on of my datasets shows the current patterns in acf graph and periodogram The periodogram shows a high value in frequence 0.01234375 which is approximatly 81 time period and I can't figure out the saisonality here.
