I ran into this bug too. My suggestion would be to use a repeated background image for the gradient in ie9. IE9 correctly tiles the image behind the rounded borders (as of RC1). I fail to see how writing 100 lines of code to replace 1 line of CSS is simple or elegant. SVG is cool and all, but why go through all that when easier solutions for gradient backgrounds have been around for years.
