Pausing replication won't accomplish what you want. When you have replication turned on, those log records which are of interest to replication (i.e. those for objects that you have configured to replicate) will not be marked as reusable until they're at the distributor. The only two ways to "pause" replication would be to stop either the log reader or the distribution agent, neither of which gets those log records to the distributor. To see if replication is your problem, check the log_reuse_wait_desc column in sys.databases for your database and see what it says. If it's "replication", then replication is your problem. :) If it is, how far behind is your log reader agent?
