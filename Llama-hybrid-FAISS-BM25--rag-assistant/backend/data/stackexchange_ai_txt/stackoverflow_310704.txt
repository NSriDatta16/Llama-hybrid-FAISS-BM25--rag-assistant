Access project directory from eclipse plugin

This is a question already asked by someone: How can an Eclipse plugin access the project directory? The answer was good: using ResourcesPlugin . But for some reason, under no circumstances will my Ganymede eclipse recognise the existence of org.eclipse.core.resources package which contains ResourcesPlugin . Why is that?
