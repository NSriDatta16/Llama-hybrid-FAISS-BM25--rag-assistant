Why does regression to the mean work?

According to Wikipedia, regression towards the mean is "the phenomenon that arises if a sample point of a random variable is extreme (nearly an outlier), in which case a future point is likely to be closer to the mean or average." But wouldn't you expect any future point to likely "be close to the mean" regardless simply because that's the expectation value of the rv? What does this have to do with the fact that the previous observation was an outlier and why does this affect/increase the likelihood that a future point be close to the mean?
