You can only access files and images in this case outside of your application using the Photo Chooser task as you've been trying, it is not possible at this time to iterate though images that are in the Pictures Hub without it. However you can use the XNA MediaLibrary methods to iterate non-DRMed music and album art that is on the phone - but you can't see the files, there is no concept of a file system for your app other than isolated storage, so within your own apps sandbox you can itereate your own files anyway you want using IsolatedStorage techniques - but not outside the app.
