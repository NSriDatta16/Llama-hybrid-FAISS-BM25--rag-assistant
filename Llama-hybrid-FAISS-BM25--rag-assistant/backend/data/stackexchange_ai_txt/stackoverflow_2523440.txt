I don't think there is such a project, if there is I want to know it as well. In order to find things in maven you have to know what you're looking for(which is not exactly the same with what you want to accomplish). If its any help I'm building 13 module project with MAVEN, use cobertura maven plugin, surefire, javadoc, etc .. it works as charm, why are you asking this question, you want to determine the capabilities of maven or ?
