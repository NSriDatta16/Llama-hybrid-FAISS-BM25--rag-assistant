Mirth: overwriting msg object with contents in an XML object

The task is to send an XML object from Channel-A to Channel-B 42 MSH|^~\&|LAB|.... PID|1|.... The steps of the channel communication: in the Channel-B's source transformer, extract the HL7v2 contents OVERWRITE the current msg object in Channel-B with the extracted contents continue in the other Channel-B source transformers and expecting to reference msg['PID']['PID.5'] as normal. The good news is that I can extract the HL7v2 'payload' into a variable. The problem or difficulty is resetting the msg object, or any other object to be able to reference the HL7 properties as expected. When I create a new variable with the SerializerFactory.getHL7Serializer , it wraps with the tags . channelMap.put('MessageID', msg['ID']); //successful channelMap.put('v2payload',msg['HL7v2']); //also looks good var v2Msg = SerializerFactory.getHL7Serializer(false,false,true).toXML(msg['HL7v2']); channelMap.put('v2Msg', v2Msg ); link to full size image Question : Do you have any suggestions on how to overwrite the msg object? How can I start referencing the msg as such: msg['PID']['PID.5'] Current Conditions the receiving channel's input type is XML the need is to take extract all the properties from that XML object; ID is a database PK to be used later in the destination.
