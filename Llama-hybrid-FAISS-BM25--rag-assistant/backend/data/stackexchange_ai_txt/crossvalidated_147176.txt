You can calculate the odds ratio using binary logistic regression analysis in SPSS. Move the outcome variable (Coded: No=0 and Yes=1 ) to the "Dependent" box and the independent variable (i.e., age category) to the "Covariate" box and specify any other output you want by clicking on the relevant button and checking the required option. Remember to declare to SPSS that your independent variable is categorical by clicking on the "Categorical" button and moving the variable name for your age categories to the "Categorical Covariates" box. Choose either the "first" or "last" age category to be your reference category so that you could obtain odds ratios of the other two categories in reference to the "reference category". After running the analysis, EXP(B) in the output table is the odds ratio.
