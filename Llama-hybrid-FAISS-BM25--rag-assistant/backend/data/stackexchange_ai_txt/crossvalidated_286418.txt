Which sampling distributions of the normal correspond to which sample statistics?

Question: Which sampling distributions of a normally distributed, i.e. $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, population correspond to which sample statistics? In particular, which sample statistics (if any), do the: $\chi^2$ distributions $t$ distributions $F$ distributions correspond to? Motivation: This information isn't well-organized in any of the sources I have found, hence why I am asking this question here: so that there can be at least one well-organized reference. Ideally an answer would be in tabular format, with one column the sample statistic, and the other column the sampling distribution corresponding to that sample statistic for a normal-distributed population. I am looking only for sample statistics for which exact answers are known. Answers along the lines of "the central limit theorem applies in the large $n$ limit" are not what I am looking for -- if that is the best possible answer for a given sample statistic, then there is no need to mention that sample statistic or its sampling distribution. Definitions: - sample statistic : A function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, i.e. $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$. - sample : $n$ independent draws from the normal distribution, i.e. a random vector with $n$ entries whose joint distribution is equal to the product of its marginal distributions. Denoted by $X$. - sampling distribution : For a given statistic $f$, the distribution of the random variable $f(X)$. Example: Sample Statistic: $f = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \quad $ Sampling Distribution: $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$ Sample Statistic: $f = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j)^2}$ Sampling Distribution : PDF $\frac{2}{\Gamma(\frac{n-1}{2})}\left(\frac{n-1}{2x^2} \right)^{(n-1)/2} x^{n-2}\exp\left(\frac{-n+1}{2} \right)$
