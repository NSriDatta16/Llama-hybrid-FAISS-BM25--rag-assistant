I have been struggling trying to test a super simple EJB project in netbeans. i have tried several examples form my java book, and an even simpler example i found online Using the EJBContainer API (to start an Embedded EJB container in your testes) is the way to go in Java EE 6 (Adam Bien blogged about this in Embedding EJB 3.1 Container Into Your Unit Tests - Boot Time: 5 Seconds ). That being said, you might be interested by the following links: Yet another Chapter 6 EJB problem Bug 179008 - javax.ejb.EJBException: No EJBContainer provider available: no provider names had been found. Bug 180767 - Embedded EJB container in tests does not work in Maven project What version of GlassFish are you using? If you're not using the latest 3.0.1, I'd suggest giving it a try.
