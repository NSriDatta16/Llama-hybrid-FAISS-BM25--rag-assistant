gv.DataSource = list.FindAll(x => x.Type == showType)); should be gv.DataSource = list.FindAll(x => 0 != (x.Type & showType))); As you don't want the Type to be exactly what showType is, right? You could manually iterate over the list and do a compare and remove what you don't need though I'm not sure it is an elegant solution.
