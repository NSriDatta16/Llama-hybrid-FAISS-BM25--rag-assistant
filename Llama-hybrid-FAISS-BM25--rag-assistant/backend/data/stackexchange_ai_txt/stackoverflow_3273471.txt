Ruby Program Error: NoMethodError

I typed up a simple Ruby code for a tutorial question, as shown below. #Grandma is deaf! puts "Hey Sonny! It's your lovely Grandmother! How are you?" response = gets.chomp while response != "BYE" if response != response.upcase puts "Huh?! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!" else puts "NO! NOT SINCE " + (1930 + rand(21)).to_s + "!" end response = gets.chomp end puts "GOOD BYE, SONNY!" However, when I run this, the window displays: Hey Sonny! It's your lovely Grandmother! How are you? NoMethodError: private method ‘chomp’ called for nil:NilClass at top level in deafGrandma.rb at line 3 I don't understand why chomp is not recognized. I'm using textMate on a Mac I have Ruby version 1.8.7, which should be fine. Any solutions? Thank you so much :)
