Note that you're on the right track loading ragged2e and using the \RaggedRight command instead of LaTeX's default \raggedright. It gives much better output some of the time, although it does hyphenate words; depending on the design of your headings that may or may not be acceptable to you. Either way, go with @sgm's answer of using titlesec. (It's as easy to use as sectsty, and more powerful...sectsty is only good for very basic redefinitions like changing the font.)
