Can anyone explain me the difference between Factor Anaysis and PCA?

Is PCA and Factor Analysis same? Both are used for Data dimension reduction but theoretically I am not able to find the difference between them? I did FA in SPSS to reduce number of variables in my data set. I think the same think can be done using PCA as well. Never did PCA so wanted to know exact difference between two techniques.
