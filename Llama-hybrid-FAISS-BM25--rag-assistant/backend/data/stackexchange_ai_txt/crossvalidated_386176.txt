1 experimental group - 6 control groups: ANOVA or t-tests or something else?

Objective: I want to find out, if a certain machine learning algorithm can select the right 100 stocks out of my stock universe of 2.000 stocks, such that they achieve better combined yearly returns than my control groups / benchmarks. Experimental group : the portfolio that was selected through the machine learning algorithm Control Group 1: benchmark 1 (e.g. S&P 500) Control Group 2: benchmark 2 Control Group 3: benchmark 3 Control Group 4: benchmark 4 Control Group 5: benchmark 5 Control Group 6: Same setup as with the experimental group, however using an old machine learning algorithm. Question 1 : What is the right approach, if I really just want to compare my experimental group to each of the control groups. I am not interested in the variances between the control groups. The only thing I am interested in is if the returns are higher in a statistically significant manner. Do I use ANOVA, pair-wise t-tests or something else? Question 2 : If building contrasts and ANOVA is the right approach, do I have to use a repeat measure ANOVA? The problem is that I comparing portfolios of stocks, which may or may not overlap. Additionally the stocks in these portfolios may change over time. If anything from the above is confusing, please tell me what I should clarify. Thank you in advance
