I've seen projects deal with this by deploying SQL Server Express edition on each web farm server and relying on Service Broker to deliver the track audit to the central server. Because each server in the farm updates a local SQL instance, they can scale as high as the sky. Service Broker assures the near-real-time reliable delivery. I've seen web farms handle 300-400 requests per second on average , 24x7 over long time, and with the queued nature of Service Broker being able to absorb spikes of 5000-7500 hits per second for hours at end, and recover in reasonable time, without audit loss and with the backlog staying under control. If you really expect to scale and become the next MySpace, then you should learn from how they do it , and queue based asynchronous, decoupled processing is the name of the game.
