Training data for anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder

I am building an time-series anomaly detection engine using LSTM autoencoder. I read this article where the author suggests to train the model on clean data only in response to a comment . However, in most cases, it is not possible to find and exlude anomalies manually. I had always believed that because anomalies are very rare, if we train the model on all the data then the model will learn the normal behavior of time series and be ready to detect anomalies. I have read the same notion in many other articles too. Can someone throw light on what should be right mechanism to prepare the training data for anomaly detection?
