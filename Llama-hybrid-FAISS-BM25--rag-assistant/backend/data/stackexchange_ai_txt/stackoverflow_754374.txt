We have just add support for this in our product. Running on an embedded device, we check disk space being below 20% (10mb) each hour, and transmit warnings to the office server, log the problem, and warn the user. Once in this state we check every two minutes for sub 2mb space, and gracefully stop the application (a guidance system), and refuse to run until the space problem is solved. As our product is a core system in our customers workplace, this gets the administers attention.
