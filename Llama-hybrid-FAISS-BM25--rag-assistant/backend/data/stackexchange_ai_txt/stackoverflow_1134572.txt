Dojo: Is there an event after drag & drop finished

I've got two dojo.dnd.Sources with items. Whenever an item is dropped I need to persist the new order of the items in the Sources using an xhr. Is there an dojo event or topic that is fired after an dnd operation has (successfully) finished? What would be the best way to use it?
