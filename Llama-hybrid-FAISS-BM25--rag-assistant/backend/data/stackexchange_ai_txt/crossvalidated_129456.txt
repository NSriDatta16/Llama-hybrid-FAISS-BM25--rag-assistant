Deep convex network is relatively new architecture of deep neural networks , which has been developed in order to overcome the scalability limitations of deep belief networks (DBN) . You can read more on technical details of the architecture and its performance in research papers, for example, in this paper as well as a relevant later paper , both from Microsoft Research. It might be beneficial to read more about DBN on this fascinating peer-reviewed open-access site , as it's more comprehensive than Wikipedia on the topic. In my opinion, even more comprehensive and interesting overview of deep learning architectures in AI can be found in this technical report .
