You'll need to modify the byte-code of your application to do that. I've found ObjectWeb ASM to be the best tool for the job. The general idea is to: Create a JVMTI agent which intercepts the classes you're interested in. Pass the classes you want to instrument to an ASM class transformer. In the class transformer, you can intercept the Java opcodes related to constructing an array, e.g. ANEWARRAY (see the JVM spec for more).
