Using deep learning to measure the similarity between two variable length voice sequences

Usually we use DTW (Dynamic Time warpping) to measure the similarity between two variable voice sequences. However DTW is time-consuming and not easy to run in the GPU since too much control in it. I wish to find a deep learning algorithm to measure the similarity.
