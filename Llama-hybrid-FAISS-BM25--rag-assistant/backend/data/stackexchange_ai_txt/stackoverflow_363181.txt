project-tracking tools for navigating with topic maps?

I'm having trouble with project management & am looking for a good tool that will be a good match for the way my brain works (very associatively). I'd like a bug-tracker but one that I can group tasks into topics and associate the topics to each other in a graph (see the Wikipedia entry on Topic Maps ) so that I can find & visualize easily the "big picture". I've tried using AbstractSpoon's ToDoList and it works well but it's hierarchical and after about 30 or 40 entries I get lost in a maze of things to do. any suggestions? edit: I've now tried Freemind , Conzilla , XMind , and VUE . Freemind and Conzilla were a little flaky. XMind seems to be the most polished of the four; they have a "pro" version which is non-free (pay by the month >:( which is weird) but an open-source base version which is free. You can't export the data directly from the program with the free version, but the storage format is just a .jar-style (ZIP file w/ extension .xmind) file that contains a "contents.xml" that is easily parsed if I needed to. @codeslave: but how important is the visual representation any way Visualization is everything! I've got information overload and I need to be able to navigate a mess of information. I don't want it to be super-Powerpoint-polished, but I need to be able to use the associations that I create to remind myself how to find what I'm looking for. In an ideal world you could just full-text search everything, but that only works if you can remember the search phrase. Often I'll file something under "algorithm" and when I go to look for it I look under "programming" instead, or vice-versa. Associativity solves that problem by allowing me to visually browse my "mental model" of the information I've stored.
