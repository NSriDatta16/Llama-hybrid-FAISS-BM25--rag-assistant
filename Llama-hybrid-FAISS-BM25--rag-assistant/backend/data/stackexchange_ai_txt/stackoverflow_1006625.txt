One thing I would watch out for is that your server will most likely get hit by more HTTP requests than if you have the (normal) full page HTTP delivery. Let me explain. When your web page is AJAX-enabled, your clients will end up creating more HTTP requests for (say) form filling, page-fragment regeneration etc. I've seen scenarios where developers have gone AJAX-crazy, and made the web page a largely dynamic document. This results in a great user experience (if done well), but every request results in a server hit, leading to scalability and latency issues. Note - this isn't particular to DWR, but is an AJAX issue. I've used DWR, and it works nicely. Unfortunately, I found that it worked so well, and so easily, that everything becomes a candidate for remoting, and you can end up with huge numbers of small requests.
