You can run formula from within LotusScript, but not the other way around, unless you use an agent as Stan has eluded to. After a few weary years of dev, I generally consider writing lotusScript for most of my work, the exceptions are only if I can write the formula in less than 10 lines and it's unlikely to interact with other documents or update them. As soon as you need to interrogate many fields in other documents or update them, write them in script. The particular function you have listed in your question would also work as formula, but if your desire is to modularise it in script, then you should consider using script, in those situations exclusively, in place of formula. I would say Formula is merely a short cut for doing basic operations.
