Best way to access a remote database: via webservice or direct DB-access?

I'm looking to develop an application for Mac and iOS-devices. The application will rely on information stored in a remote database. It needs both read (select) and write (insert, update, delete) access to the database. The application will be a multi-user application. Now I'm looking at two different approaches to access the database: - via web service: the application accesses the web service (REST, JSON) which accesses the database. Authentication will be done via HTTP authentication over SSL (https). - access the remote database directly over a VPN. The app will be used by a maximum of let's say 100 people and is aimed at small groups/organizations/businesses. So my question is: what would be the best approach to access the database? What about security and performance? What would a typical implementation for a small business look like? Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks
