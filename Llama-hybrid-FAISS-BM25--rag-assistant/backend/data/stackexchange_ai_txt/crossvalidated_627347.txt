The Bernstein-von Mises theorem says something about the asymptotic behavior of the posterior ; it does not inform your choice of likelihood. There are approaches to unknown likelihoods in Bayesian statistics , most of which, however, are more complicate than your problem requires. Because if all you want to model is a mean $\mu$ and a variance $\sigma^2$ , you're effectively estimating a second-order approximation to a unimodal symmetric distribution about its mode. The distribution that is its own 2nd-order approximation is the Gaussian . Bottomline: just model $P_x$ as a Gaussian, reminiscent of QMLE .
