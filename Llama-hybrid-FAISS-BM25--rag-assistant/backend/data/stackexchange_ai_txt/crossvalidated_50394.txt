How to measure change in time series?

I have some weekly data about Apple app store ranking of the top apps listed (also of the sub categories such as games, weather, etc.). For example: week1 week2 week3 week4 ... Angry Birds 15 13 1 5 ... Weather Pro ... I am thinking about trying to estimate a parameter of "turbulence" or "change" for each category and compare them to each other. So, how can I measure change in time series?
