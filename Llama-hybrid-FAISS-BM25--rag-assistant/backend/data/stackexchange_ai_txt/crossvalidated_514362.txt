We do forecasting for retail: supermarkets, drugstores etc. We add predictors to explain our sales time series, specifically different predictors for different phases of the lockdowns. On the one hand, that will cleanse the time series, so we don't misinterpret higher sales of cat litter boxes as a seasonal effect that will recur next year. On the other hand, this allows us to forecast the possible effect of new rounds of lockdowns. In addition, we remove periods of censored zero sales due to stockouts, like the empty toilet paper shelves in my local supermarket: Of course, there is a bit of an art to this, or rather a subjective dimension. Which part of COVID-19 influenced sales is a one-off event, and which part reflects a "new normal"? Depending on this, you will want to let your predictors run out, or keep them for the foreseeable future, essentially a "structural break" type of thing. Shameless piece of self-promotion: I actually briefly mentioned this at a webinar I gave last Friday. Here is the recording. My short remarks on COVID start at 15:45 , right after the earthquakes. And yes, I do go into cat litter boxes.
