This answer builds on Ben's answer (so please upvote his answer too if you find my answer useful). He writes: This is quite a humorous statistical approach. The main flaw in the reasoning here is that it treats an estimator of an underlying reality as if it were more important than the underlying reality that is subject to estimation! It made me think of a more general type of comic trope that is rather common, for example in cartoons. It's when a character tries to affect a process by acting on a measurement/indicator of it (the case of the statistical estimator is an instance of this). For example, I immediately though of Wile Coyote trying to stop a car with broken breaks by turning the speedometer needle to zero (I don't think I have actually seen this sketch but I imagined it based on my internal model of the type of humour in that cartoon). While I have seen this type of humour a lot, I could not name it so I have asked ChatGPT about it. Here is its answer: The situation you described, where someone tries to affect a process by manipulating an indicator or measurement of that process, is a form of a logical fallacy known as the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness" or the " reification fallacy ." This fallacy occurs when an abstraction (in this case, the speed measurement) is treated as if it were a concrete, tangible reality . In the context of comedy or absurd situations, it can also be seen as an example of "magical thinking" or a "comic exaggeration" where the character believes that changing the measurement will directly impact the reality of the situation. The humor often arises from the absurdity or incongruity of the action. In the case of Wile E. Coyote turning the speedometer needle to zero to stop a car with broken brakes, it's a classic example of cartoon physics and comedic exaggeration, where the character's actions defy the laws of physics in a humorous and exaggerated way. Note : As suggested by Silverfish, this type of error is often called surrogation, especially in management/business analytics context. See their comment below. Additional note : I stumbled upon a website about tropes in cartoons and they have a page dedicated to elevators . One such trope falls into our category: Elevators sometimes have clockface-style indicators above the doors with an arrow that points at the number which correspond to the floor the elevator is currently on. In comedies, it is possible to control elevators by manipulating these indicators â€” pulling the arrow to move the elevator car, or, alternately, trapping the elevator on or between floors by blocking the arrow.
