The GET verb is used in Requests that are idempotent , e.g. when they lead to the same result (and have no observable side-effects on the returned resource). So, you use them for retrieval of a resource only. The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. and also 1.3 Quick Checklist for Choosing HTTP GET or POST Use GET if: The interaction is more like a question (i.e., it is a safe operation such as a query, read operation, or lookup). Use POST if: The interaction is more like an order, or The interaction changes the state of the resource in a way that the user would perceive (e.g., a subscription to a service), or The user be held accountable for the results of the interaction. However, before the final decision to use HTTP GET or POST, please also consider considerations for sensitive data and practical considerations. See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html and http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet-20040321 That second link explains the difference pretty well. Note that there is not just GET and POST in the HTTP protocol, but a couple of other verbs, like PUT, HEAD, DELETE, etc as well. Those play a large role in RESTful applications .
