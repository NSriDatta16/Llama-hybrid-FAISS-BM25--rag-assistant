I used NetBeans for a while, before switching to RubyMine some month ago prior the first release. I can say the IDE is worth the entire price. RubyMine has the best autocomplete support I have ever seen. It's a really clever IDE, it can understand most of the Rails "magics" including method references by symbols class Controller before_filter :mymethod def mymethod end end metaprogramming, Rails/Ruby convention and so on. Also, RubyMine 2.0 introduced i18n support for Rails and, having to maintain a couple of Rails apps localized in 5 different languages, I must say this is an awesome feature. It supports the latest testing frameworks in the Ruby ecosystem, including Shoulda, Test::Unit, RSpec and Cucumber. Unfortunately it lacks RCov support, while I know Netbeans is going to integrate it. A couple of co-workers are still using NetBeans and they often have problem with SVN because Netbeans doesn't auto-refresh the working copy when you update it outside the IDE. RubyMine has an excellent SCM support and ships with SVN, CVS and even Git compatibility. I don't want this answer to seems like a RubyMine promo, so I encourage you to give it a try for 30days then make a choice.
