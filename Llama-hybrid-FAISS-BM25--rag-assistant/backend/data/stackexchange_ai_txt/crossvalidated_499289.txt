Conditional Posterior Distribution of nu for location-scale t distribution

In their book Bayesian Data Analysis , Gelman et al. provides a setup for a Gibbs Sampler for a $t_{\nu}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ distribution with $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ unknown. The sampler is given as (p.294): \begin{align} V_i|\mu,\sigma^2,\nu,y &\sim \text{Inv-}\chi^2\left(\nu+1,\frac{\nu\sigma^2+(y_i-\mu)^2}{\nu+1}\right)\\ \mu|\sigma^2,V,\nu,y &\sim \text{N}\left({\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{V_i}y_i}\Big/{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{V_i}},{1}\Big/{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{V_i}}\right)\\ p(\sigma^2|\mu,V,\nu,y) &\propto \text{Gamma}\left(\sigma^2\Big|\frac{n\nu}{2},\frac{\nu}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{V_i}\right)\\ \end{align} where $V_i$ are auxiliary variables, $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the square of the scaling parameter. He then says that if $\nu$ is itself unknown, the Gibbs sampler must be expanded to include a step for sampling from the conditional posterior distribution of $\nu$ . My question is how and where can I find the conditional posterior distribution of $\nu$ for a location-scale $t$ distribution? I'm completely lost on how to start and am not sure how to proceed.
