My concern with your model is that you may be ignoring important mathematical properties and get bad predictions. For example, I am assuming that roads cannot spontaneously improve themselves. Roads do not get better on their own. This matters. It may be the case that no pre-built Excel model will be a good predictive fit. It seems like roads remain quite good for a long time, but once they begin deteriorating they begin to come apart faster and faster. Although this loosely implies a quadratic-like model, the maximum value should always be for a new road and it is not under your specification. The best road happens in year two. Your model also does not consider changes in weather or the comparability of building materials from twenty years ago to today. Finally, your dependent variable is probably ranked data. Is a road rated as a 10 actually 10 times better than one whose rating is a 1 and is one rated a 10 exactly 2 times better than one rated a 5? I am a little concerned that your model may be fragile for the purposes of making a prediction. Excel really isn't designed with this in mind and doesn't have the functions for this. It doesn't really go past simple models. While you may be experiencing exponential decay, your rating system won't work with that.
