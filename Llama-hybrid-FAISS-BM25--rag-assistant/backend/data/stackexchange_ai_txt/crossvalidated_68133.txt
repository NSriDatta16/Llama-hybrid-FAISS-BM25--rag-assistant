I agree with @andrea that it is common to see "matched individuals by some independent variables", but not "matched independent variables". If individuals are matched, it is repeated measures. Zero correlation can happen but is rare, so the usual logistic regression you used may not be valid. The conditional logistic regression or GEE is robust to handle the correlation within repeated measures. The difference between conditional logistic regression and GEE is the interpretation, where the former getting the subject specific estimate and the latter the population average estimate.
