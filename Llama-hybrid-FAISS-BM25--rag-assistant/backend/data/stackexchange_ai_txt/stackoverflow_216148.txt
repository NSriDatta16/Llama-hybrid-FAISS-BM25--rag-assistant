Check the other post about the tool that you asked about. Verify your "my" storage and check if the CN="HighBall". I guess your CN is not just "HighBall", probably it has a top level domain. I think it's easier to look for the certificate serial number, i think it's faster than for it's canonical name and error prone. Regards, Victor
