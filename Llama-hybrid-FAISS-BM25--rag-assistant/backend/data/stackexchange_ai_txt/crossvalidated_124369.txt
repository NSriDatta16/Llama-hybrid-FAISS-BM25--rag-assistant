The output tells you that the model chosen for your data is the following polynomial on lags of $y_t^*$: $$ y_t^* = 1.15\, y_{t-1}^* -0.66\, y_{t-2}^* + 0.34\, y_{t-3}^* + \hbox{residuals} \,, \quad t=1,2,...,n \,, $$ where $y_t^* = y_t - y_{t-1}$, that is, the first differences of the original series $y_t$. This means that the chosen model considers the presence of a stochastic trend rather than a deterministic trend, e.g. linear trend. As regards the coefficients, they are weights of past observations of the data (in this case of the first differences of the data). We may expect that these weights will decay or go to zero. The reason is that, in general, the current observation is more closely related to the most recent observations rather than to old observations. For example, the prices observed in the present year are more likely to be related to the prices observed in the previous year rather than to the prices observed 10 years ago. The coefficients can be also interpreted in terms of the underlying cycles generated by the polynomial related to the ARMA model. You can get the roots of the polynomial and the frequency of the cycles generated by that polynomial. Frequencies close to zero will mean that long-term patterns (i.e., cycles that are repeated after many observations) explain part of the dynamics of the data and the series will look relatively smooth. More erratic series are explained by cycles of lower frequency that are repeated every fewer observations. In seasonal time series, it is common to see cycles related to seasonal frequencies that are repeated every 2, 6 or 12 moths. For an example that includes some of the calculus behind this interpretation you may see this post .
