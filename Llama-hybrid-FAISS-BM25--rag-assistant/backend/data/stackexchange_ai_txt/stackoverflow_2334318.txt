You could do that with Flex or Silverlight, if you're not averse to plugins. Otherwise, the only way I can think of to do this would be to create a function that places a very small graphic of a 1 pixel dot over and over again at the point of the cursor when it is dragged with the mouse button depressed. (Depressing, eh?) The dots would replicate more profusely and create a thicker line where the cursor pauses, and make a thinner line as it moves faster. The dots would in any case be close enough together to appear as a line, the way halftone printing uses dots to make photographs appear in newspapers. I could write this for you but you'd have to pay me. :)
