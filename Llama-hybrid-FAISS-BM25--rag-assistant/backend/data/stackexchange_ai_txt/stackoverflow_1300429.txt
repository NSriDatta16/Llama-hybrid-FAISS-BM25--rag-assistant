Web Parts in ASP.NET 3.5

I'm trying to create draggable web parts in ASP.NET 3.5 but the thing just doesn't want to be dragged. I already tried the workarounds for making it compatible with Firefox, by using AJAX, but still doesn't work. This is code I have on my page: ASP.NET site GotDotNet Contoso.com I never get the drag cursor when I hover the titles. Any idea on what I may be doing wrong? EDIT: I am in the page in Edit mode, not Browse mode.... Tks in advance.
