Choosing the distribution of the code in VAE allows for a better unsupervised representation learning where samples of the same class end up close to each other in the code space. Also this way, finding a semantic for the regions in the code space becomes easier. E.g, you would know from each area what class can be generated. If you need more in-depth analysis, have a look at Durk Kingma' thesis . It's a great source for variational inference.
