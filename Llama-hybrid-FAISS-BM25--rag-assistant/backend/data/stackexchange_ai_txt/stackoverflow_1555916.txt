Before attempting to write to a file, you can check if the file is writable by your java application using File.canWrite() . However, you still might run into an issue if the 3rd party app locks the file in between your File.canWrite() check and when your application actually attempts to write. For this reason, I would code your application to simply go ahead and try to write to the file and catch whatever Exception gets thrown when the file is locked. I don't believe there is a native Java way to unlock a file that has been locked by another application. You could exec a shell command as a privileged user to force things along but that seems inelegant.
