significant difference between few averaged values

I need to determine if one value is better significantly over others few values. I mean, I use a metric to measure different image segmentation methods, and I got these three values for that metric: method 1: 4.23 (average of 3.06, 7.59, 2.04) method 2: 4.17 (average of 2.89, 6.67, 2.95) method 3: 2.63 (average of 1.98, 3.46, 2.45) Is it possible to determine if the last value (method 3 = 2.63) differ significantly from the the other two methods. I understand there is few data, but it is all that I have. I hope it was asked clear this time. Thanks in advance, Jaime
