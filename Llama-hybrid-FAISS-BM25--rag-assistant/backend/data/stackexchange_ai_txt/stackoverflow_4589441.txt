Thanks for the responses. I didn't award the bounty because while the answers were all helpful, none quite solved the problem. Ultimately, I solved the problem by passing the data from the applet to the web page, then executing an AJAX call to communicate with the server. Not the most elegant solution, certainly, but it has proved effective thus far. Try it out, and lemme know if it works for you. Thanks again!
