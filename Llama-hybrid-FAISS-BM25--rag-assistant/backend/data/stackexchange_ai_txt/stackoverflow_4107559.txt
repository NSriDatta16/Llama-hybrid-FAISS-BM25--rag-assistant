NSManagedObject Core Data - request for member 'attribute name' in something not a structure or union

Scenario: I created a xcode project called "Importing" which I read an XML file in and import content into my core data database. I then have a second "main" project where I add the SQLite file into the main bundle and import using the code from Core Data Books example. I made changes to the .xcodedatamodel in my "importing" project I revealed that in finder and dragged it into my "main" project then generate the NSManagedObject model files there. Until now this has work but Xcode seems to be confused... Recently I deleted some Attributes and added 1 new one. I then did the same process as above and now it says "request for member 'attribute name ' in something not a structure or union". If I type article 'modelname.' and press esc the intellisence is still picking up the old attributes? In the "importing" project though everything is working fine and I do not get any errors on any attributes and the intellisence is correct? Please advice, is there a cache in xcode? I have used "Clean all targets" but this does not seem to work. James
