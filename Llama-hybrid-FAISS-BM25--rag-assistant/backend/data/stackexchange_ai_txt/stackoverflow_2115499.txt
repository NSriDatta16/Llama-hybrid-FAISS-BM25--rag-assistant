Detecting memory fragmentation problem in a process

What are the various mechanisms using which we can detect if a process execution is leading to memory fragmentation? Are there any tools available for the same? Suggestion for tools which work with 'C' code and can run on Windows, Linux and VxWorks will be helpful.
