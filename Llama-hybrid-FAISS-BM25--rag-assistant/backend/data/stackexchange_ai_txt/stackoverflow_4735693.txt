[Yes, answering my own question as I saw this after looking in the standard a bit and searching harder for related questions on here] Actually, this is answered by part of the answer to Are there any platforms where using structure copy on an fd_set (for select() or pselect()) causes problems? (in this answer ), which I will paste here: One of the following shall hold: ... the left operand has a qualified or unqualified version of a structure or union type compatible with the type of the right; ... If the value being stored in an object is read from another object that overlaps in any way the storage of the first object, then the overlap shall be exact and the two objects shall have qualified or unqualified versions of a compatible type; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. Hence as long as the pointers are the same (i.e. total overlap) then this is fine. Still seems odd that the compiler inserts a call to memcpy sometimes for this despite the spec of memcpy saying that overlap is not allowed. Perhaps the compiler knows more about the particular implementation of memcpy than the documentation eludes to..
