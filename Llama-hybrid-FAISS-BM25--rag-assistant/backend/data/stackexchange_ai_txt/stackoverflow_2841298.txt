HttpsURLConnection failing intermittently to the same URL

I think I'm experiencing the same as http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/msg/9d37d64aad0ee357 This is Android 1.5 SDK. I happen to call several times below code(which is in a method) with the same url and it fails intermittently. When it fails, there is no exception, the stream is empty so the readConnection fails, and getResponseCode returns -1. Global caching is disabled, setDefaultUseCaches(false); I suppose there must be some kind of url connection object pool somewhere. Any idea on how can I workaround this? HttpURLConnection connection = null; try { URL url = new URL(this.url); connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); connection.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "basic " + Base64Coder.encodeString(user + ":" + password)); connection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", userAgent); connection.connect(); readConnection(connection.getInputStream()); connection.disconnect(); } catch (IOException ex) { reportException(ex, connection.getResponseCode()) } catch (ParserException ex) { reportException(ex, connection.getResponseCode()) }
