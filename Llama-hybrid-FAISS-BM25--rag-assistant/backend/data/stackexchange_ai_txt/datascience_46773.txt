Log transformation leads to a normal distribution only for log-normal distributions . Not all distributions are log-normal, meaning they will not become normal after the log transformation. EDIT: As you have commented, if you are trying to convert an arbitrary distribution to normal, methods like QuantileTransformer can be used. But note that these transformations make a distribution normal by changing (destroying) some information from the original data.
