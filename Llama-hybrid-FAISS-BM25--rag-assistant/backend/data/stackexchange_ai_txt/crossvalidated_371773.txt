The simplest multivariate extension of a Mat√©rn covariance kernel or of any kernel $K(t,\,s)$ for continuous input takes the form $$ \text{Cov}[Y_i(t), \, Y_j(s)] = \Sigma_{i,j}\, K(t - s) $$ where $\mathbf{Y}(t)= [Y_i(t)]_{1 \leq i \leq m}$ is the multivariate process and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = [\Sigma_{i,j}]_{i,j}$ is a $m \times m$ positive definite matrix. This is the continuous-time version of "Seemingly Unrelated" models in Time Series: SU Regression Equations (SURE) or SU Time Series Equations (SUTSE). With this covariance kernel the Gaussian r.vs $Y_i(t)$ and $Y_j(s)$ are uncorrelated conditional on $Y_j(t)$ or conditional on $Y_i(s)$ . This is a special case of a tensor product $K_{\text{cat}} \otimes K_{\text{cont}}$ of a kernel with categorical input $i \in \{1,\ \dots,\,m\}$ and a kernel with continuous input $t$ $$ K_{\text{prod}}\{ [i,\,t], \, [j,\,s] \} = K_{\text{cat}}(i,\,j)\, K_{\text{cont}} (t, \,s) $$ This representation may provide a tip to use the product kernel with software accepting only univariate output.
