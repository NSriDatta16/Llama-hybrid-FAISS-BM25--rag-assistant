Not an easy answer, but.. You essentially want to define a set of rules written in text (tokens) and then some parser that checks these rules and assembles them into fragments. http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.16/16.07/UsingFlexandBison/ People can spend years on this, The above article talks about using two tools (Flex and Bison) That can be used to turn text into code you can feed to a compiler.
