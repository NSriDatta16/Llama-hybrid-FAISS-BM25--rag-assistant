This is similar to perfect separation in logistic regression. When I followed your code after using set.seed(102) , the largest value of "times" was 3.35. Adding 6 to those in group1 put their survival times longer than any of the individuals in the other 2 groups. Treating group as a linear continuous predictor assumes that each extra level of the numeric group has the same extra association with the log-hazard of an event. With 3 groups that poses no problem in solving the score equation to get a regression coefficient. The software starts with an estimated regression coefficient value of 0 (hazard ratio of 1) for the numeric group predictor, then iteratively adjusts that value to best correspond to a single linear association between log-hazard and the 3 numeric values of group . In this case, the result ends up a compromise between the (infinite) log-hazard difference between group1 versus the others and the (lack of) log-hazard difference between the second two groups. When you converted to a factor and (implicitly) used group1 as the reference level, you created a problem. The regression coefficients for the other 2 groups then represent the log-hazard associated with membership in those two groups, relative to that in group1 . Similarly to the above, the software will start with dummy coefficients for the other 2 groups of 0, and then interactively try to find values for each of them that best represent the observed log-hazard relative to that of group1 But all of the events in the other 2 groups happened before any of the events in group1 . Those 2 groups have infinitely higher hazards than the reference group, group1 . So as the software tries to adjust the initial coefficient estimates to match the data, the coefficients run off toward infinity. You can get results more like you were expecting if you add a value less than 6 to group1 (adding 3 worked for me) or (maybe) if you set a different group as the reference level of the factor. Alternatively, if you only had 2 groups with non-overlapping survival times and treated them as numeric rather than categorical, you would end up with the same lack of convergence as there is no longer a third group that requires compromise to provide a single regression coefficient.
