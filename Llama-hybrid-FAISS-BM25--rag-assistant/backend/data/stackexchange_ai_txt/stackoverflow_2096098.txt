The date is not stored that way in SQL server; what you see in your ad-hoc queries is a conversion from the internal numeric storage to that format. When you read it in, you should be converting rdr["Date"] to a DateTime. If you want that specific format in your code, you should format it using .NET's formatters when you output it.
