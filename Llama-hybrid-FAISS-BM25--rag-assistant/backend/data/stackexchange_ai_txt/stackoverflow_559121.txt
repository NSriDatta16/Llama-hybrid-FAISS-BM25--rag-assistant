Just remembered we have indeed seen this before, long time ago. I believe it happens like this: Drag and drop works fine until some user code throws an exception during a drag and drop operation. The exception will be eaten; you won't get any error dialog (try it yourself and see). After this point, the drag and drop will stop working.
