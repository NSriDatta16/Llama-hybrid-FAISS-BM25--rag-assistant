how to set iframe src to local file

I have an iframe in my HTML, where i would like to play mpeg/mpg files from local folder, but i can't load the video into the iframe. when i set src="http://www.google.com", it is displayed in the iframe, but if i try src="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/jgabotero/Desktop/sample.jpg" it doesn't display the image. How can i set the src property of iframe to point to local files, specially the ones stored in IsolatedStorage? Thank you in advance. -- julie
