Daily time series analysis : 1st difference ?

I have a time series of daily returns for many years and i have to do preliminary analysis, GARCH modeling and predictions. I did all my preliminary analysis, ADF test (there's a unit root) , Jarque-Bera test, acf, ... and GARCH modeling using the logarithm of the data. My question is : Since the series is non-stationary should i have used the difference of the log(returns) for all my diagnostics ? The plot of the log(returns) shows that the series is non-stazionary (trend, volatility clustering,..). The ADF test suggest a unit root The fitted garch(1,1) shows leverage effect
