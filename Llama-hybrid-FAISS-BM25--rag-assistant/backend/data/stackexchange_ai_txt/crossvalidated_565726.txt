Let's denote by $S$ the basic set which contains the elements that are grouped in clusters. So the clusters $C_i$ are subsets of $S$ . Now, IIUC, we want the following properties to hold: Any two different clusters $C_i$ and $C_j$ are disjoint ( $C_i\cap C_J = \emptyset, i\ne j$ ). All clusters together cover the whole set $S$ ( $\bigcup_{i=1}^K C_i = S$ ) In other words, the clustering is a set partition . So the goal is to better describe the space of set partitions; lets call it $\cal P$ . I think the first step would be to find a metric (or some weaker version of a metric) for $\cal P$ . Once you have a metric, you can do all kinds of things, e.g. talk about groupings (that would then be "clusters of clusterings"). Since $\cal P$ is discrete and finite, we could maybe then think of this space as a graph, with the metric giving us a similarity value on each edge. We could cut all the edges below a certain similarity, so the graph would not have to be complete. As far as the notion of a metric is concerned, the author of the question already mentioned the rand index; another possibility is e.g. based on the Fowlkes-Mallows index . You could also use mutual information . For a similar question, see here . Then, your time series of clusterings becomes a walk in the graph. You could define transition probabilities derived from the similarity values on the edges and could thus obtain some graph random walk. This would help do predictions.
