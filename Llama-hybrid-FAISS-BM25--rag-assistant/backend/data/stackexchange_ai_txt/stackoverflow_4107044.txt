cout contention is still going to be a problem here. Why not output the results in some thread-local storage and collate them to the desired location centrally, meaning no contention. For example, you could have each target thread for the parallel code write to a separate filestream or memory stream and just concatenate them afterwards, since ordering is not important. Or postprocess the results from multiple places instead of one - no contention, single write only required.
