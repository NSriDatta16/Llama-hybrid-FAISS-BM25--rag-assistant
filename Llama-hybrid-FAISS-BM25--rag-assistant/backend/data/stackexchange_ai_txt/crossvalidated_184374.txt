Descriptive statistics with some repeated observations for individuals

Can anyone advise how to report descriptive statistics for clustered data? I am using xtgee command for logistic regression. But I am not sure how to report descriptive statistics, like N's for female and the outcome with a p-value. I have 200 observations, but 150 unique individuals. I don't know how to tabulate this to report descriptive statistics. Normally I would do: tab var1 var2, chi2 // (giving me p value and frequencies) But how would I conduct this while accounting for some ID's repeating?
