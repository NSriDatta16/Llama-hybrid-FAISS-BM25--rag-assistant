Dealing with multi seasonality in time series

I am new in R and time series analysis and need some help. I am currently trying to create a tool to forecast the demand of power for a company. On my data set I have 17550 observations that correspond to the demand on the last 17550 hours. My approach to the problem was to try fit a time series with a multi seasonality approach. I tried using Fourier series terms as regressors, and as a first step I am checking the AIC values for certain combinations of the number of terms. my code so far is: Demand = head(MyData$Value,-1000) aic_vals_temp I want to test the influence of last day, last week and last year information. Am I doing this correctly so far? I have noticed that it takes a lot of time to get the AIC values. Thanks a lot for your help in advance.
