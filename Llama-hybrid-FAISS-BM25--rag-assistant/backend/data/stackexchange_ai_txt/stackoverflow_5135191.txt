Windows driver programming or Linux driver programming?

I want to learn driver programming. But I don't know anything about it, except a driver is something that acts as an interface between the operating system and the outer world. What is easier to learn, Windows driver or Linux driver programming? Where should I start? I am at an intermediate stage in C programming. What are the prerequisites? As I, in 2010, graduated as a B.Tech. in computer science from an average college, can I start doing driver programming? I mean, can only experienced persons program drivers? What are the career oppurtunities in this field?
