Exact matching + multiple regression on high-dimensional treatment-control study?

I'm working on a project with healthcare data where episodes of care in the treatment and control groups must be matched to estimate average treatment effect (ATE). I have several hundred covariates including age, sex, and various utilization and health risk factors (most of which are sparse binary variables). While my go-to model has been propensity score matching, recent research by Gary King, Richard Nielsen, and others have recommended using exact matching (or coarsened exact matching). Question: Is it appropriate to use exact matching on a subset of the covariates, followed by multiple regression on the remaining variables in the matched data in order to estimate the ATE? The subset of covariates could be selected by choosing the largest effect sizes from a simple regression on the outcome variable.
