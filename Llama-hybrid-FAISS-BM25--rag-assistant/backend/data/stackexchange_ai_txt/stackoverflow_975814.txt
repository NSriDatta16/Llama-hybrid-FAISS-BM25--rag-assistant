httpwebrequest Cookiecontainer

How do I handle cookies with paths other than "/". An HttpWebRequest object returns these headers: HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Transfer-Encoding: chunked Date: Wed, 10 Jun 2009 13:22:53 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Expires: Wed, 10 Jun 2009 13:22:53 GMT Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0 Server: nginx/0.7.41 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.9 Last-Modified: Wed, 10 Jun 2009 13:22:52 GMT Pragma: no-cache Set-Cookie: cookie1=c1; path=/; domain=site.com Set-Cookie: cookie2=c2; path=/content; domain=site.com; httponly Set-Cookie: cookie3=c3; path=/admin; domain=site.com; httponly Set-Cookie: cookie4=c4; path=/; domain=site.com; httponly Location: http://site.com/admin/ Via: 1.1 mvo-netcache-02 (NetCache NetApp/6.0.7) Iterating through a cookie collection only containsthe cookies with a path of "/". So the cookiecontainer only has cookie1 and cookie4 in it. Why are the rest not being collected? How do I access the cookies with paths other than "/"? Can I gather them all in one container? Thanks
