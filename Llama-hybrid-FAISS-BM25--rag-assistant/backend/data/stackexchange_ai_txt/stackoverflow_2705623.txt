You can't sort a Dictionary - it's inherently unordered. (Or rather, the order in which entries are retrieved is implementation-specific. You shouldn't rely on it working the same way between versions, as ordering isn't part of its designed functionality.) You can use SortedList or SortedDictionary , both of which sort by the key (in a configurable way, if you pass an IEqualityComparer into the constructor) - might those be of use to you? Pay little attention to the word "list" in the name SortedList - it's still a dictionary in that it maps keys to values. It's implemented using a list internally, effectively - so instead of looking up by hash code, it does a binary search. SortedDictionary is similarly based on binary searches, but via a tree instead of a list.
