There are two answers to this. Firstly, take a look at the MetaType service, which allows your configured bundles to declare all the fields and types that they accept. But IMHO it is better to make your ManagedService(Factory) implementations robust in the face of a variety of data formats. In particular, ensure that they are always able to handle Strings as a last resort, even if another data type is preferred. This is because some management agents either ignore the MetaType service or they are unable to supply data as any types besides Strings. Felix FileInstall is a good example: it simply reads a Properties file, therefore treating everything as a String. Be strict in what you send, but generous in what you receive.
