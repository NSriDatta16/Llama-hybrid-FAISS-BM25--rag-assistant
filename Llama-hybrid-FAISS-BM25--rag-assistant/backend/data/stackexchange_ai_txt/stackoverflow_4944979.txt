Does a single web request to IIS stay on a single thread?

I want to write a logging http module that stores a list of log events for a single request in thread local storage while the request executes. On End_Request I want to write all the events back to persistent storage. Question is, will one request match to one thread? I.e. can I assume from anywhere in my code that I can add items to the IEnumerable and they will properly be all together at the end of the request.
