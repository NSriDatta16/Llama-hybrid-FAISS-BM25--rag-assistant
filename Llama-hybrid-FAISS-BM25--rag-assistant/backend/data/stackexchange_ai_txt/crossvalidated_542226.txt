Variable length with permutation invariance for generative networks is very hard and no method that I know of currently tackles both at the same time with good success rate. If you only need variable length outputs RNNs are used for the time dimension and CNNs are used for the spatial dimension. However for your case, is there anything preventing you from just outputting a single very large vector, with each index corresponding to one ingredient? That would take care of the permutation problem. For example, if you have 32 ingredients with 3 attributes each, you could output 3 vectors of size 32. Missing ingredients can be set as 0 in all attributes.
