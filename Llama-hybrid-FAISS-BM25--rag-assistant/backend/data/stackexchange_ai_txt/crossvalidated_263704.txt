The problem with that "model" is that it is'nt really, really a model! This was discussed at length in McCullaghs (2000) paper "What is a statistical model?" http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1035844977 which I am not going to review here. (He finds that to answer the question, he needs quite advanced mathematics, specifically, category theory). So I will try to give a simpler explanation of that (which basically is the reason given by Box and Cox themselves). When you vary the transform parameter $\phi$, then you change the measurement scale of $y$ itself . Lets say that the original data $y$ (corresponding to transform parameter $\phi=1$) is measured in meter (m). Then, when $\phi=1/2$, $y$ is square root of meter (whatever that may be!) and if $\phi=2$ y is now square meter! So, not only the scale, but the meaning of the two other parameters $\mu, \sigma$ change when $\phi$ is changing (That is, their unit of measurement change). This argument could be seen as an application of dimensional analysis , an underused tool in statistics. So, maybe we should say that the "boxcox model" is not a model, but a family of models indexed by $\phi$ . If you want a Bayesian treatment of this (probably not a very good idea?) you must give separate prior distributions for $\mu, \sigma$ for each value of $\phi$ (they should of course be correctly related). Say you have a prior of the form $\propto 1/\sigma$ when $\phi=1$, then for other values of $\phi$ the prior distribution could be calculated (try it!) and it would be quite different. If that is worth it, or practical, I do not know, but it could be interesting to try.
