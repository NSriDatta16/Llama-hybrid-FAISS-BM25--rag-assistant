iPhone - Combining a Tab Bar with multiple navigation bars

I am trying to build an iPhone application that has a Tab bar as the root controller and several navigation bars. My doubt is, shall I create one NavigationBarController class for each navigation bar that I want to put in the application? Or is it possible to create only a single navigation controller that manages all the navigation bar controllers that exist in the application? In the case that multiple navigation controllers exist in the application, can I use the "self" to access the correct navigation controller that pushes/pops the view? Or should I use the delegate of the Application delegate to access each navigation bar controllers? (I am assuming that all navigation bar controllers are declared in the application delegate, is this approach correct or is there a more elegant approach?) Thanks a lot in advance
