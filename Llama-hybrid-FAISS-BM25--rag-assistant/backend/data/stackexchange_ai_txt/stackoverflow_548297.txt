While it is true that there is no DROP ALL TABLES command you can use the following set of commands. Note: These commands have the potential to corrupt your database, so make sure you have a backup PRAGMA writable_schema = 1; delete from sqlite_master where type in ('table', 'index', 'trigger'); PRAGMA writable_schema = 0; you then want to recover the deleted space with VACUUM; and a good test to make sure everything is ok PRAGMA INTEGRITY_CHECK;
