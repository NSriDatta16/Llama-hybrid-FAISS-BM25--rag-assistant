Consider each isolated section to be a project (in both the physical and management sense) as independent. Ship release from those shared components/projects and deliver them as binaries to be pulled into the others. You can use a the output from trunk or release branch builds of the shared components to deliver new "releases". This affords you the option of full branching, work item, reporting etc for each logical project in your organization.
