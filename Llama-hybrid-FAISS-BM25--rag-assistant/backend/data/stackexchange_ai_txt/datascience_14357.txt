A similar question was asked on CV: difference between neural network and deep learning : Deep learning = deep artificial neural networks + other kind of deep models . Deep artificial neural networks = artificial neural networks with more than 1 layer. (see minimum number of layers in a deep neural network ) FYI: How true is this slide on deep learning claiming that all improvements from 1980s are only due to much more data and much faster computers?
