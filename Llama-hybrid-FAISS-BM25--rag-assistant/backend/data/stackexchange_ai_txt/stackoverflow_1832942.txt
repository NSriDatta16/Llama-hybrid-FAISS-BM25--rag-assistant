Statistics are VERY important for the query optimizer. They should be gathered on a regular basis either automatically or manually. When executing a query Oracle will produce a pool of available execution plans in order to satisfy your query. Those execution plans are the same from the standpoint that they will return you the same exact result, it's just the road to getting there may be far more efficient for one plan over another. To determine this efficiency, Oracle uses the stats generated on the objects used in each of the execution plans to determine their individual costs. If those stats are non-existent or are stale, the cost associated with each plan will be less accurate and therefore the optimal plan may not be chosen. Here are some of the key stats that Oracle uses for determining this cost: Table statistics * Number of rows * Number of blocks * Average row length Column statistics * Number of distinct values (NDV) in column * Number of nulls in column * Data distribution (histogram) * Extended statistics Index statistics * Number of leaf blocks * Levels * Clustering factor System statistics * I/O performance and utilization * CPU performance and utilization
