There are two possible interpretations of your question. The first (where the Organization1 and Organization2 columns are not equal) is trivial: SELECT AccountID FROM Table WHERE Organization1 <> Organization2 But I suspect you're asking the slightly more difficult interpretation (where Organization2 does not appear in ANY Organization1 value for the same account): SELECT AccountID From Table T1 WHERE Organization2 NOT IN (SELECT Organization1 FROM Table T2 WHERE T2.AccountID = T1.AccountID)
