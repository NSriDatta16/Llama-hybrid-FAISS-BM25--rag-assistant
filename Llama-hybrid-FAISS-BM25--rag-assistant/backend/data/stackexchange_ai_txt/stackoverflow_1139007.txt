App Engine will start new runtimes for you whenever demand is outstripping the currently running instances. It will then shut down instances when demand is lower. Ultimately, this means that all of your instances could be shut down if your app is not used for a certain amount of time. Then, the next time a user tries to access your app, a new instance will need to be started, or "spun up" as some people call it. As of March, the app engine team wouldn't give any official estimate on how long an instance will stay up: 7:40pm] nwinter: Is it possible to get a rough estimate of how long an app instance will stick around once spawned? [7:40pm] marzia_google: @nwinter, not really [7:40pm] marzia_google: there are no garuntees [7:41pm] nwinter: No average time or anything? [7:42pm] marzia_google: @nwinter i'm not sure an average time would be meaningful, even if i knew off hand what it was ( i don't) [7:42pm] marzia_google: since it really can be quite variable [7:42pm] Kardax: Re instance lifetime: So an app instance could last a few seconds or a few hours? Just curious [7:43pm] dan_google: nwinter: Apps are evicted by least-recently-used on an app server. As someone noted recently (forums or chat I forget), low traffic could mean lots of "restarts", but so could spikes in traffic which may start new instances on multiple app servers. [7:43pm] nwinter: @dan_google: good to know! [7:43pm] dan_google: Kardax: Yes, depending on the weather. By which I mean, request patterns, other apps on each app server, and so forth. Not really predictable. This is the transcript of a chat with the app engine team. I have deleted the non-relevant lines in the transcript like "so and so logged in."
