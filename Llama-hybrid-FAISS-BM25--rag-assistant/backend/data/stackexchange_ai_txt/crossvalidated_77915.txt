How to describe the failure of this linear modelling?

I have a time series $X_t$, which is shown in the first plot. In the second plot, I am doing a linear regression on $X_t\sim X_{t-1}$. The regression line is very close to $y=x$. But this is tricky since if if we look at the bottom left or the top right part of the data, they are almost random. From the diagnosis of residuals, it is not a good regression either. But the model passes all the $t$ tests and $F$ tests. How can I say it's not a good model then? Is there a statistic to describe (not visually) the failure of this modelling? Here are the R codes I used to generate the plots: # Generating X_t x=c(arima.sim(list(order = c(1,0,0),ar=0.1),n=64,sd=1),3,5,7,11,14,17,rep(20,64)+arima.sim(list(order = c(1,0,0),ar=0.1),n=64,sd=1)) # Regression X_t~X_{t-1} reg=lm(x[2:length(x)]~x[1:(length(x)-1)]) # Plotting par(mfrow=c(3,2)) plot(x,xlab='',ylab=expression(X[t]),ty='l') plot(x[1:(length(x)-1)],x[2:length(x)],xlab=expression(x[t-1]),ylab=expression(x[t]) ,main=paste('coeff= ',round(reg$coefficients[2],2))) # Plotting the regression line abline(reg,col=2) # Plotting the residual diagnose plot(reg)
