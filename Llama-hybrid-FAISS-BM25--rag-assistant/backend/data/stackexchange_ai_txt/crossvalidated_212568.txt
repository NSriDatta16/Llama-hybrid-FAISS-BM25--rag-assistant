There is a very similar question here , regarding an interaction between categorical and continuous variables. Even though your example is with polr() and not lm(), the logic is the same, as it appears you are already comfortable interpreting coefficients in a logistic regression. What you need to do is calculate the marginal effect. The 'effects' package is helpful for this and works very well with polr() specifications: library(effects) plot(allEffects(mod)) A plot will likely be the best way for you to visualize and communicate your results. When you include an interaction term, you cannot interpret your summary() output the same way. For example, PreReqGrade may be significant over some letter grades but not over others. Just looking at your summary() output will not give you this information. If you feel like your references are skimming over this, then what you should do is to look up and try to understand what a marginal effect is -- see also literature referenced in this post . One final comment on your question: Current grade appears to be a letter grade (ordinal), but PreReqGrade appears to be continuous. Is this a numerical grade, or did you forget to factor it? Just to note as well, @FrankHarrell is also absolutely correct. He literally wrote the book on this... I just wanted to give you some links for further reading, to try to help you understand what some of these R function with interaction terms are actually doing.
