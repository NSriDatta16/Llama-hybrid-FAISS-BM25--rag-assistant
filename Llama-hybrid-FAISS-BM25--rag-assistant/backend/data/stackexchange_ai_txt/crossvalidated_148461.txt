How do you get the principal components of one matrix along the principal directions of another matrix?

I have a data matrix, A , on which I have performed principal component analysis (PCA) using the prcomp function in R. This gives me the rotation ( eigenvector ) field and the x ( rotated data ) field. Now I have another data matrix, B . I want to find the principal components of B along the principal directions of the rotation of A obtained above. How would I go about doing this? So far, I've just calculated the two prcomp 's separately and used a vector projection to project the principal components of B along the eigenvectors of A. Is this correct?
