text[0] fails if text is an empty string: IronPython 2.6 Alpha (2.6.0.1) on .NET 4.0.20506.1 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> text = "" >>> print(text.startswith("a")) False >>> print(text[0]=='a') Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in IndexError: index out of range: 0 EDIT: You say you "know" that text is not empty... how confident are you of that, and what would you want to happen if it is empty in reality? If a failure is appropriate (e.g. it means a bug in your code) that would encourage the use of text[0]=='a' . Other questions: How concerned are you about the performance of this? If this is performance critical, then benchmark it on your particular Python runtime . I wouldn't be entirely surprised to find that (say) one form was faster on IronPython and a different one faster on CPython. Which do you (and your team) find more readable?
