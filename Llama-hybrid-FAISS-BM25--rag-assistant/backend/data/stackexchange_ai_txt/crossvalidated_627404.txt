There is no reason to expect normality. Think about using the rank difference test or its regression model generalization described here . You have to acccount for a poke being a response variable just as poke duration is a response variable. Don't condition on a response variable by either using it as a covariate or conditioning on a poke. See if defining poke duration = 0 when pokes don't occur makes sense. Note that ordinal model generalizations for rank pre-post tests allow imbalance, if imbalance still exists after paying attention to proper construction of a response variable. But I guess for a secondary analysis you can delve more deeply into the distribution of poke time given that a poke occurs, just not so much for comparing pre with post.
