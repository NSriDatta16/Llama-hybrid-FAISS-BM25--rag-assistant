You don't need any network programming experience to anonymize the packets. The format of the output file is well documented in the pcap-savefile(5) manpage. You will need to lookup the layouts of the various protocols you'll be handling in order to identify what fields need to be anonymized. You should also look at the link layer header types documentation at tcpdump.org to help you get started. EDIT: Also look at libpcap itself... according to the pcap-savefile manpage: NOTE: applications and libraries should, if possible, use libpcap to read savefiles, rather than having their own code to read savefiles. If, in the future, a new file format is supported by libpcap, applica- tions and libraries using libpcap to read savefiles will be able to read the new format of savefiles, but applications and libraries using their own code to read savefiles will have to be changed to support the new file format.
