jQuery: Rotate through , hiding all but one. Then Repeat

I've got this code to work mostly right. It hides all but one of the tags of a certain class, then rotates to the next one on a click. I want it to reset when it reaches the last tag, and display the first one again, but it doesn't. What am I doing wrong? Here's the javascript code: $(document).ready(function() { var curPoem=1; if ($("h2.title").length==1) { break; } else { $("h2.title").eq(0).after("\ \ Click the title to change the poem\ \ ") } $("p.lit").not($("p.lit:eq(0)")).hide(); $("p.lit").eq(0).show(); $("h2.title").not($("h2.title:eq(0)")).hide(); $("h2.title").eq(0).bind("click", function() { $("p.lit").not($("p.lit:eq("+curPoem+")")).hide(); $("p.lit").eq(curPoem).show(); $("h2.title").eq(0).empty(); for (i=0; i The HTML It act's on: var author="Bud Robert Berkich"; var litTitle=["In the End", "Rental Car"]; In the End Bud Robert Berkich your other for another for yourself and not for me selfish that other indifferent not for you and now not for me too never for me but I never I othered another selfless (I othered the same for you) and now nothing in the end nothing Rental Car 4 AM. I find myself in the vicinity of the lake that five years before witnessed "the fishing trip from hell." For me, the beginning of the end. And I'm aware of the fact that if I'm in the middle of no front and back, I can easily slip up a non-gated park entrance unawares. But as the darkness pushes in and the insects mock me from behind trees I can't see, a feeling hell will be paid. I leave.
