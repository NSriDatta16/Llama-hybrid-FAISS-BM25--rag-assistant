The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove operation), the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. Why don't you call the remove () method on the iterator or set.remove (iterator.next ()) where iterator.next () returns the key, set is the keyset and iterator its iterator. PS: also try to refactor your data structure, maybe some intermediate classes which handle the data retrieval? A map in a map with arrays as values doesn't say anything and is difficult to keep track of.
