To my knowledge, the .NET Framework does not include an API with direct access to math intrinsics. The Mono libraries do include working support for intrinsics, but I'm not sure the state of them. [Edit: This paragraph is commentary on why you don't see overloads for float parameters.] One trouble is the CLI evaluation stack (per ECMA-335) does not distinguish between the float and double types. A valid implementation could treat everything as a double for math operations, but I imagine the CLR (Microsoft's implementation of the CLI) performs optimizations for single-precision arithmetic where it can. I think it's somewhat unfortunate that the issue of intrinsics (in particular SIMD extensions) hasn't been addressed [in a released product] yet. My outsider's-guess is support for intrinsics would require significant alterations to the VM that pose unacceptable risks at this point in the .NET Framework release cycle. The garbage collector (and I think the exception handling mechanisms) is tightly coupled with the register allocator, and supporting intrinsics adds a radical new variable to that area.
