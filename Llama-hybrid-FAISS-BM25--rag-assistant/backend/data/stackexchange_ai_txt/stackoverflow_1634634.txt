One other way you could do it is with rack. You could track the number of times an IP visits the login page over a certain amount of time storing the login attempts on the database, memcached, redis, tokyo cabinet, etc. Then deny the user access to the page if they have exceeded a set quota for a defined time interval. Damien suggested Authlogic. Authlogic is my favorite authentication system for Rails. It is very comprehensive and adaptable. There are plenty of existing modules for Authlogic, and I'm sure you could leverage one of these to have Authlogic work for you.
