How to simulate customer walk-ins for a given period in a fast food chain in R

I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me where I would start in tackling the following tasks in R. I'm not a data-science expert and am trying to teach myself data-analysis from a background in physics. I have introductory statistics and have just finished Udacity's course in R programming and exploratory data analysis. Tasks: 1 )Simulate customer walk-ins for a given period. The simulations should take into account peak volumes at different times of the days and differences in week days and weekends. 2) Simulate customer purchases based on the customer walk-ins. Make assumptions on the average dollar price and variations for different times of the day. Thank you
