You need to ALSO understand representation learning before differentiating between machine learning and deep learning Machine learning requires you to chose features by experimenting and applying experience. It is shallow in the sense that it does not have multiple layers unlike deep learning. ML is a superset of Representation learning which learns the features automatically. Deep learning is a subset of representation learning. Here is a tweet with a picture that might help. https://twitter.com/dickeysingh/status/967944753550471168?s=21 If you are technically inclined and favor core fundamentals I recommend THE book by Ian Goodfellow deeplearningbook.org I recommend the kindle version instead of the free web version. Hope this helps somewhat.
