VS 2008 The operation could not be completed. Not enough storage is available to complete this operation

On updating my working copy from SVN. I get this error. The operation could not be completed. Not enough storage is available to complete this operation. This error also corrupts my all reference in main project ( not in DAL not in BLL). and I have to add all (.net or 3rd party dlls) again. VS 2008 Error http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/8871/errork.png It was working OK but I am getting this error from the last couple of days. If anybody can help! EDIT: I have increased Virtual Memory and now I am not getting this error. I will check this for couple of days and again inform you people.
