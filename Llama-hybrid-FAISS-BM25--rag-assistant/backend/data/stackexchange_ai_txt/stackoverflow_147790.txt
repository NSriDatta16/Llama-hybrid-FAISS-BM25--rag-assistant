There are a few points to consider. A \u2018 character may appear only as a fragment of representation of a unicode string in Python, e.g. if you write: >>> text = u'‘' >>> print repr(text) u'\u2018' Now if you simply want to print the unicode string prettily, just use unicode's encode method: >>> text = u'I don\u2018t like this' >>> print text.encode('utf-8') I don‘t like this To make sure that every line from any file would be read as unicode, you'd better use the codecs.open function instead of just open , which allows you to specify file's encoding: >>> import codecs >>> f1 = codecs.open(file1, "r", "utf-8") >>> text = f1.read() >>> print type(text) >>> print text.encode('utf-8') I don‘t like this
