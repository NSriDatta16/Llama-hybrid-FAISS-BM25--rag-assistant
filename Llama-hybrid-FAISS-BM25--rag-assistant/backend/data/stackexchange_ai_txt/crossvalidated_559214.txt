Interpretation of plots from neural network

I am working on a Keras and TensorFlow in R and I trying to make good predictions for a regression problem. Below you can see how is look like plots two plots one for loss function and second for mean absolute error. On the first plot validation with green line is above red line and also on second plot green line is above red line. So can anybody help me how to interpret this result ? Does my neural network fit well ?
