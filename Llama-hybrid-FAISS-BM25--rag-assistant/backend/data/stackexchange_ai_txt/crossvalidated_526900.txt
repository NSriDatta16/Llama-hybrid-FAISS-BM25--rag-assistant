Is there any method to use the MCMC method to estimate the measures of samples?

I try to explain my question clearly: The MCMC method generates samples from a candidate distribution in the stationary state. In summary, MCMC generates a sample ( i+1 ) based on sample ( i ), $p(s_{i+1} | s_i)$ . Suppose, I have a function f that gets each sample as an input and returns back a real number as the output, and suppose that the time complexity of f is very high. In this case, generating samples $s = \{s_1, s_2, ... , s_{n}\}$ using MCMC is easy, but I am looking for a method, approach, research paper or anything that is about calculating the value of $f(s_{i+1})$ by using information of $f(s_i)$ , i.e, $p(f(s_{i+1}) | f(s_i))$ . Is there such a method or is there any relevant articles in this regard?
