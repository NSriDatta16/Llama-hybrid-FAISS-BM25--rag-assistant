My two cents: I would have first created an ontology holding a list of all apps used in your data set. Using the ontology and the data I would have vectorized each device into categorical features(has/has not) of each of the apps. Then, I can use a KNN based on a cosine-similarity metric-space of prediction. I am not sure how many apps (bits) the vector will be comprised of, so you might need dimensionality reduction or a more robust classification algorithm (maybe SVM since it can handle lots of features).
