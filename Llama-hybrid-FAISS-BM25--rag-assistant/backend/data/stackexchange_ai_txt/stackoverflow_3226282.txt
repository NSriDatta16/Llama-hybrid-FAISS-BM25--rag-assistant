Are there best practices for (Java) package organization?

A little while ago, I saw a question answered here regarding the fine-grained organization of Java packages. For example, my.project.util , my.project.factory , my.project.service , etc. Are there best practices with regards to the organization of packages in Java and what goes in them? How do you organize your classes in your Java project? For instance, a project I'm working on with a few people has a package called beans . It started out being a project containing simple beans, but it has ended up (through poor experience and lack of time) containing everything (almost). I've cleaned them up a little, by putting some factory classes in a factory package (classes with static methods that create beans), but we have other classes that do business logic and others that do simple processing (not with business logic) like retrieving a message for a code from a properties file.
