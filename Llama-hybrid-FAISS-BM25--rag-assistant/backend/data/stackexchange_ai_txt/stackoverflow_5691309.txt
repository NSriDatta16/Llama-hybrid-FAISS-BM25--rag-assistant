In Python, what are the cons of calling os.waitpid in a program with multiple threads?

I've heard there are problems when calling os.waitpid from within a thread. I have not experienced such problems yet (especially using os.WNOHANG option). However I have not paid much attention to the performance implications of such use. Are there any performance penalties or any other issues one should be aware of? Does this have to do with os.waitpid (potentially) using signals? I don't see how signals could be related, though, since otherwise (I suppose) I wouldn't be able to get os.waitpid to return when calling it from a non-main thread.
