First, let me say that I don't have anything personal against you when I say something like "your beliefs" or "you and those you designate" in my comments. It's not you per se, it's someone in general. You should probably look into Dempster Shafer Theory , which is a way to fuse beliefs. (Carefully read the Criticisms section. When it works it works well, when it's misapplied, it fails spectacularly.) Or perhaps Fuzzy Logic, Possibility Theory, and other topics I imagine the Dempster Shafer Theory page on Wikipedia would link to. You should also look at Artificial Intelligence (AI) research projects, like Cyc , that are already attempting to create a base of knowledge/experience upon which AI might build. It's a very hard problem and it's my impression that the consensus may even be that it's a dead end. On a personal-reaction note, what you're proposing sounds to me a little like Google's proposed idea that they might be able to not only search but also return the "truth" of what it finds. That creeps me out: Google deciding what's true? Think it might get political or reinforce a currently-popular consensus maybe? I've already seen the negative effects of Google's Friend's effect on search results, and that's way too much power, and you can never underestimate Confirmation Bias. Last, one of the reasons science is currently experiencing a replication crisis, in my opinion, is that we're all become modelators (if I may coin a phrase for idolators/worshippers of models). We over-simplify and then when a computer spits out an answer with the proper p-value, we say it's true . Not to discourage you, but to add a warning to your enthusiasm. You have an admirable drive and as you branch out into Logic, Artificial Intelligence, Bayesian Statistics, etc, you'll learn a lot and may find some linkages between them that lead to breakthroughs. Just be skeptical of your ideas, look for bugs in your code, look for exceptions in your logic, beat your ideas and system up, and in the end you may have a nugget of gold. That's the Scientific Method.
