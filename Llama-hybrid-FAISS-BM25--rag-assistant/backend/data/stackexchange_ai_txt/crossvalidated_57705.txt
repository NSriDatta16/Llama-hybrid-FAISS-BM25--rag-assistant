Identify seasonality in time series data

I want to detect presence of seasonality in time series data. I know one can achieve that by plotting the autocorrelation function but I need an automatic process if the series is seasonal or not, more like an algorithm that after I run the time series thought I get 'YES' for seasonal and 'NO' for nonseasonal. Is there anything in R that I can use? If not what is a way by knowing the autocorrelation function (ACF) to do this? Thanks
