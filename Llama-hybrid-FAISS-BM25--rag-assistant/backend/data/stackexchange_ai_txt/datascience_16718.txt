HMM - Matlab for data set to detect anomaly

I have a dataset of oil temperatures. The time series consist of 100 hours of measurement at every second. There is an anomaly in the data that I would like to detect using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). In Matlab I used hmmgenerate , however I'm not able to link my data to the assumed probabilities. Instead random states and sequences are generated. Could anyone help me?
