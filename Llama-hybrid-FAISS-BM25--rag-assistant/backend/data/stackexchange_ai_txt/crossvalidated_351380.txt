Also, non-identifiability is a big problem for using MCMC for mixture models. Basically, if you switch labels on your cluster means and cluster assignments, the likelihood doesn't change, and this can confuse the sampler (between chains or within chains). One thing you might try to mitigate this is using Potentials in PyMC3. A good implementation of a GMM with Potentials is here . The posterior for these kinds of problems is also generally highly multimodal, which also presents a big problem. You might instead want to use EM (or Variational inference).
