Embedding Videos - Various Questions

I'm developing a website that will host some videos. The client wants control over the videos, so it will be hosted on the same server as the website. I need to know two things: What is the best video format to use for this purpose? I.e. what is the best compromise between bandwidth and quality? And then, what is the best way to play this format on a website? The client wants to host two versions of each video, hi-res and low-res. For the format recommended in the first part of this question, what would be a good file size per minute of video to achieve these resolutions? Many thanks.
