Bayesian Predictive Posterior Distribution for Batch Defect Probability

For a research project, I need to assess the probability that a new batch is defective. I want to use a predictive posterior distribution for this purpose, as it incorporates uncertainty. A beta-binomial distribution seems most appropriate to me, given that I only have defect rates from previous batches. Can someone assist me in setting up a formula? I am not very familiar with Bayesian analysis. The inspection process is as follows, a random sample is taken from a batch and compared with the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) standard, which is set at 0.15. To illustrate, I've provided data on some recent batch inspections for a specific product: Batch 1: Q tested: 6 units Defective: 3 units Batch rejected, Batch 2: Q tested: 6 units Defective: 0 units Batch accepted, Batch 3: Q:12 units Defective: 7 units Batch rejected, Batch 4: Q:18 units Defective: 5 units Batch rejected, Batch 5: Q:13 units Defective: 5 units Batch rejected, Batch 6: Q:18 units Defective: 0 units Batch Accepted, Batch 7: Q:4 units Defective: 0 units Batch Accepted, Batch 8: Q:5 units Defective: 1 units Batch rejected, Batch 9: Q:10 units Defective: 0 units Batch Accepted, Batch 10: Q:11 units Defective: 0 units Batch Accepted, Batch 11: Q:4 units Defective: 1 units Batch rejected, Batch 12: Q:21 units Defective: 0 units Batch Accepted, Batch 13: Q:7 units Defective: 3 units Batch rejected, Batch 14: Q: 38 units Defective: 7 units Batch rejected, Batch 15: Q:13 units Defective: 0 units Batch Accepted, The goal is to rank batches for inspection based on the estimated probability.
