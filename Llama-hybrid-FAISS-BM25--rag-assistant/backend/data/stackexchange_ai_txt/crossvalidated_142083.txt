The go-to reference for power calculatinos is Cohen (1988). It is not clear exactly which test you want to perform, but assuming you want to compute the power of a z-test of the difference between an $H_A$ average and an assumed $H_0$ average, you have the following inequality: $$ n \geq \left(\frac{\sigma(z_{\alpha} - \Phi^{-1}(\beta))}{\mu_{test}}\right)^2, $$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
