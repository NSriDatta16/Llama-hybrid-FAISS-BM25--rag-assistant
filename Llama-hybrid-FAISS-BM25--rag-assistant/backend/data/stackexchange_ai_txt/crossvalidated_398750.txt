Is ARIMAX suitable for time series with exogenous variables?

I have the following data: Date Fruit Color y 01/01/2018 apples red 0.435 02/01/2018 oranges green 0.234 ... 01/01/2019 bananas purple 0.234 I want to predict y for future dates. I have used linear and logistic regression but never worked with dates. So I have three "regressors": date, fruit and color. I have read about ARIMAX, but I don't quite understand if this is the technique suitable for this problem. I have also read about seasonality, but I am no expert in this topic, so how can I tell if my data has seasonality?
