I wouldn't bother trying to create your own session IDs. Your method is particularly weak as many people will share the same remote host, user agent and remote address in the case of proxy servers. Use PHP's built-in sessions unless you find a specific reason to avoid them. You've given no indication that you have such a reason. Quite the opposite, as you say the system is for internal use where your home-rolled "enhanced" session security is even less important. It doesn't really matter what you're doing, chances are you will only lessen the security of what PHP already provides for you by trying to roll your own.
