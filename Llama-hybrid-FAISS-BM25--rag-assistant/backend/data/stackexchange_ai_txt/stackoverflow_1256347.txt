Plot time data in R to various resolutions (to the minute, to the hour, to the second, etc.)

I have some data in CSV like: "Timestamp", "Count" "2009-07-20 16:30:45", 10 "2009-07-20 16:30:45", 15 "2009-07-20 16:30:46", 8 "2009-07-20 16:30:46", 6 "2009-07-20 16:30:46", 8 "2009-07-20 16:30:47", 20 I can read it into R using read.cvs. I'd like to plot: Number of entries per second, so: "2009-07-20 16:30:45", 2 "2009-07-20 16:30:46", 3 "2009-07-20 16:30:47", 1 Average value per second: "2009-07-20 16:30:45", 12.5 "2009-07-20 16:30:46", 7.333 "2009-07-20 16:30:47", 20 Same as 1 & 2 but then by Minute and then by Hour. Is there some way to do this (collect by second/min/etc & plot) in R?
