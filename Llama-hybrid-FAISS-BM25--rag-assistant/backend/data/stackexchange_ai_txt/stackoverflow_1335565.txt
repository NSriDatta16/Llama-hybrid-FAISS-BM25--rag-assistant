While that's not confirmed from Google representatives, it's very possible, especially when you look at how Cupcake has pretty much reached the limit of the Dev Phone 1's internal flash storage. The media has over-stated the problem, IMHO. what are the best choices for Android test device and should we be worrying about buying the Dev Phone 1 now. AFAIK, ADP1 is out of stock. If you can get a Google Ion device off of eBay, that also is a "dev phone", insofar as it supports flashing alternative firmware. do you think that Android-based netbooks (eventually without hardware buttons) will be used as test devices Any Android device is a test device, for the purposes of testing SDK applications. do you plan your development with resolutions bigger than HVGA in mind I plan my development to at least have a hope of working on screens bigger than HVGA. Without testing on at least a proper larger emulator skin, it is difficult to tell how well those plans work out. I think that before something like Android Dev Phone 2, the developer community will have to resort to the open market devices and that applications for netbook-class devices will slowly differentiate from the ones that target Android smartphones (maybe different departments in Android market). ADP2 will be pointless for 99.99% of Android developers, just as ADP1 is. The advantage those devices offer is the ability to flash your own firmware. If you are not developing your own firmware, the advantage is moot. I strongly encourage SDK-level developers to use real consumer ("open market") devices if they can.
