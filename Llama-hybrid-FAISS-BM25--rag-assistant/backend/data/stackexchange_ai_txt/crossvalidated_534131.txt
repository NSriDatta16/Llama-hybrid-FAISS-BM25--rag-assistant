Doctor Jason Brownlee, on his page https://machinelearningmastery.com . I publish code in python that can serve you, it is not a library as such, but perhaps it will serve as a palliative to what you are looking for. You could also extrapolate this idea (it is used in SARIMA), but with some changes and calculation of the error it could be useful. In section, SARIMA to time series forecasting , You modify part of the code and it should look like this: p = d = q = P = D = Q = s = range(0, 2) pdqPDQs = list(itertools.product(p, d, q, P, D, Q, s)) Here you will find experts on the subject, they will certainly be able to help you with what you are looking for.
