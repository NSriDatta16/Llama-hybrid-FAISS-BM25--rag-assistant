PCA will give you the eigenvectors of the empirical covariance matrix of your data. Then, the sign of a particular eigenvalue doesn't matter, which has been addressed here. As a brief recap, let $\Sigma$ be the empirical covariance matrix of your data; suppose we have some vector $v$ such that the exists some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ where $\Sigma v = \lambda v$ (def. of eigenvector/eigenvalue). Let $w = -v$ ; then $w$ is also an eigenvector of $\Sigma$ , as $\Sigma w = -\lambda w$ . From a non-rigorous standpoint, all you've done is "flip" the eigenvector, meaning that the corresponding principal component is essentially the same. For a more in-depth explanation, see here . Thus, mathematically, both of the implementations above are equivalent and valid. I'm not sure how XLSTAT and scikit implement PCA internally, but different implementations can certainly lead to this behavior.
