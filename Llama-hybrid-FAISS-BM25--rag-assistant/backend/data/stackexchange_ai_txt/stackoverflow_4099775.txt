Regions are a tool just like anything else. If you have a use for them ... goody. If not, awesome. They allow you to close and separate entire blocks of code so a developer can organize things and find them rapidly. If you have a region called "Properties", it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure out what is in there. Thus it can be collapsed and will no longer interfere with scrolling the page unnecessarily. It's a maintenance item that may or may not help developers keep track of their classes and maybe avoid stepping on each other's code. For those that don't find them useful, don't use them. For our team we defined a standard for using them, and we pretty much stick to that standard. Just throwing things into regions can make the problem even worse, so it's always good to adopt a standard and stick to it (whichever way you choose). EDIT: I can't think of a good use for using regions within specific methods. That just seems like clutter to me, but it wouldn't surprise me to find someone who found a decent use for it (in their opinion).
