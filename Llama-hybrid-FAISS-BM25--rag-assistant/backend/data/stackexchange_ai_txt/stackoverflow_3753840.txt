Intermediate Ramaze Routing Help Please

Part 1: I have a call to layout(:default){|path,wish| wish !~ /rss|atom|json/} but requests to /foo/bar.json seem to think wish is html and uses the layout anyway. How can I fix this? Part 2: I want to route /path/to/file.ext so that it calls the method to on the controller mapped to /path and uses ext when formulating the return. Is there a better (more elegant) way to do this than passing the 'file.ext' to the to method, parsing it, and doing cases? This question would have been more succinct if I had written, how does one do REST with Ramaze? There appears to be a Google Groups answer to this one, but I can't access it for some reason.
