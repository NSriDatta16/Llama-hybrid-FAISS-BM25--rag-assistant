Could you post your mapping files and the query you're using? I'm not sure I understand the question exactly, or how the DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer comes into play, but if your entity includes a collection of other entities, or is part of a joined-subclass relationship, (or other relationships?) NHibernate will do joins for you in order to populate the entity (even if you don't have explicit joins in your query). You can stop hibernate from doing various joins by setting the lazy property on the specific mapping. It will only fetch the data if you end up using it.
