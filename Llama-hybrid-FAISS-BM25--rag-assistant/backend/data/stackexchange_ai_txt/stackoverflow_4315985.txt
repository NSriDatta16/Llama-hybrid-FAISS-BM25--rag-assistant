I can provide a limited answer here. We are using alfresco in production, not strictly for financial data analysis, but we're in the sector. As such, we have some reports based strictly on the data from alfresco itself. We're still not using the data lists feature, we just recently upgraded from alfresco 3.0 to the newest version, but we do collect information and we do some counting/calculating. It all seems ok, and what's most important, it scales pretty well. Also what's good about alfresco is that depending on "seriousness" of your needs, you can leverage different APIs - javascript scripts are pretty quick to deploy and Java API is good for connecting your alfresco numbers to other numbers. If you decide to take it the alfresco road, I will suggest to hire experienced alfresco developer for initial setup - as some not-so-smart choices in the beginning cost you a great deal later down the path.
