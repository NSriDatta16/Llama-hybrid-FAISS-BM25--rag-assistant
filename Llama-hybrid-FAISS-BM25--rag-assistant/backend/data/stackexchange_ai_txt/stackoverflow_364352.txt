Use the Handle/Body pattern (also sometimes known as "pimpl", "adapter", "decorator", "bridge" or "wrapper"). By isolating the implementation of your classes into your .cpp files, they need only be compiled once. Most changes do not require changes to the header file so it means you can make fairly extensive changes while only requiring one file to be recompiled. This also encourages refactoring and writing of comments and unit tests since compile time is decreased. Additionally, you automatically separate the concerns of interface and implementation so the interface of your code is simplified.
