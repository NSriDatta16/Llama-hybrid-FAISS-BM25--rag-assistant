You are right, $P(x)$ is the underlying distribution of data, and it can be assumed constant, simply because it is independent of our modeling practice. However $P(x)$ may change gradually over time, this phenomenon is called "distribution shift". For example, the distribution of height in a country may change over years. Note that "prior" is a reserved word for $P(\theta)$ which is the distribution of model parameters in Bayesian modeling. In non-Bayesian modeling there is no notion of "prior". $P(x|\theta)$ is called likelihood and $P(x)=\sum_{\theta}P(x|\theta)P(\theta)$ is called marginalized likelihood (likelihood marginalized over model parameters).
