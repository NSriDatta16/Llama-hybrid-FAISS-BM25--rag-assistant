Which performance measure to report?

I've trained a random forest regression model using boot632 resampling and the caret package. The output of the model tuning process gives a few different performance measures. Random Forest 201 samples 14 predictor No pre-processing Resampling: Bootstrapped (100 reps) Summary of sample sizes: 201, 201, 201, 201, 201, 201, ... Resampling results across tuning parameters: mtry RMSE Rsquared RMSE SD Rsquared SD RMSEApparent RsquaredApparent 2 1.775407 0.2457171 0.1183597 0.05434687 1.5063403 0.5300746 3 1.716288 0.2976727 0.1255332 0.05412185 1.3085394 0.6729571 ... 11 1.559582 0.3837259 0.1416958 0.05378046 0.7902441 0.9013706 12 1.556493 0.3857319 0.1433656 0.05361161 0.7782075 0.9062290 13 1.553249 0.3877148 0.1443430 0.05420465 0.7661420 0.9108585 RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the one SE rule. The final value used for the model was mtry = 11. When interpreting/reporting the results of the model would it be best to report RMSE and R squared , or the RMSEApparent and RsquaredApparent ? I understand that the Apparent measures are a combination of the simple bootstrap estimate and the estimate from re-predicting the training set, which is leading me towards using the RMSE and Rsquared measures.
