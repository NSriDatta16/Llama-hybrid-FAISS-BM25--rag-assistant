I would start with simple feature engineering (min, max, avg, std) and simple exploration / embedding techniques. If you want more advanced stuff I would start by embedding with umap, that allows time dependency of the data ( https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aligned_umap_politics_demo.html ) and to use complex model for embedding ( https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parametric_umap.html ).
