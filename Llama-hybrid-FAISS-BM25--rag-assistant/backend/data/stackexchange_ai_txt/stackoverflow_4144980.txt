WPF windows position

I need help on WPF... When user move/drag/change the position of the 1st page window (mainwindow.xaml), then user click on "next" button to proceed to 2nd page(process.xaml), the window (process.xaml) is not at the same position as the (mainwindow.xaml) that the user move to earlier on. How can I make it to remember the position of the window throughout? And when user close the window, and run it again, the window will be default appear in the center unless user move the window. Really need help for this. Thanks.
