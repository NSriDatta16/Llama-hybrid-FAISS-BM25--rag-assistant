Regression with heavy-tailed response variable

I have a response variable that is unbounded and continuous, but has heavier tails and violates some of the assumptions of normality (see plots below). This variable represents selection coefficients for individual animals (estimated in a separate analysis) and I'm hoping to test whether certain aspects of where they live affect how they select habitat (i.e., whether an animal that lives closer to a road selects habitat relative to roads differently than an animal further from a road). So I am hoping to use this variable as the dependent variable in a regression model, with a mixture of continuous and categorical predictor variables. Specifically, I'm hoping to use an information-theoretic approach to choose the best variables that predict selection behavior (the selection coefficients) and then plot predicted coefficients over the range of habitat variables. So I would plot estimated coefficients against distance to road to see if selection changes depending on how close an animal is to a road. However, I am unsure about the best way to formulate that model. If I were to fit a simple linear regression, what sort of bias would I be introducing? Would this approach give reasonable predictions for most of the range of values (excluding the tails)? Or does this suggest that there is some non-linearity in the data that should be dealt with in a different way? Or is it possible and/or better to fit a regression model where the response is defined by a different distribution, such as the logistic distribution? In trying to find an answer to how to do this in R, I have only been able to find information on logistic regression, which, as far as I can tell, does not accommodate a continuous dependent variable (that isn't normally distributed) and so does not address my problem. Any advice is much appreciated!
