Names of all rendered views in ColdBox (coldfusion)

I have a handler with a whole bunch of views. I am seeking a lot for some small changes sometimes. Does there exist a function so I can put a border around each view with a label where it's name stands? I have seen this before on Magento (php). Anyone ideas?
