Here is an answer that helped me solve the issue from the MSDN forums: LinqDataSource requires a default constructor on the DataContext. If you are working in a web application or website project, the Linq to SQL designer should have created a default constructor and connection string for you when you dragged tables from the database onto the design surface. Did you create your DataContext and drag tables onto the design surface from a webapp or website project? Open the Lib.NorthwindDataContext class that was generated and see if it has the default constructor. If you really want, you could also use LinqDataSource without the default constructor by handling the ContextCreating event and providing your own context instance.
