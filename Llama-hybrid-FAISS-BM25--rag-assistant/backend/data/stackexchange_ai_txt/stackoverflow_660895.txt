Knuth rejects the term "heap" used as a synonym for the free memory store. Several authors began about 1975 to call the pool of available memory a "heap." But in the present series of books, we will use that word only in its more traditional sense related to priority queues. ( Fundamental Algorithms, 3rd ed. , p. 435)
