Prior for Bayesian multiple logistic regression

I was wondering how I could incorporate a prior to form a posterior distribution for multiple logistic regression. More specifically, I am working with basketball data, where the response variable is binary (whether a player made the shot or not) and the explanatory variables are the distance from the basket and the defensive ratings of the opposing 5 players. I am able to generate multiple seasons worth of these shot logs for each player from the past, and wanted to know how I could take previous seasons of data into account when I also have a current season's worth of data.
