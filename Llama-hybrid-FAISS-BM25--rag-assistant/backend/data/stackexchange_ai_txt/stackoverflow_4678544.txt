Saving file to phone instead of SD card

In my app I save an XML file to the user's SD card by doing File newxmlfile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/Message.xml"); But not all users have SD-cards in their phone and therefore my app is likely to crash. How must I change my File creating method in order to save the file to the phone's memory instead of the SD-card? Also, how must I change the loading of the file? (currently: new InputSource(new FileInputStream(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/Message.xml")) ) EDIT: I don't think you got the question right. I know the Data-Storage page of the Android Docs and I've read it. I just want to know how I should it adjust it to match my current way of saving and loading a file.
