There are two issues to be addressed in your code. First, you should know that ObservableCollection notify its observers about changes to its own elements, it doesn't know or care about changes to the properties of its elements. In other words, it doesn't watch for property change notification on the items within its collection. So changing the Track object property value in the PlayList collection doesn't watch by any mean. Here is an article about the subject. Second, your MainWindowController doesn't broadcast for NowPlayingTrackIndex property value change at all. You should call NotifyPropertyChanged("NowPlayingTrackIndex") to notify interesting parties about the change of the current playing track. This may solve your problem but more elegant way, and my suggestion, would be implementing a custom ObservableCollection class (something like TrackObservableCollection ) that contains NowPlaying property rather than implementing it in the MainWindowController class which looks like an unnecessary intermediation.
