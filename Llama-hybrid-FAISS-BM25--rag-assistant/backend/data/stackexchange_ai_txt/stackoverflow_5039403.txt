Aero-Style Windows Explorer Bar for .NET

Good morning, I am looking for a free implementation of the Windows Explorer menu bar introduced with the Aero theme back in Vista... I am talking about the bar which is just below the address bar when you open Explorer (and in case you don't have the old menu bar visible by default) that says, for instance, "Organize" or "Open Control Panel"... Is anyone aware of such a control for .NET? Thank you very much.
