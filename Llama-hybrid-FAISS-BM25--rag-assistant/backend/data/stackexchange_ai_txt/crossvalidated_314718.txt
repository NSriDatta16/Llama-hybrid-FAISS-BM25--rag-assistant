@Tim's answer's in the comment is actually very clear, but let me find another reference for it. Correlations Results of the Pearson correlation indicated that there was a significant positive association between transformational leadership and job satisfaction, (r(112) = .60, p = .012). Results of the Spearman correlation indicated that there was a significant positive association between years of experience and job satisfaction (rs(112) = .53, p In both of the above examples, the number following r in parentheses corresponds to the degrees of freedom (df), which is directly tied to the sample size. Then the correlation coefficient is reported, followed by the p-value. Note that when a p-value is less than .001, we do not report p = .000. This is because p-values can never be equal to zero. P-values below .001 are reported as p http://www.statisticssolutions.com/reporting-statistics-in-apa-format/ According to it, your r(134) = .57, p could capture the correlation between Night_before and Average_sleep. However, I guess what you are interested in is probably the correlation between Night_before and Average_memory or the correlation between Average_Sleep and Average_memory.
