Looking to your question I got the feeling that maybe you just over-complicating your requirements? Why can't you just use JSON format to represent your objects data in portable way? Then you will be able just to store it either on file system or in database in simple text field. You can leverage android-active-record library for transparent DB persistence (http://code.google.com/p/android-active-record)
