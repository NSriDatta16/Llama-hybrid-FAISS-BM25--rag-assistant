Do you really need the full power of ORM in the client? If you don't, some kind of Web service would be favorite for my money. REST is the current darling, see e.g. django-rest-interface . Otherwise I don't see an elegant way out. You could maybe escape the need for direct DB connections by pickling Querysets and the results and tossing them around via some API, but it's probably more hassle than it's worth.
