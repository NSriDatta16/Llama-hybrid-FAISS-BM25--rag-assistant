Your approach ,as you suggested, lacks generality. I took your 286 and used a piece of software that I have helped developed which is designed to aid time series analysis. Your statement suggested a periodicity of 16 ( 4 readings per hour ). H ere is the data. AUTOBOX identified two counter-acting level shifts (visually obvious at periods 84 and 199) while forming a useful equation. incorporating memory , seasonal pulses and one possibly unusual data point at period 262. The Actual/Fit/Forecast is shown here with a 25 hour prediction period . The residuals from the model (possibly what you mean by values between the "peaks" ) are shown here . The ACF of the residuals suggest randomness reflecting a sufficient model as contrasted to the ACF of the original 286 values . If you have any detailed questions you can either respond here (preferably) or you can set up a chat room. Detecting when a new value is exceptional is straight forward and would be reported as a possible pulse/exceptional value since the equation can't discern based upon 1 reading whether or not it is a one-time event OR the start of a level shift OR a start of a time trend OR a start of a new seasonal pulse OR a start of a error variance change OR simply an error of measurement. The algorithm is based upon the concept of ARIMA modelling and incorporates procedures to include deterministic effects like Pulses/Level Shifts/SEasonal Pulses and Local time Trends as espoused by Tsay and nearly everone else http://ri.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LEVryKtXFVC9YAjcwPxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTEzNDgyZmhhBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDRkZHRUMwXzEEc2VjA3Ny/RV=2/RE=1433544203/RO=10/RU=http%3a%2f%2fwww.unc.edu%2f~jbhill%2ftsay.pdf/RK=0/RS=H7RmXr_T9hC0Ma2RAZppd5R6TWE- See http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/blog/entry/build-or-make-your-own-arima-forecasting-model for more on the suggested actual steps in model identification.
