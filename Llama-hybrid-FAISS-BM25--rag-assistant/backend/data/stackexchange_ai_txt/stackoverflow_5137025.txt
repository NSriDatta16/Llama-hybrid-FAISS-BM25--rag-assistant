Some fine gentleman on the gcc-help mailing list figured this one out: Instead of #pragma GCC java_exceptions to deal with __gxx_personality_v0, make ld link in -l gcc_s If __gcj_personality_v0 is undefined, make ld link in -l gcj Have ld link -l stdc++ Ensure that you have libstdc++, libgcjX-dev (X is a version) and libgcc on your machine If you're linking with g++ (I'm not), some of these may happen automatically (stdc++?) Also, make sure you didn't forget (or lose) the #import line for the JNI header -- you'll need the extern C {} bits, or you'll get an UnsatisfiedLinkError
