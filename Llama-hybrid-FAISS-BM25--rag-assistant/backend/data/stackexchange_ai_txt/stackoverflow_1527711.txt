You can get to this also by performing a WMI query: SELECT * FROM MSNdis_80211_ServiceSetIdentifier If you are specifically looking for a delphi implementation, there is a WMI library available from Magenta Systems which includes complete source and may be freely used. The available download includes a compiled executable where you can try this query to see if it contains all of the data that you are looking for. The only disadvantage of this approach is that the WMI service must be running (it normally is so this is not that big of a problem).
