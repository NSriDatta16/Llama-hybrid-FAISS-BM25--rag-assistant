I think you are going about this the wrong way. What you want to do is change the action when the drag is initiated, not when it is dropped. There are ways to change what the action is on initiation, including interrogating the user preferences in the "no modifiers" case. It's possible that changing the way the DropTargetDragEvent is called.
