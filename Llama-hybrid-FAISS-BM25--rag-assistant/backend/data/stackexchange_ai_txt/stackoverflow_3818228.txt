http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue?issue=6020 known bug with your version - if you paste the 1.3.2.1 version of lib/varien/image/adapter/Gd2.php into your 1.3.1 version of Magento may be a quick fix. Be sure and make a backup before overwriting the file, and I would suggest keeping a copy to rename upon performing a full upgrade.
