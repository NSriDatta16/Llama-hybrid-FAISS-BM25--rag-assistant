Is it Ok to use 2 Javascript Libraries on One HTML Page?

I know PHP and MVC but when I work on Joomla I dont want to learn Mootools for AJAX , I rather include jQuery which I know thoroughly. I think IMHO jQuery has the largest mindshare in AJAX Libraries. When I work on Magento , instead of using bundled prototpye , I use jQuery . Same is the case with SocialEngine where I dont use the bundled mootools , but jQuery what I know better. Personally I think it is ok to include 2 Javascript Libraries on one HTML Page because it doesnt puts any Extra Procesing load on the Server . Even in the Client Browser I dont find any performance Issues . Moreover , since jQuery is loaded from Google CDN so there is every chance that Browser Cache already has it . What do you think , Is it ok to include 2 Javascript Libraries on 1 HTML Page ?
