Session_End isn't run in the context of a user request, so there's no access to cookies (or any other request variables). If you put the value into Session, I think you can access that: string cookyval = ""; try { cookyval = (string)Session["parentPageName"]; } catch (Exception ex) { cookyval = ""; } Otherwise, you'd need to write it to some other server side storage (like a database).
