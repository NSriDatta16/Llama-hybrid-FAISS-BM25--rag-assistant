Using 'this' as a parameter to a method call in a constructor

I have a constructor like as follows: public Agent(){ this.name = "John"; this.id = 9; this.setTopWorldAgent(this, "Top_World_Agent", true); } I'm getting a null pointer exception here in the method call. It appears to be because I'm using 'this' as an argument in the setTopWorldAgent method. By removing this method call everything appears fine. Why does this happen? Has anyone else experienced this?
