There are many tools that no web developer should be without. One of those tools is a good HTML Validator add-on for your browser. Firefox HTML Validator Add-on: http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/ Chrome HTML Validator add-on: http://robertnyman.com/2010/04/07/html-validator-extension-for-google-chrome/ I especially like the one for Firefox. If there is a validation error in your HTML, not only will it tell you, but it also tells you why it's bad and how to fix it. To answer your question, I do believe h# are considered valid inside an element. But it may also depend on DOCTYPE as there are different rules for different HTML DOCTYPES. However, with the validator you'll never need to ask a question like this again :)
