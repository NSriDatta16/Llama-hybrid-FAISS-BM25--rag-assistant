The names are applied largely based on the structural characteristics of the dataset. To quote from @JeromyAnglim's answer there: If we think of designs made up of $n$ cases measured on $k$ occasions, then the following loose definition seems to me to be descriptive of the distinction: longitudinal designs: high $n$ , low $k$ time series: low $n$ , high $k$ To those two possibilities, we can add cross-sectional datasets. They have only one measurement occasion per case (i.e., $k=1$ , but $N>1$ and hopefully reasonably large). However, we certainly need to take those features into account when analyzing the data, no matter what we call it. The key aspect from a statistical perspective is that longitudinal / time-series data are not independent, whereas cross-sectional data may be. If existing non-independence isn't taken into account, any inferences will be invalid (e.g., confidence intervals may be too narrow). If you have cross-sectional data, standard, statistics-101-level analyses (e.g., a $t$ -test), can be applied. If you have time-series data ( $n=1$ , large $k$ ), analysts will often use ARIMA methods to identify auto-regressive, integrative, and moving average terms. With longitudinal data ( $k>1$ , but small), there usually isn't enough information to estimate ARIMA terms. Instead, people will typically use mixed effects models .
