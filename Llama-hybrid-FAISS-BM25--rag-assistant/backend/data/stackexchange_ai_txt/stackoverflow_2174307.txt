There is nothing free in project management, and managing a complex project with software is inevitably complex. The real question is, does the chosen tool help with this? Task Juggler has a learning curve, and in the end is suitable for someone who doesn't mind reading the manual (an absolute necessity for this tool) and isn't tied to graphical input. Task Juggler requires that you think about your project and structure it in a meaningful way. It is helpful if you do a diagram in advance (many TJ users make mind maps and there is a tool out there somewhere to generate TJ input statements from a FreeMind mind map). It is also very helpful if you organize your input file in some meaningful way, making things easy to find. That said, once you get going, creating a project with TJ is super fast. You don't need to bother with a million dialog boxes, you just tell TJ what you want in TJ's text language. But all of that aside, what I like about TJ (and hated at first, coming from a legacy of other more traditional tools) is that it ensures that your schedule makes sense. OpenProj happily schedules resources at 300% and more. TJ will give you an error and make you fix it. Yes, it's annoying. But the end result is that you have a project schedule that makes sense and can actually be executed. Imagine that! As I started out by saying, nothing's free. TJ requires study and some effort. The reward is rich and copious reporting, all the information you need to manage your project to cost and schedule, and the enforcement of a logical, reliable approach to scheduling and resource allocation. And it doesn't cost $499 or whatever MSP goes for --- it's free.
