Regarding "draft specifications": From time to time the expert groups of the OSGi Alliance publish some draft RFCs under a special license (the Distribution and Feedback License) for a public review in order to receive comments from non-OSGi members and other organisations. The download page to access these draft specs is http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/Drafts . To keep the RFCs non-public was a decision to protect the IPR as well as to keep the resulting specifications as unconfusing as possible. Sometimes one or more RFCs are combined into one specification, sometimes an RFC amends an existing spec. The RFCs are basically work-in-progress. There are some RFCs the OSGi Alliance decided to publish. Those are the ones you can access. One example is RFC 112 Bundle Repository . This is a stand-alone spec, which is complete in itself.
