There is one good website by the Technical editor of Book Linux Kernel Development, Robert P J Day (he is different from Robert Love) and the website is http://crashcourse.ca/introduction-linux-kernel-programming/introduction-linux-kernel-programming Once you are done with above link I would suggest to go through http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/drivers_linux and then there is a Kernel Newbies mailing list.You should subscribe to it.
