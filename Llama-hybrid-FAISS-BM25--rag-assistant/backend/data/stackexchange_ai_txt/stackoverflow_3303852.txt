I think moving the files above the web root is more elegant than hacking around with around mod_rewrite. Just saying. They're either directly served and belong in the web root, or they're aren't and therefore don't. Regardless, it's doable fairly easily, in files/.htaccess RewriteEngine On RewriteRule . validate.php?file=$0 validate.php should now have access to the request file name in $_GET['file'] . (Code untested; let me know if you get errors. mod_rewrite never really liked me all that much.)
