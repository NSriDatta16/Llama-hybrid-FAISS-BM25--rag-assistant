the combination of two independent continuous time Markov chains

Assume one variable $x$ has two states 0 and 1, $x$ changes between 0 and 1 following a continuous time Markov chain. The transition probability is represented as matrix $P$ and the time sojourning on a state follows exponential distribution with arrival ratio $\lambda$. There is the other variable y which is independent with $x$. $y$ also changes between 0 and 1, and have the same $P$ and $\lambda$ with $x$. Now the question is: will the new variable $z=x*y$ follow continuous time Markov chain? if yes, what will be the transition probability and $\lambda$. ($z$ only has two states: 0 and 1.) I guess $z$ still follows continuous time Markov chain, but I have no idea how to prove? (maybe there has been a property stating this, which I don't know?) Could anyone give some ideas? Many thanks!
