How to restrict country names in the `country_select` plugin?

I'm using simple_form , which automatically uses country_select plugin when using a field named country, like this: But I want to be able to restrict the countries displayed. I saw country_select code defines this : COUNTRIES = ["Afghanistan" ... "Yemen", "Zambia", "Zimbabwe"] unless const_defined?("COUNTRIES") So, I though I could override COUNTRIES like below: But I get an error: compile error /home/jack/src/beta/app/views/contacts/_address_fields.html.erb:6: dynamic constant assignment '); COUNTRIES = ["Canada","USA"] ^ How to overwrite the COUNTRIES constant? Or is there a more elegant way of doing this? Ps. I am using Ruby 1.8.7p330 with Rails 3.0.3
