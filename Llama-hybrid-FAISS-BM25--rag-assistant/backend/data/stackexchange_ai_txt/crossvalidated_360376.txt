How does pooling work with crossed effects in multilevel models?

In Section 12.2 of Gelman and Hill , The authors mention that one of the main benefits of creating a multi-level model is that you can take advantage of "partial pooling". As an example, if you were creating a two-level hierarchical model of test scores by state and county, then each county's predicted estimate would be a weighted average of that county's average test score and the overall state's score. In more complex models, I've seen additional random effects added. For example, a model might contain state, county, gender, and race. In this case, the model is no longer strictly hierarchical, and we now have crossed effects. In this case, 1) I assume the effect of county is still based on a pooled estimate. Are the effects of gender and race still being pooled in some way? If so, how? 2) Would this model be considered a two-level model or a four-level model? edit: For clarification, the data for race and gender in this example would be at the individual level (they are not county or state-level characteristics).
