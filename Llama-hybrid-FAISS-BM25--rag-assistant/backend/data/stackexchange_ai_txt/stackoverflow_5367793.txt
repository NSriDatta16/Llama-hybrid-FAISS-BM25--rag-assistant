another javascript function object question - more elegant way then using toString()

I turn to you with another Javascript object related question I was not able to find an answer so far. I understand that functions are objects and that they do not have names. Instead variables are references to those objects. > var a = function() { ... console.log('a'); ... }; > a [Function] > typeof(a) 'function' All this means that I can not ask a function for its name. I totally agree with that. But there is another case (putting the named function into an array) where I would be interested in the name and it is obviously there. > var b = [function myname(){console.log('hi');},]; > b[0] [Function: myname] > b[0](); hi > typeof(b); 'object' > typeof(b[0]); 'function' In the later case I am wondering if there is a more elegant way of asking for the name ("myname" in this case) then using toString()? Cheers, Mark
