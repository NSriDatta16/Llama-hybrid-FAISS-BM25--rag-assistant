I teach Java Programming at a high school, and our course runs 14 weeks. This is enough time to give students a solid foundation in object oriented programming, but students are not experienced enough to develop and large projects or anything too complicated. Many schools use the textbook by Lambert & Osbborne: Lambert, K. & Osborne, M. Fundamentals of Java: AP Computer Science Essentials for the AP Exam. 3rd ed. 2006. Thomson Course Technology.
