I would suggest you use a simpler method first, just to have a baseline to compare from. In your case you can adapt this jupyter notebook to fit your purpose. They train a k-NN model to compare time-series using similarity measures. After you're comfortable with that, you can move on to using LSTMs for classification LSTMs for Human Activity Recognition Multilabel time series classification with LSTM The last one also works if you are trying to predict multiple labels per sample.
