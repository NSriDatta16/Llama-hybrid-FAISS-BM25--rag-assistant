What is the Frequentist definition of fixed effects?

Bolker (2015) writes on p. 313 that Frequentists and Bayesians define random effects somewhat differently, which affects the way they use them. Frequentists define random effects as categorical variables whose levels are chosen at random from a larger population , e.g., species chosen at random from a list of endemic species. Bayesians define random effects as sets of variables whose parameters are [all] drawn from [the same] distribution. The frequentist definition is philosophically coherent, and you will encounter researchers (including reviewers and supervisors) who insist on it, but it can be practically problematic. For example, it implies that you can’t use species as random effect when you have observed all of the species at your field site—since the list of species is not a sample from a larger population—or use year as a random effect, since researchers rarely run an experiment in randomly sampled years—they usually use either a series of consecutive years, or the haphazard set of years when they could get into the field. Bolker continues on p 315 to state that The Bayesian framework has a simpler definition of random effects. Under a Bayesian approach, a fixed effect is one where we estimate each parameter (e.g., the mean for each species within a genus) independently (with independently specified priors), while for a random effect the parameters for each level are modeled as being drawn from a distribution (usually Normal); in standard statistical notation, $\textrm{species_mean} \sim {\cal N}(\textrm{genus_mean}, \sigma^2_{\textrm{species}})$ . Bolker's chapter thus provides clear Bayesian and Frequentist definitions of random effects, and a clear Bayesian definition of fixed effects. However, I don't see that it provides any Frequentist definition of fixed effects. I am aware from this answer that a wide variety of inconsistent definitions of fixed effects exist in the literature. To clarify, I'm looking for a definition that would "complete the set" of Bolker's existing ones, and be demonstrably consistent with the approach that he is taking. Although related topics are considered at length in this question , I see this question as different and much more specific. I also don't think the answer is present in any of the responses to the other question. Bolker, B. M., 2015. Linear and generalized linear mixed models. In G. A. Fox, S. Negrete-Yankelevich, and V.
