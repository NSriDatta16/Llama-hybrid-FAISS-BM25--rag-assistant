OCR for Devanagari (Hindi / Marathi / Sanskrit)

Does anybody have any idea about any recent work being done on optical character recognition for Indian scripts using modern Machine Learning techniques ? I know of some research being done at ISI, calcutta, but nothing new has come up in the last 3-4 years to the best of my knowledge, and OCR for Devanagari is sadly lacking!
