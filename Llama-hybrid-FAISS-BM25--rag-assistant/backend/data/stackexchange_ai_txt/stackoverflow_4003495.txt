The question itself is sure very interesting and challenging, however there are many practical issues as stated by @monksy. The opportunist pragmatic in me would take a step back, look at the big picture and see if there is another way to solve the problem. For example, if you are building some kind of "image sharing community" and want to avoid duplicates in the database, you could do a simple md5 on the file (animated gifs on the web are usually always the same, it's rare that people modify them). Another example: if you are analyzing scientific samples (like meteo sequences) it may be easier to directly embed some kind of hash in every file when generating them.
