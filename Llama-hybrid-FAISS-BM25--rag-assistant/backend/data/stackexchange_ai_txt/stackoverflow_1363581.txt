ASP.NET will only be able to work with form elements. So if these rows are for example (input[type=text]) you can do this: Request.Form["rows"] EDIT When the user drags over the element why don't you create a new hidden input and put the relevant value inside of it. This will make it easy to grab the value from the server with the example I used above.
