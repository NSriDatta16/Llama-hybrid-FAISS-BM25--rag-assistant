My Opinion: Xinc is to old und not supported are activly developed any more. Hudson: Has everything you need for integrating symfony projects. I have a Hudson-Server that integrates several Symfony projects. There is everything available as plugins. Unit-Testing, Code-Coverage, Statical code analyses and other things. Hudson has a nice and easy to use webbased Administration console. phpUnderControl: Nice for PHP Projects. But I don't like the administration and found i trickier to get some projects integrated with it Arbit: A nice new choice. I have not tested it for Symfony-Projects so far. Because it is new it doesn't have the amount of configuration features or plugins as Hudson has. I like Hudson the most.
