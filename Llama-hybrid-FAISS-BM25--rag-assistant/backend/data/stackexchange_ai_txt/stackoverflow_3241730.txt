From a windows installer perspective, InstallUtil is an evil antipattern because it injects fragile out of process code into a declarative programming model. The Windows Installer has long had the ServiceInstall and ServiceControl tables and this works really well. The same applies to Regasm and Regserver. We prefer to extract the COM data and author it into the installer and have MSI take care of applying the registry value rather then loading assemblies and calling entry points in the hope that it works. When it fails, you have no idea why and you can't roll the state of the machine back. What kind of stuff are you doing in your events? I would either eliminate and/or refactor each of them into something MSI can do for you. If it's still not enough, write a DTF custom action and schedule it between InstallServices and StartServices.
