I find that managed mode (C++/CLI) is primarily useful as a gateway facility that allows you to leverage legacy libraries. In short, I used it when I have to program in .Net, but need access to a C++ code base. On its own, there's very little reason to choose C++/CLI over C#, which is cleaner, more modern, better-supported by the IDE and a gazillion tools (ReSharper, for instance), and can even do occasional low-level stuff via the unsafe keyword. C++/CLI has been touted by its designers as the most powerful .Net language (largely because of the seamless legacy bridge and true RAII semantics for .Net objects), but it hasn't gotten much traction in the .Net community.
