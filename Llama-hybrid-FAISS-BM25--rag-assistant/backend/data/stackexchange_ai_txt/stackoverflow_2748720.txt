@Tom has answered your direct question. Basically, you cannot declare instance-level attributes (or class-level variables) in an interface. Instance level attributes must be declared in a class. If you want multiple classes to share the same attribute declarations, you could put them into an abstract superclass. But best practice is to declare the attributes as private and access them via getters and setters. There are a couple of other problems with your code: You cannot declare a class and an interface with the same name in the same namespace. You have a class called Format that implements an interface called Format , both declared in the namespace of the FormatBig . And even if you could (e.g. because they were declared in different namespaces), this is bad practice. Give the class and interface distinct names. You should use nested classes sparingly. It looks to me like you might have nested the Format class and interface inside FormatBig as a convenience so that you only have to edit and compile one file. That is lazy. Alternatively, if you are doing it to organize your code, learn how to use Java packages.
