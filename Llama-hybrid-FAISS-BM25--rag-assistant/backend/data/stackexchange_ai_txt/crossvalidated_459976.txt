Is logistic regression the way to go?

My data has two dichotomous variables: culture (A and B), emotion (X, Y). Participants in two countries (A and B) rated 16 sound-clips on these two variables. RQ1: Are people able to distinguish the emotion clips across culture? RQ2: Are people able to distinguish the cultural background of the speaker in the clip? Is a logistic regression the appropriate way to tackle this? Are there any smarter options?
