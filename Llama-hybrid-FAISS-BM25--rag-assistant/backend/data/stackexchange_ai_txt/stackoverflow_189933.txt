I think the problem is that absolute positioning is easy to abuse. A coordinate system is much easier for lay people to understand than the box model. Also, programs like Dreamweaver make it trivially simple to layout a page using absolute positioning (and people don't realize what they're doing). However, for typical page layout, the default static positioning should be adequate and get the job done 90% of the time. It's very flexible, and by keeping everything in normal flow, elements are aware of the other elements around them, and will act according when things change. This is really good when dealing with dynamic content (which most pages are these days). Using absolute positioning is far more rigid and makes it difficult to write layouts that respond well to changing content. They're simply too explicit. However, it is perfect if you're in need of freely moving elements around a page (drag/drop), need to overlay elements on top of each other, or other layout techniques that would benefit from working on a coordinate system. Frankly, a chessboard sounds like a fine reason to use it.
