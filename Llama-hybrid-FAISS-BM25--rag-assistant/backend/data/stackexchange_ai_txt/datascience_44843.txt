CV (Curriculum Vitae) Recommender System using Machine Learning, Python, Apache Solr(Back-end), AngularJS (Front-end)

I am very new to Machine Learning. This is my college project. I want to develop web application of CV RECOMMENDER SYSTEM in Python. I have lots of CVs in the format of .txt . My questions are following: What type of learning I can apply? (Supervised/Unsupervised) I have different file in one folder. So Is there need to make a corpus? If there is a need to make a corpus then can I create a corpus? I am very confused with the flow of the application. Can please anyone suggest me the steps how can I start to develop web application? Your help will be appreciated.
