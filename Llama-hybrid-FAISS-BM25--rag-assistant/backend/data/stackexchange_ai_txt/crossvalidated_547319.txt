The weighted average is indeed a potential solution. But as you say, it's an arbitrary way of doing it (because you're arbitrarily setting the audience weight to 90%). A possible improvement would be to try to define how the weights are set in a more data-driven way. For example, if there are $N_{u,m}$ user reviews for movie $m$ and $N_{c,m}$ critic reviews for movie $m$ , you could create the user-score weight for that movie in the following way: $$ w_{u,m}=\frac{N_{u,m}}{N_{u,m}+N_{c,m}} $$ and the critic-score weight as: $$ w_{c,m}=1-w_{u,m} $$ However, I imagine there might be lots more user reviews than critic reviews. If this is the case, you could start with a sensible assumption such as "every critic review is worth 10 user reviews" or something like that. It will depend on the number of user reviews relative to the number of critic reviews - you can find a multiplier (like e.g. 10) that is sensible for your data. Another completely different approach would be to do PCA on the two variables and see if you can use the first principal component as your final score. This might make sense since I imagine that the user scores and the critic scores are somewhat positively correlated. This also has the advantage of removing the subjectivity / arbitrariness component.
