Why 1 out of 5 AUC cross validation score is very low?

I am using xgboost model for binary classification problem. I am using 5 fold cross-validation (stratified as class imbalance) which results into the following. xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective="binary:logistic", random_state=42) scores = cross_val_score(xgb_model, X, y, scoring="roc_auc", cv=5) >> [0.97167546 0.96833211 0.58207582 0.90730687 0.93105652] Why is one out of the above five AUC scores very low(~0.58207582)?
