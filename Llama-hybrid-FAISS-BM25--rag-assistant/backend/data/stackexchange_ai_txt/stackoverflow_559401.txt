Create Black and White PDF from Oracle Reports

I have an Oracle Report that must be in pure Black and White. It contains two images which have been converted into Monochrome bitmaps before being inserted onto the report. When the report is executed, the resulting PDF appears to be in black and white. When I view the colour separations in Adobe Acrobat Professional, the image has Cyan, Magenta and Yellow separations. I have tried converting the image to a number of formats supported by Oracle including JPG, TIF & GIF but it makes no difference. The application we use to run the report is an ASP.NET web application in C#. We have the iTextSharp library for PDF manipulation. Is there any Oracle Report setting or C# code that can ensure the PDF created by Oracle Reports is pure Black and White?
