Even the most simple query takes half a second on to any table

I created an Innodb table with a id and name column and running this query insert into test (name) VALUES('test'); takes .5 seconds even SELECT id FROM test LIMIT 1 or select 1 takes .5 seconds or so Any suggestions on where I can read more about how to improve the speed would be helpful. I would imagine these queries shouldn't take more than .05 seconds or so. Restarting the server and check/repair/analyze didn't help. Is there such a thing as checking the base query time? i.e. the fastest a query can run? I wonder if it's the server being slow, the load averages doesn't say that it's being over utilized. I am using mysql query browser to test these statements.
