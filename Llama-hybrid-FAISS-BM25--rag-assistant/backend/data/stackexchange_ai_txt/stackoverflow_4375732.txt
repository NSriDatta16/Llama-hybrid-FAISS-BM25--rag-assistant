There are several known algorithms for merging in-place, though some of them are fairly complex. The general way in which they work is doing an out-of-place merge, using some of the array elements themselves as the external storage space. I know that Alex Stepanov and Paul McJones' "Elements of Programming" details one algorithm. I recently read a paper on in-place merging called "Practical In-Place Merging" that details a fairly simple algorithm for doing this sort of merge. I coded up an implementation of this algorithm in a way that is close to the interface of std::inplace_merge , though there are a few differences. Perhaps there's something in there that you might find useful?
