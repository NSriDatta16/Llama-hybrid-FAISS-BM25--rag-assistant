Incorrect item gets selected when starting a drag on an item in an ItemsControl

I am implementing a DragDrop framework for WPF (which incidentally you can find here ). I have a problem in that when the user MouseDown s on an ItemsControl we don't know immediately if they intended to click the item to select it, or to begin a drag. If the user clicks an item and then quickly moves the cursor, another item other than the clicked item can become selected before we determine that a drag has started (especially if clicking on the item freezes the UI for a short time to load data etc). I think this problem didn't exist in WinForms as dragging the mouse with the button held down didn't cause another item to become selected - the selection was made only on the item on which the click occurred. In the PreviewMouseDown event I can set the e.Handled property to prevent another item becoming selected, which works fine if the user actually did intend to start a drag, but then they can't actually select the item. Anyone know how to handle this?
