Something like this should do the job: $(function() { $("a:has(img.latest_img)").click(function() { $("div.info p").text($(this).next().text()); return false; }); }); Let me explain how it works. The anchor has no class or ID unfortunately but you can still find it with a:has(img.latest_img) , meaning all anchors that have a descendant image wit a class of "latest_img". The relevant paragraph can be found and its text replaced with $("div.info p").text() . The text to replace it with can be found in any number of ways. I've simplest chosen $(this).next() to get a reference to it. You could just as easily do $(this).closest("li").children("p") or any number of other selectors. Note: this in an event handler refers to the source of the event. Lastly, the click handler returns false to stop event propagation. Otherwise the anchor will navigate the browser to 1.jpg (it's href attribute).
