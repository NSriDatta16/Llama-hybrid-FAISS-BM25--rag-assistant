In general you should use the anchor tag. Nesting an inside a is perfectly valid, but in general the should be reserved for paragraphs of text. Since yours is just a link, the tag alone will probably be the most recommended. If you want your link to appear as a block element, simply style it with display: block; . The fact that the tag is normally displayed inline is only because it is its default style.
