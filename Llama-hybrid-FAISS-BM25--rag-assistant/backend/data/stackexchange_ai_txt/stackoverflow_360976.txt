You can do it with TOP or LIMIT : SELECT TOP 1 * FROM faq_questions WHERE sort_order > 5 ORDER BY sort_order ASC but that's not as elegant or portable as SELECT * FROM faq_questions AS f1 LEFT JOIN faq_questions AS f2 ON f1.sort_order > f2.sort_order AND f2.sort_order = 5 LEFT JOIN faq_questions AS f3 ON f3.sort_order BETWEEN f1.sort_order AND f2.sort_order WHERE f3.id IS NULL
