Forecasting price based on historic time series

I work for a material stock holder. I am trying to quantify how the probability of not getting a specified minimum of gross profit, changes over time. This problem basically boils down to assigning probabilities to the set of future market prices. I was hoping that I could use time series analysis on the company's purchase and sales records (they span the last ten years, so I should hopefully have a decent dataset), but I am unsure about of how to go solve this. I have done some googling and from what I can see the an ARIMA modeling is what I should be looking into, but again I am unsure. If anyone could give me some pointers that would be great. The price of the material we stock fluctuate over time, (of course, as a result of the changes in the factors that influence the market price.) Plotting the prices into a histogram, it is clear that it is not a normal distribution. (this is the case for both deflated and nominal prices) Which, from my standpoint is expected, prices are influenced by business cycles and the evolution of the production costs. If anyone could give me a pointer in the right direction of where to start looking / reading, I would be very grateful.
