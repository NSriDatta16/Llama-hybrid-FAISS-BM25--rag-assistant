ARDL non-stationary

I have multiple explanatory variables and one dependent variable. Data for all are collected at an annual basis, time series, dependent on their t-1 value. Â¨ Will use of ARDL Autoregressive distributed lag be appropritate to apply? If so, some other questions regarding ARDL: Do all, both Xs and Y, need to be I(1)? or is it ok if some Xs are I(0)? I also did read somewhere that for ARDL non-stationary data can be used? If have non-stationary data and have to turn it stationary, is it right that I can use either 1 differencing OR just include time as an independent variable? Thank you so much in advance!
