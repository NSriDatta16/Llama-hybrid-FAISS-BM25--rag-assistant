I think Matthew Gunn's answer is correct, but it seems to me that "record-wise" CV can cover two different concepts: Records are randomly partitioned into folds, regardless of subject or time. Records are partitioned into time-based folds, with no fold used for training that contains data from after the beginning of the test fold. In the first case, any time-series nature of your data is being compromised, since your training set can include data from both before and after your test set. The principle of Train/Test is that Training data represents data known to the present, and Test data represents as-yet-unseen data (perhaps literally from the future). Perhaps time series autocorrelation compromises option #2. Perhaps the time element of the model is not really important and so "past" and "future" observations are likely to be the same. In these cases, neither #1 or #2 is the way to go. If there is only seasonality and not trends, it seems like it's okay to include "the future" in training for some subjects in order to predict new subjects (who will be affected by the same seasonality). If there are trends, training on the future should learn something about the future that you really would not know when using the model in production. In the OP's example, it sounds like subject-wise is good. But if trends and time-series concerns were part of the model, I'd try to use subject- and time-based partitioning so you trained on one set of subjects prior to a specific point in time, then test on the other subjects after that specific point in time.
