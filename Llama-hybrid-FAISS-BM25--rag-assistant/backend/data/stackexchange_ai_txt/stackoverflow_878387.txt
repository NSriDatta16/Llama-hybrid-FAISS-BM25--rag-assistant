switch structures with structs and arrays?

I had an earlier question about organizing some inputs by name, ID, and then Amount. Now that I have figured out how to get them organized, I need to have 3 outputs; the first by name, the second by ID, and the last by amount. can i use case and switch statements? Every time i tried to, all three outputs were by name. this is what i have so far: void GeneralSort(const int SortItem, const int count, CustomerProfile c[]) { string tempname; string tempid; float tempamount; for(int iteration = 1; iteration c[n+1].CustomerName) { tempname = c[n].CustomerName; c[n].CustomerName = c[n+1].CustomerName; c[n+1].CustomerName = tempname; } if(c[n].CustomerId > c[n+1].CustomerId) { tempid = c[n].CustomerId; c[n].CustomerId = c[n+1].CustomerId; c[n+1].CustomerId = tempid; } if(c[n].AmountDue > c[n+1].AmountDue) { tempamount = c[n].AmountDue; c[n].AmountDue = c[n+1].AmountDue; c[n+1].AmountDue = tempamount } how do i get the rest of the data in, so it will have the 2nd output by ID, and the 3rd output by Amount. I think you can add switch statements but when I tired, all three outputs were by the first set, which is by name. any help is appreciated. im not expecting anyone to solve it all for me, just a tip to point me to the right direction. output example: //by name name id amount able b2 24 bob g3 68 carry a4 12 //by id name id amount carry a4 12 able b2 24 bob g3 68 //by amount name id amount carry a4 12 able b2 24 bob g3 68
