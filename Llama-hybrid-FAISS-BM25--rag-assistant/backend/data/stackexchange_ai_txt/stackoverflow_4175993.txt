How to select the nth jQuery object in a jQuery collection?

When I execute var rootElement = $('.grid').find('.box'); rootElement contains a collection of jQuery objects. How do I access a specific jQuery object in this collection? I don't want to use .each() since I'm not necessarily going to iterate through the entire collection. I know this works, but this seems awkward. var index = 1; $(rootElement.get(index)).find('.a'); /* Use chaining to do more work */ Is there a more elegant way of doing this? Thanks.
