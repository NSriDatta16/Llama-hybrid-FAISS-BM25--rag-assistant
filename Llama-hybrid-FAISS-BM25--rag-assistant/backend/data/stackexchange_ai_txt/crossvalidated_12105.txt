Best analysis method for three interrelated longitudinal series

I have data which consist of three longitudinal series of financial data. The hypothesis is that two of the series are "caused" (in a loose sense) by the third. It is fine to investigate this as two separate hypotheses. All the series are about the relationship between two specific countries. There are data for about 20 quarters on one of the series, and about 80 months on the other two series. A little exploratory work reveals that none of the series are stationary, and that there is no apparent seasonality. So, how best to analysis these hypotheses? Can I simply try regressions with different lags, or should I do a more formal time series analysis, or should I do something else? Peter
