How do I analyse a two-alternative forced choice test?

I have recently as part of my bachelor project at my university conducted a two-alternative forced choice test. I have looked at ways to say something with significance about which images (the test participants were given a set of 4 pairs of images, for each pair they had to choose one). While testing is emphasized in my education, I do not have enough knowledge about analysis of the results I have now. How do I go about figuring something significant out about the independent variables that I am manipulating (in separate scenarios)? Is logistic regression something I could use or are there methods that are easier to understand for someone who has only had one course of statistics? The data (and edits about the data) : The data consists of rows of test participants and four columns named as image pairs that the participants were choosing between. The values are the test participants' choice (between the two images in the pair) I have four independent variables, three of them scales and one nominal that I am changing in four scenarios respectively. Each scenario has paths that are chosen "at random" (depending on the last number on the test participant's digital watch e.g. if the time is 13:37, the test participant takes path 7). The reason for the paths is a detail of the implementation in Google Forms to allow all image pair combinations to be presented but not all to every test participant. I would like to find a model for achieving either high probability of one outcome of the dependent binary variable. IV: Amount, Spread, Diff objects, Placement model (nominal) DV: Image chosen or not. e.i. if I want a high probability of YES/1/ACCEPT/etc answers (to the binary question: "Does the virtual environment seem inhabited to a greater extend than the other image in this pair of images?"). to an image, what need the ratios between the independent variables be? Here is a link a copy of the spreadsheet containing the data. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am7BMwlOEiUNdGJhNU1uQlg5QUtxYW1ZNHhfUHlqS1E&usp=sharing
