What's the fastest way to get an ObjectContext reference from an entity object?

I'm creating extensions for my EntityFramework objects as described in How to: Customize Generated Data Objects but in some of those extensions I need to get the instance's ObjectContext to look up some other values in the model. I've found Tip 24 â€“ How to get the ObjectContext from an Entity but that was written a couple years ago, which is referenced in this similar SO question but I'm really hoping there's a better answer now. Surely this must be something that's needed frequently enough that retrieval of an Entity's object context from the entity itself should be supported with an official method. Thanks in advance for any more recent information on this implementation.
