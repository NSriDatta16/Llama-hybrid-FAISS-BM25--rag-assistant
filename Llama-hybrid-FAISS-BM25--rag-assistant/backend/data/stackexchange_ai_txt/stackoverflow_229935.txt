.NET: is there a Click-and-drag "Desktop-Like" control?

OK, first for context look at the Windows desktop; You can take items (folders, files) on the desktop and drag them around to different places and they "stay" where you dragged them. This seems to be a pretty useful feature to offer users so as to allow them to create their own "groupings" of items. My question is thus: Is there a control in .NET that approximates this behavior with a collection of items? I'm thinking something like a listview in "LargeIcon" mode, but it allows you to drag the icons around to different places inside the control.
