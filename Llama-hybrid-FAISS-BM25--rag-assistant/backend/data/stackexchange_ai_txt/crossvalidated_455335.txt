Cointegration test, three I(1) variables, and one I(0) variable

I have four time series, three of which are I(1), and one is I(0). I know an I(0) and an I(1) timeseries can not be cointegrated, but if I run a Johansen test could the other I(1) variables be cointegrated with eachother? Or, does it consider all four variables, and as one is I(0), then there is no linear combination that would be stationary, and therefore, there would be no cointegrating relationships present.
