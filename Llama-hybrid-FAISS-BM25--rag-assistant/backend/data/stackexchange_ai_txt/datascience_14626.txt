Every regression analysis should include a residual analysis as a further check on the adequacy of the chosen regression model. A plot of all residuals on the y-axis vs. the predicted values on the x-axis, called a residual vs. Ô¨Åt plot , is a good way to check the linearity and equal variance assumptions. To answer your question, I believe if you did this EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) you would find that including your single floor data does indeed violate the linearity that you have to assume if you are making a linear regression model. To get around your intercept at $0 dollars issue, try subtracting the mean of your two story houses from each data point (centering the data ). This should give you meaningful results at the intercept. Your new intercept should be the mean of your two story houses. After you do your EDA with the residuals, if you find your data is not linear try doing some transformation of the variables to get you to a linear data set. I have used the following as a reference to answer your question. I encourage you to check it out: especially the section on transforming variables.
