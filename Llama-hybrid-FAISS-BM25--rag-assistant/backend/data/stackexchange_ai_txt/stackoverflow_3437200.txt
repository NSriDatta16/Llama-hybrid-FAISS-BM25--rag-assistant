TCP sockets don't handle buffering for you. How could it? It doesn't know what application layer protocol you are using and therefore has no idea what a "message" is. It is up to you to design and implement another protocol on top of it and handle any necessary buffering. But, Node.js does have a built in application layer protocol on top of TCP that does automatically handle the buffering for you: the http module. If you use the http module instead of the tcp module for this you won't need to worry about packet fragmentation and buffering.
