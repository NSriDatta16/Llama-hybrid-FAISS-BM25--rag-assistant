Forecast data with seasonality with machine learning

I have a basic knowledge on econometric techniques for forecasting, and I was reading about Forecasting with decomposition . My data seems to show high seasonality as can be seen in the following picture: If my understanding is correct, after decomposing the time series in its components with (e.g.) STL , I can forecast the seasonally adjusted component and then sum the season_year to the results to obtain predictions in the original scale. Is this correct? I am using Machine Learning (Random Forest precisely) to perform the forecasting, and my questions are: Does decomposing the time series like I am doing make sense when using ML? Since I am using other covariates to forecast, do I need to decompose them as well and use their seasonally adjusted values instead of the original ones? In the past I used to add dummy variables like quarter(date) to my model to account for the seasonal effect, but maybe this is better.
