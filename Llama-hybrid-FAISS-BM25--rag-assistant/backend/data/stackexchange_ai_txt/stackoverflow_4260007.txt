This is a classic example of keep alive and 100-continue. All cases I have seen so far were due to this issue so I would say you are on the right track. First of all, use Fiddler to get the request raw view to see what your request looks like. I bet you have Expect:100-continue in there. so try HttpWReq.Expect=""; It seems that you are using Windows authentication, try turning that off to see if this could be making issues - obviously you cannot turn that off all the time,just see what behaviour is. UPDATE First of all, I am almost sure that this is not the same request you are sending. This is the user agent which tells me it is not your HttpWebRequest: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB6.5; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Also there is view state which makes me believe this is just another request from browse. Also not protocol which is 1.1. I also noticed that you are not getting the response which might to do with it. You need to call request.GetResponseStream and read it.
