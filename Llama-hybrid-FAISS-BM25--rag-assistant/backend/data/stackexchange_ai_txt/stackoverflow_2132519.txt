In both cases I think you should hold onto the original emails. Storage is cheap, but if disk space is really an issue look to compression rather than excision to solve it. Both your of your use cases (historical record and audit) will be better served by storing the complete unabridged email in the database. Once you start tampering with the data, albeit "just" removing formatting, it becomes difficult to prove that you haven't edited it in other, more significant ways. Especially if you have deleted the original email instead of archiving it. You don't say what business you're in, but the other thing to remember is whether there are any data retention policies active within your organisation or in the wider jurisdiction. Compliance is becoming gnarlier all the time.
