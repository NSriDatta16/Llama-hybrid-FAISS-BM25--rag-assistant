Simple event listeners (as used in Java AWT) require that events are handled immediately, within the same virtual machine, and typically within the same thread. JMS (for instance using ActiveMQ) allows events to be handled at a later time (optionally buffering messages in persistent storage), and in other virtual machines / threads. That flexibility comes at the price of additional complexity and lower efficiency.
