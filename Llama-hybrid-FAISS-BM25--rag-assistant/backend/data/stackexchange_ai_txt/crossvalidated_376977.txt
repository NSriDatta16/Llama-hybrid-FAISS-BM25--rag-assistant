Your way to calculate the accuracy on the validation data set is not 100% appropriate as your linear regression estimates an intercept (unequal to 0) and a slope (unequal to 1). The way to go is to calculate the out-of-sample residuals as the difference between observed and predicted (from the random forest) and calculate the metrics of interest by hand. Put diffenently, just skip the part involving a linear regression. So following your code, you can obtain the "correct" validation results by something like res In this case, the out-of-bag R-squared is a bit lower than the one evaluated on the validation data. This is not a big deal as the Boston data set is small.
