A good mod is a person who realizes that there are two sides to every story, and that often people need a little extra help along the way. Mods are often teachers, they are often trusted, and they are always engaged. They definitely know that the community is larger than the stated goal of the community, and they participate within the community regularly. I'm active on MSO having over 900 points (granted, I'm nowhere near the top, but I'm in the top 500 sure enough), I'm active on SO (I think 3500 points qualifies me as understanding the system and actively participating), I'm a regular SE enthusiast, and I'm currently helping DBA.StackExchange.com get off the ground, where I'm also a regular on both the site and the meta. Many people have observed that I'm just about as committed to the SE system as anyone can be. I am often found in the SO chatrooms, the MSO chatrooms, and on some of the SE chatrooms. I routinely help people work out their problems by way of rubberducking and encourage them to post a proper SO question that we can then use for collaboration and that can in turn give back to the community. Enough about that, let's focus on what you care about: Why does someone want to volunteer to be a mod? Surely the person who volunteers for a public-good task is probably the least suited for the job, yeah? That would be true if I were asking to be a SOIS - Community Senator or something, but I'm really just looking to be a better janitor. I already flag questions for close, suggest comments on how to make other questions better, edit titles/tags/questions, and generally help with the upkeep. But I would be happy to take that one step further and help a little more, because I believe in SOIS and the mission to make the internet a better place. Of course, I also realize that I could just be some power hungry guy looking to make a name for himself as a ruthless mod, exacting bloody vengeance throughout the community as tho I were the grim reaper and my mod abilities were my scythe. But with Jeff on the horizon, I doubt anyone could pull that stunt at this point, even if they were so inclined. So no, I don't want to be a god mod , I just want to help keep the SO community in good general repair, and help out as I can.
