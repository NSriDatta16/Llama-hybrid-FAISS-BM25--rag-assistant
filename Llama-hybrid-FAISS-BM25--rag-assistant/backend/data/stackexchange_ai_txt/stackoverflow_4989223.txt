CSS Website Sidebar problem

I am making a web project http://conatus.in/alumniconnect/index.php?page=about I need to have a floating right sidebar, to accommodate different panels for facebook, news etc. However, the right sidebar is not working properly. Right sidebar's div id is "sidebarright". CSS is #sidebarright { float:right; } The contents are posted just above the main panel ( ) Left sidebar with following css is working good. #sidebar { float:left; width:250px; } I tried several combinations using firebug and dragonfly, but just cant make the right sidebar to properly float.
