Sharing widgets between PyQT and Boost.Python

I was wondering if it was possible to share widgets between PyQt and Boost.Python. I will be embedding a Python interpreter into an application of mine that uses Qt. I would like users of my application to be able to embed their own UI widgets into UI widgets programmed in C++ and exposed via Boost.Python. Is this possible and how would one go about doing this?
