For external libraries you can try to specify their include path with -isystem instead of -I , this will cause gcc to stop reporting warnings in them most of the time. When the warning only pops up in a few limited cases you can work around it with: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wshadow" For the rest of the cases refactoring the code or doing the grep trick Peter mentioned seem to be the only options.
