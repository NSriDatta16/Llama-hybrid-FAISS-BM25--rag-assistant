Ruby is way better at anything related to text processing, and is very good at being flexible , that is, to give developers the power to write very elegant, readable code. If you want speed, this isn't the place, but for a lot of things it doesn't matter. If I had to give one thing Ruby excels at, it is that it is fundamentally designed to be very readable - Matz writes about this in Beautiful Code, that well-written code is an essay to communicate ideas to other people , not to computers.
