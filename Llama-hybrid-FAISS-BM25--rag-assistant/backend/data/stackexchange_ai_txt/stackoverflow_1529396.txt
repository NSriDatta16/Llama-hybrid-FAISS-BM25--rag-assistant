This would seem to be a basic physics problem. You would need to know where the click, and that will tell you if they are pushing or pulling, so, though you are doing this in 2D, your calculations will need to be in 3D, and your awareness of where they clicked will be in 3D. Each item will have properties, such as mass, and perhaps information for air resistance, since the air will help to provide the motion. You will also need to react differently based on how fast the user is moving the mouse. So, they may be able to move the 2 ton weight faster than is possible, and you will just need to adapt to that, as the user will not be happy if the object being dragged is slower than the mouse pointer.
