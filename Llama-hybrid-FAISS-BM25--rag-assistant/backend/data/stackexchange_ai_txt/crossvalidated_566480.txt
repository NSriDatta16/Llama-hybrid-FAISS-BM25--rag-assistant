In what applications do we prefer Model Selection over Model Averaging?

I'm wondering in what applications or scenarios (or in trying to answer what kind of questions), the researcher would prefer using Model Selection (such as AIC or BIC) over Model Averaging (such as Bayesian model averaging)? One example: if my question at hand is what's the most appropriate model, then I must use Model Selection. Another (not sure) example: I guess if we want less bias, Model Selection is also preferred. It would be great if you have other examples like these. Paper or book recommendations are also welcome.
