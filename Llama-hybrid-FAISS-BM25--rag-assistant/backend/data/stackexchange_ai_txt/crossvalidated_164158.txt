Logistic regression in R, basing on which class(0 or 1) in dependent variable the modelling is performed

In R and in binomial logistic regression to be specific, the modelling is based on which class amongst 0 and 1? And if it builds model based on 1 by default, is there a parameter or something in which we can pass 0 so that the model is built basing on class 0? At least this is what I percieve, please correct me if I'm wrong. I've heard that in SAS, modelling is done based on class 1 rather than class 0(Is it true?). So I was curious to know how it works in R.
