If you dont write a return-statement in a JavaScript function, but it reaches its end anyway, then it returns undefined. That is (probably) what has happened here, since if you dont enter the if-statement with the return-statement, you will not get to return anything. EDIT: As a rule of thumb, you should ALWAYS return something in every bransch of your code. A static language compiler would have warned you about this, but here you have to make sure yourself. Example: function get(what, where){ where = typeof(where) != 'undefined' ? where : user.object; for(entry in where){ if(typeof(where[entry]) =="string"){ if (entry == what) { result = where[entry]; console.log(result) return result; } }else if(typeof(where[entry]) =="object"){ get(what, where[entry]); // Are you sure you don't want to return anything here?.. hm... } } // Here be dragons! What will be returned from the function? // Hint: Undefined! :) } Both those places could probably use return statements. The last one need one because what if the for-loop doesn't have any entries to enumerate over?
