These page seems to offer some good advice: Here The section on blocking by user agent may be something you could look at implementing. Is there anyway you can get the useragent from the bot from your logs? If so look for the unique aspect of the useragent that probably identifies the bot and add the following to .htaccess replacing the relevant bits BrowserMatchNoCase SpammerRobot bad_bot Order Deny,Allow Deny from env=bad_bot Its detail on that link in more detail and of course, if you can't get the useragent from your logs then this will be of no use to you!
