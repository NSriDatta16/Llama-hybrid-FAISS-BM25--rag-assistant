This question is examined in detail in the book: "Statistics On Spheres", Geoffrey S. Watson, University of Arkansas Lecture Notes in the Mathematical Sciences, 1983 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. as mentioned at http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/7.44.html#subj4 by Bruce Karsh. A good way to estimate an average angle, A, from a set of angle measurements a[i] 0 sum_i_from_1_to_N sin(a[i]) a = arctangent --------------------------- sum_i_from_1_to_N cos(a[i]) The method given by starblue is computationally equivalent, but his reasons are clearer and probably programmatically more efficient, and also work well in the zero case, so kudos to him. The subject is now explored in more detail on Wikipedia , and with other uses, like fractional parts.
