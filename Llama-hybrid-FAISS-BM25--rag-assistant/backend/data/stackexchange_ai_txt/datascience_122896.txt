Solution using search Without any machine learning involved, you can solve it by searching for the user input in Column_B . Here is a solution using pandas ( documentation ). import pandas as pd import io raw_data = """Column X,Column_A,Column_B AA, 1 , KEYWORD1 KEYWORD2 KEYWORD3 AA, 2 , KEYWORD4 KEYWORD5 KEYWORD6 XX, 3 , KEYWORD3 KEYWORD7 XX, 4, KEYWORD6 KEYWORD8 YY, 5, KEYWORD9""" f = io.StringIO(raw_data) data = pd.read_csv(f) # The following will give you a DataFrame with rows having KEYWORD9 in Column_B. data[data["Column_B"].str.contains("KEYWORD9")] Solution using machine learning With machine learning, you should specify what you are trying to predict , and what are the features you can use for this task. For example, you may want to use machine learning to denoise the user input into a valid input. However, you should first consider simpler solutions. For input denoising, you can use fuzzy search to guess the user's input, even with some typos in the input. Fuzzy search is an approximate string matching technique which does not requires any machine learning and will be much, much faster.
