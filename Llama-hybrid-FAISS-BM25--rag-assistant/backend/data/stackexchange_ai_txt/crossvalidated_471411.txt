Simple example of a Fixed vs. Random effects model

Wikipedia's page on Random effects models gives a simple illustrative example of a random effect occurring in a panel analysis amongst pupils' performance on schools. Wikipedia's page on Fixed effects models lacks such an example. So, in order to meet the persisting need* for clear explanations between Fixed and Random effects models, I think it would be of added-value to alter the pupils' performance example to exemplify a fixed effect in such a panel analysis. Serving both as a contribution to Fixed effects' Wikipedia page and my understanding of the two models, I propose the following tweaked example: Suppose $m$ large elementary schools are chosen randomly from among thousands in a large country. Suppose also that $n$ pupils of the same age are chosen randomly at each selected school. Their scores on a standard aptitude test are ascertained. Let $Y_{i,j}$ be the score of the $j$ th pupil at the $i$ th school. If one considers scores $Y_{i,j}$ to be subject to the non-random assignment of students to schools, a Fixed effects model can be used to difference out unobserved heterogeneity. A simple way to model the relationships of these quantities is $$ Y_{i,j} = \mu + U_i + W_{i,j}, $$ where $\mu$ is the average test score for the entire population. Can $U_i$ in this context be called the school-specific fixed effect , i.e. it measures the difference between the average score at school $i$ and the average score in the entire country? The same question for the term $W_{i,j}$ , is it the individual-specific fixed effect , i.e., it's the deviation of the $j$ -th pupilâ€™s score from the average for the $i$ -th school? Please let me know if you have any suggestions. *amongst others: this , this and this posts
