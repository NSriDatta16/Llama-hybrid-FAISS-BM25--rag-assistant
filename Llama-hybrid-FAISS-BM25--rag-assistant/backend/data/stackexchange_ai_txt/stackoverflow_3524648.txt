If the entire array must be loaded into PHP, I'd write a script that made it into a PHP script that contains an array definition of the list of words, so you'd have a .php file that contains: $myArray = array('blah', 'blah', 'blah'); //etc Then, I'd include that (require_once)... most PHP script engines will be able to optimize that pretty easily... not much point in storing it in a session, would just use up more disk space/DB space/memory for storage.
