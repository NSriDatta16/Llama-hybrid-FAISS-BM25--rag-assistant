How Principal components can be determined using Statistical Inference? : doubt in the book "Using Multivariate Statistics"

In chapter 13 (Factor analysis and PCA) of the book "Using Multivariate statistics" , under the section 13.3.2.2, how big an issue is the non-normality of the data is discussed. From what is given, I understand that multivariate normality is not a concern when PCA is used descriptively. But the authors also say, multivariate normality is assumed when statistical inference is used to determine the number of factors. I'm not able to figure out what do they exactly mean here. How can statistical inference be used to determine the no. of factors/components? Any help appreciated. Thanks!
