How to test differences between coefficients of determination R²?

I have two sample Models M1 and M2 and a time series with 1000 observations of x, B, C and D. M1 is a nested model of M2. M1: x = a + b1*B + b2*C M2: x = z + y1*B + y2*C + y2*D I regress now both models to get two different coefficients of determination R². M1: R²M1 = 0.68 M2: R²M2 = 0.70 I calculate the difference of them. R²M2-R²M1 = 0.70-0.68 = 0.02 How can I test now this difference between the coefficients of determination R²? I tried the Meng test, but it seems to lack something. german: http://www.andre-hahn.de/Statistik/Korrelationsdifferenz.html ; english: https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37867-meng-s-z-test-for-correlated-correlation-coefficients I simulate similiar regressions like in the example 100.000 times, but I don't get 5% significant results for a 5% normal distributed test statistic. (which I expected to be logical and assumable). I am also quite sure, that I cannot use a simple t-test to test the difference against zero due to the correlated correlations nature of both R² of the nested models. Do you know any test for differences in the coefficients of determination R² between two nested models?
