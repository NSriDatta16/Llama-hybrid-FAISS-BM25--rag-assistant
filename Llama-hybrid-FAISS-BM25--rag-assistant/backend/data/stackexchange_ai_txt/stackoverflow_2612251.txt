Hey I'm getting the same issue. I tried my app on an iPad and it was spitting out this error. The only way I could replicate it on my Safari browser is if I put my computer in Private mode... I think anytime it's in private mode the localStorage becomes read only. So I still don't have a solution, but if it helps I'd love to hear it.
