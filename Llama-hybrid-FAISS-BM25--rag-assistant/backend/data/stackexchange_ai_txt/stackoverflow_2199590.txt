defrag your harddisk (or at least the mdf/ldf) files. put the ldf file on a separate harddisk than mdf, if possible use the the profiling tool from SQL 2005; it will tell you which requests last most; then use the "show execution plan" tool to see the steps of execution; maybe you will get a hint on what indexes should be added; for example, full table scan should be avoided for large tables.
