I would use a combination of strategy and decorator pattern. Your initial suggestion is something like a strategy pattern approach. Try to distinguish between character types and character traits. Character types would be something like fighter, wizard, cleric, … and design it with a strategy pattern, which result to some hierarchy tree. Character traits would be elements like fire elemental, water elemental, black force, … E.g. a fighter character might choose between fire and water elemental to be his native origin, like a pirate (aarrrr!) or a blacksmith. If you design this hierarchically, then you are doomed, because this will let your hierarchy tree explode in size. Such character traits should be rather implemented with the decorator pattern, because it’s an orthogonal concept to the character concept. So you’ll basically create a fighter character and wrap a water elemental decorator around to get a pirate (aarrrr!). Or create a wizard character and wrap a dark magic decorator around him to get a dark mage. Or: Crate a wizard character and wrap a water elemental and a dark magic decorator around him to get a swampland wizard. Some food for thoughts: If you decide to have all character have magic abilities, then design magic as character trait. If necessary: Organize the decorators in some kind of hierarchical structure. You might have an "elemental" (water, fire, earth, wind) decorator hierarchy and "magic type" (black, white) decorator hierarchy. Have fun!
