You can trigger some javascript when you UpdatePanel refreshes with the following javascript code: var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance(); prm.add_pageLoaded(YourJavascriptFunctionNameHere); You could then put a hidden button on the other UpdatePanel and manually call the __DoPostBack from the javascript function you have hooked onto the UpdatePanel reload. There is probably other ideas for how to leverage add_pageLoaded in your scenario but this should at least get you on the right track.
