You could do this using a logistic regression . Use one predictor as the time/treatment (possibly with a polynomial or spline term for non-linearity) and another predictor as a 0/1 variable indicating control or test, also include the interaction between them. If there is no difference in the groups, then the coefficients on the 0/1 variable and the interaction will not be significantly different from 0. I would suggest a full/reduced model test comparing the model with the 0/1 term and interaction to a model that only includes the terms for time/treatment.
