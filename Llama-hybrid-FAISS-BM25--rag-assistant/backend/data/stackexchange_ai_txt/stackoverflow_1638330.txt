There are several things you could/should do Disable automatic NTFS short file name generation (google it) Or restrict file names to use 8.3 pattern (e.g. i0000001.jpg, ...) In any case try making the first six characters of the filename as unique/different as possible If you use the same folder over and (say adding file, removing file, readding files, ...) Use contig to keep the index file of the directory as less fragmented as possible (check this for explanation) Especially when removing many files consider using the folder remove trick to reduce the direcotry index file size As already posted consider splitting up the files in multiple directories. .e.g. instead of directory/abc.jpg directory/acc.jpg directory/acd.jpg directory/adc.jpg directory/aec.jpg use directory/b/c/abc.jpg directory/c/c/acc.jpg directory/c/d/acd.jpg directory/d/c/adc.jpg directory/e/c/aec.jpg
