Making and reporting a logistic regression, stratified by sex and age

This question was already asked at Stackoverflow - R Language Collective, but they said this might be a better place to post this question, so here I am. I'm doing the statistics in R. I have this database with over 6,000 entries and 75 variables. I want to make a few models. The outcome variable is always mortality. The first idea for a model is "Only take male/female, then stratify by age categories, youngest being the reference for the odd ratios (ORs) of the following age categories." (like this ). To do this, I first made a new dataframe with only all the female entries, and then in the glm -function, I subsetted by the youngest age-category (i.e. 18-39). Code looks something like this: df_model_1_all_female % filter(Sex == "Female") model_1_stratgender_age_categories If i subset like that I'd have to make around 7 models (one for every age-category), for only the female category which already seems odd? Furthermore, if I use this code to become the ORs and confidence intervals: exp(cbind(OR = coef(model_1_stratgender_age_categories_default), confint(model_1_stratgender_age_categories_default))) I'm not sure how to report this. Especially since the youngest age category equals the reference for the further ones. I suspect I shouldn't use the subset-function in the glm like that, but I don't know how I should resolve it. Furthermore, I'm fairly new to logistic regression all together. I can interpret an R summary -output of a regression, but I'm not sure how to adapt the model to make it better. Do you recommend certain practical resources to look at?
