If you regularly need to get the key of the nth item, consider: using a TreeMap, which efficiently keeps keys in sorted order then using a double map (i.e. one TreeMap mapping integer > float, the other mapping float > integer) You have to weigh up the inelegance and potential risk of bugs from needing to maintain two maps with the scalability benefit of having a structure that efficiently keeps the keys in order. You may need to think about two keys mapping to the same float... P.S. Forgot to mention: if this is an occasional function, and you just need to find the nth largest item of a large number of items, you could consider implementing a selection algorithm (effectively, you do a sort, but don't actually bother sorting subparts of the list that you realise you don't need to sort because their order makes no difference to the position of the item you're looking for).
