Prior , conjugate , and posterior distributions are concepts from bayes ian statistics. A good introduction is Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al. , currently in its third edition. Loosely, a prior distribution is a mathematical statement about how you believe the parameters of a model, or another quantity of interest, are distributed before you even look at the data. The core concept in this paper is that the authors are trying to prevent the model from estimating variances near 0, because that creates training instability. To ameliorate this, the authors assign a prior probability distribution to the variance, so there is only a very small probability mass on the values of variance that are near 0. This is analogous to penalizing a loss function for certain solutions, so that the model doesnâ€™t estimate the variance to be near 0. The effect is that the model's posterior probability distribution avoids training instability that arises from near-0 variance estimates.
