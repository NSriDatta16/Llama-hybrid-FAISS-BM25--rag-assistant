As UDP is not connection oriented there's no way to indicate that two packets belong together. As a result you're limited by the maximum size of a single IP packet (65535). The data you can send is somewhat less that that, because the IP packet size also includes the IP header (usually 20 bytes) and the UDP header (8 bytes). Note that this IP packet can be fragmented to fit in smaller packets (eg. ~1500 bytes for ethernet). I'm not aware of any OS restricting this further. Bonus SO_MAX_MSG_SIZE of UDP packet IPv4: 65,507 bytes IPv6: 65,527 bytes
