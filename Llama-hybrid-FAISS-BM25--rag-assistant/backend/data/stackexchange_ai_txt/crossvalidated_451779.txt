How to identify the order q of the moving-average part of a SARIMA model?

I'm analyzing this time series y = [18 22 26 16 19 21 18 22 25 31 30 34 31 25 21 24 21 28 24 26 32 33 36 39 32 33 42 44 43 48 50 56 57 59 61 49 49 57 69 72 75 76 78 73 73 75 86 97 110 134 138 146 146 132 136 143 133 158 160 182 183 188 180 176 185 194 217 220 237 266 270 264 283] and I'm trying to understand why the researchers chose the model $\text{ARIMA}(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_{10}$ . These are my reasoning based on the below figures: $p=P=0$ since there aren’t significant autocorrelations (ACF fig.1) $d=D=1$ since differencing was applied once (fig.1) $s=10$ since there are 10 periods in each season (ACF fig.1) But what about $q$ ? From theory, $q$ represents the number of the random process' previous points that are taken into account, for example MA(1) : $x_{i} = \varepsilon_{i} + a_1 \cdot \varepsilon_{i-1}$ , where $\varepsilon$ is the driving noise MA(2) : $x_{i} = \varepsilon_{i} + a_1 \cdot \varepsilon_{i-1} + a_2 \cdot \varepsilon_{i-2}$ and so on But how to understand how many of the previous points of the random process have to be considered? Moreover, I also read that a property of MA(q) models is that there are nonzero autocorrelations for the first q lags and autocorrelations = 0 for all lags > q. But from ACF plots below, we see that there aren’t significant autocorrelations, i.e. all autocorrelations are (statistically) 0. So I'm a bit confused.
