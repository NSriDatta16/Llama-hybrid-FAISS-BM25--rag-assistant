Vague and noninformative priors are often used if researchers cannot agree on what prior information they have, or if they legitimately do not feel comfortable specifying a distribution. One of my professors always said that the biggest problem for Bayesian statistics is that if you shove 15 statisticians into a room and say "Do a Bayesian analysis of this problem", you'll get 15 different priors. Saying "we really don't know" is a good way to alleviate that problem and to avoid accusations of bias. Even though prior knowledge may be rare, sometimes you still want to take advantage of the Bayesian interpretation. As you probably know, a common critique of frequentist methods is that they are often difficult to interpret. For example, confidence intervals treat the bounds as random and the parameter as fixed, so the statement "The probability that this mean is in the interval" don't have a meaningful interpretation because the interval either captures the mean or it doesn't. Using a noninformative prior allows you access to a Bayesian interpretation without having to incorporate unavailable or not-agreed-upon prior knowledge. For more information, read this older question where someone asked a very similar question.
