In my opinion, DRY is the critical path. To that end, I see two options: Instead of saving the data in the component, return it to the controller in a raw form that can be saved from the controller. Go ahead and import the model into the component and do what you need to do. It's not encouraged, but they do make it reasonably easy. If it comes down to a hard choice, I'd err on the side of keeping my application DRY rather than maintaining a strict MVC discipline.
