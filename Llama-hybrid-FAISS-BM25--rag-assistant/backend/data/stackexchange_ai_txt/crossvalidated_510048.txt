It is possible to use a full error correction model, when properly rearranged to condition on any subset of observations, both future and past. In the appendix to this note we provide some matrix algebra to solve for what we called a Correlated Brownian Bridge but i only found out later, is very similar to what Bayesians call a Conditional Forecast. (I used it in several similar notes for marketing structured products but had my coauthor publish only under his name after I moved from Research.) Youâ€™ll note that although in this note we condition on a future state of one variable to infer conditional means for the others, you could easily condition on the path of one variable. Moreover given that we are assuming joint normality for everything it is easy to find standard errors and do conditional simulations. Just use the Cointegration to form the structure of a large multivariate normal with a complex covariance structure. https://www.academia.edu/36076078/Quantitative_Strategies_Scenario_analysis_on_the_EUR_10Y_level_and_EUR_2Y_10Y_slope_conditioning_on_future_macroeconomic_expectations In this second note I use the same method to do simulations conditional on outcomes of specific variables or combinations of variables. It only involves the manipulation of large banded block matrices. https://www.academia.edu/36076082/CMS_Squared_Macrofinancial_Scenarios_for_Structured_Products_using_Brownian_Bridges So the problem is not hard to generalise if we assume normality.
