Are you sure 12 rolling window tests warrant so many digits in your result table? In other words, what is the uncertainty on your error estimates and how does that compare to the observed differences? Statistically speaking, can you distinguish 19.40 from from 19.99? Keep in mind: finding "those 4 methods perform well, it doesn't matter which of them we take" is a valid result. More than one method may be equally suitable. I don't work with time series, so I don't know how to interpret ses, meanf, holt and holt damped to achieve similar predictive performance. But with my spectroscopic data, if I found, say, that principal component regression and partial least squares do equally well, whereas OLS and neural network don't that would not be surprising. Interpretation would be that linear models are suitable, but some regularization is needed.
