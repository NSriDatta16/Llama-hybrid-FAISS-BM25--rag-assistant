Qualitative difference between boxplots and error bars (descriptive vs inferrential statistics?)

Assume I have test scores from several groups, with all samples of equal size. Assume I want to plot this data so as to emphasise in the simplest way (without showing the distributions) the difference in test scores in terms of average and variability between groups. Now assume I am someone with only superficial understanding of statistics, and I know about (1) barplots with error bars and (2) boxplots; but because of how similar these appear to be on paper (simplistic visualisation below), I am undecided which one to use. My question is: What is the qualitative difference between these two plot types? After all, each one of them shows a measure of central tendency (barplot with error bars: mean , boxplot: median ) and a measure of spread ( SEM and IQR , respectively). My guess is that the answer lies with inferential vs descriptive statistics, of which the barplot with errorbars, and the boxplot, are respective exponents of; but would appreciate an ellaboration on how these two seemingly-similar types of plots are in fact qualitatively quite different, and how the choice between them is not purely a matter of which one you better like the look of (or the extra few bits of information that the boxplot gives you). Stated another way, would it be wrong to take the measure of uncertainty of estimation provided by the error bar (Â±1 SEM) as a measure of spread , as if it were just a scaled IQR? Of course, both the SEM and the IQR care about the distributions' variances, but IQR does not care about sample size, whereas SEM does (as it's normalised by its squareroot).
