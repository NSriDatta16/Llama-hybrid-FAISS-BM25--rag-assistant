Another thing that could go awry is an unbalanced panel where you have "gaps" in the middle of the time series. The FD estimator will lose two observations if there a single period missing. The dummy approach will loose only one. Are the sample sizes wildly different between the two regressions by any chance? What happens if you use only observations where you have all the periods? If that's not's what causing it, we have to think harder. You may have contemporaneous correlation between $x_{it}$ and $u_{it}$. In that case, both the FD and FE estimators will be inconsistent and have different probability limits ( Adult Wooldridge , p.321-322). It's hard to know which one should be preferred ex ante and or what to do about it. If you have non-contemporaneous correlation, it will have similar effects, but there may be a solution. When $x_{it}$ and $u_{is}$ for $t s$, a more complicated solution is described in chapter 11 of Wooldridge. If you maintain that you have contemporaneous exogeneity, then the inconsistency of the FE estimator from the failure of strict exogeneity goes to zero at the rate $\frac{1}{T}$, while the FD's is independent of $T$. But that's only true if $x_{it}$ and $y_{it}$ are cointegrated (in the time series sense). In fact, FE may be worse than FD in that case for fixed $N$ as $T$ grows. So FD may deal better with spurious regression.
