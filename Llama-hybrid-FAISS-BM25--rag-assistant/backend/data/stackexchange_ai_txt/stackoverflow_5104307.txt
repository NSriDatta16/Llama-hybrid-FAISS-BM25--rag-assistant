Good to see you've given it some thought and tried on your own. http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db has some good info on using SQLite on Android It's also used in the Notepad tutorial: http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/notepad/notepad-ex1.html I personally learned by using part of the guide from the "Hello, Android" book. The source code is available at: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/eband3/source_code - the SQL example is the one called 'Eventsv1'
