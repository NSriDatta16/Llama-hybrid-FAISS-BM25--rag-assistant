I am quite sure that a by default has external linkage, b , c and d have internal linkage. Is my understanding correct? No! d has no-linkage because it is a formal parameter. From C99 The following identifiers have no linkage : an identifier declared to be anything other than an object or a function; an identifier declared to be a function parameter ; a block scope identifier for an object declared without the storage-class specifier extern. Furthermore b has external linkage in C99. In C++ const-qualified variables at file scope have internal linkage.
