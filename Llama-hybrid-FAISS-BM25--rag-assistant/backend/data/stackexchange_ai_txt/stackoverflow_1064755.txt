I haven't done this in a while, but the last time I did, using a string that is a template for your HTML fragment, e.g., var myVar = ' @TEXT@ '; then doing some token replace to populate it with data, and finally using someElement.innerHTML = myVar , was at least an order of magnitude faster than doing it through more standard DOM manipulation techniques.
