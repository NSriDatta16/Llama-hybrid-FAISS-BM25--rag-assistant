In my native Polish, for example, there are three forms: for 1, for 2-4 and for zero and numbers greater than 4. Then after you reach 20, the forms for 21, 22-24 and 25+ are again different (same grammatical forms as for numerals 0-9). And yes, "you have 0 things" sounds awkward, because you're not likely to see that used in real life. As a localization specialist, here's what I would recommend: If possible, use forms which put the numeral at the end: a: Number of cars: %d This means the form of the noun "car" does not depend on the numeral, and 0 is as natural as any other number. If the above is not acceptable, at least always make a complete sentence a translatable resource. That is, do use b: You have 1 car. c: You have %d cars. But never split such units into smaller fragments such as d: You have e: car(s) (Then somewhere else you have a non-localizable resource such as %s %d %s ) The difference is that while I cannot translate (c) directly, since the form of the noun will change, I can see the problem and I can change the sentence to form (a) in translation. On the other hand, when I am faced with (d) and (e) fragments, there is no way to make sure the resulting sentence will be grammatical. Again: using fragments guarantees that in some languages the translation will be anything from grammatically awkward to completely broken. This applies across the board, not just to numerals. For example, a fragment such as %s was deleted is also untranslatable, since the form of the verb will depend on the gender of the noun, which is unavailable here. The best I can do for Polish is the equivalent of Deleted: %s , but I can only do it as long as the %s placeholder is included in the translatable resource. If all I have is "was deleted" with no clue to the referent noun, I can only startle my dog by cursing aloud and in the end I still have to produce garbage grammar.
