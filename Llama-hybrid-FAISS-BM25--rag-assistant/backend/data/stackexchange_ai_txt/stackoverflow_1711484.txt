We use a static front end with a Magento back end (www.movingpicturebooks.com). It's fairly straight-forward. The biggest challenge is that you need to hardcode your front end to specific product IDs. If you're running seperate development and production environments, it can be a real bitch to keep them in sync. But that's another subject. Here are the pieces you need: 1) Add to Cart buttons - Use this link format: /checkout/cart/add/?product=$PRODUCTID&qty=$QUANTITY 2) Shopping Cart Link : /checkout/cart/ 3) Checkout Link : /checkout/onepage/ 4) My Account Link : /customer/account/ 5) Login/Logout : You need to have a small bit of PHP code on every page to access the Magento session, and then depending on where it's at, render the appropriate link. Example: "frontend")); if (empty($session)) { $session = Mage::getSingleton("customer/session"); } if($session->isLoggedIn()) { $login_action = "Sign Out"; $login_url = "/index.php/customer/account/logout/"; } else { $login_action = "Sign In"; $login_url = "/index.php/customer/account/login/"; } ?> 6) Skinning : You mention wanting to embed the Magento Shopping Cart stuff in your design template. It's not just the cart you need to worry about - it's My Account, Login, Forget Password, all sorts of stuff. This is the one area of Magento that's halfway documented. Do a little research and you should be able to rock it.
