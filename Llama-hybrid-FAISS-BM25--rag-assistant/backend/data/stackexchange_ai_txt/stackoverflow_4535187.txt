It's not that easy to relate asymptotic complexity to running times. When the sample is so small there are lots of things that will affect your timing. To have more accurate timings you should run your algorithm K times per instance (e.g. K times with 17, K times with 33 and so forth) and take the average time as sample point (e.g. K=100) That said it looks about right. You can plot nlog(n) vs your timings and you'll see that despite the different scales they are growing similarly. Still too little sample points to be sure...
