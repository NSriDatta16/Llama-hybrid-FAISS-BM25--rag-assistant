Why is computation of scores in Sparse PCA different from T=XP?

I am recently learning Sparse PCA. From a lately published paper All sparse PCA models are wrong, but some are useful. Part I: Computation of scores, residuals and explained variance I learned that since the loadings of sPCA are not orthogonal, we should use the correction formula below to compute the scores, where the superscript '+' indicates the Moore-Penrose inverse: $$ \mathbf{T}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{P}\left(\mathbf{P}^\text{T}\mathbf{P}\right)^+ $$ Actually I cannot figure out the reason behind it. As far as I know previously, $\mathbf{P}$ contains coefficient vectors which can construct Principal Component directly, so $\mathbf{T}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{P}$ already stands for the scores. I've tried to turn to Google, but didn't find any related topics. Could you please tell me why we should add $\left(\mathbf{P}^\text{T}\mathbf{P}\right)^+$ to the right side of the formula just because the loadings are not orthogonal? Thanks in advance.
