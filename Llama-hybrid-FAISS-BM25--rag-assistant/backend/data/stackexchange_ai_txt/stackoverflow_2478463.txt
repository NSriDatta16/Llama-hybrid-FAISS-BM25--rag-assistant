PNG is best, but you don't need to worry about patents; (citing Wikipedia ), it seems the JPEG patent was never valid to begin with (a clear case of patent trollery, not just dickery), and it's expired anyway even if it was. GIF was patented because it uses patented LZW compression technology, but these patents expired in 2003/2004. So the decision need only take into account raw merits. PNG beats GIF on everything except that animations are not supported (MNG supports them, though). However, because PNG is very bad at compressing photographs, you're better off publishing your images as JPEGs, although PNG is better for storage.
