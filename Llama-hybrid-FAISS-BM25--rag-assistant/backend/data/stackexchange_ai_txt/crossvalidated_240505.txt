Bootstrapping the Granger Wald Test?

I created full example code that conducts a Granger causality Wald test for the Chicken & Egg dataset: library(lmtest) library(aom) #Load data data(ChickEgg) data = data.frame(ChickEgg) data # sample=54 data points, which is rather low. # plot time series par(mfrow=c(2,1)) plot.ts(data$chicken) plot.ts(data$egg) # For simplicity of the example, we don't check stationarity and assume stationarity I(0) # Also, we assume the optimum lag length of the bivariate VAR to be 2 # Conduct Granger causality Wald test VAR This works. Now comes the main question. As the sample size is rather small (n=54), I want to conduct a bootstrap test for the p-values. I got following working for a simple regression: library(boot) # Test Original Regression summary(lm(chicken~egg, data=data[1:53,]))$r.square # function to obtain R-Squared from the data rsq Can anyone help me replacing it with the Wald test? And: How do I interpret the results?
