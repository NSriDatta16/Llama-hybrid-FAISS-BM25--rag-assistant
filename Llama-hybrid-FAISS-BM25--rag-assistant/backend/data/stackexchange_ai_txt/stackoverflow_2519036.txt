Implementations are free to do anything they want :P. However since C++ has to appeal to certain styles of programming, you will find a deterministic way of accessing your fields for your specific compiler/platform/cpu architecture. If your byte ordering is varied on a different compiler, my first assumption would be byte packing issues. If you need the class to have a certain specific byte ordering first look up "#pragma pack" directives for your compiler... you can change the packing order into something less optimal but deterministic. Please note this piece of advice generally applies to POD data types.
