KMeans data treatment

I have a dataset with a set of features regarding: Age Country TypeA1 TypeB1 TypeC1 Where Country is a feature that can have 195 different potential values, TypeA1 can have 50 different potential values, TypeB1 can have 32 potential values and TypeC1 can have 42 potential values. I would like to compute clusters by using Kmeans algorithm. My concern here is that, if I use the whole set of potential values within each variable in dummies the number of columns could have too much and the risk would be dispersion. How I should treat the variables? By using dummies, or by using categorical (encoding the label with a number) and then performing the dimensionality reduction (eg PCA) before training the Kmeans?
