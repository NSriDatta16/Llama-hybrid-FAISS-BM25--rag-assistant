None of the methods you mention are used for feature selection. You have high-dimensional data (where $p>n$ ), so regular methods go out the window. Given your data, and the fact that you want to keep your variables intact and reduce the dimensionality, then something like LASSO is more appropriate, or a Random Forest.
