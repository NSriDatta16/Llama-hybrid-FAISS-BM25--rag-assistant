The classic definition of a confidence interval $I_\theta$ for the unknown parameter $\theta$ is indeed that $\mbox{P}(\theta\in I_\theta)\geq 1-\alpha$ for all $\theta$. This definition is needed for theoretical comparisons of confidence intervals (i.e. when deriving optimality results), but is used less frequently in applied statistics, where confidence intervals commonly only satisify $\mbox{P}(\theta\in I_\theta)\approx 1-\alpha$, with $\mbox{P}(\theta\in I_\theta) Examples of intervals of the latter type are bootstrap confidence intervals , which are very useful when the sampling distribution of $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ is either unknown or too complicated to be treated analytically. Another example of where $\mbox{P}(\theta\in I_\theta)\neq 1-\alpha$ is confidence intervals for the parameter $p$ in the binomial distribution $\mbox{Bin}(n,p)$. A classical confidence interval is the Clopper-Pearson interval, which is such that $\mbox{P}(p\in I_p)\geq 1-\alpha$ for all $p\in(0,1)$. Below is the coverage $\mbox{P}(p\in I_p)$ as a function of $p$ when $n=25$ and $\alpha=0.05$: For symmetry ("equivariance") reasons, the coverage for $1-p$ is the same as that for $p$. An alternative, quite popular, interval is the Wilson score interval, which only satisfies $\mbox{P}(p\in I_p)\approx 1-\alpha$ but is prefered since it has significantly shorter length than the Clopper-Pearson interval (most practitioners are willing to accept slight undercoverage for some values of $p$ if they can obtain shorter intervals): As you can see, the answer to your question depends on whether you use the term confidence interval in the classic sense or in the sense that it is used in modern applied statistics. (Confidence intervals for $p$ with coverage $1-\alpha$ for all values of $p$ can be obtained by using randomization . Essentially, this means that the function $\mbox{P}(p\in I_p)$ is smoothed by adding additional randomness to the analysis. This is however not all that popular in practice.)
