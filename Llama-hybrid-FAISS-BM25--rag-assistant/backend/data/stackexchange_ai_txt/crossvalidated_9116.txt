How to properly weight contributing percentages?

First off, be warned: I am a complete stats novice. I'd like to learn, but at the moment I have an intense business problem to solve that I think (hope?) is straightforward enough that it could be answered easily. I will try to explain as simply as I can so I don't muck it up. In short, i'm trying to find the right way to display a collection of pie charts. These pie charts are part of a proposal for new business; they measure incumbent capture across multiple contracts from different teaming partners. Data I'm working with: Company A: [a1] percentage of capture across [b1] contracts Company B: [a2] percentage of capture across [b2] contracts Company C: [a3] percentage of capture across [b3] contracts Total: [aT] percentage of capture across [bT] contracts I have the data for sets 1, 2, and 3 -- the goal is to derive the data for set "T". Essentially, we'd like to say "business A had 30% capture across 100 contracts, business B had 50% against 70 contracts, and business C had 40% against 500 contracts" the individual pie charts are of course simple enough (even I can do that one ;) ), but I would like them all to feed into a pie chart which shows the average percentage across all contracts with the total of contracts. To try to articulate more bluntly, my question is: how can I ensure that the individual percentages for company performance are weighted according to the number of contracts they are referencing? Thank you in advance for any help you can give! All the best, --Sean
