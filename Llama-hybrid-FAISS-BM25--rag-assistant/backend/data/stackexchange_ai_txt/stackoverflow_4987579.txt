How do I get the current PyInterpreterState?

I'd like to create a PyThreadState since there doesn't appear to be one for the current thread. How do I get the current PyInterpreterState to pass to PyThreadState_New(...) , or is that something that I should only do if I'm embedding an interpreter (and thus have created it), rather than calling into a library from python?
