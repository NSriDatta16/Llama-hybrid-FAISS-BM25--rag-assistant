Interpretation of R glm output p value, specifically one-tail vs two-tail?

I'm nervous this has been asked elsewhere (feel free to point me there) but I had trouble finding it. My question is: I am doing a logistic regression to examine whether the length of time between two surgeries led to more complications in the second surgery. I'm doing this analysis in R. Going in, I very much think that if there is less time between surgeries (the "TimeFrame" variable. Its # of days. I especially think if there's a very short amount of time, in my head I would think under 90 days would be important) that there would be more complications (variable is yes/no). When I do the regression, my output looks like this: When I was reading here and in Joseph M. Hilbe's book "Practical Guide to Logistic Regression", it said that what you see is the p value for a two-tailed test, and if you're interested in a one-tailed test you'd divide that p-value by 2. Hence, my question: I THINK I am interested in a one-tailed test, given I think its shorter time frames that lead to complications, not longer. And given I think there'll be more complications, not less. Is that a safe assumption? If so, I'd divide that 0.0958 by 2 and get 0.0479, which would then be significant correct? Do I need to divide anything else? As an aside, my data has "Timeframes" from 1 day to 800 days. As I mentioned I think the very short timeframes would be more important to this question than the difference between 500 and 600 days. Is there a different way you'd recommend analyzing this?
