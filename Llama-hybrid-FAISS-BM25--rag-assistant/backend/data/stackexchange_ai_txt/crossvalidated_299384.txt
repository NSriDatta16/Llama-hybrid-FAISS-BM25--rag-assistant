What is going on here? This is a very generic question with the obvious answer to study in details Carlin & Chib (1995) . The essential idea is to consider the joint parameter $(m,\theta_1,\theta_2)$ where $m$ denotes the model index ($m=1,2$) and $\theta_1,\theta_2$ the parameters of both models, in the sense that the data comes from the density $$f(x|m,\theta_1,\theta_2)=f_m(x|\theta_m)$$ i.e. one of the two parameters $\theta_{3-m}$ is superfluous once the model index $m$ is set. Once this completion is done, a prior has to be chosen on the triplet $(m,\theta_1,\theta_2)$, which is $$\pi(m,\theta_1,\theta_2)=\pi(m)\pi_m(\theta_m)\tilde\pi_m(\theta_{3-m})$$ where I denote by $\pi(m)$ and $\pi_m(\theta_m)$ the true priors on the model index and on the parameter of each model. The additional $\tilde\pi_m(\theta_{3-m})$ is free because the posterior on $\theta_{3-m}$ is equal to the prior: $$\pi(m,\theta_1,\theta_2|x)=\pi(m|x)\pi_m(\theta_m|x)\tilde\pi_m(\theta_{3-m})$$ The data does not impact the parameter it does not depend of. And thus inference about $\theta_m$ is not impacted by the choice of $\tilde\pi_m(.)$. In practice, this means that the algorithm of simulating from the augmented model produces a frequency for each model approximating the posterior probability of this model a sequence of parameters $\theta_m$ when $m$ is the model index, to be used for inference on this parameter a sequence of parameters $\theta_{3-m}$ when $m$ is the model index, to be ignored. how do we square this with my intuition and Plummer's comment? What Martyn Plummer means in his comment is that the pseudo-prior does not matter on the parameter with the other index $m$ but must be the true prior on the parameter with the current index $3-m$. This is 100% coherent with Carlin & Chib (1995) paper . does this mean it's impermissible to pseudo-priors corresponding exactly to the true priors? Pseudo-priors can be taken as the true priors, provided these are proper. But as Carlin & Chib (1995) indicate, it is much more efficient to take an approximation of the true posterior, $\pi_{3-m}(\theta_{3-m}|x)$, approximation that can be obtained by a preliminary MCMC run for each model. What if the indicator variable turns on and off a part of the model with several parameters The resolution to this conundrum is to consider different sets of parameters for all different models, i.e., to have no common parameters between any two models. If you are in a variable selection problem, this means using a different parameter and a different notation for the coefficient of variable $X_1$ when $X_2$ is part of the regression and when $X_2$ is not part of the regression. From this point, use any pseudo-prior you want on the superfluous parameters. What does @Xi'an mean in the first comment I mean that if the probabilities of visits to the two models are not the probabilities in the prior, the posterior probability of one model estimated by the simulated frequency must be corrected.
