R is great for a lot of analysis. As mentioned about, there are newer adaptations for big data like MapR, RHadoop, and scalable versions of RStudio. However, if your concern is libraries, keep your eye on Spark. Spark was created for big data and is MUCH faster than Hadoop alone. It has vastly growing machine learning, SQL, streaming, and graph libraries. Thus allowing much if not all of the analysis to be done within the framework (with multiple language APIs, I prefer Scala) without having to shuffle between languages/tools.
