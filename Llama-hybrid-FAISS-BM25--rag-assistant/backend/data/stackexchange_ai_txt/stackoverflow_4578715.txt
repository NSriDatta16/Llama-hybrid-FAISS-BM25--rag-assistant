Get user input on their exact location

I have built a PHP website that helps its users to organize their events. An important part of the system is defining the event location, which will usually be the home location for the person creating the event. I am trying to create a way to allow a user to add 'places' to their profile by selecting those places on some sort of a map, or maybe take a textual string and show it on a map (how do I avoid people misspells?). Also important, the service should allow addresses from all over the world. Has anyone ever done something like this or has any solution?
