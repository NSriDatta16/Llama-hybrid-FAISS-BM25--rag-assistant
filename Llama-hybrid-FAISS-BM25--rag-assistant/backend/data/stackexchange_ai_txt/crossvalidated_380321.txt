Think about a hypothetical situation when a point null hypothesis is true but one keeps sampling until $p (this will always happen sooner or later, i.e. it will happen with probability 1) and then decides to stop the trial and reject the null. This is an admittedly extreme stopping rule but consider it for the sake of the argument. This moronic procedure will have 100% Type I error rate, but there is nothing wrong with it according to the Likelihood Principle. I'd say this does count as "really" mattering. You can of course choose any $\alpha$ in this argument. Bayesians can use a fixed cut-off on Bayes factor if they please. The same logic applies. The main lesson here is that you cannot adhere to LP and have an error rate guarantee. There is no free lunch.
