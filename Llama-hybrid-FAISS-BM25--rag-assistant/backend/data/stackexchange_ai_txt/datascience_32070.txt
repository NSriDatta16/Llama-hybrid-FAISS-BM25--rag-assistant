Classifying sequences of mouse clicks with different number of clicks per sequence

I have a series of sequences, each sequence contains multiple mouse click with the following features: [x coordinate on screen, y coordinate on screen, duration of click], and each sequence is labeled with 1 of four classes which represents the user that did the sequence of clicks. I need help determining the right model/approach for this problem. Here's what I've tried so far: 1. RNN with LSTM where I had to pad the sequences with zeros since they're not equal in length 2. Draw an image with points on the coordinates clicked, and color coding the points based on the duration of the click, generating an image for each sequence, then running the images through a CNN and classifying them depending on the points Both of these yield ~40% accuracy on submission. I need ideas/different approaches to the problem. Thank you in advance!
