The “jump menu” is a discredited navigational device from many years ago that should not be brought back. Auto-navigate-on-change menus are unsuitable for navigation because: keyboard users will be firing a change event every time they move the selection, making it impossible for them to use the control; non-JavaScript agents (including search engines) won't be able to see or follow the links; form values are retained over page back/forward navigations, making the select show the wrong value after a navigation, making it impossible to select the same option again; users can't use their browser's normal navigational tools like middle-click, ‘open in new tab’ or ‘bookmark link’. Therefore the ‘best’ way to make a jump menu is not to. If you want something that behaves similarly but doesn't have these disadvantages, go for a that's hidden and re-popped-up by JavaScript, containing plain links pointed at the pages they go to. You can style it to look like a dropdown if you really want, and you can make them open new windows when left-clicked if you must (I wish you wouldn't, though).
