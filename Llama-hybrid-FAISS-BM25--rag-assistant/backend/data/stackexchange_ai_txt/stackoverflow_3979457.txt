Error on installation on iPhone, iPod devices "Application exited abnormally with signal 11: Segmentation fault"

I tried to install my application on the devices by using Build and Run from xCode, the application works fine, but when I quit, in the springboard there's no icon for the application, I found the following log on the device's console (which I takes from the Organizer application) Wed Oct 20 17:05:48 iPod-01 com.apple.launchd[1] (UIKitApplication:com.company.app[0x4cbb][1689]) : (UIKitApplication:com.company.app[0x4cbb]) Bug: launchd_core_logic.c:3252 (24226):3 Wed Oct 20 17:05:48 iPod-01 com.apple.launchd[1] (UIKitApplication:com.company.app[0x4cbb][1689]) : (UIKitApplication:com.company.app[0x4cbb]) Bug: launchd_core_logic.c:2681 (24226):10 Wed Oct 20 17:05:48 iPod-01 com.apple.launchd[1] (UIKitApplication:com.company.app[0x4cbb][1689]) : (UIKitApplication:com.company.app[0x4cbb]) Working around 5020256.
