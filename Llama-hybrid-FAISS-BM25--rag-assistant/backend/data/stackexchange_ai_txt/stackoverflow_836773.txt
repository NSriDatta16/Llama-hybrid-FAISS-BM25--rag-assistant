How about this for thought: If it was an electronic signature, you would probably not be able/allowed to store it at all. You could store the signature+document (i.e. the crypto-signed hash of the initial document) and verify it with the public key, but to store a lot of client's private keys to be able to re-sign documents. Imagine some one breaking in to the database and stealing those private keys (gifs or RSA/DSA keys). That store would be very useful/profitable to a criminal organization. Do you want to expose yourself to that?
