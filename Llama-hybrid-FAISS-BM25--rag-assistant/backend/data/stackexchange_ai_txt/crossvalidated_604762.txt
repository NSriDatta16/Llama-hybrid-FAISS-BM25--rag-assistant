Deep Learning and human voice modification

I'm working on a pet project with my D&D friends. Let's say I have a dataset of orc voices (people talking like orcs, saying sentences in English but with intonations and phrasing of orcs), elf voices and dwarf voices. What kind of ML models should I use if I wanted to extract what makes a orc voice "orcish" and use those characteristics to modify my own voice (for instance, a sentence I record saying) to make it "orcish" ? The final product would me ("my_sentence.wav", 'orc') -> ML model -> ("my_sentence_with_orc_accent.wav") ? I still want to keep the phrasing of my voice, the intelligibility of the words, but blended with other characteristics to enhance it. Could you point me to model names or concepts so I can look into resources ?
