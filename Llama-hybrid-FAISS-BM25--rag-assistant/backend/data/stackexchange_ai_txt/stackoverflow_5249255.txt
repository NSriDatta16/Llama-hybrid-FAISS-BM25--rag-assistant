How to move the root controller into another controller

Suppose I have tested a navigation controller at the root level. - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { self.window.rootViewController = self.navController; //iOS4 } Now I want to move it into one tab inside a tab controller (in a larger app). I feel I should be able to do an equivalent to the above: self.rootViewController = self.navController; //pseudocode inside say - (void)viewDidLoad just dropping the code in. What in fact is the correct/elegant way to go about this? Often books refer to the root controller of a controller, and I'm wondering how to access it as I can the one of the window. (It's possible my understanding of this is misplaced of course).
