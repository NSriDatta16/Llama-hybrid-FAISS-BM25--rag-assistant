I'd recommend starting by looking at artificial neural nets where the units already take binary values. For example, check out Hopfield nets and the McCullochâ€“Pitts model (the original ANN). The Ising model may also be of interest. Although it was originally a model of ferromagnetism, it has connections to neural networks, and is of interest in neuroscience and physics. Although the units in these models take binary values, the connection strengths are continuous, so implementing them with digital logic would require something like replacing each unit with a local network of logic gates. This will only be an approximation because real numbers can't be truly represented using a finite sequence of discrete operations--almost all of them are uncomputable . Of course, this also applies to digital computers, which we use to approximate computational models (e.g. ANNs) involving real numbers.
