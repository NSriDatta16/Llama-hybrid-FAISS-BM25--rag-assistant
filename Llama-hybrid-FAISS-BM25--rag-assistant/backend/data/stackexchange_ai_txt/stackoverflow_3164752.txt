Draggable UI in jQuery

I am currently working on a project where I need to go for draggable elements. There will be list of options e.g. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday... Saturday. Here user will be selecting any of them, say Sunday, Wednesday, Saturday. I need to display them in such a way the user can realign them in any Order. E.g Sunday Saturday Wednesday or Sunday Wednesday Saturday And I need to get the display order in my Client/ Server side I have decided to provided asp checkboxs for the parent list. When user checks any of the option, I need to populate it in another UI which would later helps me to realign the selected options. I have gone through few samples of draggable jQuery UI but not sure which will suit my requirement. Can any one suggest the BEST?
