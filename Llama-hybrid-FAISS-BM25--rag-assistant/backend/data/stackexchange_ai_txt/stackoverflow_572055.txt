This pseudocode finds the average and covers the problem of overflow: double avg = 0 int count = 0 for x in array: count += 1 avg = avg * (count - 1) / count // readjust old average avg += x / count // add in new number After that, you can apply your rounding code. If there is no easy way to round in your language, then something like this will work (rounds up when over .5): int temp = avg - int(avg) // finds decimal portion if temp
