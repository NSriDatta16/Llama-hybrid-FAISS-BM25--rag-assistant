This post talks about the purity of the two. But as far as converting them from one to the other, I have used extension methods in the past. So before the POCO is being sent over the wire, I have something like this. accountPoco.toDTO() which converts it into a WCF datacontract obj, serialized and sent across the wire. On the other side I have accountDto.toPOCO() Which converts it back into POCO. It's not the most elegant, but it works.
