Categorical white noise

Categorical time series such the genomic DNA, the sleep state of a person $\cdots$ etc, are often treated and analyzed. The first question that came to my head was how can such type of series be a white noise? is there a definition for categorical white noise (I haven't found any definition). Edit: $X_{t}$, for $t = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2 ,\cdots$ , is a categorical-valued time series with finite state-space $\mathbb{C}= \{c_{1}, c_{2},\cdots, c_{k}\}$ and $p_{j} = pr (X_{t} = c_{j}) >0$ As an example, here's the categorical time series that represent EEG sleep stat of an infant.
