An official answer by an Apple rep is on the Apple Dev Forums (login required): There's no supported way to get at the ambient light sensor. If you'd like to see such support added in the future, I encourage you to file a bug describing your requirements. While we may have seen similar requests many times before, a fresh bug report will allow you to express your needs in your own terms, and allow iOS engineering to gauge the level of demand. http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter
