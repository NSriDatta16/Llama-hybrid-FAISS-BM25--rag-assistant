You can use void QSettings::setPath ( Format format, Scope scope, const QString & path ) to set the format (as specified in the doc ) QSettings::NativeFormat 0 Store the settings using the most appropriate storage format for the platform. On Windows, this means the system registry; on Mac OS X, this means the CFPreferences API; on Unix, this means textual configuration files in INI format. QSettings::IniFormat 1 Store the settings in INI files. QSettings::InvalidFormat the scope: QSettings::UserScope 0 Store settings in a location specific to the current user (e.g., in the user's home directory). QSettings::SystemScope 1 Store settings in a global location, so that all users on the same machine access the same set of settings. So if you are on Windows and want to write User-specific settings, you would use the IniFormat and the UserScope values and specify the path where you want to write your settings in the path variable. Hope this helps.
