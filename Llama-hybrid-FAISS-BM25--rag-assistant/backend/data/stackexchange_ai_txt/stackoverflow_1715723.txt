No-code or little-code website

What is a (free) technology which requires the least amount of code for creating a website with the following requirements: Sign-up/login Form for adding your personal info. which gets databased Each person can view and edit their own info Admin can view and edit any The form needs to be easily customizable and extensible (by the website's owner, not during run-time) Is there a beginner tutorial for such a thing? (For me, this question is about a friend who wants me to do this, but I want him to do it himself so I don't have to get roped into maintenance. I also want to keep it more general for the sake of Stack Overflow and future readers.) Edit : I thought I remembered some ASP.NET tutorials that were mostly drag/drop or things where it was all but made for you from the database schema (which can be made with SSMS's GUI) but I can't seem to find them now. Responding to posts below requesting specifics: this site will be for potential clients to sign-up and enter their company's info and fill out a form about their advertising needs. I thought about putting this on SU instead, but since there was likely going to be some coding involved (I assumed no-code was an unreachable goal) SO seemed more appropriate.
