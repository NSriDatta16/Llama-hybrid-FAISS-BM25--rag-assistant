I think that your way with enumerate is pretty good actually. Enumerate is able to keep track of the modifications because it creates a generator that uses an iterator of the array you input. The problem I see is if you change your array to be: s = ['foo', 'bar', 'wtf', 'foo', 'bar', 'wtf', 'foo'] then the last 'foo' that doesn't have a 'bar' will give you an exception when your code tries to look at the item beyond the end of the array. I'm not sure how to fix this yet because my attempts haven't been successful. Edit: It may not be very elegant, but this code for the collapse() function will work even on the above case: def collapse(): i = 1 L = len(s) while i
