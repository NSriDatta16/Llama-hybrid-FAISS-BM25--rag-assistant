Questions about approximate inference and calculating the posterior predictive

As I understand, computing the exact posterior of parameters $p(\theta|x)$ is nearly always impossible since we need to compute the evidence $\sum_\theta p(x|\theta)p(\theta)$ with every possible combination of values that $\theta$ and $x$ can take which is lots of summation operations. So we try to find an approximation to $p(\theta|x)$ by variational or sampling methods. I have a few questions regarding these. Some of them might be not so clear or silly since I am confused. 1) In order to do sampling we need to calculate $p(x|\theta)p(\theta)$ for a specific value of $x$ and $\theta$ , which gives us an unnormalized scalar value, and we know the exact shapes of $p(x|\theta)$ and $p(\theta)$ distributions separately. Right? 2) Is it possible that we also do not know or cannot compute the likelihood and prior? Can Approximate Bayesian Computation or other likelihood-free inference methods be used for this? 3) In rejection sampling the proposal density has to cover the posterior, right? How can we know if it does or not? We don't know the exact shape since we don't know the normalization term. 4) In MCMC this is not a problem since the normalization terms cancel when dividing two posterior values (which are scalar). Therefore just evaluating $p(x|\theta)p(\theta)$ is enough though we don't know the exact shape of the whole distribution. Is this correct? 5) If we sample the posterior, then we have $n$ samples $\theta_1, ..., \theta_n$ . But we still don't have the distribution $p(\theta|x)$ , so how can we find this? 6) For new data points we need to compute the posterior predictive $p(x_{new}|D)=\int p(x_{new}|\theta,D)p(\theta|D)d\theta$ where $D=\lbrace x_1,x_2,...,x_m \rbrace$ is the training set. How can we do this using the posterior samples? Do we again need sampling to calculate this integration? 7) What does computing and evaluating a distribution mean? What is the difference?
