I agree with you that you should not hard code this or use constants. There are a few good options depending on yours needs: Java Properties Files - If you just have a few key-value pairs to store, these are the simplest way and easy to use. XML Storage - If you are looking for persistence and are looking at XML for storage, I would recommend looking at JAXB . It is part of Java 6 and will make your life easier than trying to use the DOM. Database Persistence - If you have more data that is changing often, you could also look at storing it in a database. JPA is a great standard library for doing this. That is probably overkill for what you are looking for though. Bottom line is hard coding is a thing of the past. There are lots of great ways to get data in quickly and easily without resorting to hard coding everything.
