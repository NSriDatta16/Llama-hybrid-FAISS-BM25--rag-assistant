I will give one method to find an approximate solution. First, let $X_i$ be the random variable, "result of throw $i$ with the dice" and let $N$ be the number of throws necessary to reach a sum at least $k$ . Then we have that $$ P(N \ge n) = P(X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n \le k) $$ so to find the distribution of $N$ we need to find the convolutions of the distributions of the $X_i$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n$ , for all $n$ . Those convolutions can be found numerically, but for large $n$ it might be much work, so we try instead to approximate the cumulative distribution function for the convolutions, using saddlepoint methods. For another example of saddlepoint methods, see my answer to Generic sum of Gamma random variables We will use the Lugannini-Rice approximation for the discrete case, and follows R Butler: "Saddlepoint Approximations with Applications", page 18 (second continuity correction). First, we need the moment generating function of the $X_i$ , which is $$ M(T) = E e^{tX_i}= \frac16 (e^t+e^{2t}+e^{3t}+e^{4t}+e^{5t}+e^{6t}) $$ Then the cumulant generating function for the sum of $n$ independent dice becomes $$K_n(t)=n \cdot log(\frac16\sum_{i=1}^6 e^{it}) $$ and we also need the first few derivatives of $K$ , but we will find those symbolically using R. The code is the following: DD = 1") if(order == 1) D(expr, name) else DD(D(expr, name), name, order - 1) } make_cumgenfun Next, we must solve the saddlepoint equation. That is done by the following code: funlist Note that the above code is not very robust, for values of $k$ far in either tail of the distribution it will not work. Then some code for actually calculating the tail probability function, approximately, by the Luganini-Rice approximation, following Butler, page 18, (second continuity correction): Function for returning the tail probability: # Ghelp Then let us try to use this to calculate a table of the distribution, based on the formula $$ P(N \ge n) = P(X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n \le k) \\ = 1-P(X_1+\dots+X_n \ge k+1) \\ = 1-G(n,k+1) $$ where $G$ is the function fron the R code above. Now, let us answer the original question with $K=20$ . Then the minimum number of rolls is 4 and the maximum number of rolls is 20. The probability that 20 rolls is needed is very small, and can be calculated exactly from the binomial formula, I leave that to the reader. (the approximation above will not work for $n=20$ ). So the probability that $N \ge 19$ is approximated by > 1-G(20, 21) [1] 2.220446e-16 The probability that $N\ge 10$ is approximated by: > 1-G(10, 21) [1] 0.002880649 And so on. Using all this, you can get an approximation for the expectation yourself. This should be much better than the approximations based on the central limit theorem.
