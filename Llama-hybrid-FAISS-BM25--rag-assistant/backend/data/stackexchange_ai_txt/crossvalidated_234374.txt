It becomes arbitrary because you can't rank the eigenvalues: they are all equal. It becomes obvious thinking about the eigendecomposition formulation instead of SVD. PCA in this scenario makes no sense though: the variables are already principal components. If you apply PCA on this data the PCs will correspond to the original variables, with possible changes in sign introduced by the method.
