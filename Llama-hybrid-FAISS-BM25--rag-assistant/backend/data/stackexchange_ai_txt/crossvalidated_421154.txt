I can't quite make sense of your question. For one thing it seems that the geo data would provide prior information and information from your website would 'update' that. I have tried to put your ideas into the framework of a typical application of elementary Bayesian inference. Suppose that City A has a football team and several nearby cities also have football teams. Your prior information (from geo statistics) is that about 40% of football fans in City A with favor the local 'A-team'. In Bayesian statistics the probability $\theta$ of preferring the A-team is provided as a probability distribution, often a beta distribution because beta distributions have $(0,1)$ as their support. Perhaps you choose as your PRIOR distribution $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(4,6)$ which has $E(\theta) = \frac{12}{12+18} = 0.4$ and puts over 70% of its probability in the interval $(.4,.6)$ and about 95% of its probability in $(0.234, .0577),$ according to computations in R: diff(pbeta(c(.3,.5), 12, 18)) [1] 0.7381535 qbeta(c(.025, .975), 12, 18) [1] 0.2352402 0.5773954 Then from your website you find that $x = 1283$ of $n = 2500$ visitors to the site from City A, show interest in the A-team. That information based on data is represented in terms of a LIKELIHOOD function. Bayes' Theorem in this setting is expressed as: $$\text{POSTERIOR} \propto \text{PRIOR} \times \text{LIKELIHOOD},$$ where the symbol $\propto$ (read 'proportional to') indicates that we are using 'kernels' of density functions, omitting their norming constants. In particular, your posterior distribution is $$p(\theta|x) = p(\theta) \times p(x|\theta)\\ \propto \theta^{12-1}(1-\theta)^{18-1} \times \theta^{1283}(1-\theta)^{2500-1283}\\ \propto \theta^{1295-1}(1-\theta)^{1235-1},$$ where we recognize the final expression as the kernel of the posterior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(1295, 1235).$ Thus, the posterior mean is $E(\theta|x) = \frac{1295}{1295+1235} = 0.512$ and the 95% Bayesian posterior probability interval is $(0.492, 0.531)$ qbeta(c(.025, .975), 1295, 1235) [1] 0.4923767 0.5313210 Thus your prior information that $\theta$ is roughly $0.4$ has been updated by website data to show that $\theta$ is very nearly $0.51.$
