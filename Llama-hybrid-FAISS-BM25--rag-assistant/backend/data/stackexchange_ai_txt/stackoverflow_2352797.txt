looking for php game engine/framework

I'm looking for php game engine/framework. Free or cheap, preferably open source (but it's not requirement). If there's nothing like this available I'd be fine with modifying some open source game... I like Legend of the Green Dragon a lot (simple but enjoyable gameplay :) but it's use terms are very limited - they don't give you permissions to place ads in your game, change donations button to something else than paypal, etc...
