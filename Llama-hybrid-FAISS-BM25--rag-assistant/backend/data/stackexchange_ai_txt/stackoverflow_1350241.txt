I have single big table in Ms access 2k database and I need a way to copy this table and then populate my two already ready tables on SQL server . How big is "big"? SQL Server should be able to handle any single table you would ever store in Access. I don't think a terabyte of data would be unfeasible. You could use Microsoft SSIS . Or just dump a .csv representation of the Access database and import it into SQL Server. Or upsize Access to SQL Server. Your question is confusing to me. Are the two "already ready" tables in addition to this one big table, with other data to be stored in them? I certainly hope that they don't have the identical layout as the "big" table in Access (violating first normal form) and encourage you to divide the data from Access between them, thinking that it's an improvement of some kind.
