PHP Regex Help for parsing String

I have a string such as the following: Are you looking for a quality real estate company? Josh's real estate firm specializes in helping people find homes from [city][State]. Josh's real estate company is a boutique real estate firm serving clients locally. In [city][state] I am sure you know how difficult it is to find a great home, but we work closely with you to give you exactly what you need I would like to have this paragraph split into an array based on the tags, so I have the following array as the result: [0] Are you looking for a quality real estate company? [1] Josh's real estate firm specializes in helping people find homes from [city][State]. [2] Josh's real estate company is a boutique real estate firm serving clients locally. [3] In [city][state] I am sure you know how difficult it is to find a great home, but we work closely with you to give you exactly what you need This is a regex i'm currently using: $matches = array(); preg_match_all(": (.*?) :is", $string, $matches); $result = $matches[1]; print_r($result); But this one only returns an array containing the text found between tags, it ignores the text found before and after these tags. (In the example above it would only return the array elements 1 and 2. Any ideas?
