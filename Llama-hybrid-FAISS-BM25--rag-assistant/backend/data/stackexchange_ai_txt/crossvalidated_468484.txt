They're unrelated. So-called multimodal machine learning operates on multiple input modalities . That is, input signals of different types (e.g. auditory and visual input). Multimodal distributions have probability density/mass functions with multiple modes (i.e. peaks). The existence of multiple input modalities doesn't imply anything about multiple modes in the input distribution, or any other distribution.
