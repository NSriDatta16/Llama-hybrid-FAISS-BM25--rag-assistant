Handle OSX Dock Drag N Drop

I looked high and low for information on how to handle drag n drop to the dock in OSX. The drag n drop documentation ( http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/DragandDrop.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000069 ) I found all deal with dragging from view to view. If anyone can point me to some code samples, that would be excellent. I'm writing my app using the PyObjC bride, but Cocoa examples would be equally welcome :-)
