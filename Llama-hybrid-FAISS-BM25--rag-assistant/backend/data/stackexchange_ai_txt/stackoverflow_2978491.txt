youtube javascript api doesn't trigger callback

I'm trying to work with youtube's javascript api and am having a problem initializing it/getting a callback when it's ready. Api documentation can be found here . I'm getting the videos from the json provided by youtube and embedding them like this: //insert flash object in video element $(video_elm_arr[i]).append(' ' + ' ' + ' ' + ' ' + ' ' + ' '); Note that I'm adding 'enablejsapi=1' to the url which should enable the javascript api. However, when I listen for the callback that the api is ready, ie: //set player functionality when javascript api is available function onYouTubePlayerReady(playerId) { alert('api is ready!'); } it never gets triggered. Everything else on the page (including the youtube videos) loads correctly, and even the other parameter I pass in the videos url (showinfo=0) works properly. What gives? Anyone see my error? All help is greatly appreciated...
