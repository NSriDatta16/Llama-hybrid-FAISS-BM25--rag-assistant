Ned has already mentioned his excellent coverage.py module. If the problem you're having is something nose specific, you might want to consider using another test runner. I've used py.test along with the pytest_coverage plugin that lets you generate coverage statistics. It also has a pytest_nose plugin to help you migrate. However, I don't understand exactly what the problem you're facing is. Can you elaborate a little on the "distribute / setuptools' namespace package feature" you mentioned? I'm curious to know what the problem is.
