Cross-Validation on a Multinomial Logistic Regression

I am coding in R, and I would like to verify that my multinomial logistic regression model is not overfit and to assess the performance of my model. The data that I am using is categorical and has many different variables (ie, age, cell count), but I selected only the ones I felt would be most relevant to the model. I know that cross-validation is among the most optimal ways to accomplish this, but I am very new to this process. I poked around online for some examples, but a large portion of the resources I came across only explained cross-validation for models that used two variables. I did, however, learn that k-fold cross is a standard of cross validation--would it be applicable to a multinomial logistic regression model? What other methods are recommended? Here are the lines of code that I have attempted: k.folds I received this: [1] 0.7128463 0.7187894 0.7153652 0.7141058 0.7229219 as my result. I assume this is the confusion matrix that was created. Is there a way that I can better visualize these results, like plotting a graph? If so, what functions/lines of code should I use? I have also tried repeated k-fold cross validation: set.seed(500) v Both of these are examples I found off of the internet. However, I received a large response from the repeated k-fold cross validation (as in thousands of results generated). Is that normal? And same question as above--how can I better visualize the results for the model? Are there any other ways to cross validate this multinomial logistic regression model? After I finish this process, I need to cross validate a boosting, random forest, decision tree, and many other models. Any suggestions on how to approach the rest of these as well? Thank you for taking the time to help out a newbie. I know I asked a lot of questions, so if anything is unclear please tell me so.
