Like Pedro mentioned, you can fuse together the chained calls to Enumerable#select and Enumerable#map , avoiding a traversal over the selected elements. This is true because Enumerable#select is a specialization of fold or inject . I posted a hasty introduction to the topic at the Ruby subreddit. Manually fusing Array transformations can be tedious, so maybe someone could play with Robert Gamble's comprehend implementation to make this select / map pattern prettier.
