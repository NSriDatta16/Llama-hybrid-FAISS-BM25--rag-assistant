How do I set up my Linux X terminal so that Emacs has access to 256 colors?

When I run emacs -nw in an X terminal window, and I ask for M-x list-colors-display , I am offered a paltry palette: black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white I am told it is possible to get 265 colors. Setting the TERM environment variable to xterm-256color does not do the job. What does?
