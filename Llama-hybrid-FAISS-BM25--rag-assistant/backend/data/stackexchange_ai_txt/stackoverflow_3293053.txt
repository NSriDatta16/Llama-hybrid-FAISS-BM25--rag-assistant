How to perform equivalent of AppleScript "copy" command from Scripting Bridge?

Is there a way to do a remote copy within a container from Scripting Bridge? In AppleScript, this looks like "copy [element] of [container] to [location in container]". For example, in the context of a tell to a TextEdit document, you can "copy first paragraph of its text to end of its text" to copy the first paragraph to the end of the document while preserving all formatting. Is there any way to do with from Objective-C using Scripting Bridge? I tried something like this: SBObject* foo = [container objectAtIndex: 0]; [container addObject: foo]; And got a message "can't add an object that already exists." on the console; it appears that addObject and the various replace* methods only work when you're building a new SBObject instance and inserting it.
