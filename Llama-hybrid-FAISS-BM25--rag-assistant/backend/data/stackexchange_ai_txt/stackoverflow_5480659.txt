Measuring the time taken when shaking device

I am developing an application that measures the total time of a shake event. In other words, the timer starts when the shake event is started, and the timer stops when the shake event ends. So my question is, if we hold two iTouches in a single hand and then shake both at the same time, will the shake event generate the same value on both iTouches? This is my code: -(void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { timer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.00025 target:self selector:@selector(showactivity) userInfo:nil repeats:YES]; } } -(void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { [timer invalidate]; } }
