Have a look at where you use the code and how you use it. I find that the inheritance always lends itself when you have distinct objects that have a good opportunity for polymorphism. Think a logging solution, the way to log log(string info) should be inherited to an object that is distinct in what its doing, such as logging to disk, log to network, screen etc.) I've found a code smell is upcasting, when you have to go back to the real class to do something. If you are doing that then you probably haven't used it appropriately. Inheritance is just a tool, don't use it because you can, use it because it will help you write clearer code that runs more efficiently.
