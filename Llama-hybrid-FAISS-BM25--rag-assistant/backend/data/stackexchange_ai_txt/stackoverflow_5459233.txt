One famous example of ambiguity in multiple inheritance is the so-called Diamond Problem. Summary: "In object-oriented programming languages with multiple inheritance and knowledge organization, the diamond problem is an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If a method in D calls a method defined in A (and does not override the method), and B and C have overridden that method differently, then from which class does it inherit: B, or C?" You can find details here: Wikipedia: Diamond Problem
