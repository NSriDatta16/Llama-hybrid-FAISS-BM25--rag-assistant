In data science, accuracy is a measurement used to determine which model is best at describing the underlying patterns of a dataset. It is defined as: Accuracy = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions In binary classification we can further define it in terms of positives and negatives: Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
