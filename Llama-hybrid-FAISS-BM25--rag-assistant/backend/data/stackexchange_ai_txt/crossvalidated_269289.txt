I completely agree with David Kozak's answer, but I would like to bring some additional points: 11 inputs is not too high for Gaussian process regression (GPR)/Kriging. I have already dealt with problems with a dozen of variables with success using GPR 121 observations is indeed quite small, and the second concern about the training dataset is that it has been created with an Orthogonal Array (OA). While they are fell suited for linear regression, they are not for GPR. GPR with stationary kernels (the most common and simple ones) use the distances between points of the training set and need as much diversity in these distances, but OA have only few distances compared to a random design of the same size. When using GPR, it is better use rather Latin Hypercube sampling or random design. But I guess that you cannot change your design of experiment... As Kriging may give disappointing results, I would advise you to test more simple methods as linear regression, GAM ... Random Forests (or more simply a decision tree) might give interesting results too.
