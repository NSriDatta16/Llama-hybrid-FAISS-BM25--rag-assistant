As Joannes mentioned, it's unclear whether you are looking to browse SQL Azure or Azure Table Storage. If it's SQL Azure you're asking about, then it's an easy answer: Yes. Simply go to your SQL Azure account online and grab the server name (.database.windows.net), and use that from SQL Server Management Studio when connecting to your database. Specify your admin username and password, and you're off and running. If you're talking about viewing Azure Table storage, there are a few tools floating around. The most current seems to be the Azure Storage Explorer on CodePlex. It'll let you view all of your Azure tables, and edit text blobs.
