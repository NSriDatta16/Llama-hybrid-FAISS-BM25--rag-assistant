Time Series Clustering

The thing that I am trying to do is the time series shapes classification. Basically the problem is as following: Let's say I have some time series and my goal is to have an algorithm that "finds" the similar shapes in the data, that occur throughout the dataset and labels it accordingly (a, b, c...etc.)...The image might be worth than 1000 words, so I have attached the workflow that I have in mind It would be great if anyone directs me to the algorithms/papers/codes that deal with this kind of problems
