The different outcomes are (probably) a result from initializing your Random Forest with a different seed. Normally the outcomes should not differ that much, if they do, try to increase the number of trees of your forest. Another possibility is to take the average of the various outcomes, which will allow you to make a proper estimation of the outcome and to generate a confidence along with your prediction scores.
