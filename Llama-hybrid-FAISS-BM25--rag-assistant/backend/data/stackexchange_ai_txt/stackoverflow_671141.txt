When the cluster is first set up, you must specify a user account that is a member of the domain. This is the cluster service account. It is a Windows account, meaning it is a Windows login (Windows user login, specifically) as far as SQL Server is concerned. This Windows account has to be a member of the local Administrators group for the operating system on every server that makes up the cluster. And prior to SQL Server 2008, the Administrators group was automatically added to SQL Server and granted sysadmin level rights, meaning when you installed SQL Server, you didn't have to worry about it. With respect to SQL Server service accounts, and this include SQL Server Agent, SQL Server Full Text (if on 2005/2008), they need to be Windows accounts from the domain, too. The reason is that the operating system actually starts those services using those accounts and they need to be able to run on every server of the cluster where SQL Server is configured to potentially run. If you don't change these from when you set up SQL Server, then the installation will ensure that these accounts have the correct permissions within SQL Server as well.
