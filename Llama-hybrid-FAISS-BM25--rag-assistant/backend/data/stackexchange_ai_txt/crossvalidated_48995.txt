Correlation based on binary events

I have a system with 5 components. Every 10 seconds the signal travels to all of them and I know how many of them responded. I need to know there there is a correlation in response. So, my time series data looks something like: A B C D E ----------------------- 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 ............ there are about 10,000 rows Can I use a simple correlation function to see if there is correlation between occurrences of the above 5. Or is there a better way for this?
