In the absence of any answers so far, I have researched this question a bit. And, what I understand at this stage is that DLMs do have certain vulnerabilities. The first that comes to mind is overfitting. By capturing every abrupt up and down turn of the time series, they can generate regression coefficients that are not representative in a Hold Out sample or in forecasting. Another issue is that DLMs can be unstable. Depending on how DLMs underlying parameters are specified (somewhat of an arbitrary or judgment process), you can get very different results. Thus, DLMs are unstable. DLMs seem unsuited for medium- or long-term forecasting in part because of the mentioned vulnerabilities. They also seem questionable as a testing tool for regression coefficient stability. Robust Regressions are a superior tool earmarked for doing so.
