If you have to leave the app running and it gets deadlocked at the wrong time of day, you might get some benefit from JCarder , which is an agent you tell Java to use. When the program has finished running, it outputs various diagnostic files which can then be converted into a graph to show the deadlock(s). Also, run your code through things like Findbugs , which may point out a subtle deadlock scenario that you otherwise haven't noticed.
