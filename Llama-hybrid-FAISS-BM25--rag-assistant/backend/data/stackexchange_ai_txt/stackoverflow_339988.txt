Setting the folder search paths in the Visual Studio settings to fix an include issue is generally not really a good idea from a design point of view. Your code will be less portable to different machines with different directory lay-outs. My suggestion would be to settle on an organisation of your code so that the relative paths of the sub-directories (relative to your including code) are fixed: Add the "base folder" to the project ( project properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories, "additional include directories" ) Add the subdirectories to the #include statements , i.e. #include "subdirectory/somefile.h" . This has the added bonus of being able to see which folder in your Solution contains the file - that is often useful information when you're trying to find your way around or trying to figure out what a file is for.
