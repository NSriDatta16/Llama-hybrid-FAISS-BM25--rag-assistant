Troubles after installing Two stores with same php docroot

I am trying to setup multiple stores within same hosting account and I studied many interesting guides out there on the matter. Seems to me I figured out simplest solution for me - map both my dot com sites onto the same directory on host, and modify .htaccess to launch different website depending on URL, like so: SetEnvIf Host .*anatscraftonia.* MAGE_RUN_CODE="anatscraftonia"; SetEnvIf Host .*anatscraftonia.* MAGE_RUN_TYPE="website"; My first store works fine, but when I go to anatscraftonia.com , all I get always is a Magento 404 page. I checked all settings, multiple stores are defined and code above is copy/paste from Admin console under Website I added. I have Home page enabled for All Stores and Base URL redefined for both Secure/Unsecure. I also tried changing website to store, with no improvements. What else am I missing? How do I even know what page is it trying to go to, or whether it even gets “no-route” or just totally whacked…
