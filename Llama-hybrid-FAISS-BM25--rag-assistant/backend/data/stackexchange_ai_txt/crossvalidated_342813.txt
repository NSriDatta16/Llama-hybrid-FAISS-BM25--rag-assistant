What is the best way to categorize/code political affiliation? Can I make it an ordinal variable?

I have coded 'Political Leftness' as the variable and coded: 0=Right 1=Center 2=Left But I am not sure that this works or if there is a glaring error in coding it as ordinal data. Is there a better way to code political affiliation as scale data? I want to run a Binary Logistic Regression if possible so I am trying to avoid nominal categories.
