Although I would recommend you use Mutex and investigate whether or not the issue is your code itself, one very complex highly fragile alternative might be to use "lock files". Basically, you create a temporary file in the file system with a name that both processes recognize. If the file exists, the lock is in place; the other process should release any other locks, wait, and attempt to re-acquire. If the file does not exist, the lock is not in place; the process should create the file to complete the lock and continue processing, deleting the file when releasing the lock. As I said, it's very complex and fragile, but it doesn't use Mutex. Alternatively, use Mutex.
