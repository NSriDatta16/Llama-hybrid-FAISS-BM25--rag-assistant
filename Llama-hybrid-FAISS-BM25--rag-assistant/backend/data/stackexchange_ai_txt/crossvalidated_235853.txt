How to interpret interaction with continuous and categorical variables in logistic regression

I've trying to understand the meaning of the significant and negative interaction between a categorical and a continuous variable in the model I attach here. This model was the best model obtained after AIC model selection (weight=1). The response variable MPO refers to the use of the microhabitat fern by individuals, that is: MPO=0 when fern was not used and MPO=1 when it was used. The explanatory variables are treatment (categorical: RC and NT) and SVL (size of individuals, continuous). Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: MPO ~ TREAT * SVL + (1 | GRID/ID) Data: arbino5 Control: glmerControl(optimizer = "optimx", optCtrl = list(method = "nlminb")) AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 1764.4 1804.3 -876.2 1752.4 5682 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7812 -0.0469 -0.0304 -0.0249 6.8455 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ID:GRID (Intercept) 15.56 3.945 GRID (Intercept) 0.00 0.000 Number of obs: 5688, groups: ID:GRID, 2219; GRID, 4 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -11.68453 1.15979 -10.075 I cant fully understand what this interaction means, specially considering that the main effects have positive estimates. I tried using interaction.plot(arbino5$SVL, arbino5$TREAT, arbino5$MPO, type ="p") to graph this interaction but it wasn't helpful as SVL has tons of points. Could anyone help me with this? Thanks so much
