Your object design is good. However, I suggest using single table inheritance (as mentioned by Adam) and steer clear away from EAV. If your RDBMS supports XML types and you're worried about storage of all the NULLable fields, put all the optional data in a single XML column. Schema validation will then ensure that you don't try to store a processor type with a pair of shoes, etc. Adding extra fields per product type is then as simple as updating the schema for that particular product.
