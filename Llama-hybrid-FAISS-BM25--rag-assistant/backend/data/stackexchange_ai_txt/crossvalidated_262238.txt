Number of inputs much greater than size of training (Neural Networks)

I'm working with neural networks. I have a number of inputs to the network which is far greater than the number of training instances ($\sim 7k$ inputs vs $700$ samples, $1$ order of magnitude, number of outputs $2k$). My question, as a newcomer to neural nets, is this: Should I diminish the size of the input layer (maybe through an autoencoder) ? Dimensional reduction was suggested to me, but I didn't really understand why.
