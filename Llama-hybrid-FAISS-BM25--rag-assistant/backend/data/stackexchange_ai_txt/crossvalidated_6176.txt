Introduction to measure theory

I'm interested in learning more about nonparametric Bayesian (and related) techniques. My background is in computer science and though I have never taken a course on measure theory or probability theory, I have had a limited amount of formal training in probability and statistics. Can anyone recommend a readable introduction to these concepts to get me started?
