You can't tell if this will be fast enough to meet your goals without measuring. Do it the simplest way possible (wrap the existing C++ code inside a DLL) and see if it meets your performance goals. I'm guessing it probably will. Calling native code from managed does have some overhead per each method call - if your program is heavily compute bound and will be calling the native methods many times per record, you may see a slow-down due to the interop. If your code calls the native code once to process all 40k records in bulk, the cost of doing interop will be greatly dwarfed by the actual time spent processing the records. If the records are coming from a slower storage media, such as over the network, your processing time will probably be negligible compared to the I/O time.
