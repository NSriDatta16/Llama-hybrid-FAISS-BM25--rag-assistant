Using Lazurus' answer, I have come up with the following solution. I like his approach, but for simplicity's sake, I am using this to get started and I think it is the best (for now) to help other's understand it. Any better answers are welcome, as well as criticisms about this code since I know it is not very elegant at all. public FileContentResult ShowImage(long ID) { return File( _db.Vehicles.First(m => m.ID == ID).Picture, MediaTypeNames.Image.Jpeg); }
