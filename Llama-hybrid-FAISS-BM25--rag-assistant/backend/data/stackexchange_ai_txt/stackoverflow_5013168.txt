Compression/Decompression for DataSet or any .Net Object

I'm developing a WPF App, in which I want to encrypt and compress heavy DataSet or Objects ( I want efficient Compression Class (would like to stick to .Net compression classes). Takes less time to compress and decompress. compress ratio high while data retrieval should be 100%. Can anyone suggest me about the compression classes (DeflateStream/GzipStream). Thanks VJ
