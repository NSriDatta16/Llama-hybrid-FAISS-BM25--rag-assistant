Okay, so maybe it is insane to disable the power button. But we have a software application the uses a database and uses an expensive set of licenses. This large German vendor uses a license manager that moves the licenses physically around the drive. Defragging, certain anti-virus applications, and cutting the power corrupts the licenses. We have a UPS to allow elegant shutdowns if the machine power is cut. Now it seems some service guy or operator has powered down the PC with the power button corrupting the licenses. These devices are located in remote location all over the world and training the operator may not always prevent this. It seems like the solution options are 1) Work with the vendor to disable the power button, 2) attempt to trap it and warn the user of possible doom, or 3) redesign the display using an OS and application immune from this power removal.
