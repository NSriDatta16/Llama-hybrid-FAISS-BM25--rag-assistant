Multi-collinearity

I have a binary response variable (presence/absence) and four independent variables (min.temp, max.temp, precipitation and elevation. My scatter matrix is showing collinearity between 3 of the variables with cor.efficients of 0.73, 0.74, 0.84. ELevation however doesn't seem correlated with the rest. I therefore thought it was best to run binary logistic regression on each variable seperately with elevation? However, when I checked the vif Score of the model when all were included it was only showing min.temp as high (9.13) and max temp (4.7) so it appeared I could include all but min.temp....I'm confused.
