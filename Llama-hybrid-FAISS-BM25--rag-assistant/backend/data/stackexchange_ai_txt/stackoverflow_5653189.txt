How to identify type of draggable item?

I need to drop an object dragged from a third party application to a wxpython application. I know the content of the object is basically a string but I dont know how to specify the type so that the drop is accepted by the wxpython application. By "type", I refer to this documentation: http://wiki.wxpython.org/DragAndDrop If you are not using a built-in data type, choose a type specifier (a unique string used to identify the datatype). Only targets whose type specifiers include one of the current data source specifiers will be eligible for drops . An example of type specifier is 'text/x-moz-message' for thuderbird data. How to find the type specifier of an unknown object or how to force the wxpython application to accept any drop?
