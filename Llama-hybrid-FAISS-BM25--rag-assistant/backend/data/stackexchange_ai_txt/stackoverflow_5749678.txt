taking top fifty items in sorted vector into another vector (clojure)

EDITED because question is about same program. I'm trying to take the top fifty items in the first vector and write them to the topfifty variable, to return to use elsewhere. "gets the closest 50 locations in the file fName and writes them out by sending a function to the agent" [fName] (let [sorted (sort-by sortFn (makeStructs fName)) topFifty ;TODO take the top 50 from sorted ] How exactly do I do this in clojure? I'm new to the language and have never used lisp. I'd rather not use a for loop as that is not exactly functional-ish.
