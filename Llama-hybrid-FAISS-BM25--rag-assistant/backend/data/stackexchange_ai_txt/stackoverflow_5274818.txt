Edit 2: Since you clarified your question I can give a more specific answer. You want one index with the six columns included. I'm still a bit confused regarding the datetime column. You say that the six columns define unique entries. If they are unique for the whole table you need the datetime value neither in the index nor in the query. If they are unique only for a given date, you need to include it in both the index (total of seven columns) and the query. The six/seven-column index is probably not feasible as a clustered index (especially if you want to create other indexes as well), so if you don't have a clustered index already, create one, preferably on an auto-id-column. A clustered index should be as small as possible, unique and always rising, because it affects the way in which the table and the other indexes are stored. The six/seven-column index should be marked as unique and not contain any additional columns. If possible, the columns should be ordered in a way that the index produces rising values on each insert, because that will limit or in the best case eliminate fragmentation, thus increasing I/O performance. Based on your description this is the best advice I can give you.
