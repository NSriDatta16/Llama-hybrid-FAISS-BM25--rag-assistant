I found this to be annoying too. I remember searching for a tool to make the sorting for me, but didn't find anything to help. Finally I decided to use the brute force approach: If you will list all your libs twice, e.g. -lA -lB -lA -lB , it will guarantee that every library is listed before (and after) every other library. So given a $(LIST) of libraries, you can use $(addprefix -l,$(LIST) $(LIST)) . Not very elegant, and slows the linking stage somewhat, but works.
