Why doesn't my sticky footer stick?

I've browsed to all question related to "sticky footer" and nothing helped me because my #content div does not always have sufficient content to push the footer to the bottom. Here is the code I've used to achieve this, but apparently I did something wrong: html, body, div#container { height: 100%; } body > div#container { height: auto; min-height: 100%; } div#index_body { padding-bottom: 30px; } .footer { clear: both; position: relative; z-index: 10; height: 30px; margin-top: -45px; padding-top:15px; } .footer { color: #666; background-color:#F4F7FA; border-top:1px solid #E6E7E8; font-size:95%; text-align: center; } Some of my attempts work when index body has loads of text images only then the footer goes to the end but when it doesn't have much content let say 2 paragraph tags and an image the footer doesn't stick. Maybe this is not possible with just CSS, because the index_footer height is not fixed? Is there a way to do this with JavaScript? Or what is the right way to do this? My screen resolution is really big maybe that is the problem its 1680 x 1050
