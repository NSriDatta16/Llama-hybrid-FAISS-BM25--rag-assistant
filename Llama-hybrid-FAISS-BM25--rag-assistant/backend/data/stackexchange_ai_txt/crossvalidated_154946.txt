What is the equivalent for cdfs of MCMC for pdfs?

In conjunction with a Cross Validated question on simulating from a specific copula, that is, a multivariate cdf $C(u_1,\ldots,u_k)$ defined on $[0,1]^k$, I started wondering about the larger picture, namely how, when given such a function, can one figure a generic algorithm to simulate from the corresponding probability distribution? Obviously, one solution is to differentiate $C$ $k$ times to produce the corresponding pdf $\kappa(u_1,\ldots,u_k)$ and then call a generic MCMC algorithm like Metropolis-Hastings to produce a sample from $C$ (or $\kappa$). Aside: Another solution is to stick to Archimedian copulas, using the Laplace-Stieljes transform for simulation, but this is not always possible in practice. As I found when trying to solve the aforesaid question . My question is about avoiding this differentiating step in a generic way, if at all possible.
