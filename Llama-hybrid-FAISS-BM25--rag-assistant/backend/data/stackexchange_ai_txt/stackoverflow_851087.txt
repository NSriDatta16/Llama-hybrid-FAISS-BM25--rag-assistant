How to use Google Maps "auto-load" functionality?

I began reading about Auto-loading a google map at: http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/documentation/#AutoLoading What's unclear to me is how to actually load the google map. I have tried: // But the map doesn't load. Strange thing is that if I simply remove the " autoload= ..." from the URL - the map loads and works fine. If I keep the autoload= ... in the url and comment out the manually loading " google.load("maps", "2.x"); ", it still doesn't work. Any ideas on how to properly use the auto-load functionality to gain the most performance (least latency)?
