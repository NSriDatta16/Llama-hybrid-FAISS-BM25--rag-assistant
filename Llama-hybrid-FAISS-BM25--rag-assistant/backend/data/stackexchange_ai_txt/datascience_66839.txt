If a dataset is imbalanced in real life, should I train on my machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset

I have a dataset where around 20% of the data is the positive class and 80% of the data is the negative class. When I undersample and train my classifier on a balanced dataset and test on a balanced dataset, the results are pretty ok. However, if I train on the balanced dataset and test on an imbalanced dataset that replicates the real world (80-20 split) the metrics are not great. Should I train the model on the original imbalanced dataset if I want it to perform well on real world test data that is also imbalanced.
