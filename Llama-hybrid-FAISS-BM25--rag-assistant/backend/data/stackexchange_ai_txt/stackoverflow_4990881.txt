Use to get name of the file being sourced. You can use expand() to turn it into a full path and get the bit you want. For example, in your line: source /root/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim_-_Elegant_buffer_explorer/plugin/minibufexpl.vim You could do: expand(' :p:h:h') The :p turns it into a full path (in case you do cd /path/to/plugin , :source filename.vim ); each :h strips one part of the path off the end. Note that this won't work in a :set line. Use :let-& instead: let &runtimepath='/usr/share/vim/vim71/' . expand(' :p:h:h>') See: :help SourcePre :help expand() :help :let-&
