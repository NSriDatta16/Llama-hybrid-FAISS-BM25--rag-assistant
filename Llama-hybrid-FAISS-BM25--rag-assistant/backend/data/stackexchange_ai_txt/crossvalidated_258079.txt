Correlation matrix: relationship to third variable?

I have been looking at structural covariance matrices (correlating grey matter volume across many regions (all continuous variables, residualized for covariates). I have created this matrix and noticed several significant correlations (after correction for multiple comparisons), and now I would like to see if these correlations are associated with a third variable (disease severity, a continuous variable). How can I do this? I have been thinking of several ways: Averaging all possible two-by-two correlations and correlating these averages with disease severity. Running linear regressions for each possible correlation interacting with disease severity in the model (though I think i should then run double the amount of regressions as I guess I should test switching X and Y) I am new in matrix mathematics, but I thought matrix multiplication could help me. But I am not sure if this would be correct, as maybe I am correlating brainvolume1 disease severity with brainvolume2 disease severity. This would contain disease severity twice in there and maybe might be collinear. Any other suggestions?
