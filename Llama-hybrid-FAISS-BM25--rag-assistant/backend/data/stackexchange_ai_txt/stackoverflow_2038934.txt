I agree with other answers that a fool-proof protection is simply impossible. However, as a gentle nudge ... If your library is precompiled, you could discourage excessive illegitimate use by requiring custom license info in the API. Change a function like: jeastsy_lib::init() to: jeastsy_lib::init( "Licenced to Foobar Industries", "(hex string here)" ); Where the first parameter identifies the customer, and the second parameter is an MD5 or other hash of the first parameter with a salt . When your library is purchased, you would supply both of those parameters to the customer. To be clear , this is an an easily-averted protection for someone smart and ambitious enough. Consider this a speed bump on the path to piracy. This may convince potential customers that purchasing your software is the easiest path forward.
