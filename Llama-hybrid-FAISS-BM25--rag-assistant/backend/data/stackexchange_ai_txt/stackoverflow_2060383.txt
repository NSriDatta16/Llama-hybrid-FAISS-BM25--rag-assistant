I manage the SVN repositories for a medium sized development team, and for ease of use we check-in binaries that we need; even our own in some instances. I think this is still relevant, but SVN has historically performed poorly with binaries. A Java developer at IBM ran into this issue, investigated, and wrote up his findings. You might find it useful: Performance tuning Subversion: Store and handle binaries without the performance drag Here's the takeaway: The findings of this investigation are clearly specific to the system being investigated, so it is unlikely that the actual values shown are of much significance to other systems. The patterns are more important because they will be replicated in any Subversion system. According to our findings, when storing a set of binaries in Subversion: The most time-efficient method is to create a single, compressed file containing the binary. The most space-efficient method is to use Subversion's efficient check-in script on a regular directory structure. Using any form of authentication on the Subversion server will result in performance loss. A dedicated, powerful machine is optimal for running Subversion.
