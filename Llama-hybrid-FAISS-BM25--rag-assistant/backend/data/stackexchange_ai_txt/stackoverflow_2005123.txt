Introduce a private bool m_IsClosing variable that indicates whether closing is already in progress. public void Closing(object sender, EventArgs e) { lock (m_Object) { if (m_IsClosing) return; m_IsClosing = true; try { // Code, which can trigger Closing again } finally { m_IsClosing = false; } } } I don't think it's particularly elegant, but without knowing more about what you're doing, I can't any better solution. Edit: adapted example for possible exceptions while closing.
