Sorry @zartag but this is some seriously obfuscated code. Please just tell us in a paragraph what you're trying to do and what you think your code is doing. The most obvious thing I can see wrong with your code with respect to the question title ("output to a file") is that you are using printf instead of fprintf . They behave almost identically, except that printf prints to standard output, and fprintf prints to a file stream (e.g. to your list.txt). See the documentation on fprintf . In your case it should be FILE * fp = fopen("list.txt","w"); switch(length){ case 0: fprintf(fp, "%c\n",c0);break; ..snip But seriously that code is in dire need of refactoring (e.g. it looks like the whole switch block can be replaced with a for loop). And please, when you ask a question here, give us a little more to go on than a code listing and question title.
