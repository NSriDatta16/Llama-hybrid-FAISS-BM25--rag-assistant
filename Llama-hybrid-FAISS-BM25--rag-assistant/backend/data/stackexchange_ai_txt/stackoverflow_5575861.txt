IIS 7 performance issues for static page requests

I need help scaling up the performance of an IIS webserver. My simple tests indicate that I am unable to scale up the response time even for serving static HTML pages. Details as below: I have a static HTML page of size about 20 KB getting served from IIS 7 with its default configurations. I am performing a load test on this static page using the Microsoft VSTS 2008 Test Suite. Following are the load test configurations: Constant Load Pattern of 5000 users Load test duration of 5 minutes Percentage of new users: 100 (in order to treat every user as new and to not use caching) Web Test Connection Model: Connection per user Configuration of the server that hosts the HTML page: 8 GB RAM 8 core Intel Xeon Processor (X 2) Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise edition operating System IIS 7 Results: Requests / Second Minimum Average Maximum 130 310 540 Response Time (seconds) Minimum Average Maximum 0.51 9.76 18.71 These seem to be very low numbers, as it indicates that for a constant load of 5000 users, on an average, the users would have to wait for almost 10 seconds to get the response. What could possibly be contributing to this reduction in performance?
