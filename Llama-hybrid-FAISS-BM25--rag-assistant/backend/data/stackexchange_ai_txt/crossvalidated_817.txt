Vipul, you're not being totally precise in your question. This is typically justified using the central limit theorem, which says that when you average a large number of iid random variables, you get a normal distribution. I'm not entirely sure this is what you're saying, but keep in mind that the raindrops in your example are not iid random variables. The mean calculated by sampling a certain number of those raindrops is a random variables, and as the means are calculated using a large enough sample size, the distribution of that sample mean is normal. The law of large numbers says that the value of that sample mean converges to the average value of the population (strong or weak depending on type of convergence). The CLT says that the sample mean, call it XM(n), which is a random variable, has a distribution, say G(n). As n approaches infintity, that distribution is the normal distribution. CLT is all about convergence in distribution , not a basic concept. The observations you draw (diameter, area, volume) don't have to be normal at all. They probably won't be if you plot them. But, the sample mean from taking all three observations will have a normal distribution. And, the volume won't be the cube of the diameter, nor will the area be the square of the diameter. The square of the sums is not going to be the sum of the squares, unless you get oddly lucky.
