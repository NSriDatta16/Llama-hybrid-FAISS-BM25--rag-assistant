Finding model for time series in R

I am supposed to find model for the following time series. It looks to me that it has trend, so I tried regression, here is code: t Then I plotted residuals: I see that residuals are autocorrelated, so I tried harmonic regression: exchangeRate.per Clearly there is on significant frequency which is $0.01041667$ , so my model should be the following: cost And the I did residuals again: resid2 But from the ACF it is clear that residuals are still autocorrelated. Can you tell me where I made mistake?
