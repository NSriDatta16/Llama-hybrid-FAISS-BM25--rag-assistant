Drag & drop across frames with jQuery UI

I would like to do this: Drag a DIV element from a first document that contains an IFRAME Drop this DIV element into into a second document, inside the IFRAME. Is there a way to use jQuery UI draggable & droppable to achieve this? or otherwise do this in a cross-browser way, possibly with another JS library?
