The 'quality' of a JPEG (As interpreted by the code) is nothing to do with the resolution. Rather it is to do with how compressed the image is. A 640x480 image at 100 quality will be noticably better looking than a 640x480 image at 50, but will use more storage space. Try this instead: jpg = mVideoControl.getSnapshot("encoding=jpeg&quality=100&width=2048&height=1536");
