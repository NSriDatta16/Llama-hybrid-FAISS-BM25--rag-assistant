@Ali i would like to suggest you in this situation,that instead of making custom UICustomSearchBar drag and drop the UISearchBar which contains search Display Controller in your Xib of UITableViewController from the library ....and put it above the UITableView it will auto adjust himself...reason i am suggest you this is in UITableViewController class the whole view is covered by table....so custom searchBar will create some problem on that....this is what i analyse and done in my App
