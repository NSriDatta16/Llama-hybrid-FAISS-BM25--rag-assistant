Worker threads stop their work after a moment

I have a serial application that I parallelized using OpenMP. I simply added the following to my main loop : #pragma omp parallel for default(shared) for (int i = 0; i It seems to work well : at the beginning, all my worker threads execute an iteration of the loop, everything goes fast, and I have a 100% CPU load (on a quad-core machine). However, after a moment, one of the worker thread stops, and stays in a function called _vcomp::PersistentThreadFunc from vcomp90.dll (the file is vctools\openmprt\src\ttpool.cpp ), and then another, etc... until only the main thread remains working. Does anybody have an idea why this happens ? This starts to happen after about half of the iterations have been executed.
