Premature optimization is the root of all evil! @Vlad's suggestion to iterate over each float is a much more reasonable answer than switching to a byte[]. Take the following table of runtimes for increasing numbers of elements (average of 50 runs): Elements BinaryWriter(float) BinaryWriter(byte[]) ----------------------------------------------------------- 10 8.72ms 8.76ms 100 8.94ms 8.82ms 1000 10.32ms 9.06ms 10000 32.56ms 10.34ms 100000 213.28ms 739.90ms 1000000 1955.92ms 10668.56ms There is little difference between the two for small numbers of elements. Once you get into the huge number of elements range, the time spent copying from the float[] to the byte[] far outweighs the benefits. So go with what is simple: float[] data = new float[...]; foreach(float value in data) { writer.Write(value); }
