Objective increasing while error decreasing in CNN

I'm using MatConvNet to train a convolutional neural network, and i noticed that after the 5th iteration, the objective started fluctuating (mostly upwards) whereas the validation error was decreasing. Does this indicate overlearning? What system parameters can I change for a slower but more steady learning? Thanks for any help!
