How about: unsigned long start = GetTickCount(); // stuff that needs to be timed unsigned long delta = GetTickCount() - start; GetTickCount() is not very precise, but will probably work well. If you see a lot of 0, 16 or 31 millisecond intervals, try timing over longer intervals or use a more precise function like timeGetTime . What I usually do is this: unsigned long deltastack; int samples = 0; float average; unsigned long start = GetTickCount(); // stuff that needs to be timed unsigned long delta = GetTickCount() - start; deltastack += delta; if (samples++ == 10) { // total time divided by amount of samples average = (float)deltastack / 10.f; deltastack = 0; samples = 0; }
