JSP: Getting viewer's IP

Greetings, I am using Apache Tomcat 6.0 using Windows 7 Professional as my OS. I have developed a JavaEE project using Netbeans 6.9.1 I have a domain on Dyndns that goes directly to the Apache Tomcat 6.0. I was wondering if this is possible? I want to track/monitor the IP (IPv4 / IPv6) which are currently viewing my domain. Also, can I also monitor what part of my project are they viewing. Thanks, Cyril H.
