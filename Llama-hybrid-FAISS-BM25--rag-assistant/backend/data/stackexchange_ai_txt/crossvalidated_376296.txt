can a vector of strictly positive values have a negative autocorrelation at any lag? [NB As whuber notes, the question is ambiguous. I read it as "With positive time series, can there be a lag at which there's a negative correlation?".] Consider the sequence $Y_t =12/Y_{t-1}$ with $Y_0=4$ . Alternatively, consider $Y_t=10-Y_{t-1}$ with $Y_0=4$ . As a more prosaic but realistic example, take some stationary series that has a negative correlation at some lag and shift it up by some large value $L$ (some value easily large enough to make the whole series positive). The autocorrelations are unchanged. Or take a series with a strong negative correlation and little noise that's close to zero (but can be both positive and negative) and exponentiate it. For example: x Any of these should suffice to demonstrate that negative autocorrelations are easily attained with positive variates.
