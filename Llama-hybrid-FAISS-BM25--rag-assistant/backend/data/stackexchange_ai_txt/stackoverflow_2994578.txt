Will jQuery ever leverage HTML5 technologies?

In an effort to move to HTML5, does one have to abandon jQuery or is a port underway to move jQuery to HTML5? For example, jQuery has animations like SlideDown, SlideUp etc... that aren't using HTML5 for animations? Wouldnâ€™t HTML5 handle that more optimally?
