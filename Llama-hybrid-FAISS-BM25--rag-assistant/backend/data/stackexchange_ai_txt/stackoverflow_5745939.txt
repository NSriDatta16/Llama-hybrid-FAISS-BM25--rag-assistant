SVN is about as simple as version control systems get. Problems should only arise when dealing with merging operations...those can be tricky. If you don't address the "human factors" it won't matter which version control system you use, you will always be the helpdesk. To address these kinds of problems, you typically need to: Set up a wiki with common "recipes" for version control tasks. Include a workflow diagram for how changes are made to your code (for those who don't like to read). Host a training session that is specifically designed for your users (use the wiki material). When helping someone with a problem, be sure to make them perform the actual fix. Don't just do it for them, talk them through it instead. Make a point of directing users to product documentation when helping them. Introducing a new version control system into any organization should include the items I listed. I realize it is extra work for those who get it done, but it does save you from long "support" hours down the road.
