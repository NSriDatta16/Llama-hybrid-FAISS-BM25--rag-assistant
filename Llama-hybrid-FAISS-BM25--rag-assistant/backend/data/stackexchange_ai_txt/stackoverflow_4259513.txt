char * myArray = malloc(ARRSIZE*sizeof(char*)); You have allocated a place to store ten string pointers. But you have not allocated any space to copy the characters into persistent strings. If you want to set up that storage at the beginning, you could do #define MAX_STR_SIZE 100 char * myArray = malloc(ARRSIZE*sizeof(char*)); if (!myArray) exit(1); for (j=0; j Or, probably better, you can allocate each string as needed. Instead of strncpy , use strdup (which is like doing a malloc then a strcpy ): myArray[j] = strdup(mystring1);
