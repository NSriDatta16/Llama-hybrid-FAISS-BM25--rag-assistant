If you want to explicitly assign a type, try using extension methods and Cast . var c2010 = formsEntities2010.Clients .Join( formsEntities1010.Agent_Client .Where( ac => ac.Agent_ID == a.Agent_ID ), c => c.Client_ID, ac => ac.Client_ID, (c,ac) => c ) .Cast (); // or whatever namespace you choose I would be surprised, though, if this affected your problem since it seems to me that it is having difficulty determining which fields to use as the join keys.
