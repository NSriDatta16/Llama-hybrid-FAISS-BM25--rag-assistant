The Breusch-Pagan test only checks for the linear form of heteroskedasticity i.e. it models the error variance as $\sigma_i^2 = \sigma^2h(z_i'\alpha)$ where $z_i$ is a vector of your independent variables. It tests $H_0: \alpha = 0$ versus $H_a: \alpha \neq 0$. The White test on the other hand is more generic. It relies on the intuition that if there is no heteroskedasticity the classical error variance esitmator should gives you standard error estimates close enough to those estimated by the robust estimator. Therefore, it is able to detect more general form of heteroskedasticity than the Breusch-Pagan test. A shortcoming of the White test is that it can lose its power very quickly particularly if the model has many regressors. This could be the reason for the results such as yours.
