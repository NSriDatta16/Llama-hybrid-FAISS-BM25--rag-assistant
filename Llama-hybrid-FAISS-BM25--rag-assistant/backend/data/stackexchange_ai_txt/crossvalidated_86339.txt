What is needed is simply to have a variable observation matrix, i.e. in the observation equation: $$ \boldsymbol{Y_t} = \boldsymbol{A_t}\boldsymbol{\theta_t} + \boldsymbol{R_t}\boldsymbol{e_t} $$ matrix $\boldsymbol{A_t}$ (and $\boldsymbol{R_t}$) should omit at time $t$ the rows corresponding to NA entries in $\boldsymbol{Y_t}$. Most packages in R, for instance, will take care of that: you can have the observed multivariate time series with NA values without problems.
