Looking for open source naive Bayesian Classifier in C# for a Twitter sentiment analysis project

I've found a similar project here: Sentiment analysis for Twitter in Python . However, I'm working on C# and need to use a naive Bayesian Classifier that is open source in the same language. Unless someone can shed light on how I can utilize a python Bayesian Classifier to achieve the same goals. Any ideas?
