The ending semicolon can be omited but itâ€™s absolutely not recommended. See this note in the HTML 4 specification regarding character references : In SGML, it is possible to eliminate the final ";" after a character reference in some cases (e.g., at a line break or immediately before a tag). In other circumstances it may not be eliminated (e.g., in the middle of a word). We strongly suggest using the ";" in all cases to avoid problems with user agents that require this character to be present.
