VC-dimension and shattering are keywords for this kind of question. The typical expression involved is "A 2-D hyperplane shatters 3 points". Indicating that if there are three points that can have two classes, then a 2-D hyperplane can always separate the classes. So N distinct points can be separated by a N-1 dimensional hyperplane in a N-1 dimensional space. For more information see slides 8 and 9: https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.toronto.edu%2F~hinton%2Fcsc2515%2Fnotes%2Flec10svm.ppt&ei=X9hNVYmQNMONsAGj54GoCQ&usg=AFQjCNFuwD_e_uNS4e1eLmeY9K4mKTdOWw&sig2=1bwN22vlPsMvovR8Y4e1_w&bvm=bv.92885102,d.bGg I am not sure how this works out for more than 2 classes.
