As someone who maintains large svn repos, let me tell you, DO NOT use a unified trunk . It will make all operations much, much slower. Beyond this, extracting a single project out of a larger repo is not only tedious and touchy, but will result in a space waste when you do eventually want to peel away even one project. Use separate repos for each project, with a trunk and tags directories under the repos, and have developers needing to tie to other projects use externals, the way they were designed. Lazy is not an adequate substitute for organized.
