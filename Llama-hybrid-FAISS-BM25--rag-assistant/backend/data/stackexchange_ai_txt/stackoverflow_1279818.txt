C++ or alternatively C# and mono. Honestly, to accomplish much in the world of software engineering, you will likely have to wrap your head around these languages you find distasteful. Java, C, C++, C#, etc. are likely to come up in a career that involves programming. Looks like you've done some interesting work. I encourage you to push your technical skills harder. It will be worth the effort. Alternatively, Python might be good, given your interests. You might find Smalltalk interesting, or even ATS . For some ideas, look at the Language Shootout and analysis by Oscar Boykin . You have already discovered this, but comparing Ruby to C we see that Ruby is between 14 and 600 times slower (several tests are more than 100 times slower). He also points out that Python is faster than Ruby. The benchmarks for all languages is interesting. Also interesting are benchmarks from Dan Corlan .
