First of all you have to realize these kind of problems have large amounts of noise compared to signal, because predicting what someone will buy based on a very small window of information is difficult. That said, you are throwing away a lot of information with your current approach. Temporal aspects include a ton of information, for example the sequence in which items were bought etcetera. While this is a lot more complicated than what you are describing now, you could look into recurrent neural networks where you feed history up to the point of prediction as a sequence and predict the item they will buy next as softmax classification. This will depend on the amount of products that you offer whether this is feasible or not. Another advantage is that so-called 'out-of-core' training is relatively easy with neural networks due to the iterative training of batches. Multi-label is also clean, you can just add a number of labels at the end of your graph if necessary.
