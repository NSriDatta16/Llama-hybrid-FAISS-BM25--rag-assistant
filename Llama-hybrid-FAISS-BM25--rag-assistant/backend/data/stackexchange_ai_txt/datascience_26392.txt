correct value of output_dim or units parameter of dense

I have started learning deep learning and using keras library. But I am confused as to how to take a proper estimate of the value to use for units parameter of the dense method. I came across this tip that we can take it as the average of the number of input nodes and output nodes but everywhere it says that it comes from experience. I want to know if there are things to look out for to estimate it wisely or any other things I need to know. Thanks for the help. classifier.add(Dense(units=6, kernel_initializer="uniform", activation="relu", input_dim=11))
