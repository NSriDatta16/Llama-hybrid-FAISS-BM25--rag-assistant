If you could use Visual Studio 2010 v4.0 framework there are some new capabilities to generate scripts using "Model First" and entity framework. This isn't helpful for v2.0 obviously but I thought it was worth a mention. The "Model First" feature lets you design a conceptual (CSDL) model in the Entity Designer, and then generate the storage (SSDL) model, as well as the mapping (MSL) between these. In addition, we also generate T-SQL scripts to create the database for you. To run the Model First wizard, just right-click on the Entity Designer surface, and choose "Generate Database from Model...". There's an in-depth blog post here . Also, check this article out.
