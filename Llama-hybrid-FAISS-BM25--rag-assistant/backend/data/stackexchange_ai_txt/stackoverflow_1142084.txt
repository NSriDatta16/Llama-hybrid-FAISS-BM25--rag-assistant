Loading a different web.config file at runtime fo ASP.NET

I have a web application which I want to use for multiple business areas. I do not want to have multiple instance of the web app code on the web server. So as an example: I have //MyWebSite/Virtual_Directory_1 refers to c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\MyWebApp pointing to Database_A What I want is to setup another Virtual Directory as follows: //MyWebSite/Virtual_Directory_2 refers to c:\Inetpub\wwwroot\MyWebApp pointing to Database_B. The I was thinking of doing this was by having separate web.config files, but I am not sure how to actually do this. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks Parag
