Are there any peer-to-peer web conferencing API's for .NET?

I'm wondering if anyone has experience building an application like Skype (peer-to-peer), and what technologies and software packages you leveraged? I haven't been able to find a .Net API to build a web conferencing application, but I guess I'm open to any platform. Thanks!
