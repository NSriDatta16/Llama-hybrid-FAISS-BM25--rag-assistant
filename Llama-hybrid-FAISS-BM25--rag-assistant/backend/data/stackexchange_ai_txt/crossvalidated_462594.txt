Detecting if weekday has influence on data - is using F-test correct method?

I have transactions which are produced on a daily basis. Each transaction has a price. I'd like to see, if the weekday has an influence on the average daily price, whether it is statistically significant. I have tried an anova analysis: stats.f_oneway(df['price'][df['weekday'] == 0], df['price'][df['weekday'] == 1], df['price'][df['weekday'] == 2], df['price'][df['weekday'] == 3], df['price'][df['weekday'] == 4]) executed in 43ms, finished 21:33:16 2020-04-24 F_onewayResult(statistic=1.7483567589994404, pvalue=0.16221246736524217) It seems that the H0 of means being equal cannot be rejected. Is this correct? Can we therefore conclude that the weekday has no effect? Is there a way to get an f-score for every categorie, so I can see which day has the most impact?
