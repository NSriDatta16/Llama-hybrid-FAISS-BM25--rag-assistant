Since you're a beginner, here's an easy way. In your application, switch to Design View. Drag an Image Component from the Component Panel onto the main Application Canvas. Size the Image on the Canvas and leave it selected. On the right hand side, in the properties panel, click the Folder button on the "Source" field. Choose your image. If you place the image in your project's folder, it will be included in your build folder. Then take a look at the source view. You will see MXML code that reflects what you've done. You can change this by hand as well. The source="blah.png" part can also be pointed to a remote URL.
