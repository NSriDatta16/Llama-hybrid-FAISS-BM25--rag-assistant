A couple points: 1) To find the risk of the undesirable event, you do not need logistic regression. It's just a proportion. Logistic regression is about the relationship between the IV and risk 2) To compare the risk of the event across data sets, you can use chi-square tests. 3) If you want to get estimates of the effect of group membership on risk then you should combine the data sets and run a logistic regression with event as the DV and both group and the original IV as IVs. If you want to see if the relationship is different across groups, then you should add the interaction between these two.
