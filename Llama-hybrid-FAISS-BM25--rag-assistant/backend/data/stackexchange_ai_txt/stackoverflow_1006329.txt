Actually, generating code from a parse tree is strictly easier than parsing code, at least in a mathematical sense. There are many grammars which are ambiguous, that is, there is no unique way to parse them, but a parse tree can always be converted to a string in a unique way, modulo whitespace. The Dragon book gives a good description of the theory of parsers.
