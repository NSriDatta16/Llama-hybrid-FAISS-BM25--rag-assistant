When you say "NO" to "Enable C++ Exceptions" then Compiler's synchronous model of exception handling (/GX or /EHsc )is not chosen. In this mode, unwind semantics will not be enabled. That is , an object with automatic storage in the frame, between the function doing the throw and the function catching the throw, will not be destroyed. You can refer MSDN or A Visual C++ Exception FAQ for more details on exception handling. class Test { public: Test() { printf("Test::constructor"); } ~Test() { printf("Test::Destructor"); } }; int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) { int a; try { Test a; int* p = 0; *p = 0; // Cause access violation } catch (...) { printf("Caught access violation"); } return 0; } with No to exception handling the output would be: Test::constructor Caught access violation
