Someone help me with error propagation?

I have a fraction: $y = (A/B)-1$ , where $A$ and $B$ are values (constants) with an associate value of error. How do I calculate the error of each $y$ ? And then I have to plot the average value of my matrix with these many $y$ . What do I do with the errors in this situation? Thanks
