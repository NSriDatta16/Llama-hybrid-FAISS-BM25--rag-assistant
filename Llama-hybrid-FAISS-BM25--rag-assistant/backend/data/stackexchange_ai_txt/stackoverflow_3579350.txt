@Ragims, No matter whether Scott Hanselman might come come and kick my a$$ or not, I embed any and all code that I need in my Views, inside tags. That being said, I try to get most processing done in a model, triggered from the controller code. I don't think you should use codebehind, but embed what you need in the page itself. Keep it as clean as you can, and use server side comments inside when you can't keep it clean. You will be better served doing stuff in a model or controller in the long run. Codebehind vs CodeInPlace conveys no advantages that I know of. CodeInPlace at least lets you see the code in the context of the html. Yeah, Yeah, I know it reminds us all of the asp days. Some things in those days were pretty clear. ymmv
