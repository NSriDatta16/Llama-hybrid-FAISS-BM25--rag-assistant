How to resume training in neural networks properly?

I'm working on training a network to identify different kinds of cells. For each experimental batch, I would take my previous model weight, and then train a few new pictures on it. Since the model is for the same kind of data, thus this is not a transfer study in my mind. My question is that does the newly trained model pertain the old training memory, for example, if I predict an image from an older batch, would this new model perform badly comparing to the older model? And why?
