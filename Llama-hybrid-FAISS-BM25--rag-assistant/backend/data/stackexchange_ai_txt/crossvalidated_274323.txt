There is no such standard and there never will be. If your data is very noisy and forecasting-unfriendly, you will be happy to find any forecasting method that behaves better then the best alternative you have for it. There is no arbitrary "critical" value that marks the point where you can say that your forecast is either "good", or "bad". If you decided to adopt such rule-of-thumb, then unavoidably you will end up with concluding that for some data no matter what method you will use, all of them will produce "good" forecasts, and for other data, you will be unable to find any method that produces one.
