tag "swallows" html

This is a very strange problem I've been struggling with for a few days. At first I thought it was related to something in our application, but I've stripped it down to the simplest html page and it's still happening. Basically anytime I add a tag to a page the html after it gets rendered as it's value. fixes the issue, but I don't understand why. I'm at a loss here, it has to be something really simple that I just don't know. In the following example the paragraph tags show up as the value of the textarea. I'm using IE8. About test test
