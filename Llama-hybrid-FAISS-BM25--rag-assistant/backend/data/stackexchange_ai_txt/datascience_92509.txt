Suitable metric choice for imbalanced multi-class dataset (classes have equal importance)

What type of metrics I should use to evaluate my classification models, given that I have two imbalanced multi-class datasets (21 and 16 classes, respectively) where all classes have equal importance? I am somehow convinced with macro-averaged-based metrics choice such as macro F1 and macro TNR, ...etc. Are macro-averaged-based metrics suitable for my problem based on the aforementioned inputs?
