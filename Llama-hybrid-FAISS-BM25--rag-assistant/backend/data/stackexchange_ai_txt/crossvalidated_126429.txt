The line graphs would probably be easier to interpret if you took a rolling seven-day, fourteen-day or maybe 28-day moving average. That would smooth them out and still allow you to spot trends. This has some similarities with Peter Flom's solution, though is rather simpler and hence doesn't tell quite as full a picture - but it may well suffice for your needs. If you are recording your data in a spreadsheet, it has the advantage that such averaging can easily be performed within the spreadsheet itself by setting up some formulas, and the graph will automatically update as you fill in new data. Update to include graphs The spreadsheet graph for the seven-day rolling averages is unspectacular but seems to do its job well - daily variation is smoothed out so trends are easier to detect (compared to the equivalent daily chart which is so noisy as to be incomprehensible). Some key features are picked out well by this plot: for instance, a large quantity of work was done in mid-January, in hourly terms, but this was not accompanied by a proportionate rise in the average pages completed per day. The Christmas break is very visible and so long as individual data points are clearly plotted then it's not too misleading (if just the line was visible, it would be impossible to determine that the flat period was due to lack of data!). Nevertheless, I'd strongly recommend including rest days in the table, albeit with zero hours and zero pages. The graph could then respond to this, rather than hover $\approx 1.5$ hours per week over the break. With just fifty items of data it did not seem worth trying averaging over a longer period of time to detect longer run trends. Similarly I suspect that Peter Flom's excellent idea of seasonal decomposition would struggle with such limited data. If you were to perform the decomposition in your spreadsheet, it would be even more important to include the break as zero data.
