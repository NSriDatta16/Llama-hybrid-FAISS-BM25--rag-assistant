Permutation feature importance on Train vs Validation set

When I compare on Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) on Train vs Validation set, some features has high values (of PFI) for train but the low values (PFI) for validation. One the conclusion, for me, that features : c, d, f, g and i seams to be kind of noise or "label leakage". Is there any additional conclusions? The bar plots of permutation feature importance: Permutation Feature Importance on Train set Permutation Feature Importance on Validation set N.B. The task is Regression (Forecasting) which is done by Random Forest Regression.
