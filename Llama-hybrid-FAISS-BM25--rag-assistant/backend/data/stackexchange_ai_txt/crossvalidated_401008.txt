Multivariate Time Series Classification/Regression

Background, I'm predicting stock price change direction (either up or down) with about 200 predictors. All of them are time series data. We have about 1500 days as training/validation data. My question is what ML algorithm can I use in a time series classification problem. i.e.Use the 200 predictors on time t to predict the direction at time t+1. BTW, I use R only so please do not give me Python packages. Thanks very much!
