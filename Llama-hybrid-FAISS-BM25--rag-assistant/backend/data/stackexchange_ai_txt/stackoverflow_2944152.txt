Instrumenting java core libraries

When we compile a java program, we get .class files. Can I access these .class files of java core libraries? e.g. can I have access to java.lang.String.class ? Actually I am doing a research and trying to find branch coverage of some java core libraries. The tool I am using for branch coverage actually instruments the .class files. Thanks
