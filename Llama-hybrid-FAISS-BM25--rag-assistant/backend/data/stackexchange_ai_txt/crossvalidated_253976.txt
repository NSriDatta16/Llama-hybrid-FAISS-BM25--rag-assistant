VAR models are routinely used with seasonal data, e.g. in macroeconomics where most of the time series (such as GDP or unemployment) are seasonal. Seasonality is handled either (1) outside of the model (by seasonally adjusting the series before fitting a VAR model) or (2) within the model (by including seasonal dummy variables, for example). For (1), seasonal decomposition can be performed by function stl , decompose (as mentioned in another answer by @GD_N) or by fitting a univariate SARIMA model or an ARIMA model with seasonal dummies or Fourier terms - but there are other options, too. For (2), seasonal dummies can be included as exogenous regressors or via the optional argument season in the vars::VAR function in R (scroll down in the package manual for details).
