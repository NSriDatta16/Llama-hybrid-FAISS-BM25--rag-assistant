Does class weighting introduce bias in Random Forest classifier?

I want to use a Random Forest classifier to stratify a strongly imbalanced population of samples. During training I used class weighting to weight the vote for each class by considering its prevalence. But lately I am thinking that weighting the vote for each class may be a too strong assumption, if the training data set is not representative of the overall population classes prevalence. What are the drawbacks of such approach, and may downsizing the biggest class (in the training set) be an alternative approach to overcome the use of priors?
