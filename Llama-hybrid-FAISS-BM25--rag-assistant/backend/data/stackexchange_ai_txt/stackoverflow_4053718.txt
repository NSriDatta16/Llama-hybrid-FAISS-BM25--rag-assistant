According to the ISO standard (8.5 [dcl.init] paragraph 9): If no initializer is specified for an object, and the object is of (possibly cv-qualified) non-POD class type (or array thereof), the object shall be default-initialized; if the object is of const-qualified type, the underlying class type shall have a user-declared default constructor. So GCC is right here. Sorry, VC guys.
