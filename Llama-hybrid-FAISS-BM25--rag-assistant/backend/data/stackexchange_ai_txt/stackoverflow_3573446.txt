First assign the ViewController which the UIWebView appears in as its delegate: Do this either by control-dragging from the UIWebView to the File's Owner object in InterfaceBuilder or in code: [myWebView setDelegate:myViewController]; Then in your ViewController.m file you can now use the delegate methods to detect when pages are being loaded. These delegate methods will be triggered every time a link or new page is loaded in the UIWebView. - (void)webViewDidStartLoad:(UIWebView *)webView { [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:YES]; } - (void)webViewDidFinishLoad:(UIWebView *)webView { [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:NO]; } - (void)webView:(UIWebView *)webView didFailLoadWithError:(NSError *)error { [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:NO]; }
