Why does "linq to sql classes" change the name of a table when making a class?

I go in and add a new "linq to sql classes" in Visual Studio and then go and drag a table from Database Explorer to the new DBML and the name of the new class is no longer plural. What if I still want it to be plural? If I drag a table that isn't plural I get a bunch of compile errors about how there is already a type definition for all of the fields in the table I put on the dbml layout. If I then make the class name plural for the table that wasn't plural in the dbml layout by clicking on the name and changing it then no more compile errors.
