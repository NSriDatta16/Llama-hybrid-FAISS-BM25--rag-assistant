I think this is just a simple problem with extrapolation. Time series make it more subtle, but the issue is still there. For example, if I draw a line through human male heights and weights I might predict that a 90,000 kg man will be 2,000 meters tall. The problem is there is no 90,000 kg man, so we immediately see how foolish this "model" (extrapolation) is. Similarly if I'd draw a line through Apple stock prices a few years ago, I might predict that within ten years I'd be a billionaire. Same problem -- extrapolation -- but it's disguised because ten years from my prediction will come, even though a 90,000 kg man will never be. Time series also tend to have limits, saturations, cycles, positive and negative correlations and feedback, etc as well. And in your sports example, it's not like scoring is a law of nature or that teams might not change their strategy. Perhaps the Hawks will purposely slow the pace down, perhaps the Pistons have played so hard they can't sustain that pace. Perhaps teams tend to play to win, not to score the maximum number of points, and 24 points is reasonably comfortable later in the game. These aren't random numbers, they're tied to human performance, motivations, and strategies.
