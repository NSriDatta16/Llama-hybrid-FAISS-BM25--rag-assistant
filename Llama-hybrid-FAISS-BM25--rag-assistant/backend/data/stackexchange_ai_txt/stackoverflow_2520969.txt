NSUserDefaults in App Not Updating View in iPhone Settings App

When I change and synchronize value in my app, they get saved, but the changes do not appear in the settings app. Is there a way to get them synced while maintaining the ability to make changes inside the app? Here is my code: //I'm registering the defaults from the Settings bundle I created using David Keegan's class inside my application delegate + (void)initialize{ if([self class] == [VirtualVeloAppDelegate class]){ [InAppSettings registerDefaults]; } } //I'm accessing the values like so NSUserDefaults *ud = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]; [ud boolForKey:@"_someKey"] //I'm setting the values like so [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setBool:switch.isOn forKey:@"_someKey"]; //After I'm done I sync [ud synchronize]; The values are getting saved and recalled accurately in my application both on the iPad and iPhone. However they are not updating the Settings app. I think the fact that I've found no clear cut explanation of this likely indicates Settings.bundle parameters can only be modified in the Settings app.
