David, This post is pretty old but I thought I'd respond anyway as I'm an avid user of your software, Grasshopper, as well as Stack Overflow. When using components in your software I typically find my self in two separate modes: looking for components I'm already aware of, or figuring out what other components are available that might be able to perform what I'm trying to achieve. When using components that I'm already aware of 99% of the time I end up using the feature where you can double click on the canvas and type all or part of the component name. Even when I'm looking for new components I tend to use that feature more then the toolbar. Say I know I want to divide a line, but I don't know where the Icon is. I'll just enter the name "Divide" to search for all the commands with "Divide" in their name. While the toolbar is useful for seeing an overall view of what's available. I end up spending a lot of time dragging components out just to see what inputs they accept. Thus I think it would be useful to make the toolbar more dynamic and context sensitive. For example if the user selects a component that can output points, then I'd like to see a separate toolbar pop up that only shows components that can take points as an input. Autodesk Revit has functionality like this where, for example, if a user selects a wall they will be presented with all the tools related to modifying walls. With your software this would be easy as you could simply cross reference the output of the currently selected component with the inputs of all available components to generate the dynamic tab. Ultimately this would allow users to quickly answer the question "where can I go from here" by selecting individual components in their current definition.
