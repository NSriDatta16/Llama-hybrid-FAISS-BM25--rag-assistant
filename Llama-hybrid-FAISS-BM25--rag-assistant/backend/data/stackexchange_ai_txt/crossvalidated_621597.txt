PCA to reconstruct Binary Data

I'm working with binary 3D matrices. I calculate their PCA (or REOF or SVD) and as a test I would like to reconstruct these matrices from the PCA results. However I realized that because I only keep the first 10 modes of my PCA, the reconstruction ends up giving me floats between 0 and 1 rather than binary numbers. Can a PCA reconstruction ( see this question ) with only the first principal components return binary numbers ? (binary in -> binary out)
