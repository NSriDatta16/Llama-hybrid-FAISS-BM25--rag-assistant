Physical storage of data in Access 2007

I've been trying to estimate the size of an Access table with a certain number of records. It has 4 Longs (4 bytes each), and a Currency (8 bytes). In theory: 1 Record = 24 bytes, 500,000 = ~11.5MB However, the accdb file (even after compacting) increases by almost 30MB (~61 bytes per record). A few extra bytes for padding wouldn't be so bad, but 2.5X seems a bit excessive - even for Microsoft bloat. What's with the discrepancy? The four longs are compound keys, would that matter?
