Javascript Widget Affecting Style of the Page it is embedded in

I'm currently developing a widget that can be embedded within a page. However, when embedded, it affects the style (font, text, layout, etc.) of the page it is embedded in. I wonder how Clearspring and other widget frameworks encapsulate their widgets so as not to affect the embedding page. Thanks.
