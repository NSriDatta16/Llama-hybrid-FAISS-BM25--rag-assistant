Short answer is NO . The format in which the image is encoded has to do with its quality. Neural networks are essentially mathematical models that perform lots and lots of operations (matrix multiplications, element-wise additions and mapping functions). A neural network sees a Tensor as its input (i.e. a multi-dimensional array). It's shape usually is 4-D (number of images per batch, image height, image width, number of channels). Different image formats (especially lossy ones) may produce different input arrays but strictly speaking neural nets see arrays in their input, and NOT images.
