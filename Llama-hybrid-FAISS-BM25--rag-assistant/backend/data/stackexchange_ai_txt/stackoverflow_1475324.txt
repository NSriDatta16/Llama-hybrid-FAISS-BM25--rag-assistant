We're a .Net team, so this worked for us... We created our own class library for functions that we think will be commonly used. Things like calculating a Luhn Mod 3 check digit, creating a regex to validate a an address that will fit into a database field that is n characters, etc. The trick is being able to recognize code that is likely to be reused and get it in there. And keep it organized.
