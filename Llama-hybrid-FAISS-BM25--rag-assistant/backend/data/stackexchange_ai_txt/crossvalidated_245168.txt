Choosing the hyperparameters using T-SNE for classification

In as specific problem that I work with (a competition) I have the follwoing setting: 21 features (numerical on [0,1]) and a binary output. I have approx 100 K rows. The setting seems to be very noisy. Me and other participants apply feature generation for a while and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding turned out to be rather powerful in this setting. I stumbled upon this post "How to Use t-SNE Effectively" but still I can not really conclude on how to choose the hyperparameters best in my setting of classifcation. Are there any rules of thumb (number of features, dimension of embedding -> choice of perplexity)? I just apply ad-hoc settings at the moment as it takes too long to iterate various settings. Thanks for any comments.
