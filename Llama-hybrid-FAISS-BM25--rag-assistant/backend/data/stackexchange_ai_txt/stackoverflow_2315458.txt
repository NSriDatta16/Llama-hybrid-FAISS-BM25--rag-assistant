I would suggest looking into neural networks using unsupervised learning such as self organising maps . It's very difficult to use normal supervised neural networks to do what you want unless you can classify the data very precisely for learning. self organising maps don't have this problem because the network learns the classification groups all on their own. have a look at this paper which describes a music recommendation system for music http://www.springerlink.com/content/xhcyn5rj35cvncvf/ and many more papers written about the topic from google scholar http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%09+A+Self-Organizing+Map+Based+Knowledge+Discovery+for+Music+Recommendation+Systems+&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&safe=active
