Storing a value in Memory Independent of Process

I need a way to store a value somewhere for temporarily by say Process A. Process A can exit the after storing the value in memory. After sometime Process B comes accesses the same location of memory and read the value. I need to store in memory, because I dont want the data to persistent across reboots. But as long as the system is up, it Independent of the Process the data must be accessible. I tried MailSlots and Temporary files in windows, both seem to have problem where the process reference count drops to zero , the entities dont persist in memory. What is a suitable mechanism for this in Windows preferably using Win32 API? Ganesh
