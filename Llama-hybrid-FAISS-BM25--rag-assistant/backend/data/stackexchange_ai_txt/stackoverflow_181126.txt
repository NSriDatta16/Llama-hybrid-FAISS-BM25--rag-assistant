For anyone who's interested, the solution i'm going to use is the Mono.Cairo libraries from the mono C# distribution instead of using system.drawing. If i simply drag the mono.cairo.dll, libcairo-2.dll, libpng13.dll and zlib1.dll files from the windows version of mono into the same folder as my executable, then i can develop in windows using visual studio 2005 and it all works nicely. Update - i've done the above, and stress tested the application and it all seems to run smoothly now, and uses up to 200mb less ram to boot. Very happy.
