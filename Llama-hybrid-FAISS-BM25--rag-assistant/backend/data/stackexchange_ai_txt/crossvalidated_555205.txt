Yes, a softmax model is essentially a multi-output version of a logistic regression model. The inputs are sent through a linear transformation, then each of those outputs are sent through an exponential activation function (which necessarily outputs a positive number), then those outputs are just normalized. You recover a logistic regression model when there are only two possible outputs. Since they sum to 1, so you only need one output to determine the other. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function .
