As others have said, first tell bots they can't access the images with robots.txt if possible. Well-behaved bots will obey that. Do a search for "prevent hotlinking". The standard method is to block requests to image files without a referrer within your domain, using a mod_rewrite rule. That'll stop most bots. You can match the user-agent strings of hundreds of common crawlers using get_browser and a recent browscap.ini file. This is not commonly available on shared hosting, but if you read the comments in the manual, you should find a get_browsers implementation that you can run from your own code. All of these will effect SEO since the major search engines all have image searches. It'll also effect the new Google Web Previews that show a screenshot of the webpage when hovering over a search result, since you'll be blocking the bot from seeing the images on your page when creating the screenshot.
