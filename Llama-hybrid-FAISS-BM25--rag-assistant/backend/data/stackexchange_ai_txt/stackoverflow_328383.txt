Perhaps you are looking in the wrong area - all you are storing for each value is the row number of the database row, which suggests that perhaps you are just using this to retrieve the row? Why not try indexing your table on the numeric column - this will provide lightning fast access to the table rows for any given numeric value (which appears to be the ultimate objective here?) If it is still too slow you can move the index itself into memory etc. My point here is that your database may solve this problem more elegantly than you can.
