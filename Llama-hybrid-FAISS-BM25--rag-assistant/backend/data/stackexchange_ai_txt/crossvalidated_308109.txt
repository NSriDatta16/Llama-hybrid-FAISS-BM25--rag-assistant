Creating a text generator using Neural Network

What would be the approach needed for creating a text generator. Most of the tutorials such https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/project/Creating-Text-Generator-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network/ follow using characters instead of words. Could someone tell me what are the tradeoffs using words vs characters. I believe characters will reduce the size of the vectors. However, wouldnt it yield to better results?
