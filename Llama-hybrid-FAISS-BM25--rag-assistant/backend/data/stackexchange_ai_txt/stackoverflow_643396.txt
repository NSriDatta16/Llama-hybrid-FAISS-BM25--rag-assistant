is it because IE can only handle a certain amount of cookies? Could be, but that limit is quite high â€” way more than you should be setting in practice. Don't put large amounts of data in cookies; they are sent on every HTTP request, slowing your application down. On IE you can store larger amounts of data in userData , and on newer browsers you can use DOM Storage , either way without the HTTP overhead. But relying on these isn't brilliant for compatibility. Do you really need to store that much on the client side? For a general-purpose web app this may be a sign that you are Doing It Wrong. is there some other way to do a cookie check that is more reliable? No, that's pretty much it. Note that you can fail to set the cookies-with-expires-date but succeed to set a session cookie (no expires date; expires when the browser is closed). This is because in IE when you block persistant cookies they are completely blocked, not downgraded to session cookies as on some other browsers. So for some purposes you need two checks.
