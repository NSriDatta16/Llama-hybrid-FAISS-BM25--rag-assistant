Time almost necessarily is a factor in any causal analysis. In fact, I would say the majority of DAGs include it without the statistician actually explicitly thinking about it. Most often, it's age . Age is time since birth. We all agree this causes mortality. We also unthinking model interactions between age and other factors as a form of adjustment: cumulative pack-years of smoking, telomere length, educational achievement, household income, marital status, left-ventricular hypertrophy, et cetera . Yes, age is a form of time. You can also have calendar year, especially when there are interruptions to a time series, you can find massive forms of temporal confounding because a certain intervention or policy was made available that massively disrupts a planned analysis, especially when treatment is allocated in a stepped-wedge, cross-over, or other non-parallel fashion. Even in clinical trials, time-on-study is reflected in a number of important measures. Some drugs are likely to produce toxic effects at their first administration, others cumulatively overcome the liver or kidney's ability to metabolize and eventually lead to organ failure. Hawthorne effect can have a diminishing impact on the measured safety and efficacy outcomes, as a consequence of learning or becoming accustomed to the study setting. This is illustrated also with the issues of modeling per-protocol and intent-to-treat effects, where non-compliers and non-responders are dropped from the analysis set, you might say that conditioning on their outcomes, you can estimate a "pristine" effect of treatment in an ideal setting where patients comply with and suitably respond to treatment. These are just the age, period, and cohort effects: the three forms of time that the statistician must account for in analyses. As we learn in time series modeling, when a lack of stationarity holds, we cannot presume that measures taken repeatedly over time are the same as many measures taken all at once. The statistician must identify and interpret a causal estimand and account for time in the appropriate, causal fashion.
