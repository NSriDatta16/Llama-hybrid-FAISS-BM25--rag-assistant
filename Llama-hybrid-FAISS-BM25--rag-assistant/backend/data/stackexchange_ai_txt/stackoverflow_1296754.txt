Having code which interacts with the database server through SQL instead of through stored procedures is not a violation of separation of concerns, as long as that code is well modularized and the LINQ to SQL part cares only about data entry/retrieval and is not intermingled with other tasks (concerns). LINQ to SQL usage does not break any principle Now, modifying code not to use SPs when it has been coded that way from the beginning will probably not be a small task and there might not be any real benefit in the end other than you learning LINQ to SQL.
