I think you are asking for a Map . A map doesn't use indices like array, but stores each value with an associated key, or identifier. A map, will store multiple items of different types and allow you to associate them with identifiers for later retrieval. Like this: JLabel label = new JLabel("Hello world"); Map map = new HashMap(); // store the lable in the map, using it's text as the key. map.put("Hello world", label); // or equivalently, map.put(label.getText(), label); // ... later on, when you want the label JLabel helloWorldLabel = (JLabel)map.get("Hello world"); assert hellowWorldLabel==label; // true If you must use an array, you still use a map and add the index as the value, and the identifier as the key, Object[] DS = ...; your array, with JLabel in 124324 // When you add the object to the array, also add it's index to the map map.put("Hello world", 124324); //.. later when you need the value Integer index = map.get("Hello World"); JLabel label = (JLabel)DS[index.intValue()]; Unless you have a very specific need for the array, I would just use the Map. I hope this is what you are looking for. If not, please clarify.
