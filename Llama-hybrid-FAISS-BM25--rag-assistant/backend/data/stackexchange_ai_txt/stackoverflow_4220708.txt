First, clean up your HTML. You need to close your ul tags with , not open new ones with . Second, you are not allowed to have id values beginning with a number, at least in HTML4. In addition, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by I think you mean you are including a file that outputs the HTML. This makes things a little tricky. You will need to turn output buffering on. You can then do some DOMDocument stuff with the captured content. createDocumentFragment(); $f->appendXML($text); $dom->appendChild($f); // these three lines import $text into $dom $i = 0; while ($dom->childNodes->length > 0) { // loop through the elements from your file $child = $dom->childNodes->item(0); // working with the first remaining element $dom->removeChild($child); // remove them -- we'll reinsert relevant elements later if ($child->nodeType === XML_ELEMENT_NODE) { // forget about non-element nodes (i.e. whitespace) $div[$i] = $dom->createElement('div'); // create a new parent element $div[$i]->appendChild($child); // stick the current ul into it $div[$i]->setAttribute('id', 'd' . (++$i)); // give it an id like d1, d2, etc. } } foreach ($div as $d) { $dom->appendChild($d); // reinsert each div element into the DOMDocument } echo $dom->saveHTML(); // echo the processed content Of course, by far the easiest solution is to change the included file...
