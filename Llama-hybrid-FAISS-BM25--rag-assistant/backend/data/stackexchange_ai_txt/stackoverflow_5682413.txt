How do I make a Safari window active using AppleScript (elegantly)?

While one can simulate command-shift-` using System Events to change windows in Safari, is there no better way to do this with AppleScript? I can change the index of Safari's windows, this changes their ordering on the screen but does not make them active. Suppose you have two Safari windows containing about:blank -- how could you bring the one in the back to the front and make it active? Granted, command-shift-` works, so maybe there only needs to be one way to skin this cat.
