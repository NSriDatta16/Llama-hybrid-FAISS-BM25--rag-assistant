Rails3 structure, engines, plugins, slices, gems, modules..?

Do you have a working example of a Rails3 mvc application? How will it be organized? I hope something like: -app --controller --views -plugins --myapp1 ---app ---controller ---views ---... Can app1 use a model from app2? Will "routes" file be deprecated? reference: https://web.archive.org/web/20170704120345/http://yehudakatz.com/2009/07/19/rails-3-the-great-decoupling https://www.slideshare.net/jacobian/django-in-the-real-world-1750000
