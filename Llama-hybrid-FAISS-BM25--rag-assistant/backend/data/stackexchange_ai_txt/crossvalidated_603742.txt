How can I compute the set of interventional probability distributions compatible with a DAG?

Let $P$ be a probability distribution on a set $V$ of variables and for any $X\subseteq V$ and any possible realization $x$ of $X$ let $P_x$ be a distribution on $V\setminus X$ . Let $P^*$ the collection of such distributions. Pearl (page 24 of Causality, 2009) says that a DAG $R$ is a Causal Bayesian Network compatible with $P^*$ if $P$ is Markov with respect to $R$ For any $X\subseteq V$ and any realization $x$ of $X$ , $P_x(v)=\prod_{i\ st\ V_i\notin X} P(v_i|pa_R(V_i))$ where $v$ is any realization of $V\setminus X$ This is actually a slight rephrasing of Pearl, in the sense that he consider interventional distributions as distributions on $V$ , and asks 2. for realizations of $V$ which are consistent with $x$ , in the sense that they are of the form $v=(x,v)$ , up to permutation. My question is: given a dag $R$ can we charachterise the sets of probability distributions $P^*$ for which it is a Causal Bayesian Network? "Algorithmically" one would first pin down all the distributions which are Markov to $G$ , hence those for which the pattern of conditional independencies coincides with the d-separation pattern of $G$ . Then, each one should pin down uniquely a family of interventional distributions. My question is: can we have a nicer description of this set, at least in special cases (e.g. restricting to Gaussian or Bernoulli vectors) ?
