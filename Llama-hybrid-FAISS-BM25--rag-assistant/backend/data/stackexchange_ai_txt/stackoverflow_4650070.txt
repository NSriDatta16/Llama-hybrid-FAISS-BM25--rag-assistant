AppEngine - Send files to the blobstore using HTTP

I'm trying to send files to the blobstore using http requests. First I made a button to call the createUploadUrl to get the upload url. Then I made a client: HttpClient httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient(); HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(URL_FROM_CREATEUPLOADURL); httpPost.setEntity(new StringEntity("value1")); HttpResponse httpResponse = httpClient.execute(httpPost); But I have 2 problems: In dev mode: When I run the client it responses "Must call one of set*BlobStorage() first." If I upload the app: The url changes every time I call it, so when I run the client it responses "HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error" What I'm doing wrong?
