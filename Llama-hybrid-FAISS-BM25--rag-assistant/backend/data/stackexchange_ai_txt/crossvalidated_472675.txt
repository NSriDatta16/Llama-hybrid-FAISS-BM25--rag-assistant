First, investigate the application of a power transformation to your data, for example, a Box-Cox Power Transformation , which can induce normality and even improve the homogeneity of the variance. In the particular case of Log-normal distribution , the log transform shifts the data to being mean-centered at the average of the logs (which is now the center of a symmetric Normal distribution). Also, basing the Pearson correlation on a median (in lieu of the mean) concept is another option to explore. Ssee for example work here and also google search on 'Aspects of Linear and Median Correlation Matrix', which is freely available as a pdf.
