If the player is playing in tune, there will be very distinct frequencies in the signal, or at least frequencies with a mathematical separation. It may be possible to characterise a signal using spectral analysis to distinguish music from noise ; or at least melodic music from noise - avant guarde experimental music may not pass ;). The distinction may become more difficult with multiple instrumentalists, percussion, and non-standard or poor tuning; traditional Chinese or Indian music for example uses different scales than western music. Extracting the frequencies in the signal will require signal processing techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform . Categorising the signal as music/not music could be done by statistical analysis, or AI techniques such as neural networks or fuzzy logic
