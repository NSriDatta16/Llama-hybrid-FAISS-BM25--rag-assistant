ADODB recordset in VBA says excel field is empty when it's not

I have an excel sheet I need to import in my Access database. The sheet looks like this: DATE RECEPTION DENOMINATION ITEM NÂ° QUANTITE RECUE 06/01/2010 DVD-Sex & the City PCR-PA21550167 5 06/01/2010 DVD-Avatar Natie 2 PCR-PA21550209 10 I then transfer this file into the database using adodb: Dim rs2 As New ADODB.Recordset Dim cnn2 As New ADODB.Connection Dim cmd2 As New ADODB.Command Dim intField As Integer Dim strFile As String strFile = fncOpenFile If strFile = "" Then Exit Sub With cnn2 .Provider = "Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0" .ConnectionString = "Data Source=" & strFile& "; " & "Extended Properties=Excel 8.0" .Open End With Set cmd2.ActiveConnection = cnn2 cmd2.CommandType = adCmdText cmd2.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM [PCR$]" rs2.CursorLocation = adUseClient rs2.CursorType = adOpenDynamic rs2.LockType = adLockOptimistic rs2.Open cmd2 While Not rs2.EOF strNaam = rs2.Fields(3).Value Loop Now my problem: certain fields have text in them. The field value should then be item0001 , but it's reportedly NULL When the field has a regular number it works fine. The strange thing is: there are other text fields in the sheet and they work FINE.
