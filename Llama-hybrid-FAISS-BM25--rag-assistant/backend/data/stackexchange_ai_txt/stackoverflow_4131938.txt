Source Control Training

I am sure everyone knows that Source Control is a core component of responsible software development. Like software development practices most organisations have differing policies and procedures in working with their chosen Source Control Management Tool; Subversion, GIT, TFS, etc. My question is around how you provide training for new and existing staff in the area of Source Control management? Do you provide staff documentation, videos, brown bag sessions, formal training from an accredited provider or something else?
