I strongly suggest to read Benavoli & Zaffalon (2017) "Time for a Change: A Tutorial for Comparing Multiple Classifiers Through Bayesian Analysis" [PDF] . The paper introduces the problem of comparing two classifiers in different settings. Authors show how NHST (null hypothesis significance testing) falls short of expectations and proposes simple Bayesian alternatives (code included). The case "what is the probability A = B?" is also covered. The paper is very readable.
