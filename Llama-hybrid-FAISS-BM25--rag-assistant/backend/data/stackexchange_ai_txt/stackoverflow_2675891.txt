How to detect (with server-side code) whether an ASP.NET Page is about to be cached (the first time it is requested)?

Is it possible to detect whether an ASP.NET Page is about to be cached and if so, how? The HttpCachePolicy object provides only set-methods. The VaryByParams name-value collection is useless if values other than "None" and "*" are set as it impossible to enumerate them and you can only access them by key. Additionally, I cannot use Reflection. Any ideas?
