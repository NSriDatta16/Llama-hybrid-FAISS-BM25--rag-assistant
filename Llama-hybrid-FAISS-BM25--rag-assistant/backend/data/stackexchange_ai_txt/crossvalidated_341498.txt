Conditional independece iff joint factorize four variables

Im interested with a derivation as shown by by Zoubin Ghahramani in his article ' Learning Dynamic Bayesian Network ' The whole objective was to prove P(Z, W|X,Y) = P(W|Y)P(Z|X,Y) ---- EQ 1 Given a factorization P(W, X, Y, Z) = P(W) P(X) P(Y|W) P(Z| X,Y),------- EQ 2 The question was to show, from the above factorization, show that given the value of X and Y, Z and W are independent. In the manuscript, Ghahramani give the following to prove EQ 1. Such that, $$P(Z,W | X,Y) = \frac{P(W,X,Y,Z)} {P(X, Y)} ..........(A)$$ $$ = \frac{P(W) P(X) P(Y|W) P(Z| X,Y)} {\int{P(W) P(X) P(Y|W) P(Z| X,Y)dW dZ}}..........(B)$$ $$ = \frac{P(W) P(Y|W) P(Z| X,Y)} {P(Y)}..........(C)$$ $$=P(W|Y) P(Z|X,Y) ..........(D)$$ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% I know that for the following, $${\int{P(W) P(X) P(Y|W) P(Z| X,Y)dW dZ}}$$ we arrange it such that $$P(X) P(Y|W){\int{P(W) dW} { \int P(Z| X,Y) dZ}}$$ Where $${\int P(W) dW} =1$$ and $$P(W|Y)=\frac{P(W,Y)} {P(Y)} $$ However, I am not so clear on, Why we need to integrate by the dW and dZ, How to get from P(X) P(Y|W) to P(Y) in equation C. I really appreciate, if anyone can show how we get the solution from C to D. Thanks in advance. Best regard, Rod
