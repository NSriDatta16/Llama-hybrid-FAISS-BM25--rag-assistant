Strictly speaking, any p -value is some evidence regarding the $H_0$ vs. $H_1$ question. It usually boils down to decision-making: Should you act (or plan your future acts) assuming that $H_0$ is true, or should you hold $H_1$ for true? In an empirical field you can never know with absolute certainty, but still, you have to make the decision somehow. Now, it's a different question whether probability by itself is the right criterion for making that decision, but let us assume that it is. Then, by setting $\alpha$ to some value (usually 0.05) you are basically establishing a decision boundary: If the p -value is below it, you decide to act as if $H_1$ were true, because it is sufficiently improbable (though still possible) to get such an extreme value of $T$ if $H_0$ were right. For example: Assume you have ordered 1 million of 1 k $\Omega$ resistors from a manufacturer of electronic components. Due to the manufacturing process, no resistor is exactly 1 k $\Omega$ , so the true resistance is some random distribution around that value. You don't have the resources to check each resistor yourself, but you can take a sample, measure the resistance on it and do the statistics. If you get a sufficiently large p -value, $p \gt \alpha$ , you can say: Assuming that the true resistance in the population is 1 $k\Omega$ , it is reasonably probable to draw a random sample whose average resistance deviates at least as much as measured from that ideal value. I'll accept the shipment and build the resistors into my product. This is failing to reject $H_0$ . On the other hand, if your p -value is below your $\alpha$ , your reasoning is the following: Assuming that the true resistance in the population is 1 $k\Omega$ , it is very improbable to take a random sample whose average resistance deviates at least as much as measured from that ideal value. Hence, the true resistance likely isn't 1 $k\Omega$ . I'll reject the shipment, sue the manufacturer, search for a more reliable one or whatever, but I will not use these resistors in my product, because it is not going to work properly with wrongly dimensioned components. This is rejecting $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$ .
