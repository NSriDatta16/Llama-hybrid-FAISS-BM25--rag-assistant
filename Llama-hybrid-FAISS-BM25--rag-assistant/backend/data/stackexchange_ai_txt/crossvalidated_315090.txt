2D rotation of standardized PCA, how to compute new eigen values, eigen vectors, and loadings ?

I want to apply a 2D rotation of a $\theta$ angle to my two first principal components of a PCA. What I understood from this post is that I have to apply a rotation matrix R : $$ R_\theta = \left( \begin{array}{ c c } \cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} \\ \sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta} \end{array} \right) $$ If the coordinates of my observations in the factorial plan are the matrix $Y$ of dimension $n*2$, then the rotated coordinates are $Y_R = YR$. With this new matrix, I can plot my observation in the rotated factorial plan. In the same way, rotation of loadings $L = V S$, with $V$ the eigen vectors of the correlation matrix and $S$ the square-root matrix of the eigen values, are obtained such as $L_R = L R = V S R $. With this rotated loading, I can plot the new circle of correlation between original variables and rotated components. I also understood that the new eigen values $S_R^2$ (variance explained by each component) are obtained doing $S^2_R = R^T S^2 R$. What I suppose is that the rotated eigen vectors are $V_R = VR$. But if I follow loading definition ($L = V S$) then $L_R = V_R S_R = V R \sqrt{SÂ²_R} = V R \sqrt{R^T S^2 R}$. However, I find that $V R \sqrt{R^T S^2 R} \neq VSR$. So why rotated loadings are defined as $L_R = L R = V S R $ and not as $L_R = V_R S_R$ ? Which definition of $L_R$ should I use and why ? Thanks a lot =)
