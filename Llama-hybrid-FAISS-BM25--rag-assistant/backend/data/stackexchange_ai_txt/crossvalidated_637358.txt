Terminology: multivariable when multiple levels of categorical variable?

Oftentimes, one sees people use terms such as univariate and multivariate logistic regression, where they clearly refer to number of predictors rather than number of response variables. I know it might be better to use term multivariable instead of multivariate in such circumstances. My question is, when there is a categorical predictor with several levels, would it be considered univariable (univariate) or multivariable (multivariate) model within this context? The confusion arises from the notion, that despite there being one predictor, it formally corresponds to several dummy variables, where, for example, each dummy variable would be associated with respective odds ratio.
