Yes, that's correct. The only change I'd make is to include "on average". Here is how we describe the same problem in the upcoming 2nd edition of our book: The slope coefficient shows that a one unit increase in $x$ (a 1% increase in personal disposable income) results on average in 0.24 units increase in $ y$ (an average 0.24% increase in personal consumption expenditure). As you have recognized, this example is a little tricky to describe because the two variables are percentage changes.
