predict next career suggestion

I have a dataset having job and description. i want to make model which can predict what are the thing that user needs to improve when the user inputs his skills. For an example, If he has skills - Python, Data Visualization, and etc The model should predict - DataScience, Machine Learning etc.. Note : The dataset contains the job description which contains various skills a candidate needs to have. model needs to predict from those data, fine tune the dataset on GPT model is not recommended. If you have any idea how to approach to this problem, I am all ears.
