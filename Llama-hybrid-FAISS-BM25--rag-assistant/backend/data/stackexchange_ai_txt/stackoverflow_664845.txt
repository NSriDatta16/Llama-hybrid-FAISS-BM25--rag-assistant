Have you tried Spy++ ? It's a tool that comes with Visual Studio (at least 2003 & 2005). On my default 2003 and 2005 installs, Spy++ is at: Start | Program Files | Microsoft Visual Studio 200X | Visual Studio Tools | Spy++ After you run Spy++, select Find Window... from the Search menu. Drag the "Finder Tool" to the window or control you want to watch events on and click OK. Right-click on the item selected in the tree and select "Messages". This will bring up a window that shows the messages as they hit your window of interest. If Spy++ doesn't get what you need, what about Managed Spy ? It appears to be like Spy++ but specifically for managed code. I haven't tried it. [It] displays a treeview of controls in your .NET-based client application. You can select any control and get or set any property on it. You can also log a filtered set of events that the control raises.
