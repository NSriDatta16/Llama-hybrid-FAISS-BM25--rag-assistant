How does inheritance technical work?

I am about to give a presentation in my company (I am a trainee) about Inheritance in Java. I think I figured it out and I also know how to use it. But one thing is not so sure. Where are the methodes stored in the storage. And how does an object know where the methodes are? For example: We have this class. class Animal { private String desc1; protected String desc2; public void breath() { } public void eat() { } } and this class: class Dog extends Animal() { public void bark() { } } we now make an Object of the Dog class: Dog dog = new Dog(); So now my questions: The classes are loaded in the heap. So Dog and Animal are in the heap. (EDIT: Thats wrong, classes don't get loaded in the heap, look answers below.). So, Lets say we make dog.bark() . How does dog know where the bark method is in the Heap? Knows it where the Dog class is? Next we make dog.eat(): So when dog knows where Dog is, does Dog know where Animal is or does dog know where Animal is? With know I mean it has a address where it is on the heap. And how is it when I overwrite a method? Where is that stored? thx for helping.
