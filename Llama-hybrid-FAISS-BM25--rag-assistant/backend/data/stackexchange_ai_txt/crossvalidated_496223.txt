Seasonality and non-stationarity

It is usually claimed that a time series with seasonality is not stationary and requires seaosnal differencing. Intuitively, this could be understood by the fact that the mean is time-dependent. Now, in analogy with AR(1) models, I can write down the following process: $y_t = \phi y_{t-12}+ \epsilon_t$ Assume that $\phi . In which sense is this process not stationary? Also, does this imply that modeling with the above model ( $\text{SARMA}(0,0,0)(1,0,0)_{12}$ ) will never make sense (as $D=0$ )? Thanks in adavnce.
