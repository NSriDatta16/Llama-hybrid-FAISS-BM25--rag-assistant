There are two approaches here: Classification- This is considered binary classification. Take a set of pictures with the object, label them 1. Then take a set of pictures without the object, label them 0. Then train a CNN to distinguish. Google "Resnet50" to get started. Object Detection - Given a set of images, instead of the label just being 1 or 0, the labels instead are bounding boxes of each instance of the object in each image. Then train a CNN + head to distinguish. Google "SSD Object Detection" to get started. Advantages of Classification: Much simpler, just a normal CNN Less time to train Advantages of Object Detection: Shows location of object, not just whether it exists. Can classify more than 1 object for a particular image
