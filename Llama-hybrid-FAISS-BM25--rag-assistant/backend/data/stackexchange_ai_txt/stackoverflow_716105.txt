MySQL dumps are exactly that -- dumps of the MySQL database contents as SQL. So, there isn't any way to read this directly as a database file. What you can do, is modify your init script for MySQL to automatically load the last dump (via the command line) every time MySQL starts. An even better solution would be to use a ramdisk to hold the entire contents of your database in memory, and then periodically copy this to a safe location as your backup. Although, if you want to maintain the contents of your databases at all, you're better off just using one of the disk-based storage engines (InnoDB or MyISAM), and just giving your server a lot of RAM to use as a cache.
