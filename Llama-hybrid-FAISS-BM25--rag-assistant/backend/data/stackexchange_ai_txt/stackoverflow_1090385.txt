How to change view size in IB for iPhone 3.0

I want to change the view size for iPhone 3.0, but I find that in IB, size&Position section, the Width and Height for view was set as fixed values. Does apple forbid us to change its value here. How can I change its Height then? PS:I use the navigation bar as title bar, so I need to change the height of view to 416 so as to know how much space I can use to organize my controls.
