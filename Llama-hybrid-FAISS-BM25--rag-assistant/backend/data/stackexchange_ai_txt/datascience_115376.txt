How is Probability Used in Data Science?

This is my first Question so apologies if I do not stick to the standards. What I want to understand is how is all of the following topics: Probability Different Probability Distributions. Baye's Theorem and soo on.. related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning modelling. Like can someone give an example How these theories help us developing let's say a simple Classification problem to a complex Neural Network that detects Faces for example? Can someone pinpoint the exact stage at which we need to utilise these concepts and how do we actually use them?
