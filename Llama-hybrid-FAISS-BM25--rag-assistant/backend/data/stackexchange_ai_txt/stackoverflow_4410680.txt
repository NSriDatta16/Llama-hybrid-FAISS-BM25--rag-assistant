git error on push : "fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly"

I have dreamhost account and wanted to host a git repository so I followed the steps here . Here is the what I did: 1 - Installed tortoisegit and msysgit following the steps here (didnt generate a key) 2 - Using Git Bash (with username: geryit , host: geryit.net ) ssh-keygen -t rsa cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ssh geryit@geryit.net "mkdir ~/.ssh; cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" eval `ssh-agent` ssh-add then created my local and remote repositories and git remote add origin ssh://geryit@geryit.net/~/p5.git git push origin master then it asks for my username and password and after I type i got this error: I tried assigning private putty key to tortoisegit but no luck. What am I doing wrong?
