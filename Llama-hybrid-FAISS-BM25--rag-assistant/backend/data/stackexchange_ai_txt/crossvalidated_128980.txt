It is about a year since you have asked this question, @variant, and I assume you hopefully passed whatever exam you where studying for or passed your stats course. Homogeneity of variance is a standard assumption of ANOVA and most statistical tests. It is usually touched on quickly in most stats class. Most people have no understanding of what their prof is talking about and, frankly, most profs do not have the best handle on it as well. Homogeneity of variance (HOV) has a history and it is often helpful to understand that history if you want to understand statistics. Variance, as a term, was first coined by Fisher in 1918. (hopefully you already have a good understanding of variance) What Fisher was interested in was decomposing differences among organisms into their genetic and environmental influences. You know, the idea that people are a combination of nature and nurture. Fisher also felt that most natural phenomenon was normally distributed -- or had a bell curve shape. Before Fisher was Pearson and Galton, and they had a strong influence on Fisher. The normal distribution has an interesting history in statistics and Galton found it almost magical. Galton explored the normal distribution using a device called the Quincunx. There is a great demonstration of Galton's device on the MathisFun website. Basically it was a board with nails pounded in it. The nails were arranged in a triangular shape. Galton dropped a series of beans or marbles at the top of the triangle and watched them plink, plink, plink down through the nails until they reached the bottom. What he observed was that the objects would arrange themselves at the bottom in a normal(ish) distribution pattern. Now imagine you are using Galton's game and you repeat the above experiment with a 1000 marbles. Then you measure the mean and variance of those 1000 marbles. You write that down. Then you repeat your experiment with the same marbles but first you only use 750 marbles (write down the resulting mean and variance of the 750 marbles) and then empty the game and then use the remaining 250 marbles (again write down the mean and variance of the 250 marbles). If you add the variance of the 750 marbles with the variance of the 250 marbles you will get the exact variance (more or less) of the original 1000 marble distribution. Now, repeat the above experiment but, this time, imagine that on the last 250 marble trial you slightly tilt the game so that one side is higher than the other. This will cause the marbles to slightly skew off-center and collect more to one side of the game then the other side. If you calculate the mean and variance of this skewed sample, and add it to the non-skewed 750 marble sample, you will find that it no longer adds up correctly to the original 1000 marble population variance. This because your 250 sample is skewed and has a different distribution than the 750 marble sample. Also when a sample is skewed the mean may no longer be the best measure of central tendency and variance relies on the mean. ANOVA is a special case of the general linear model of statistics. It is linear in that you are adding things up. It assumes that the distributions of those things you are adding up are the same. If they are not then your conclusion or estimate might be off or biased. And this why HOV is important. Hope this helps.
