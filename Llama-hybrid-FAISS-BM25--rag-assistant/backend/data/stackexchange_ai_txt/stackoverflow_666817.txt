winpcap is probably the most well known choice, but you could also write a Layered Service Provider. There's not a whole lot of documentation, but a good place to start is the article on msdn: http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0599/LayeredService/LayeredService.aspx This has some advantages vs layer 2 packet parsing, but also some disadvantages. You'll need to evaluate where in the stack you want to live. edit: Obviously, when I say pcap -- I really mean any similar approach. Obviously, winpcap was not the first driver/library combo to provide this sort of information.
