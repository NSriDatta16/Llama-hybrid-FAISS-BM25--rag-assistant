"Please specify the product's option(s)" in Magento.

In Magento, I am using bundled products and I have a configurable product as an associated product of the bundled product. This configurable product has 4 simple product as associated products of the configurable product. The chain goes like: - bundle product - configurrable product (associated with bundled product) - simple products (associated with configurable products) Now, in the bundled product view page in the frontend, I'm getting this message: Please specify product option(s) although I have filled out all the required fields for all the products as required, This validation error message occurs while adding the product to the cart. Any advice? I've been stuck for day with this problem.
