How to organize a Rails App

For the first time I'm creating a quite complex Rails app. I'd like to know what's the best way to organize that app by folders. Until now, I'd do everything under one app (all the models, controllers, etC) but reading some open source code I realize that they put everything under different apps. Like for example Spree Commerce. They have a general folder and inside that they have different apps (API, core, admin, etc). How is that done and is that the best way to do it? I'd like to get pointed to the best way to do it (a book, blog, anything) so I can understand how I can architect my app for future maintenance. thank you
