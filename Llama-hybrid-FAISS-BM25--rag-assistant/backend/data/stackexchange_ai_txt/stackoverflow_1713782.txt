For VS you can use: #pragma setlocale( "[locale-string]" ) The default ANSI code page of the locale will be used as file encoding. But in general is a bad idea to hard-code any user-visible strings in your code. Store them in some kind of resources. Good for localization, easy spell-checking and updating, etc.
