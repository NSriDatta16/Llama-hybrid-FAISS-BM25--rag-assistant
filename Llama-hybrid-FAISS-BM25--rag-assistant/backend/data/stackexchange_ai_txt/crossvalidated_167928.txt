Minimum detectable effect size for difference in difference estimator

This answer gives a formula for the minimum detectable effect size of the average treatment effect, given that the outcome variable follows a normal distribution, as follows: $$MDE=\sqrt{\frac{\text{Var}(\widehat{Y})}{n}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{p(1-p)}}(q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}+q_\lambda)$$ Where $Y$ is the outcome variable, $p$ is the proportion of the sample in the treatment group, $n$ is the sample size, and $q_t$ is the $t$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution. How is this formula derived?
