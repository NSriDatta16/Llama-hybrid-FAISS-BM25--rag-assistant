Delaying, cancelling or replacing a ASIFormDataRequest in a NSOperationQueue (for a searchbox)

I'm successfully making a ASIFormDataRequest using the below code. //get groups if (![self queue]) { [self setQueue:[[[NSOperationQueue alloc] init] autorelease]]; } //make the url by appending the URL from the Constant class to the jsp name NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/%@", URL, @"connectors/searchGroupsServlet.jsp"]]; ASIFormDataRequest *request = [ASIFormDataRequest requestWithURL:url]; [request addRequestHeader:@"User-Agent" value:USER_AGENT]; [request addPostValue:[login username] forKey:@"username"]; [request addPostValue:[login password] forKey:@"password"]; [request addPostValue:[searchText lowercaseString] forKey:@"query"]; [request addPostValue:GROUP_FILTER_LIMIT forKey:@"limit"]; [request setDelegate:self]; [request setDidFinishSelector:@selector(requestDone:)]; [request setDidFailSelector:@selector(requestWentWrong:)]; This request is currently made on every key press a user makes in a searchbox (The text typed is sent off in the request as the search string). However, rather than sending the request on every key press, I want to delay the request by a second to allow users to type further characters into the searchbox before the request is sent. I've successfully made a thread that waits a second as users continue to type (although admittedly Im not convinced this is the best way to do it yet, but it works for now)... this [self performSelectorInBackground:@selector(wait:) withObject:request]; calls this -(void)wait:(NSString *)request { [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:1.00]; [[self queue] addOperation:request]; //queue is an NSOperationQueue } but, if a user continues to type, I haven't managed to work out how to cancel the request or not put the request in the queue, or empty the queue and replace it with the new request. Finally, obviously I could force users to wait until they have pressed the 'search' button on the pop-up keyboard, but I was hoping to provide search results without that. Thanks
