O(n^2) seems really excessive. What exactly are you expecting from your data structure? Simply using a vector will give you O(n) worst case for storage and retrieval and O(n) space requirement. – The latter can’t really be reduced (barring a compressing data structure, but for that to work you need to provide a lot more information about your data domain) so why not simply use a vector?
