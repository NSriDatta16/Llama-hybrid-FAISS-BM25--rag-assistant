First record does not show in pagination script

This is my pagination script which extracts info for my TV guide project that I am working on. Currently I've been experimenting with different PHP/MySQL before it becomes a production site. This is my current script: = now() ORDER BY airdate, 3 ASC LIMIT 0, 100;"); //You can also add results to paginate here mysql_data_seek($queryresult, 0); while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $paginator->add(new paginationData($row['programme'], $row['channel'], $row['airdate'], $row['expiration'], $row['episode'], $row['setreminder'])); } //Show the paginated results $paginator->paginate(); include("pca-footer1.php"); //Show the navigation $paginator->navigation(); Despite me having two records for the programmes airing today, it only shows records from the second one onwards - the programme that airs at 8:35pm UK time GMT does not show, but the later 11:25pm UK time GMT one does show. How should I fix this? Above is my code if that is of any use! Thanks
