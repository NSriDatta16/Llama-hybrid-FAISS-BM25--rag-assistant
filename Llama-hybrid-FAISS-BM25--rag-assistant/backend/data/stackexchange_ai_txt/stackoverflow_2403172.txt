Best practice for storage and retrieval of error messages

What is a best practice for storing user messages in a configuration file and then retrieving them for certain events throughout an application? I was thinking of having 1 single configuration file with entries such as REQUIRED_FIELD = {0} is a required field INVALID_FORMAT = The format for {0} is {1} etc. and then calling them from a class that would be something like this public class UIMessages { public static final String REQUIRED_FIELD = "REQUIRED_FIELD"; public static final String INVALID_FORMAT = "INVALID_FORMAT"; static { // load configuration file into a "Properties" object } public static String getMessage(String messageKey) { // return properties.getProperty(messageKey); } } Is this the right way to approach this problem or is there some de-facto standard already in place?
