(Here be dragons, but I'll try not to mess this up...) The null hypothesis either is or isn't true. The $p$ value tells you how likely it would be to get the result (a test statistic, and hence the data you collected) you did on the test if the null hypothesis were true . Hence your suggestion to use the level of the test as the probability that the null hypothesis is true is not the correct interpretation - the null is either true or false, nothing in between. Consider a $t$-test where we are interested scientifically in whether two groups of samples differ in their means for some variable $y$. The null hypothesis in this case is that there is no difference in the means, that the two groups are drawn from the same population (or populations with the same mean). We perform the test and get a $p$ value for the test statistic $t$. If we don't care (or know, expect) if the difference in means is positive or negative (odd, but what I mean is the second group could have a smaller or larger mean than the first), then we are doing a two-tailed text and the $p$ value is the probability getting an absolute value for the $t$ statistic as large or larger than the observed absolute value of $t$ if the null hypothesis (of no difference) were true . We talk about absolute values of $t$, $|t|$, because large negative values as well as large positive ones are both evidence that the null hypothesis is not true. (If the alternative hypothesis in the above example was that we expected the mean of group two to be larger (smaller) than that of group one, then we would only consider large positive (negative) values of $t$ as evidence against the null hypothesis respectively.) In more general terms, you'll often see the $p$ value described as the probability of getting a statistic at least as extreme as the observed statistic , where extreme depends on exactly what the distribution of the test statistic is, what the alternative hypothesis is etc.
