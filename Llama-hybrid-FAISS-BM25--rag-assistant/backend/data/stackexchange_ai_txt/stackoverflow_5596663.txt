I've seen this happen before as well. However, there is a way around it. You can edit the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg for your web role and set the instance count to 0. Then set your actual web application as the startup project instead of the Azure Web Role. This will allow you to use Cassini / IIS Express instead of the Compute Emulator to develop your web application. NOTE: When you do a deployment you will have to set the instance count to something greater than one. ALSO NOTE: There are certain features you will not be able to test when running your site like this. One example is local storage. If you're using features like that in your application you can simply switch the configuration and startup project back. You'll also notice a huge speed increase when you press F5 to debug your application.
