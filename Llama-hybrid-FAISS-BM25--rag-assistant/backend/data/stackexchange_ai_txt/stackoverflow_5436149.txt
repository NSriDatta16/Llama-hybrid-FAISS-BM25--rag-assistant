kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter on Mac OS X 10.6.7

I am querying AudioQueueRef for kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter and code that perfectly worked on 10.6.6 now gives me just zeros in level.mAveragePower and level.mPeakPower. Is anybody aware of any changes in the OS? Can somebody point me to sample code that can verify that this is not working anymore in 10.6.7? Thanks, Martin
