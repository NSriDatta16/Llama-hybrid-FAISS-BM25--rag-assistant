Three20 and Core Data are for the most part orthogonal. The one certainly doesn't preclude or replace the other. They can be used together, and perfectly functional iOS apps can be built without either. In particular, Core Data is all about managing and persistently storing an object graph. Three20 is about implementing the core of the Facebook app, including lots of UI widgets, and infrastructure for fetching and displaying data that originates on the network. In many cases, you won't see both together, because the apps that want to load everything from the network often don't want to store that data on the device. But, on the other hand, I've seen people talk about implementing Three20 models backed by Core Data storage. Perhaps you can elaborate on what it is you're trying to accomplish?
