I'm the creator of Voter Universe, a new open source web application for helping political campaigns and political organizations analyze and interact with their voter data. The application is still in active development, but we expect to have our first production release in October 2009 as well as the launch of an affordably priced hosted service. The first release will not include donor management, but that functionality is a high priority item after the first release. I created a screencast a few weeks ago in advance of starting to spread the word about the application at Netroots Nation.
