To what length in the array should I go to calculate correlation function

I have a time series data (5000 entries) of a vector quantity. (i.e. 3 components, which are recorded after every fixed time interval of 240 seconds). I want to calculate the Autocorrelation function of this quantity $\langle \vec{A(t)}\cdot\vec{A(t+\tau)}\rangle $ , where $\langle\cdot\rangle$ denotes the process of averaging over whole available array. The first entry will be average of $ \vec{A_1}\cdot\vec{A_2}+\vec{A_2}\cdot\vec{A_3}+\cdots+A_{4999}\cdot\vec{A_{5000}}$ ; The second will be average of $ \vec{A_1}\cdot\vec{A_3}+\vec{A_2}\cdot\vec{A_4}+\cdots+A_{4998}\cdot\vec{A_{5000}}$ ; Third $ \vec{A_1}\cdot\vec{A_4}+\vec{A_2}\cdot\vec{A_5}+\cdots+A_{4998}\cdot\vec{A_{5000}}$ ; and so on. Doing like this; upto what length of the array should I go. Firstly I was going till the last of the array when I had only two entries; $ \vec{A_1}\cdot\vec{A_4}+A_{2}\cdot\vec{A_{5000}}$ ; but one of my friends told me, that going till the end; my statistics will not make sense. So he advised me to go till specific length say half the array length or 3/4th or something else. My question is that how to decide what length to choose. Kindly explain.
