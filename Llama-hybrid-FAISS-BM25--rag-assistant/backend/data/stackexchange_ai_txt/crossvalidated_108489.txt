You could use conditional logistic regression. That would answer if, within each subject, on average, if Variable1 is associated with Variable2. This will only work if you have enough subjects who have concordant Variable1 and Variable2 measurements. In R, library(survival) clogit(Variable1 ~ Variable2 + strata(UID)) Note that this only accounts for the correlation within subjects, not the correlation between time points, within subjects. I think you're going to be stuck using a mixed model if you need to model the correlation across time, within subject.
