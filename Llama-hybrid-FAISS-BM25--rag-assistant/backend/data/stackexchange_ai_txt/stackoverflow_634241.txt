Elegant database design help... (MySQL/PHP)

I'm building a movies website... I need to display info about each movie, including genres, actors, and a lot of info (IMDB.com like)... I created a 'movies' table including an ID and some basic information. For the genres I created a 'genres' table including 2 columns: ID and genre. Then I use a 'genres2movies' table with two columns:movieID and the genreID, to connect between the genres and the movies tables... This way, for example, if a movie have 5 different genres I get the movieID in 5 different rows of the'genres2movies' table. Its better than including the genre each time for each movie but... There is a better way for doing this??? I need to do this also for actors, languages and countries so performance and database size is really important. Thanks!!!
