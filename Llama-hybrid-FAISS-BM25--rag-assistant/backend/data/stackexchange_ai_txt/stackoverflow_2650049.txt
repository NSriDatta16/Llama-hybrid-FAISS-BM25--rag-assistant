Can you give more information about your plugin? There is a gantt chart plugin on trac-hacks.org ; is that the one you are using, or a custom one? If custom, is it available as Open Source somewhere so we can see what you are doing? If you implemented this as a wiki macro, you can use the WikiToPdf plugin to do this.
