The need for prewhiten your time series will depend on the model that you will use to analyze your data. For example, if you want to perform Pearson correlation analysis between two-time series, the pre-whitening will be needed because the autocorrelation in the time points (if it is the case) will violate the assumptions behind Pearson Correlation. For example, suppose that you get a correlation of value C12 between time-series 1 and 2. Is C12 significant? You can infer the probability of getting the result C12 by chance given the number of points in each time series. However, if there is autocorrelation in any of the time series 1 and 2, you lose the real meaning of the calculated probability. Another example, suppose that you want to apply some general linear analysis in a given times series (y) with a design matrix (x) such that y=x*beta + error. If y presents autocorrelation, it will introduce serially correlated errors, violating the Gauss Markov theorem.
