I think you have to be careful about asking whether it is "compiled" and assuming that this means that the result emitted must be "native code." This isn't what "compiled" means: "We generally say that a language is 'interpreted' when the initial translator is simple. If the translator is complicated, we say that the language is "compiled." The distinction can be confusing because "simple" and "complicated" are subjective terms, and because it is possible for a compiler to produce code that is then executed by a complicated virtual machine (interpreter)...These two characteristics - thorough analysis and nontrivial transformation - are the hallmarks of compilation." From "Programming Language Pragmatics" by Michael L. Scott. Oddly enough, this is a textbook on programming language theory that I just happened to be reading this afternoon with the page open to that quote. So, yes, C# and other .NET languages run on the CLR and they are compiled.
