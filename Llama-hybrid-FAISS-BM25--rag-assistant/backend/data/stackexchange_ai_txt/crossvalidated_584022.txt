Unsupervised learning (clustering) before supervised learning

Is it a common practice to do clustering before supervised learning to eliminate "noisy data"? Obviously, depending on the type of task. It seems like it makes sense in my case and my neural network then achieve better results. Is there any resource (paper, online article, or anything else) regarding this?
