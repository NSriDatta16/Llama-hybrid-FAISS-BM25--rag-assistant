In Oracle, is there a function that calculates the difference between two Dates? If not, is a way to display the difference between two dates in hours and minutes? Query: SELECT Round(max((EndDate - StartDate ) * 24), 2) as MaximumScheduleTime, Round(min((EndDate - StartDate) * 24), 2) as MinimumScheduleTime, Round(avg((EndDate - StartDate) * 24), 2) as AveragegScheduleTime FROM table1
