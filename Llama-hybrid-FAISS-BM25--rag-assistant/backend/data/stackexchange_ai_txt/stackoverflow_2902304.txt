I don't think checking for expiration date make much sense in Redis, though. I'd like to first suggest that you model it so you don't need to check for expiration date. If you really need it, though, you can just use another key to store the expiration date for later retrieval via normal GET/SET. Note that you can also check for EXPIRES manually in your client code, which might be a better solution.
