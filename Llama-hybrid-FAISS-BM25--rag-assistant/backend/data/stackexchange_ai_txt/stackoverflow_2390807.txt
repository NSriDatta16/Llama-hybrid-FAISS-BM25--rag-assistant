Xcode organization in finder?

I have read all the suggested StackOverflow posts on this question. It bothers me that Xcode will not organize my files in the finder the same way it does in the editor view...it will only do that if I copy files in from an external source and specifically tell it how I want things organized. Is there a way to make Xcode have the Finder respect the same organization as a default? I'd love to create a directory and then a file in that directory, and see the changes in both places. I hate opening a project and seeing ALL my files in one place.
