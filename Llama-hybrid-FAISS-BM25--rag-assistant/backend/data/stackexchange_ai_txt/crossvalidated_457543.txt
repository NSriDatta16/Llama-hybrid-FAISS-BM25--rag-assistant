Relatively fast approximations to the marginal likelihood?

Let $\theta\in{\mathbb R}^d$ be a multidimensional parameters, where $d$ can be large (e.g. $d=100$ or more). What approximations can I use for the marginal likelihood : $$\int f(x\mid \theta)\pi(\theta)d\theta.$$ The likelihood $f(x\mid \theta)$ does not seem to be log-concave, so, I am not confident of using a Laplace approximation . Also, the model is slightly complex, so I am trying to find general alternative methods that may work beyond simple linear regression models, and preferably without having to sample from the posterior. My main objective is to perform Bayesian model selection among a number of candidates.
