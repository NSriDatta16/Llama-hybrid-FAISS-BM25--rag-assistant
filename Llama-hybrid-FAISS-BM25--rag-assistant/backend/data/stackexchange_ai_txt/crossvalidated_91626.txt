Mechanism of multiple imputation?

I am trying to understand the mechanism underline multiple imputation ideas. I am confusing on creating multiple sets of estimates and then average them. For example: set.seed(123) df =0.4,1,0)) df$yimp1 If I want to impute m times to find the average estimates for x1 and x2 , in what idea to create multiple df$yimp1...df$yimpm . Why are not these estimates same in different runs? Could someone give an example for m=3 ?
