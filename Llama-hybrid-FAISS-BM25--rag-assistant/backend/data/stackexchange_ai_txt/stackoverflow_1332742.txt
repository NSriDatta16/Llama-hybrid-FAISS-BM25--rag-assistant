Magento - Retrieve products with a specific attribute value

In my block code I am trying to programmatically retrieve a list of products that have a attribute with a specific value. Alternately if that is not possible how would one retrieve all products then filter them to just list the products with a specific attribute? How would I perform a search using standard boolean filters AND or OR to match a subset of my products?
