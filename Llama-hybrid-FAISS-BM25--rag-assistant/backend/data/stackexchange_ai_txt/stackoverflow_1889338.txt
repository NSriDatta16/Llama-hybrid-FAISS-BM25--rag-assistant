To organize data in a grid-like manner, instead of making elements behave like tables, use . That's what it was invented for, and it still is the right solution. Edit: As you need to do it with LIs: It should be no problem to present your markup in a table like manner. Give the inner a width: 100%, clear: both and overflow: auto . Give the inner s float: left and either a relative or absolute width that amount to 100% of the ul.
