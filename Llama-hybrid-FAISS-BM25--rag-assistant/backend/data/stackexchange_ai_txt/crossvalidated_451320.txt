So you have a time series (or multiple time series, one for each area) of yearly counts. I would start out with Poisson regression, with $\log(10 000)$ or $\log(100 000)$ as an offset, so as to modeling rates . This is called Poisson rate regression, search this site. You must have an eye out for possible overdispersion . As for the time series aspect, look through this earlier Qs with answer . As for using R, this post Modeling multivariate Time Series Count Data in R have jags code run from R, this post have some pure R code.
