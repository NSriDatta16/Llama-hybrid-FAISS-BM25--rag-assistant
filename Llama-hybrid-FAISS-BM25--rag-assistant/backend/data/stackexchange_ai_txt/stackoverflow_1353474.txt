I got an answer through the Resin mailing list and thought that I post it here too: It seems that Resin 3 has a bug with this and there's now an issue for it . Basically the way that we tried should work, or at least it works on Resin 2. So, this should work: grant codeBase "file:/path_to_resin/runtime/work/-" { //...some jsp-specific permissions }; The dev lead for Resin said this: "Well, the security manager kills performance, so we generally discourage it." We might have to reconsider if it's reasonable to use SecurityManager at all. See my other question Should I use Security Manager in Java web applications? for more discussion on the topic.
