The reason why it's a bad practice to optimize early is you don't know where your bottlenecks will be until your website sees a significant amount of traffic. How your users access and interact with your site is an unknown at this point. It's almost always best to start with a 'good' architecture (normalized database, MVC architecture, DRY, well-written frontend code, etc) and go from there. It will be much easier to scale a clean, organized architecture than one that was prematurely optimized. At best right now you can do some load testing via ab or another load testing tool to see where your current bottlenecks are. It certainly won't find all of them, but it will find some. If you're really worried about this (and you shouldn't be yet), install Nagios or Munin on your server to monitor performance. Use a third party tool to measure page load time daily. Once you start seeing issues then you can profile and tune.
