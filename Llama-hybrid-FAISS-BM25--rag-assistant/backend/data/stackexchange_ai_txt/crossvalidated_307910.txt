Either cross validation or forward chaining is a valid approach. (Incidentally, what you call "forward chaining" is often called "rolling origin out-of-sample testing" or "rolling holdout testing" or similar in the time series literature.) I see why you could be surprised by the increase in RMSE over time. I don't think it is an artifact of your forward chaining approach. Test this: model the first half of your data using CV and predict the next year, and I strongly suspect you will get a lower RMSE than if you model all-but-the-last-year and predict the last year. The problem is that now only will your mean number of days taken off increase with the number of employees, but the variance will also increase. If you have 10 employees, all of which can take anywhere from 0 to 10 days off and will take an average of 7 days each, then the mean total will be 70 with a possible range of 0-100. If you increase your number of employees to 20, then the mean will increase to 140, but the possible range will now go to 0-200. And of course the RMSE depends on the variance of the target variable, so it will increase with a larger variance. If all you are interested in is the mean response, then you now know why the RMSE will increase, but it shouldn't be much of a concern. Alternatively, you could model the number of days taken off per employee . There, you will get the opposite effect: the variance will go down as the number of employees increases, because you get averaging effects. Yet another alternative would be to model first differences, i.e., the increase in total days taken off year-over-year. This would be especially appropriate if your employee growth is linear, because then this increase in days taken off simply reflects the days taken off by net new employees.
