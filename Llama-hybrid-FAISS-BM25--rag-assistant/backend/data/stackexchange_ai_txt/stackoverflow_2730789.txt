You could use the Ajax AutoComplete Control: http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/AutoComplete/AutoComplete.aspx . You can opt to only do a lookup if the user has typed in a certain number of characters. You'd create a static Web Method to query the collection (you could use LINQ) and return matching organizations. You'd obviously need to validate the textbox input afterwards.
