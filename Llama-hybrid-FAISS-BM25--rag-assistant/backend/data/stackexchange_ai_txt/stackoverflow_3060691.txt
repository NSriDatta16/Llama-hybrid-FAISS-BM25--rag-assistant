This isn't specific to Android, but you'd want to create a java.io.File and perhaps use a java.util.Scanner to read it (if it's text). Otherwise you'll create java.io.InputStream and work from that. Depending on what format you want to use and the nature of the data, you can also use things like java.util.Properties , XML, etc. See also Java Tutorial - Essential Classes - Basic I/O I/O Streams Byte streams Character streams Buffered streams Scanning and formatting developer.android.com links package java.io at developer.android.com Developer's guide Application resources Data Storage Shared Preferences/Internal Storage/External Storage SQLite Databases/Network Connection
