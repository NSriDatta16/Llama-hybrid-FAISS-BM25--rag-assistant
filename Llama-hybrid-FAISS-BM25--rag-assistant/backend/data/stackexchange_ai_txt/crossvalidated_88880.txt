Does the sign of scores or of loadings in PCA or FA have a meaning? May I reverse the sign?

I performed principal component analysis (PCA) with R using two different functions ( prcomp and princomp ) and observed that the PCA scores differed in sign. How can it be? Consider this: set.seed(999) prcomp(data.frame(1:10,rnorm(10)))$x PC1 PC2 [1,] -4.508620 -0.2567655 [2,] -3.373772 -1.1369417 [3,] -2.679669 1.0903445 [4,] -1.615837 0.7108631 [5,] -0.548879 0.3093389 [6,] 0.481756 0.1639112 [7,] 1.656178 -0.9952875 [8,] 2.560345 -0.2490548 [9,] 3.508442 0.1874520 [10,] 4.520055 0.1761397 set.seed(999) princomp(data.frame(1:10,rnorm(10)))$scores Comp.1 Comp.2 [1,] 4.508620 0.2567655 [2,] 3.373772 1.1369417 [3,] 2.679669 -1.0903445 [4,] 1.615837 -0.7108631 [5,] 0.548879 -0.3093389 [6,] -0.481756 -0.1639112 [7,] -1.656178 0.9952875 [8,] -2.560345 0.2490548 [9,] -3.508442 -0.1874520 [10,] -4.520055 -0.1761397 Why do the signs ( +/- ) differ for the two analyses? If I was then using principal components PC1 and PC2 as predictors in a regression, i.e. lm(y ~ PC1 + PC2) , this would completely change my understanding of the effect of the two variables on y depending on which method I used! How could I then say that PC1 has e.g. a positive effect on y and PC2 has e.g. a negative effect on y ? In addition: If the sign of PCA components is meaningless, is this true for factor analysis (FA) as well? Is it acceptable to flip (reverse) the sign of individual PCA/FA component scores (or of loadings, as a column of loading matrix)?
