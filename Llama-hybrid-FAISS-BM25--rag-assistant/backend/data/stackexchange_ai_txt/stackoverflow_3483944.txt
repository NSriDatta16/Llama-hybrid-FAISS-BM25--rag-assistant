Two models using the same table but with conditions in CakePHP

I have two models that I would like to save in the same table. For instance I have a status model and a payschedule model both should be saved in the statuses table. But at retrieving the status model should return only the records with payment = 'no' and the payschedule only records with payment = 'yes'. I will have a before save in each model to make sure that the correct payment value is saved to the table. My question is how can I restrict the retrieval from the table on the model to the constraints explained above without having to do it at each find() operation? ps I you have not figured it out, I am a CakePHP noob.
