I think you are describing the procedure known as one-versus all (ova). I outlined the steps in this question . It is usually a way of using binary classification algorithms for multiclass problems. It may be worthwhile to note that fitting separate binary classifiers may not be what you want if your goal is to predict future observations that fall into any class. Therefore, a binary classification must be constructed at each iteration of cross-validation. Also note that random forests can be sensitive to class imbalance, which you may have with 12 classes.
