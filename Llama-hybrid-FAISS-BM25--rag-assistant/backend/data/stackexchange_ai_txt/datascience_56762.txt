t-SNE is computationally expensive, more than PCA. Many examples might use PCA just to simplify the problem. Moreover, it is explained here : If the data set is high dimensional, doing principal component analysis is recommended because otherwise the curse of dimensionality can be an issue. TSNE makes the assumption of local linearity which might not hold in high dimensions where the manifold may be varying and PCA can help alleviate this issue by reducing the dimensionality of the data. In other words, it seems that t-SNE suffers from high dimensionality of your data. It is typically used to represent a manifold in 2-3 dimensions, not tens or hundreds like, for example, PCA. It's mostly a visualization tool IMHO. On the googling part, I suggest you to search only for the most relevant elements of your search, not for articulated sentences. I googled something like: "why pca before tsne" and it was enought to find useful stuff. Browsers don't need syntactic coherence, just the right keywords.
