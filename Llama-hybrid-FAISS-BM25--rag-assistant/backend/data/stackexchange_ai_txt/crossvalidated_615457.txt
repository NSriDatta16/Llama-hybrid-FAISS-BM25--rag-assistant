How to stationarise a univariate time series in R when auto.arima gives a model to fit that doesn't stationarise it?

I am currently working on a univariate time series that I try to modelize (following the Box-Jenkins methodology, I try to identify the model before I estimate it, using correlograms, in order to later validate it by running PP, ADF tests and so on, and finally, to make previsions). Yet I have trouble to modelize it in a stationary framework. Here is my code : auto.arima(log_prod_periode_1) # ARIMA(2,1,2)(2,1,1)[12] library(lmtest) # Fit the ARIMA model spe I get the , which indicates that the model fitted isn't sufficient to stationarize my series which is in logarithm (I have already transformed it as the AIC and BIC were lower when i fitted auto.arima to the time series in log than when I fitted it to the initial time series). Could anyone indicate how I could solve this problem ? Here is the structure of my dataset :
