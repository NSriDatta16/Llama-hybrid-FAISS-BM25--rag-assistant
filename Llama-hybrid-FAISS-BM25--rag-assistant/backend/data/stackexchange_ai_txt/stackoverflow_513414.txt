2 other options you might consider - Hsqldb is a small sql db written in java. More relevant for your purposes, it can be configured to simply write to a csv file as it's data store, so you could conceivably use it's text output as a portable datastore and still use sql, if that's what you prefer. A second option might be to write the datastore directly to a serialized file either directly or through a library like prevayler. Very good performance and simple to implement, cons are the fragility and opacity of the format. But if the data is small enough, xml is probably much less bother.
