learning the relative order of elements

I have a list of elements with very little information about them. These elements are ordered and I need to find the correct order. All I can do is to submit a query with a hypothesizes complete order and get a score (between 0 and 1) which represents how far is my ordering from the true ordering, without any information about which part of the ordering is correct/incorrect. This seems like a standard kind of a problem, but I couldn't find info about that. Is there a strategy/algorithm that can generate queries based on past answers to minimize learning time and maximize score achieved? I thought that learning to rank algorithms should help, but their formulation seems far from what I need, although I might have missed something. I am also looking at some reinforcement learning algorithms However, any references/hints/help will be appreciated. For simplicity, let's assume that the score you get for a hypothesized ordering is the percentage of correct pair orderings. however, as this is a statistical learning qustion, you should also consider that there is some noise, and the score you are given is the true score plus some unknown, but typically small random noise. Thanks.
