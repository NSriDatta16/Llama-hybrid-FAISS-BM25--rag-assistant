Large coefficients does not mean anything themselves. Suppose that your store announces a one-day discount and you want to discover the effect of that on sales. If your variables and ARIMA (lags, etc) explains the time series behaviour very well (low AIC/BIC), a large coefficient could tell how much of sells were caused by the discount. But with high AIC/BIC, large coefficients could mean just lack of covariates, and bad choice of ARIMA parameters. If the theorical model does not translate reality to math, the hipothesis will lead to wrong coefficients. Remember that Flag1 and Flag2 just moves the time series level/mean, case 1, and does nothing case 0.
