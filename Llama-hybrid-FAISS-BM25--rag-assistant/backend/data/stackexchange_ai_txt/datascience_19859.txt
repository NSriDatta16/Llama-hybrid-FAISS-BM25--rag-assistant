Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning on Coursera is terrific. I'm doing it right now, and he has wonderfully gauged student understanding. He helps you along and doesn't skip lots of steps. It apparently is not his goal to convince you of how smart he is - he's more concerned with explaining everything clearly. Highly recommended!
