Given a time series for many unique IDs, I need the top 100 deltas for each period

I have a time series of data in TSV like so: ID \t Date \t Value ------------------------------- 1234567 \t 2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z \t 121 12131 \t 2009-06-01T00:00:00.000Z \t 151 12131 \t 2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z \t 15153 ... It easily fits in RAM, but is too big for Excel. There is one value per month per ID, but not all IDs have entries for all 12 months. The data spans 12 months, but not all IDs have all 12 months. I want to go through the data for each ID, and if there is an entry for the previous month, take the current month minus the previous month and store it in a new column to get a delta. If there is no entry for the previous month, then return 0. Then, for each month, I want the top 100 positive and negative of those deltas, along with the ID. I'd like to do this in R, because it's hard in Excel and it keeps crashing. I have R, Rattle, etc. installed and I've worked through basic examples, but ... the learning curve is steep. I would really appreciate some help :)
