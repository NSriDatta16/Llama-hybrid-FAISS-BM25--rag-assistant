Searching for java "A to T, T to A" found this suggestion : String sequence = "AATTTCTCGGTTTCAAT"; sequence = sequence.replace("A", "t") .replace("T", "a") .replace("C", "g") .replace("G", "c") .toUpperCase(); System.out.println(sequence); This is a simple and concise solution that works for your specific situation and will have acceptable performance if your DNA strings are relatively short. For a more general solution for handling large amounts of data you should iterate over the characters one by one and build a new string. Or as polygenelubricants pointed out - consider a storage format that only uses 2 bits per base instead of 16.
