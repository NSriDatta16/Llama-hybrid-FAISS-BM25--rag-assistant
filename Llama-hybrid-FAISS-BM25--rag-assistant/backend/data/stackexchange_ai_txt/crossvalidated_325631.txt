The easiest way would be to train a fully connected neural network on randomly ordered inputs, ideally on all permutations. EDIT: Alternatively, if you ask for a design of a network that is order invariant, you can do the following: You would need to do a 1D convolutional neural network, where the stride size is equal to the array length of each individual X. You can then stride over the network and assess each X. In the case you present, I assume each X is scalar, so the stride size would be 1. However, the disadvantage of this approach is, that each Xn would only be considered by itself, independently of all other X. The convolutional layer will have filters that are equally applied to all X, but the different X are not conneted with each other. Have a look at this example.
