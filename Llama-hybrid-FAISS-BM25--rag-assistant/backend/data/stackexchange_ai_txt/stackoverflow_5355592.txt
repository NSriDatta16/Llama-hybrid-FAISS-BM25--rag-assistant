Bayesian Network: Independance and Conditional Independance

I'm having some misunderstanding concerning Bayesian network. My main misunderstanding are independence and conditional independence!! If e.g. I have to calculate P(Burglary|Johncall) , is it P(Burglary|Johncalls)=P(Burglary) because i'm seeing that Burglary is independent of Johncalls??
