Assuming json is the variable containing JSON text, use Jayrock.Json.Conversion.JsonConvert.Import(json) . What you will get back in return is either a JsonObject , JsonArray , JsonNumber , System.String , System.Boolean or a null reference depending on the root JSON value in the source JSON text. If you know it is going to be a JSON object for sure then you can safely cast the return value or use JsonConvert.Import (json) . I would discourage working against JsonObject directly unless you particularly depend on one of its features. You should just pretend the JSON object you get back is a dictionary; either IDictionary or IDictionary . With the latest version for .NET Framework 4, you can also work with a JsonObject as a dynamic object.
