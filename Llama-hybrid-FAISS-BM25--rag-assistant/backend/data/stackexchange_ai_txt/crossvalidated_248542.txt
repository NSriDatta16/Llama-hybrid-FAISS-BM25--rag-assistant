independent censoring

Independent censoring is one of the fundamental assumptions in the survival analysis. However, I cannot find any test for it or any paper which discusses how real that assumption is. I would be grateful if anybody could point me to some useful references. I have found the following paper as an interesting reference but it is not freely available. Leung, Kwan-Moon, Robert M. Elashoff, and Abdelmonem A. Afifi. "Censoring issues in survival analysis." Annual review of public health 18.1 (1997): 83-104. Any feedback would be much appreciated. Kind regards DK
