How to choose between variations of EfficientDet

In the Tensorflow 2 Object Detection API model ZOO , there is 7 versions of the EfficientDet: Being new to deep learning, I don't understand very well what is the difference and how to choose the best one for my application (detecting buildings from satellite imagery). I haven't been able to find much info on this online. Question: How do these differ and how does one decide which one to choose?
