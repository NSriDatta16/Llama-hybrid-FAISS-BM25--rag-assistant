Recommendations - Scheduling software/components .Net

I'm starting a new back office scheduling app for a doctor's office. .Net 3.5. I'm trying to save time and money. Can anyone recommend a suite of tools (Infragistics, etc) that are best of breed for a scheduling application? More advanced than that, if anyone has a codebase they are willing to share or sell the base of, I would be interested in talking...
