is it allowed to rerun your entire predictive model?

Hi i am new to r and I have made a predictive model for the iris dataset (using the multinom function from the package nnet). When i ran the model for the first time I got an accuracy score 0f 0.9667, but when i rerun the (entire) same code I am getting different accuracy scores (0.933, 0,9667 and 1). Because of this occurance I think that i might be violating some rules of machine learning. My questions are: - Is it allowed to rerun your model? - Why do i get different accuracy scores for the same code? #set random seed set.seed(42) #shuffle run indices dataset rows
