A question about precision

We have 2 Classification models (Random forest on balanced Data Set), the first one classify a Bank's client as a Churner (closing his account) or an active client, the second one classify a Bank's client as a dormant (inactive) account holder or an active client. We have tested the model on a data set, and we have two confusion matrices. What's the Precision of every model? and is there a way estimate the precision of the two models?
