To demonstrate the principle the results are applied to the generalized two-sample Behrens-Fisher problem for testing equality of the means under general non-parametric heterogeneous error distributions. Within this setting we propose a permutation version of the Welch test which is an extension of Pitman's two-sample permutation test. These results are special cases of a conditional central limit theorem for studentized permutation statistics which also applies to asymptotic power functions. https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01595-5 (free access) Noguchi, K., Konietschke, F., Marmolejo-Ramos, F. et al.

Behav Res 53, 2712–2724 (2021). https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01595-5 Abstract: Recent replication crisis has led to a number of ad hoc suggestions to decrease the chance of making false positive findings. Among them, Johnson (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110, 19313–19317, 2013) and Benjamin et al. (Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 6–10 2018) recommend using the significance level of α = 0.005 (0.5%) as opposed to the conventional 0.05 (5%) level. Even though their suggestion is easy to implement, it is unclear whether or not the commonly used statistical tests are robust and/or powerful at such a small significance level. Therefore, the main aim of our study is to investigate the robustness and power curve behaviors of independent (unpaired) two-sample tests for metric and ordinal data at nominal significance levels of α = 0.005 and α = 0.05. Through an extensive simulation study, it is found that the permutation versions of the Welch t-test and the Brunner-Munzel test are particularly robust and powerful while the commonly used two-sample tests which utilize t-distribution tend to be either liberal or conservative, and have peculiar power curve behaviors under skewed distributions with variance heterogeneity. https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/ye2d4/providers/osfstorage/60dee6c3f83de20290afec7b?action=download&direct&version=2 for PDF or online viewer: https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ye2d4 (free full text) Karch, J.

The present paper establishes conditional and unconditional central limit theorems for various resampling procedures for the t-statistic. The results work under fairly general conditions and the underlying random variables need not to be independent. Specific examples are then the m(n) (double) bootstrap out of k(n) observations, the Bayesian bootstrap and two-sample t-type permutation statistics. In case when m(n)/k(n) is bounded away from zero and infinity necessary and sufficient conditions for the conditional central limit law of the bootstrap t-statistics are established. For high resampling intensity when m(n)/k(n) tends to infinity the following general result is obtained. Without further other assumptions the bootstrap makes the resampled t-statistic automatically normal. The results are based on a general conditional limit theorem for weighted resampling statistics which is of own interest. http://129.217.131.68:8080/bitstream/2003/40978/1/Diss.pdf Lubna Amro, Resampling-Based Inference Methods for Repeated Measures Data with Missing Values, Dissertation in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doktor der Naturwissenschaften submitted to the Department of Statistics TU Dortmund University, 2022 It discusses various aspects of resampling tests.
