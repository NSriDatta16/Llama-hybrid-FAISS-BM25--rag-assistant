wxpython ogl package drag event

I'm testing the ogl package in wxpython. I want to drag a shape. And when I do drag it, I want a second shape to move at the same time. The problem is that I have not found a move/drag event. Only pre and post move events. The only solution I can think of is to hide the second shape, and redraw it at the new position when the dragging is done. And is the ogl package no longer maintained?
