What is the meaning of rank in the context of change-detection?

In a technique that uses CUSUM for change-point detection in this paper , the first step is given below: Let $x_1, x_2,..., x_n$ be the $n$ samples in an event-series. The samples are ranked in increasing order and the rank $r_i$ for each sample is calculated. In case of ties, we assign average rank to each sample. The cumulative sums are computed as: $S_i = S_{i-1} + (r_i - \bar{r})$. If the ranks are randomly distributed, then there is no change-point. However, if there is indeed a change-point in the event-series, then higher ranks should dominate in either the earlier or later part of the event-series. I am not quite sure I understand the meaning of rank in this context. For instance, if n=10 and my data points are: 5, 2, 4, 1, 9, 2, 9, 2, 10, 1 can someone please clarify what is really being done here? Sort in increasing order: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 5, 9, 9, 10 Assign Average Ranks to break ties: What does this step mean? Assign Final Ranks: What does this step mean?
