Just make closure a DateTime? instead of a DateTime . The whole point of Nullable is to make a nullable type from a non-nullable one. Now, you haven't shown the type of SelectedDate - but if it's already a DateTime? then you don't need to use ?? at all. Just: DateTime? closure= dateDatumIspisa.SelectedDate; How familiar are you with nullable value types in general? You might want to read up on the MSDN coverage of them .
