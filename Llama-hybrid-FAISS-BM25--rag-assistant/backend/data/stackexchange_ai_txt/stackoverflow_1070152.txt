I assume you save your procedure definitions to a text or .sql file that you then version control. You could always use something like notepadd++ to find/replace the strings you want then commit them as a production/customer tag. This is not elegant, but an option. I don't know of any third party tools and my google searches returned the same result as the other posters posted.
