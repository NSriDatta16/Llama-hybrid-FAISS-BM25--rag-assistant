The technical term for the process you describe is called reverse geocoding . Google offers the The Google Geocoding Web Service New working Google Geocoding Link , where you can do reverse geocoding on the server side, instead of in JavaScript on the client-side. For example, if you try the following URLs in your browser, you would get back the latitude and longitude of the postcode passed in the q parameter, in CSV format: http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=SL59JH,+UK&output=csv&sensor=false http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=LU13TQ,+UK&output=csv&sensor=false This is how you would be able to reverse geocode your postcodes in php, for example: $url = 'http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=SL59JH,+UK&output=csv&sensor=false'; $data = @file_get_contents($url); $result = explode(",", $data); echo $result[0]; // status code echo $result[1]; // accuracy echo $result[2]; // latitude echo $result[3]; // longitude Note that as Pekka suggested in another answer , the Google Maps API Terms of Use seem to prohibit the storage of the results , unless the store acts as a cache for data that will used in Google Maps. You may want to get in touch with Google and enquire on the Google Maps API Premier to have more flexible terms of use for your geocoding requirements.
