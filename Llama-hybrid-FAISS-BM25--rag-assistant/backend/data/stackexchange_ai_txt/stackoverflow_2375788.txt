if you want to get fancy and use XPath 2.0, it is more elegant (but potentially confusing, depending who might be reading the code) to write it like this: link[@rel='alternate'][@type = ('application/rss+xml', 'application/atom+xml')] the reason for this is that XPath 2.0 redefines '=' to apply to sequences, which means that the above comparison returns true if there is one match when comparing items from the left-hand sequence with comparing items from the right-hand sequence. this can be very useful if the list of things you want to compare with is dynamic.
