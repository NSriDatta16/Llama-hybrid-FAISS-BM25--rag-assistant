Is Wald Z test two tailed?

I would like to ask you whether the Wald Z test which is used in context of null model for multilevel logistic regression is actually two-tailed or not. So far, I've found that Wald has chi-square distribution which is one-tailed, but I have not been able to find anything about the situation when there is value for Wald Z . I want to test the null hypothesis whether the variance in second level is actually statistically significant different from zero. Also, if the Wald-z is two-tailed, can I divide the p-value by two so I get just the right p-value for $H_{0}$ (the variance in second level is actually statistically significant bigger than zero)?
