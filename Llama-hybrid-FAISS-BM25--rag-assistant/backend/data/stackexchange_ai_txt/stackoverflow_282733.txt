can UPDATE clause in MYSQL using PHP update multiple records in one query?

well i have this messages table with sample values like these: msg_id recipient_id read locked new 0 1 N Y Y 2 1 Y N N ok, so lets just say this is a messaging table, and i want to reset all messages addressed to recipient with id=1 i was wondering why UPDATE `messages` SET `new`='Y',`read`='N',`locked`='N' where `recipient_id`=1; doesn't work, MYSQL always returns 0 affected rows... can anyone help me? to robert gamble: yes, im sure the values were changed, since my purpose for this update query is to reset the data i was using for the testing phases :D
