IÂ´m pursuing a PhD in this area so far I can tell that: Industry is mostly based on robust yet simple models: AWS offers a solution that as far as I can tell uses ARMA based models ( AWS Forecast ) ETAP uses probably a Markov Model that also includes information about weather for the forecast ( ETAP Forecast ) Scheider probably uses a ARMA-Based Model alongside some Markov it also can use weather information ( Schneider Forecast ) Also I've talked with Small retailers them provide ARMA Based and few talk about Machine Learning Models. In Research there is a complete different story. Some Suggestions use CNN + LSTM ( CNN 1 , CNN 2 ) But personaly I prefer models based on Multiresolution decomposition + LSTM like ( MRA + SVR + LSTM and MRA + LSTM ) So far I've not found a common dataset for benchmark because most researchers uses their own collected data and also have not found a baseline model. Nevertheless most of them use the Mean Absolute Percentage Error as Metric and try to reach a MAPE Best Regards and keep in touch. My Github
