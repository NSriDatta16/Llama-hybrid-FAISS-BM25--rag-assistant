Which recommended Perl modules can serialize Moose objects?

I was usually using Storable with nstore , but now I have a module that has CODE and apparently Storable doesn't like that. I found YAML (and YAML::XS which I can't really get to work ). I also experimented a bit with MooseX::Storage without much success. Are there other alternatives? What would you recommend?
