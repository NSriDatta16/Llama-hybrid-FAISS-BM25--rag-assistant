We are using Blob storage for CQRS Views backing up ASP.NET MVC 2 Web client (and desktop client as well). Some more details This is in production and is a great improvement over the previous version of views (NHibernate over SQL Azure) It handles simple indexing and querying as well. For more complex scenarios I'm considering using subset of Table Storage functionality (only for really large sets that can't be partitioned).
