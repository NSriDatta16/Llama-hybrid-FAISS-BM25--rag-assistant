Central Limit Theorem - does the number of times the samples are taken matter in terms of the CLT?

Let's say that in R, we generate $n$ random variables $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ which all follow an exponential distribution. We then construct the mean $\bar{Y_n}$ . The process is repeated $m$ times, so we end up with $m$ averages: $\bar{Y_n}^1, \dots , \bar{Y_n}^m$ . The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean will approach a normal distribution as $n$ , the sample size, gets larger. What does the Central Limit Theorem say about the size of $m$ ? I have tried running it in R, with a fixed (large) value of $n$ and varying $m$ , and it seems like the plot approaches normality. I've included two of them here. However, I'm confused since the formula $$X_n = \frac{\bar{ Y_i} - \mu}{\sigma - \sqrt{n}}$$ doesn't refer to how many times the process is repeated. So, does the number of times the samples are taken matter in terms of the CLT? (In case the formatting doesn't work, the plots below show $n=100, m = 50$ and $n=100, m = 500$
