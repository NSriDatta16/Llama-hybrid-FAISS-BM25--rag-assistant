Explaining multicollinearity in layman's terms

Say we have a study where we want to run a logistic regression on a group of people, and we want to find out whether one attribute of a person makes them more likely to be a smoker. So we have smoker yes/no as the dependent variable and let's say we have weight and gender as independent variables. From this information, I'm guessing weight and gender are introduce collinearity because men generally weigh more than women, and therefore are not independent variables. Is this correct? If so, I'm confused because I thought a regression controls for the other variables, so it seeks to look if men are more likely to smoke, regardless of their weight - and whether overweight people are more likely to smoke, regardless of gender. Or do I have it all wrong?
