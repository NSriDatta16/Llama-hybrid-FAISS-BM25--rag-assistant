Calculate expected values using logistic regression coefficients

The outcome of the logistic model is binary (0;1) - intervention that occurs in hospital (3838 interventions in 51096 cases). I am modeling the effect of age groups (60 to 74; 75 to 89 and 90+) and sex (female) on the outcome. My reference age group is male aged 18-59. My logistic regression coefficients look like this: intercept -4.313 female 0.5117 age 60-74 0.4081 age 75-89 1.1761 age 90+ 1.5612. Corresponding odds ratios: female 1.668 years60_74 1.504 years75_90 3.242 years90 4.764 Now I am trying to obtain a probability of an outcome = 1 for each case. What is the right way to do this?
