Download attachment issue with IE6-8 wih no SSL

I'm facing an issue with file download with IE6-8 in non ssl environment. I've seen a lot of articles about the IE attachment download issue with ssl. As per the articles I tried to set the values of Pragma, Cache-Control headers, but still no luck with it. These are my response headers Cache-Control: private, max-age=5 Date: Tue, 25 May 2010 11:06:02 GMT Pragma: private Content-Length: 40492 Content-Type: application/pdf Content-Disposition: Attachment;Filename="file name.pdf" Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 I've set the header values after going through some of these sites KB 812935 KB 316431 But these items are related to SSL. I've checked the response body and headers using fiddler , the response body is proper. I'm using window.open(url, "_blank") to download the file, if I change it to window.open(url, "_parent") or change the "Content-Disposition" to 'inline;Filename="file name.pdf"' it works fine. Please help me to solve this problem
