Dependent continuous and categorial predictors in logistic regression

Given a set of variables (continuous and factors with more than two levels) I would like to show that one continuous variable (age) correlates in a certain sense with the professional status (a factor with levels: clerk, worker, retired and other). The target is credit default as indicator. I think it is misleading to have both age and the prof.status in the model as retired and age are strongly related. Age is not related to the other classes. If the professional_status were a continuous varible then correlation could show that one should not have both variables in the model. I have the impression that age and the status retired compensate each other in a similar way as correlated continuous variables would What are statistical approaches that a continuous variable and a factor (with more than 2 levels) are in relation that therefore a logistic regression should not contain both. What I have tried: I cut age in bins and looked at default reates grouped by age bins times work satus Regressions of Default on age and work satus w/o interaction: the coefficient of the indicator for "retired" loses significance. and with interaction term: hard to describe :) $age * retired$ is significant on a 10% level.
