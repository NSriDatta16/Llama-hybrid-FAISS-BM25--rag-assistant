From the spec section 7.8.1.1 Exact-width integer types , paragraph 1: The typedef name int N _t designates a signed integer type with width N , no padding bits, and a twoâ€™s complement representation. Thus, int8_t denotes a signed integer type with a width of exactly 8 bits. And from: 7.18.1.2 Minimum-width integer types , paragraph 1: The typedef name int_least N _t designates a signed integer type with a width of at least N, such that no signed integer type with lesser size has at least the specified width. Thus, int_least32_t denotes a signed integer type with a width of at least 32 bits. And finally from 7.18.1.3 Fastest minimum-width integer types , paragraph 2: The typedef name int_fast N _t designates the fastest signed integer type with a width of at least N . The typedef name uint_fast N _t designates the fastest unsigned integer type with a width of at least N.
