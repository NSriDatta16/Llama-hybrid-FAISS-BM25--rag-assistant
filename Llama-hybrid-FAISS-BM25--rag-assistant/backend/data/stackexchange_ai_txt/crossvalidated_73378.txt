Reciprocal roots and eigenvalues relationship in time series

I came across a result in a time series textbook the other day and have not been able to understand why it is true (the authors don't give a proof but just state it as true). I want to show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathbf{G}$ given by $$G= \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1&\phi_2 &\phi_3 &...&\phi_{p-1} & \phi_p\\ 1 & 0 &0 &...& 0 &0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 &... &0 &0\\ \vdots & & & \ddots&0&0\\ 0 & 0 &...&...&1 &0 \end{pmatrix} $$ correspond to the reciprocal roots of the $AR(p)$ characteristic polynomial $$\Phi(u)=1-\phi_1u-\phi_2u^2-...-\phi_pu^p$$ The one thing i was able to deduce is that the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{G}$ must satisfy $$\lambda^p-\phi_1\lambda^{p-1}-\phi_2\lambda^{p-2}-...-\phi_{p-1}-\phi_p=0$$
