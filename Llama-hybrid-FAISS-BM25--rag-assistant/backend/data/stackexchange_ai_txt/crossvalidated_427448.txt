Autoencoder reconstruction error threshold

I have a set of signals on which I have to implement an anomaly detection algorithm. The data is split among a reference period (i.e. last 3 months) and a test period (i.e. last week). I've already built an autoencoder model which is trained (and validated) with the data on the reference period. Then the test period is scored. I would like to know how to make an "indicator" (single number) of how the two distribution look alike, or how "anomalous" is the second distribution compared to the first one. I have calculated the reconstruction error in the training set and in the test set for each point (calculated as the squared distance between the original and the reconstructed point), as well as the MSE in both sets of course. Things I've tried: get the ratio of MSEs (>1 means the second distribution is "anomalous", but how much? what threshold can I set?) get the 95% percentile of both the error sets and get the ratio count the points beyond the 95% percentile of both the error sets and get the ratio but none of these seems a good stable indicator. What would you recommend?
