According to the Oracle JDBC Developers Guide - 14.6 Working with BFILEs : BFILEs are read-only. You cannot insert data or otherwise write to a BFILE. You cannot use JDBC to create a new BFILE. They are created only externally. So it seems that you need a separate tool/method to upload the data to the Oracle storage directory, which probably makes BFILE a bad choice for your scenario.
