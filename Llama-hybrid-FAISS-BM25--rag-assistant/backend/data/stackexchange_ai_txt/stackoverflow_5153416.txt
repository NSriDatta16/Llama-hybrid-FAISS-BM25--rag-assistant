Mirth Connect Script to Re-process Errors?

We have to go through and re-process connection-type errors in Mirth Connect. Is it possible to have a script somewhere that re-processes with these restraints? Can't reprocess Transformer Errors Can't keep reprocessing connection-type errors when interface is down I was thinking of a script launched manually that would go through the feeds with errors and reprocess the valid connection-type errors. Is this possible? Thank you :) Todd
