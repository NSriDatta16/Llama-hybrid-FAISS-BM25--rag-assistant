Scrapy is a great Python library which can help you scrape different sites faster and make your code structure better. Not all sites can be parsed with classic tools, because they can use dynamic JS content building. For this task it is better to use Selenium (This is a test framework for web sites, but it also a great web scraping tool). There's also a Python wrapper available for this library. In Google you can find a few tricks which can help you use Selenium inside Scrapy and make your code clear, organized, and you can use some great tools for Scrapy library. I think that Selenium would be a better scraper for Linkedin than classic tools. There is a lot of javascript and dynamic content. Also, if you want to make authentication in your account and scrape all available content, you will get a lot of problems with classic authentication using simple libraries like requests or urllib .
