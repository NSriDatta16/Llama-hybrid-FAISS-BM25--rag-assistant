What is a "real" programming language?

Recently a teacher said "PHP isn't a real programming language", but only gave, in my opinion, weak justification: It's not compiled. It's scripted. It doesn't run on every platform. Is PHP not considered a "real" programming language? What is a "real" programming language? Must a language be compiled to be taken seriously? Background I did an induction lesson into my A-Level Computing Class in school two days ago â€“ we're using Java for the first year of the course. I'm unfamiliar with Java but have a pretty good grasp on general programming fundamentals (variables, functions, object-orientation, loops, etc.). Our first task the teacher ran through ridiculously fast. She didn't bother to explain any of the concepts, how they work, or what you would realistically use them for, and seemed to take great pleasure in watching most of the students (who were, on the whole, new to programming) squirm in their seats at not having the vaguest idea what she was on about. In hindsight, I reckon she went through it incredibly quickly to see who could really "handle" taking Computing A-Level, since students still have a chance to change their subjects before September begins. The first and only task was to write a Java command-line application to convert binary to denary (decimal). We had a two-hour taster session to do this, and after explanation how the binary system works we had to begin, despite, on the whole, nobody really having the foggiest idea where to begin. After an hour some were further than others, but nobody had really achieved anything significant. The teacher herself became so confused she called in another teacher from next door. He came round to help people and see where to go next. Without bragging, I probably did have the most experience in the class and had gotten the furthest in the exercise. He asked me if I'd had any previous experience; I said yes, particularly in PHP, and jokingly commented that I could write something to convert binary to denary in just a few lines of PHP, whilst the Java application was rapidly growing into several screens of code. He replied, "PHP isn't a real programming language!"...! After some discussion, he gave the three reasons above. However, I pointed out you can run PHP on any platform that runs Apache, but I don't think he really knows what Apache is and was having none of that!
