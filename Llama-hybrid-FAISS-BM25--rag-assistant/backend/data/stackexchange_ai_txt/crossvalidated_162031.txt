Does the order of rotations matter in rotating PCA loadings (by-hand)?

Suppose I have retained 3 principal components, and I want to rotate their loadings by hand (yeah, that's rare, but it is commonly used in Q Methodology ). Does it matter in which order I rotate the component pairs? Say, I first rotate component 1 vs 2 by 45°, then take the resulting loadings and component 1 vs 3 by -90°. Will the final result be different if I proceed the other way around (first 1 vs 3, then 1 vs 2)?
