The suggestion that Bayesian methods use more information from the data than the sufficient statistic is false . For any Bayesian model with data vector $\mathbf{x}$ and sufficient statistic $\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{x})$ you can use the Fisher-Neyman factorisation for the sufficient statistic to get the posterior form: $$\begin{align} \pi(\theta | \mathbf{x}) &\propto \pi_0(\theta) L_\mathbf{x}(\theta) \\[6pt] &= \pi_0(\theta) h(\mathbf{x}) g_\theta(\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{x})) \\[6pt] &\propto \pi_0(\theta) g_\theta(\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{x})). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ As you can see, the posterior distributon is a function of $\mathbf{x}$ only through the sufficient statistic $\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{x})$ . This is something that happens in every Bayesian model , and it is really just a manifestation of the likelihood principle . Contrary to the quotation given in your answer, it is classical methods (not Bayesian methods) that sometimes disobey the likelihood principle and use inference procedures that have regard to other aspects of the data outside of the sufficient statistic. Of course, when you move outside parametric models, things become more complicated. The secondary suggestion that a non-sufficient statistic is noisier than a sufficient statistic is not true in general . Indeed, in any parametric model, the statistic $T=3$ exists and is non-sufficient and it has no noise whatsoever (it is constant so has a variance of zero). Perhaps here the author has in mind some particular sub-class of non-sufficient statistics, but they are not specified, so I would simply ignore this assertion unless you think you can intuite the sub-class of statistics they have in mind. Finally, the assertion that Bayesian estimators are always admissible is true so long as the model is correctly specified. This is a well-known and desirable property of Bayesian estimators. You can find a discussion of this topic in Robert (2007) (Ch. 8, pp. 391-426) if you would like to know more.
