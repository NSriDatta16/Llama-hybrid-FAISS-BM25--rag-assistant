The one solution I've found is to put them in an IFRAME . So instead of embedding your form inside the page: .. form content create a new ASPX file like this: .. form content Then in your original page, you'll refer to it via an IFRAME : Some things you'll need to do: Make sure that you do not include any inside the new ASPX file. Adjust the size of the IFRAME and the ASPX file to be exactly the same For the FORM in the new ASPX files, you probably want to set target='_top' to ensure when a user fills in the form, the result is in the main window rather than inside the IFRAME .
