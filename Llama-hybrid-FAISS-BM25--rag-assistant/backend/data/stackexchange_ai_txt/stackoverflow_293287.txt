As explained in this CSS font size article: Ideally? The very best unit of measure is NONE AT ALL! Let the user-agent determine the display according to the user's preference - BUT! We also know that with most designs, this is not a very practical approach. Personally? I prefer the "mix 'n match" flexibility of .em and .px - As user-agents become more "user-friendly" designer sizing will NOT be as potentially problematic OR controversial as it stands now. Do not forget though relative font size can be used for other things than... font size! css image text wrap css em scale image
