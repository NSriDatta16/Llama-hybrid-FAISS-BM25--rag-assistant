Make tabs movable in Qt

I want to make an application in Qt where the tabs in the QTabBar can be "undocked" so they will become a floating window, or can be dragged into another QTabBar and "transfer" into that QTabBar. My aim is to let the user completely customize the interface by dragging modules around into each other. If you have ever used Adobe After Effects CS5, it has the exact effect I'm looking for. It allows you to drag a tab and make it float as it's own window, dock it into another tab page and do a lot more. So, if anyone could point me in the right direction on how to go about this, or even where I would begin that would be great!
