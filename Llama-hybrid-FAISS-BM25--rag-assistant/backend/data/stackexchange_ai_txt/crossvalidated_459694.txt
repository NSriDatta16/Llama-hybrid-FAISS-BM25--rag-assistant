Predicting correct match for short French and English descriptions

I have a training and test set of food descriptions pairs (please, see example below) First name in a pair is a name of food in French and second word is this food description in English. Traing set has also a trans field that is True for correct descriptions and False for wrong descriptions. The task is to predict trans field in a test set, in other words to predict wich food description is corect and which is wrong. dishes = [{"fr":"Agneau de lait", "eng":"Baby milk-fed lamb", "trans": True}, {"fr":"Agrume", "eng":"Blackcurrants", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Algue", "eng":"Buttermilk", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Aligot", "eng":"potatoes mashed with fresh mountain cheese", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Baba au rhum", "eng":"Star anise", "trans": True}, {"fr":"Babeurre", "eng":"seaweed", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Badiane", "eng":"Sponge cake (often soaked in rum)", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Boeuf bourguignon", "eng":"Créole curry", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Carbonade flamande", "eng":"Beef Stew", "trans": True}, {"fr":"Cari", "eng":"Beef stewed in red wine", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Cassis", "eng":"citrus", "trans": False}, {"fr":"Cassoulet", "eng":"Stew from the South-West of France", "trans": True}, {"fr":"Céleri-rave", "eng":"Celery root", "trans": True}] df = pd.DataFrame(dishes) fr eng trans 0 Agneau de lait Baby milk-fed lamb True 1 Agrume Blackcurrants False 2 Algue Buttermilk False 3 Aligot potatoes mashed with fresh mountain cheese False 4 Baba au rhum Star anise True 5 Babeurre seaweed False 6 Badiane Sponge cake (often soaked in rum) False 7 Boeuf bourguignon Créole curry False 8 Carbonade flamande Beef Stew True 9 Cari Beef stewed in red wine False 10 Cassis citrus False 11 Cassoulet Stew from the South-West of France True 12 Céleri-rave Celery root True I think to solve this as text classification problem, where text is a concatenation of French name and English description embeddings. Questions: Which embeddings to use and how concatenate them? Any other ideas on approach to this problem? BERT? Update: How about the following approach: Translate (with BERT?) French names to English Use embeddings to create two vectors: v1 - translated English vector and v2 - English description vector (from data set) Compute v1 - v2 Create new data set with two columns: v1 - v2 and trans Train classifier on this new data set Update 2: It looks like cross-lingual classification may be the right solution for my problem: https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM#iv-applications-cross-lingual-text-classification-xnli It is not clear yet from the description given on the page with the link above, where to fit my own training data set and how to run classifier on my test set. Please help to figure this out. It would be ideal to find end-to-end example / tutorial on cross-lingual classification.
