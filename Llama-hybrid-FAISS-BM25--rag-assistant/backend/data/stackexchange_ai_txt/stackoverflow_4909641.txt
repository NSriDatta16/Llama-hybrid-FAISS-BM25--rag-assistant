My answer won't help you that much, but can bring some hope ;) For code metrics we use Sonar , it integrates CheckStyle, PMD, FireBugs and some other plugins (like Cobertura etc.), to see it in action click here . It can be integrated with Hudson, and there is plugin to send emails but they are as you said, just links to dashboard. There is also jira report opened, feel free to vote, as well as describe what you need (if you decide to use Sonar). PS. there are a lot of addition plugins for sonar, just have a look
