Text indent after the first line in a paragraph

- A Reuters reporter in Surkhrod district in Nangarhar province, where villagers said the raids took place, said Afghan police fired at the crowd after some of them started throwing stones at local government buildings. In the above paragraph, I would like to use CSS to make all lines after the first line to automatically indent some space so that each line stays right after the - in the first line. HTML - A Reuters reporter in Surkhrod district in Nangarhar province, where villagers said the raids took place, said Afghan police fired at the crowd after some of them started throwing stones at local government buildings. It's similar to a list item with list position set to outside, but I don't want to use a list. What is the simplest way you can think of to achieve this effect? Less extra html markups will be better. Many thanks to you all.
