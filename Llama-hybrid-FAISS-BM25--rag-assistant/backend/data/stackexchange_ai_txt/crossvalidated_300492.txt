Deterministic classifier and input features

I call the function estimation based classifiers as deterministic, the ones which estimates the $f(x) = a'x+b$ directly, rather than estimating the conditional or joint probabilities directly. For example, SVM outputs a score which corresponds to $f(x) = a'x+b$ and the classification rule is $sign(f(x))$. Now, my question is, since the original formulation is based on estimating a function $f(x)$, does this implicitly means that the input is non-ambiguous ?. To be clear, support I got two input features, $x_i$ and $x_j$, and corresponding labels $y_i$ and $y_j$. Suppose $x_i = x_j$ but $y_i \neq y_j$. In case of density estimation based approaches like logistic regression, it makes sense to use this data, as output is a probability function. But in case of function estimator based approaches, how can we use this data ?. I know there are ways to convert svm scores to probability values, but the original formulation is based on function estimation.
