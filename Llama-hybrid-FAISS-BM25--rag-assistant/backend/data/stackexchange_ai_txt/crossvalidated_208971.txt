There is not much literature on semi-structured document parsing. You can approach it with Named Entity Recognition but all the pre-trained models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) won't suit your needs since they aim at PEOPLE, ORGANISATION, and some other basic classes. Building a training set for your kind of data to train such models is very costly (time consuming mostly). And if you try to automate the process to annotate and build your training set, then you have solved the problem... This problem is really non-trivial (at least to solve with a generic approach), and is overlooked in the literature. I know some guys who are specialized in that. Their examples are much similar to yours. Maybe you can drop them a mail to learn about some techniques to solve this problem: their website http://www.scriptminer.com/
