Tools: Dev environment - Visual Studio 2010 Professional - quite an obvious choice given that the latest tool is a big improvement over 2008 edition, especially in terms of performance. There are a few quirks still (waiting for SP1!) but it is mostly a pleasant and productive experience. SQL Management Studio Express - for DB management Source control and Project Management - Team Foundation Server 2010 - really going all out with MS here, leveraging our Bizspark membership, TFS 2010 has cool new features including branching/merging, shelfing (vs checking in) and much better transactional integrity than VSS. Also the project management tools are pretty good - there are various templates you can choose depending on whether you want to go Agile, or traditional. Mantis - for bug tracking, but we are phasing this out and trying to move to TFS. Figuring out how to migrate existing data though. Libraries: Asp.net Ajax - pretty cool for what we need, simple ajax effects are quite easy to achieve. Testing: MS Test - in built in Visual studio, much better than previous releases - Unit testing support is far better. Debugging: Visual Studio Debugger IE Developer tools
