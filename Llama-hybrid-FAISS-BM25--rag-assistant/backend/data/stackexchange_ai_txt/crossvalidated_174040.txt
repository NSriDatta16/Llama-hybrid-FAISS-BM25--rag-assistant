Which model do we select ultimately if we are performing leave one out cross validation

In leave one out cross validation, if I have 10 data points, and I am trying to fit a linear regression model (as an example), then I generate 10 different models, each time using 9 data points and testing the model on the 10th data point. After that, do I just select the model that gave the lowest error? or do I take an average of the coefficients of the 10 different models for my final model?
