ARIMA model with delay in fitting and constant prediction

I am trying to use ARIMA (Python, statsmodel ) on the following time series, values are collected with a weekly frequency: 2018-01-05 2.253999 2018-01-12 1.943268 2018-01-19 2.186222 2018-01-26 2.096893 2018-02-02 2.078723 2018-02-09 1.916794 2018-02-16 1.895745 2018-02-23 2.126000 2018-03-02 2.280271 2018-03-09 2.013397 I have no experience on ARIMA and just following generic suggestions on how to find p,q and d. I can see the TS has a decreasing trend: and differentiating with lag 1 ( train.diff() ) makes it stationary, hence d=1 . The ACF and PACF plots (of the differentiated TS), show negative autocorrelation at lag 1 and together with the partial autocorrelation dropping after lag 1, I'd chose q=1 (MA = 1). So, ARIMA(p=0, d=1, q=1) model = ARIMA(train, order=(0, 1, 1)) model_fit = model.fit() The model summary: ARIMA Model Results ============================================================================== Dep.

It suggests a delay in fitting the values to the TS. Furthermore, when forecasting the next values ( model_fit.forecast(9) ) I obtain an almost constant prediction value. I also tried adding p=1 but results did not improve. Is the TS having random patterns, hence impossible to predict? Am I missing something?
