Short answer, you need to (a) send it as -H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded". (b) specify the parameters as Object[field]=value - for example User[name] would refer to the name field in some user object. (c) [Not Required because you use curl] encode the parameters and POST/PUT them. Encoding the parameters The encoding is simple enough and although curl will do it for you, it's useful to understand it. I've quoted an extract from the W3C spec... " application/x-www-form-urlencoded This is the default content type. Forms submitted with this content type must be encoded as follows: Control names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced by +', and then reserved characters are escaped as described in [RFC1738], section 2.2: Non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by %HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., `%0D%0A'). The control names/values are listed in the order they appear in the document. The name is separated from the value by =' and name/value pairs are separated from each other by &'. " Simple Example (New User Form) The example below is how to send a simple "New User" form. If I have fields in the user object for name, password, email etc, I specify them like this ... user[firstname]=chris&user[login]=cmccauley&user[company_id]=8&user[email]=&user[surname]=mccauley then curl will escape them to give ... user%5Bfirstname%5D=chris&user%5Blogin%5D=cmccauley&user%5Bcompany_id%5D=8&user%5Bemail%5D=&user%5Bsurname%5D=mccauley ... before posting them like this extract from a wire dump ...
