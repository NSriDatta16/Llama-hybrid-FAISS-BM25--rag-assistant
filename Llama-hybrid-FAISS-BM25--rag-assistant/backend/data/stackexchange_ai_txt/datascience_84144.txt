Sklearn allows you to build your own pipeline steps (and estimators if you so choose). If you get comfortable with how the Pipeline object framework works it's infinitely configurable. It also allows you to rely on pre-built algos. To operate this way you will need to be comfortable with object-oriented programming in python rather than a script-based approach. Take a look at how to create custom pipeline steps in this helpful blogpost: https://towardsdatascience.com/pipelines-custom-transformers-in-scikit-learn-the-step-by-step-guide-with-python-code-4a7d9b068156
