Problem with touch in cocos2D

Hey guys, i ready many many questions about that point, but i really didn't get the right one yet. So.. this is the problem.. This is my first project with cocos2d, so sorry for that. I have one scene called Gameplay inside that i have one Layer with the name Grid and inside of this grid, have many many Block (Layer too). I need check when you touch one Block , i do this before with Interface Builder, so when i call touchesBegin i have the exact touch in one view. But in cocos2D, i understand you have to check the position of the objects, and not hit test then right?! So my touchesBegin is like this: - (void)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; //location = [[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate: location]; for(int i = 0; i The first Problem is: This looks upsidedown! When i click in one of this blocks at the first line! I get the block at last line!! I Really dont get that! And the hit not seens perfect to me! And when i convertCoordinate this going even worst! Someone can help me?! And sorry for bad english =/
