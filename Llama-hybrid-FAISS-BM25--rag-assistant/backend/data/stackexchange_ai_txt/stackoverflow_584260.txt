In your actionPerformed method it'd be fine to just disable the menus and then start the thread - but you shouldn't be enabling the menus again in the same function. Rather, you'll need to trigger the enabling of the menus when the thread finishes. I would suggest, at the end of your agent thread, calling SwingUtilities.invokeLater() with a Runnable that will reenable the menus.
