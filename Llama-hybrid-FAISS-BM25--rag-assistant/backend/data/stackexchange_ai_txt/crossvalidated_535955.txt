How do I write the Jeffreys prior for error variances in stan? $p(\mu, \sigma_1^2, \dots, \sigma_C^2) \propto \Pi{ \sigma_i^{-2}}$

I need to model the Jeffreys prior for error variances in a heteroscedastic ANOVA design in rstan . That is to say, $\pi(\mu,\sigma_1^2,\dotsb,\sigma_C^2)\varpropto\Pi_{i=1}^{C}\sigma_i^{-2}$ . Is the following setting correct? target += -2 * sum(log(sigma)); It seems not, because my current codes return an MCMC divergence warning. Thank you for the kind comments.
