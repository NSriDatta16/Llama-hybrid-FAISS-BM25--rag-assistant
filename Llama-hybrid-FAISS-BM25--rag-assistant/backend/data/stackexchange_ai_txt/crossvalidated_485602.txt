Random Forest creating normal distribution out of not normal data

Im experiementing with machine learning and my target vairable has a distribution shown below Not your standard normal distribution. When I train a random forest model on it the predictions from the model follows the below distribution which is not the same sort of distribution at all. I was under the impression that random forest models are robust to having data which isnt normally distributed? Is it because my training dataa doesnt have enough representation in the extremes? Any thoughts how I can correct this would be great
