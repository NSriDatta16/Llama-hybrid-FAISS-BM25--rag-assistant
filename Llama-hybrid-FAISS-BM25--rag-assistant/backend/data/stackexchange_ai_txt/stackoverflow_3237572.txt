You could use the async option for this to make each request synchronous (= halt script execution until each request is finished): async By default, all requests are sent asynchronous (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false. Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation. Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active. but, as the docs already say, this is highly discouraged, as it could freeze the browser if a request hangs or times out. It would be better to change the architecture of your code in a way that can work with the classical callback functions if at all possible.
