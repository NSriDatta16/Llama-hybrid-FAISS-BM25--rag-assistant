One-class KNN for Quality Control

I've come across this paper https://uta-ir.tdl.org/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/1827/Sukchotrat_uta_2502D_10083.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y] where it is described a k-Nearest Neighbors Data Description (kNNDD)-Based Control Chart. (pag 45) First, the author describes the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method and then the $K^2$ chart, where the control value is defined as the average euclidean distance of a point from its k nearest neighbors. I can't really find a connection between the LOF algorthm and this control value. Am I wrong?
