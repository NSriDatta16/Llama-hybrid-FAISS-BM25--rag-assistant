Are all .class files in my Java application loaded into memory after application start?

I am making an app for Android, in my Activity I need to load an array of about 10000 strings. Loading it from database was slow, so I decided to put it directly into one .java file (as a private field). I have about 20 of these classes containing string arrays and my question is, are all the classes loaded into memory after my application is started? If so the Activity in which I need these strings would be loaded quickly, but the application as a whole would have a slow start... Is there other way, how to very quickly load an 10000 string array from a file? UPDATE: Why I need these strings? My Android app allows you to find "journeys" in Prague's public transit - you choose departure stop, arrival stop and it finds your journey (have a look here ). My app has a suggestions feature - you enter leter "c" as your departure stop and a suggestions ListView appears with stops starting with "c". For these suggestions I need the strings. Fetching the suggestions from database is slow (about 400ms on G1).
