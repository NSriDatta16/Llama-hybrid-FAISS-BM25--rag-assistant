I believe this is possible, but then you're limited by what Spring MVC's convention-over-configuration will do. I think that the bare minimum is that your controller be annotated with @Controller , and also a class-level @RequestMapping annotation. The individual public methods on that class are then mapped by name. If the methods do not return a view or view name, then the view name will be inferred from the method name. The documentation doesn't really go into this, though, you're very much encouraged to use method-level annotations, to keep things explicit.
