The difference is that in MCMC algorithm, e.g. Metropolis-Hastings (or many others), there is a target distribution that the algorithm converges to. You can use it to sample e.g. from normal , or gamma distribution, circular one, joint distribution from a regression model , or even much more complicated ones. In case of M-H algorithm you have proposal distribution that is used for drawing random values that are accepted or rejected based on some target density. If you wanted to compare them, with using random walk instead of algorithm such as M-H, then you'd be drawing values from proposal distribution and accepting everything. With random walk you draw values that are "random" , you cannot use it to sample from some prespecified distribution.
