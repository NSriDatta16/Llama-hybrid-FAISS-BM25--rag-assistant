I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but if you have handwritten text, so the word 'cat' can be written in many different ways, you could train an object detector like YOLO or Faster R-CNN to detect this word (e.g. on your data or OS dataset like ICDAR2015-FST) or even separate characters therein. If, on the other hand, yo want to identify unseen words and classify them into one of the classes, I don't think it's possible.
