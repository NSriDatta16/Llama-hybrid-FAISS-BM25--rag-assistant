Would it be possible to just expose the foreign key instead of the entire object in a @ManyToOne interface

@Entity public class Organization {} @Entity public class User { @ManyToOne Organization org; } The @ManyToOne interface in the above code is modeled as " Organization org ", even though only the organization id is stored in the database. Can't I just model this as Integer orgId so that I can avoiding loading the entire Organization object for persistence sake. Sometimes when we bulk import users for different Organization(s), more time is spent loading Organization(s) rather than user persistence itself. Would like to know, how others are handling this issue.
