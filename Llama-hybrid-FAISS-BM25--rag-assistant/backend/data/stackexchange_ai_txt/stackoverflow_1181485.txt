Disabling a menu item isn't a cosmetic display issue, it does just what you'd expect from the term - it disables the menu item. When disabled, the menu item is effectively inert - it will not raise the click event, and there's no (straightforward) way to make it do so. I can guess at your motivations - to explain to your users why the particular menu item is unavailable to them - but you'll need to find a different approach, one that works with the system, not against it. Some possible approaches ... Leave the menu item disabled, allowing the user to select it - you can then make a role based choice on how to handle the event. Disable the menu item and provide feedback elsewhere in your UI telling the user what level of access they have. Display a tooltip with the reason for disabling the control Leave the menu item enabled, but change it's display to look inactive (this is hard to achieve 100%); this will allow the events to fire and your handler to be invoked Create a separate "Explain" menu item, perhaps on the "Help" menu; when invoked, all disabled menu items become enabled, and will explain to the user why the command is unavailable. Some systems display a line of help text relevant to the highlighted menu item on the status bar - you could leverage this to explain availability: "Maintain customer details (requires Administrator role)"
