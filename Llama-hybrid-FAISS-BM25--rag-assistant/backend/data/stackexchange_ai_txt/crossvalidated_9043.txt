What is the English name for a statistics term that I'm looking for?

I'm helping my father to translate a text from my own native Latvian language to English. Even though I'm a fair English speaker and have a bit of mathematics in my past, I never did have a firm grasp of statistics. :( The term I'm looking for has something to do with error calculation. A GPS device is measuring coordinates and then trying to estimate the error. In wikipedia I've come across two different likely terms - Mean squared error and Root mean square error . From what I can understand, they are not one and the same thing, but what each of them means is beyond me. A direct translation from Latvian language would be "average (mean?) squared error estimate". No idea what that means either, I'm afraid. Perhaps someone here has a better idea?
