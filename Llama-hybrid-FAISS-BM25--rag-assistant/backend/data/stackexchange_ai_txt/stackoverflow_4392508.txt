You don't need to upcast Circle to Shapes . (BTW, why Shapes but Circle ?) If you don't want your Circle class implement its own getName method, just don't override it. If you need to override getName method for something else, you may want to add getNameInSomeContext to your Shapes class, and override it in derived classes if necessary.
