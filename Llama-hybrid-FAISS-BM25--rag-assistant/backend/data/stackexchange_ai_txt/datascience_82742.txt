Predictive output with your own model built

I would need to better understand how can be created a machine learning algorithm from scratch using an own model developed based on boolean values, for example # of words in a text, # of punctuation, # of capital letters, and so on, to determine if a text is formal or informal. For instance: I have Text there is a new major in this town WTF?!? you're a great person. Really glad to have met you I don't know what to say BYE BYE BABY I created some rules to assign a label on this (small) train dataset, but I would need to understand how to apply these rules to a new dataset (test): if there is an upper case word then I; if there is a short expression, like don't, 'm ,'s, ... , then I; if there are two symbols (punctuation) close to each other, then I; if a word is in list of extra words, then I; otherwise F. Suppose that I have a dataframe to test and to assign these labels (I or F): FREEDOM!!! I don't need to go to school anymore What are u thinking? Hey men! I am glad to hear that. how could I apply my model to this new dataset, adding labels? Test Output FREEDOM!!! I don't need to go to school anymore I What are u thinking? I Hey men! I I am glad to hear that. F Update after mnm's comment: Would it be considered a machine learning problem the following one? import pandas as pd import numpy as np data = { "ID":[1,2,3,4], "Text":["FREEDOM!!! I don't need to go to school anymore", "What are u thinking?", "Hey men!"," I am glad to hear that."]} # here there should be the part of modelling df['upper'] = # if there is an upper case word then "I" df['short_exp'] = # if there is a short exp then "I" df['two_cons'] = # if there are two consecutive symbols then "I" list_extra=['u','hey'] df['extra'] = # if row contains at least one of the word included in list_extra then 'I' # append cols to original dataframe df_new = df df_new['upper'] = df1['upper'] df_new['short_exp'] = df1['short_exp'] # and similar for others It is not clear, however, the latest part, that one based on condition. How can I predict the new values for the other texts?
