First you need to define the criteria that makes '624' correct. Is it the average count(*) ? Is it the count(*) that occurs most often? Is it your favorite count(*) ? Then you can use the HAVING clause to separate the ones that don't match your criteria: SELECT proc_id, count(*) FROM proc WHERE grouping_primary = 'SLB' AND eff_date = '01-JUL-09' GROUP BY proc_id HAVING count(*) <> 624 ORDER BY proc_id; or: SELECT proc_id, count(*) FROM proc WHERE grouping_primary = 'SLB' AND eff_date = '01-JUL-09' GROUP BY proc_id HAVING count(*) <> ( ) ORDER BY proc_id;
