Can't drop table that was just created

I created a table named dual2 . I've a rows there, and can select from it. When attempting to drop it, it produces this error: ERROR at line 1: ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1 ORA-00942: table or view does not exist However, the table still exists! It returns from dba_tables and user_tables . Any ideas on what's happening here?? alt text http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/6012/28140463.png Here is the script of table creation, that i got with plsql developer: -- Create table create table ( DUMMY VARCHAR2(1) ) tablespace SYSTEM pctfree 10 pctused 40 initrans 1 maxtrans 255 storage ( initial 64K minextents 1 maxextents unlimited ); P.S.: p.cambell thanks for editing! and sorry for my bad english :)
