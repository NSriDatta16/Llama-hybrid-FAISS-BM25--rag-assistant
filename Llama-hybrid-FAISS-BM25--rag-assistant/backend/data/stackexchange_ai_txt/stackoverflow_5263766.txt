How to use Github with Xcode4's version control

The whole implementations seems very unstable. Sometimes I can push, sometimes it fails with 'no permission'. Cloning through Xcode's Organizer behaves even stranger: The first time, it fails with no permission. When I click 'try again', it fails with some weird error like can't store object BLABLA: No such file or directory . If I click 'try again' another time, it succeeds. Same behavior for Xcode's git and for a fresh homebrew-installed git (1.7.4.1). Is this a problem on Github's side or is this a problem in Xcode?
