Pros/Cons to increasing the scope of a repository instance?

The title to this question isn't written very well. Sorry 'bout that. I'm curious what the pros or cons would be to increasing the scope of an object instance within a method to the class level. As a specific example, I have a non-static service class that wraps access to a repository class which is used to manage CRUD activity as well as some other tasks that don't necessarily mix well with other business logic. As I'm building this out, each method creates it's own instance of this repository. Assuming an average amount of traffic (nothing huge), I'd like to know if there's any benefit to creating a class level instance of this repository in the service class' constructor as opposed to the method level scope I'm currently using. This app is not currently using DI, although that might be an option. I'm also considering making the class static, but I have some other hurdles to jump through before that's an option. Thanks in advance.
