How much time will xgboost model take?

I have run xg boost model on R. Dataset has 130 columns and 130,000 observations. I have run xgboost model with default parameters, like this- xgb_model It has been running for 2 hours. How much time will it take generally? Is it so complex? Can someone explain me in lucid way ,what exactly happens inside xgboost algo ?
