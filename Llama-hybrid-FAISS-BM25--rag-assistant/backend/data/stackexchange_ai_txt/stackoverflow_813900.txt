How can I manipulate a web page (re-arranging some HTML controls) through the Browser?

I want to be able to open my website and use some kind of firefox plugin to re-arrange some Html on the site by drag-and-drop and be able to use that modified source. I used to use a css plug-in but do not remember it anymore. Are there any cool tools or plugins avaiable?
