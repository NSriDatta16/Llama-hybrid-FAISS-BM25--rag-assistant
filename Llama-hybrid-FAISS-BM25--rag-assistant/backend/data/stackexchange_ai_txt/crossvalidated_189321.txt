As a addition to Tim answer, I would note that Gelman and Robert wrote in the paper "The perceived absurdity of Bayesian inference" ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.5366v2.pdf ) in Section 4 called "The doomsday argument and confusion between frequentist and Bayesian ideas" that the doomsday argument (and Gotts one) is essentially a frequentist and not a bayesian view: For our purposes here, the (sociologically) interesting thing about this argument is that it’s been presented as Bayesian (see, for example, Dieks) but it isn’t a Bayesian analysis at all! The ”doomsday argument” is actually a classical frequentist confidence interval. And explain in plain english why. Moreover, they also comment that The doomsday argument is pretty silly and also, it’s fundamentally not Bayesian. I am no such an expert to claim these two points but as both Gelman and Robert agree on that, I think it is good to know...
