Does principal component analysis (PCA) lead to p-hacking?

My knowledge of principal component analysis is only conceptual; I know nothing about the nuts and bolts of how it works. I learned about it from its use in sociolinguistics, as in Horvath & D. Sankoff (1987), and what I gather from their description is that PCA is basically an automated method of determining which factor is most strongly associated with a given variable of interest. This sound to me a lot like making the process of p-hacking a bit easier, although it doesn't seem to suggest that PCA inevitably leads to p-hacking as one could simply describe their study as exploratory to avoid accusations of p-hacking. But, am I correct in thinking that, in cases where a researcher is not describing their study as exploratory, the use of PCA would essentially be an automated method for p-hacking?
