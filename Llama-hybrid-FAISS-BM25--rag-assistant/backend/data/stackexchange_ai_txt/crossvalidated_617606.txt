How do you use mathmatical way to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?

My question come across from this post: How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Is there any mathmatical or statistical way to prove that my machine learning problem is hopeless? I have a project which tries to predict binary classes (0 and 1). However, I try the several models (some DL and classical ML) but model always give 50% of val_accuracy, which the models do not learn well. I have tried fine-tuning, feature engineering, dimensional reduction, and normalization/ stadardization, but it did not work. How can I use mathmatical or statistical way to prove my ML problem is hopeless or is just not preditable?
