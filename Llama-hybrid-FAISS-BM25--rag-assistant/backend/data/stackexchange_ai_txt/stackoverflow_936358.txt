In playing around with your page in Firebug, changing the following allowed me to drag and drop: .toolbox { /*position:absolute;*/ height:700px; width:324px; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; border-color:Black; } .drop { height:700px; width:700px; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; border-color:Black; /* the following updated or added */ margin-left:328px; position:absolute; top:132px; } Removing position:absolute moved your div.drop element below your div.toolbox, which may be the weirdness you were referring to from Dave's answer. Everything I updated in the css for .drop is just repositioning the div.
