I don't believe I can offer what you're looking for, but the first step is to use the repeated individual_id as a variable to ensure that each individual is in 1 partition. For example if you're using cross-fold validation, then an individual should only show up in 1 fold and not be spread out amongst the others. As far as what machine learning algorithms to try - that is ultimately up to the data. In my experience though, I think your best results will come from some sort of boosted tree such as LightGBM or xGBoost. This will lead to you deciding how to encode the categorical variables, for which I recommend category_encoders library in python, if you're using python. I'm sure there's interesting and novel ideas around RNN's but to be honest I don't think this problem is suited for that type of algorithm. This sounds like a classic regression problem to me.
