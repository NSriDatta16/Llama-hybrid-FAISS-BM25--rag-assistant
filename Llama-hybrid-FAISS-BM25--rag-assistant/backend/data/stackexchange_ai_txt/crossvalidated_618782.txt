Why is there only a box constraint on alpha and not on mu when solving the dual problem of soft linear SVM?

I am currently learning about the linear SVM in the non-separable case. In the dual representation, we introduce the Lagrange multipliers μ k and α k (see also this source: https://machinelearningmastery.com/method-of-lagrange-multipliers-the-theory-behind-support-vector-machines-part-2-the-non-separable-case/ ). Both my course notes and the above source say that the following should hold: c - μ k - α k = 0. But then without further explanation they go on and say 0 ≤ α k ≤ c. Since μ k is a Lagrange mulitplier and thus ≥ 0, how is the only a box constraint on α k sufficient?
