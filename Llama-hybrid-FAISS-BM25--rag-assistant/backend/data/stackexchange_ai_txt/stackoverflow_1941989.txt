flash as3 drag and drop with inertia

I want to imitate the iPhone scroll behavior in a Flash app I am developing. The idea is to enable drag-drop with a certain amount of inertia/deceleration (you know, when you drop something while your cursor is still moving and the thing would continue moving for a moment and then stop). I am using the TweenMax library for my animations. Any ideas will be appreciated. Thanks
