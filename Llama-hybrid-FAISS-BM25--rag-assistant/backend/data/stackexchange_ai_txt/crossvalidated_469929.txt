Machine learning models, with the exception of neural networks, generally do not use the GPU. However, some algorithms can utilize multiple cores/threads. This depends on the algorithm. If the algorithm can easily be broken into multiple independent processes which don't depend on each other's output, then it can be run in parallel. For example, with a random forest, you can train multiple trees at the same time on different threads. For other algorithms, like SVM, it is more difficult or impossible without changing how the algorithm works (see PSVM). Scikit-learn's support vector classifier does not support multi-threading, as an example. However, if you're training multiple models, such as multiple SVMs, you can always train them in parallel.
