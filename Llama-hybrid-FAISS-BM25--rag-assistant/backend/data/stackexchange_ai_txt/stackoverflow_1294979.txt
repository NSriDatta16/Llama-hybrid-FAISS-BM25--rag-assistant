The performance tradeoff would basically be what you described: If you modified the structure to store a rank, queries would be very, very simple and fast. However, this would require some overhead any time "points" changed, as you'd have to verify that the rank hasn't changed. If the ranking had changed, you'd have to do multiple updates. This causes more work (with the potential for bugs) at every update/insert. The tradeoff is very fast reads. If you're typical usage is very few modifications compared to millions of reads, AND you found this query to be a bottleneck, it might be worth considering reworking this. However, I would avoid the added complexity and maintainability headaches unless you truly found this to be a problem, since the current solution requires less storage, and is very flexible.
