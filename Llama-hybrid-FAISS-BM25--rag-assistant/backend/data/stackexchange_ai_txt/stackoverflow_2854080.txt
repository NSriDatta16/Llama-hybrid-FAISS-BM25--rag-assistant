For Django models, is there a shortcut for seeing if a record exists?

Say I have a table People , is there a way to just quickly check if a People object exists with a name of 'Fred' ? I know I can query People.objects.filter(Name='Fred') and then check the length of the returned result, but is there a way to do it in a more elegant way?
