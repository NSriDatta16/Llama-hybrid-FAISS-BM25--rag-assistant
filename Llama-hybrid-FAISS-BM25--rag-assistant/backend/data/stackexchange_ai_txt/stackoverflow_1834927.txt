Since date's inherently include time, you're going to have to modify the NSDate object itself by converting it into its NSDateComponent s, blanking out the HH:mm:ss , and then converting those date components back into an NSDate. For example: NSDate * aDate = [NSDate date]; NSDateComponents * components = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] components:(NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit | NSDayCalendarUnit) fromDate:aDate]; NSDate * convertedDate = [[NSCalendar currentCalendar] dateFromComponents:components]; If you do this, you'll lose things like timezone offset, so you might want to consider the side effects of that. The nice thing about this method is that it works regardless of how the string is formatted (which is a fragile thing to rely on).
