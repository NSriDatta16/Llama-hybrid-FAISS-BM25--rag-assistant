Answer to question 1: The magnitude of seriousness is best assessed in a contextual way (i.e., should consider all factors contributing to validity). The magnitude of seriousness should not be assessed in a categorical way. An example is the notion of a hierarchy of inference for study designs (e.g. case reports are lowest and RCTs are categorically highest). This type of scheme is frequently taught in medical schools as an easy heuristic to quickly identify high quality evidence. The problem with this type of thinking is that it is algorithmic and overly deterministic in reality the answer is itself overdetermined. When this happens, you can miss the ways in which poorly designed RCTs can yield worse results than a well designed observational study. See this easy to read review for a full discussion of the above points from the perspective of an epidemiologist (Rothman, 2014) . Answer to question 2: Be very afraid. To simply reiterate what others have already said and to quote (roughly) from Richard McElreath's elegant introductory text on critical thinking in statistical modeling : "...all models are false, but some are useful..."
