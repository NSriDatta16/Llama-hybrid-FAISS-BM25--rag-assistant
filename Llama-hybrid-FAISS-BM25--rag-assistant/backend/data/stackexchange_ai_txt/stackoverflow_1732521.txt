I believe I read there is a bug (not necessarily confirmed) in the CVS import if your 'short_description' is more than a sentence or two long, it causes problems elsewhere. You've got long, long descriptions, but you didn't mention how short, your short descriptions are. Could you try importing with a one sentence 'short_description', then see what happens. I'm not sure the protocol of recommending a commercial product here, but there's a windows program (I run it in vmware) that does imports/exports with a direct connection to the magento database, skipping the long-winded dataflow api). I've imported products from there in much faster time frames without issue. I've never had to deal with long descriptions, though. It's not cheap at $200, but the time saved has been worth for it for me. It's the first result for 'magento manager' in google. Have you confirmed by creating by hand a single product with a huge description that magento doesn't choke on it?
