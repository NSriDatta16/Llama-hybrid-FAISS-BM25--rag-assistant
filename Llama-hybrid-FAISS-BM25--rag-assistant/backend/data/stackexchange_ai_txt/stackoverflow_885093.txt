I think I understand what you're asking here. Let me know if I'm off base. I think the easiest way to fix this is in the select statement to get your data from the database, but it might not necessarily be the best method. Here's what I've come up with: Since your "DateFrom" is in the format of "MM/yyyy", you won't be able to do a straight CAST() operation. The best way to get a valid DATETIME value, that I can think of, is to parse the current DateFrom column and treat all dates as the first of the month, then you can set a Format of "MM/yyyy" on the datagrid column, and it will still render properly. The CAST() statement could be something like this: SET DATEFORMAT MDY SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING(DateFrom, 0, CHARINDEX('/',DateFrom)) + '/1/' + SUBSTRING(DateFrom, CHARINDEX('/',DateFrom) +1, 4) AS DATETIME) AS DateFrom I know this isn't the most elegant method, but it should work as long as your date format is consistent . Good luck!
