Programs that update their scrolling region "live" as the user drags the thumb are handling the sb_ThumbTrack code for the wm_HScroll and wm_VScroll messages. Those that only update when the user releases the thumb are handling the sb_ThumbPosition code. There's a compromise on those two options, which is to update after the user hasn't moved the thumb for a little bit, even if the user hasn't actually released it yet. Handle sb_ThumbTrack , and then set a timer. If the timer fires, update the display. If another sb_ThumbTrack arrives, reset the timer.
