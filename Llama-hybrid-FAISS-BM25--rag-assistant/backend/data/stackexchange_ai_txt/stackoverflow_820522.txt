Adding a new answer to make sure a notification is sent for it. Using a subreport is the easiest method when it works. You can simply drag and drop a subreport onto a table cell, and it will fill that cell's content area. Right-clicking on the subreport will allow you to edit the parameters for the subreport. Like most values in SSRS, the parameters can be set to expressions which use the fields in the table. Within the subreport, just filter your results to show only the records associated with the employee who was passed in as a parameter. The other route you can take is to merge your two datasources using a join. This will give you data something like this: employee1 time1.1 employee1 time1.2 employee1 time1.3 employee1 time1.4 employee2 time2.1 employee2 time2.2 employee2 time2.3 You can then create a group on the repeated columns (employee in this example), and enable the HideDuplicates property on those columns. The result will look like this: employee1 time1.1 time1.2 time1.3 time1.4 employee2 time2.1 time2.2 time2.3
