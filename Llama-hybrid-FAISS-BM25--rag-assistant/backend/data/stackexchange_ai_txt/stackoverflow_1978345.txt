Mostly you would like to use a profiler. The post pointed by Fragsworth is a good start. Personally, I prefer Shark for Mac OS X, and gprof for Linux. But in your case, you may also call clock() or getrusage(), for example, in this way: clock_t t = clock(); for (i = 0; i Profiler is useful when you want to dig out which part of code takes most time. Calling clock()/getrusage() is more convenient (to me) when you want to compare/benchmark different implementations.
