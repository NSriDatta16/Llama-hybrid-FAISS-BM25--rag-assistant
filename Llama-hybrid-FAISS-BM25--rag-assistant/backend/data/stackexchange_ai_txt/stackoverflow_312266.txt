As others have pointed out, it's not just the cost of the storage. The length of a column will affect the number of rows per page. Having fewer rows per page means that fewer can fit into your caches, which drops performance. I am assuming that in MSSQL, a NVARCHAR column which is indexed will use up more space in the index. Which means fewer index entries per block, therefore more blocks in the index, therefore more seeks when scanning (or searching) indexes, which slows down indexed access too. So it loses you performance on every single front. If you genuinely don't care (or can measure the performance and are happy with it, of course), then that's fine. But if you have a genuine requirement to store unicode characters, of course, use NVARCHAR. I may be that the maintainability gained by using NVARCHAR throughout your database outweighs any performance cost.
