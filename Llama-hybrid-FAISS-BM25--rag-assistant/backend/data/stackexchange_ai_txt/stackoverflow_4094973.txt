My question is if this method will effect in a negative way on my pages' rankings, considering the paragraph I quoted above that the best way to do a redirection is through the .htaccess. No , it will not provided that you implement the redirection correctly in your PHP file! I.e., you should probably look up the Name (by uid ) before issuing the 301 header (and only issue this when a Name is found — otherwise it's a 404 ). Also, why don't you run a query on your database, output the redirects in .htaccess format and write this directly to the .htaccess file? This way you'll have to do it only once and wont have to care about non-existing uid 's. Edit — pseudocode str ← "" for each (uid, Name) in database: line ← concat("Redirect 301 /dynamid.php?UID=", uid, "http://www.domain.com/static/", Name, ) append line to str copy or write str to .htaccess Doing this, you'll still be able to find your redirects in a year (they're all in .htaccess) and there's no longer a need to do a look-up in the database on every "old style" request.
