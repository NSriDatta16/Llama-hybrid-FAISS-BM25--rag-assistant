A suggestion You could build the absolute path in the app and pass that in the connection string. So, if you know that the database file is in the database subfolder of the application folder, you could do something like this (C#): string relativePath = @"database\myfile.s3db"; string currentPath; string absolutePath; string connectionString; currentPath = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location; absolutePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(currentPath,relativePath); connectionString = string.Format("DataSource={0}", absolutePath); SQLiteConnection cnn = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString); (Someone can probably correct me on how to get the current path).
