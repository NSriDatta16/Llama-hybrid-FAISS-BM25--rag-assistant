Compute moment and quantiles of a stream of data

I'd like to compute the moments and quantiles of a random variable which is the output of a sensor. I don't intend to store all the values this sensor outputs (let's say it outputs one value each 15 minutes), but rather keep batches of these values (for example a two weeks' batch) that I'll discard from time to time. I was considering estimating the probability density function of a batch of outputs with scikit's KernelDensity. I then discard the batch and when I get hold of a new batch of values I update the estimate of the probability density with these new values. I know that the probability density function that I estimate for each batch separately converges almost surely to the real density but I don't know if this result still holds if I compute the density incrementally as defined in the above paragraph. Is it the way I should do ?
