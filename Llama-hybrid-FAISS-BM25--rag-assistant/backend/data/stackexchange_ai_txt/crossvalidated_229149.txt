A stepwise procedure using AIC is a very bad idea as it is equivalent to variable selection/elimination based on a p-value. A much better method is using expert knowledge to choose variables that you know should be included or excluded, paying careful attention to possible confounders and mediators, in conjunction with a shrinkage method such as LASSO.
