Conditional move problem

Code fragment from Assembly exercise (GNU Assembler, Linux 32 bit) .data more: .asciz "more\n" .text ... movl $more, %eax # this is compiled cmova more, %eax # this is compiled cmova $more, %eax # this is not compiled Error: suffix or operands invalid for `cmova' I can place string address to %eax using movl, but cmova is not compiled. I need the source operand to be $more and not more, to use it for printing. Finally, this value goes to %ecx register of Linux system call 4 (write).
