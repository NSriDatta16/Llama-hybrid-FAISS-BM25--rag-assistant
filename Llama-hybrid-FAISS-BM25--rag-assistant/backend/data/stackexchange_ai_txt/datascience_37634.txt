What is the highest accuracy for classifying cats and dogs from CIFAR-10?

Resnet, DenseNet , and other deep learning algorithms achieve average accuracies of 95% or higher on CIFAR-10 images. However, when it comes to similar images such as cats and dogs they don't do as well. I am curious to know which network has the highest cat vs dog accuracy and what it is. I am aware of Cat vs Dog competition on Kaggle and such, but none that I know of are on CIFAR-10.
