This is sort of a hack but decent work around. I'm seeing jqmodal put the modal at the top of the page, so this code simply scrolls to the top after they open a modal: if( navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) || navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)){ $('html, body').animate({scrollTop:0}, 'slow'); } I added this to the open function in jqmodal.js From trying the demos that come with SimpleModal, they seem to work correctly on iPad/iPhone so migrating to that would be another solution: http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/
