Joining sql views in oracle sql

How can I join views using sql? I'm using Oracle at the moment? Sql view 1 CREATE VIEW florence_staff AS SELECT * FROM staff WHERE libname ='florence' Sql view 2 CREATE VIEW alexandria_staff AS SELECT * FROM staff WHERE libname ='alexandria' I'm doing this to check if the fragmentation is correct, if you get what i mean. Thanks :))
