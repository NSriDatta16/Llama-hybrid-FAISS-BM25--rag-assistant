The atan2() method is handy for this, and is found in most languages. atan2(y,x) and converts rectangular coordinates (x,y) to the angle theta from the polar coordinates (r,theta) . Given 4 points, find their average. Then calculate the four (x,y) vectors obtained by subtracting the average from each of the four points. For each of these (x,y) vectors, calculate the angle θ = atan2(y,x). θ will be between -π/2 and π/2. Sort the θ's. This will give you the order of the points, in clockwise order. This only works for convex quadrilaterals.
