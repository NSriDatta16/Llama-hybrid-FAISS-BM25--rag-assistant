The physics are very simple: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtongrav.html I assume you won't be worrying about drag or wind, so depending on your angles of inclination (user input), you'll be implementing: Sourced from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory . You can even probably get away with simplifying it. If you don't want to be super-accurate, you can just do something like F=ma where is is whatever you decide the gravitational acceleration to be (9.8 m/sÂ² on Earth).
