How big is the organisation? I've seen this stuff handled very well in a small organisation (a few dozen programmers total) where one or two individuals are known to have ownership of each component, and are responsive to feature requests. It's easier to march off to someone's office (or mail them), explain what you need, and get one of: the expected way to do what you want, agreement to add the required feature (or direct a minion to do so), permission to implement the required feature in the common component, Than it is just to launch into writing workarounds, starting a fork, or writing an equivalent new component. If your programmers are smart, they'll do what they think is easiest. The trick is to ensure that this is the right thing. Aside from really simple stuff like linked lists, there wasn't a whole lot of wheel-reinvention going on. There were, very rarely, private forks for particular products, most commonly to reduce code size by chopping things out. But the usual way to do that was to modify the original component to have more build options.
