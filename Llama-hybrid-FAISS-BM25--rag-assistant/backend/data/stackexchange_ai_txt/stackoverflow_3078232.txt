I gave up on finding an elegant solution to this problem. Basically I created a hack which tests whether or not the conditions exist where the bug will occur (selection from left, etc), and if they do it adjusts the rendering of the text. I really don't like hacks as they are often bad for portability and maintainability, but this seems to work, so I suppose I'll abstract it away and hope it doesn't break anything. In any case, it's working which is the key point. I didn't receive any answers, but I'm sure there are some people who at least tried to think of something, so thanks :) Btw - if someone can come up with an elegant solution I will still accept that instead of my own answer (I can't anyways for two days). Edit: This is one reason I like Java. Hacks are less likely to cause portability issues - even though this is related to rendering (it works through interaction with a Graphics object), it should still work on any OS.
