Google Audit Question

The following external CSS files were included after an external JavaScript file in the document head. To ensure CSS files are downloaded in parallel, always include external CSS before external JavaScript. 1 inline script block was found in the head between an external CSS file and another resource. To allow parallel downloading, move the inline script before the external CSS file, or after the next resource. My HTML is: // Your chart object(s) var myChart; // Function to hold all chart creation function initCharts() { myChart = new ganttChart("chart1"); myChart.gAddBar("Dynamic!", "22/3/2010", "3/4/2010"); myChart.gLoadData("Going to the shop*4/3/2010*19/3/2010*Watching TV*9/3/2010*23/3/2010*Watching TV*1/3/2010*23/3/2010*Watching TV*18/3/2010*28/3/2010*END INPUT*1/3/2010*9/3/2010"); myChart.gDraw(); myChart.gChangeBarColour(1, "#dd2200"); myChart.gChangeBarColour(2, "#9900ee"); myChart.gChangeBarColour(3, "#00dd00"); myChart.gChangeBarColour(4, "#ffbb00"); myChart.gChangeBarColour(5, "#00aa99"); } Is it getting confused between the body inline script?
