Not sure I have the ultimate answer for you, but I can offer some ideas: Selenium will have a time-out to deal with Firefox freezing. You should double check to make sure that is set correctly and working. Whatever is running your selenium (like cruise control or team city) should also have a timeout that can kill off the selenium server. People often revert to rebooting their servers once a day and report positive results.(Not me) I would really encourage you to figure out the root cause of this. Selenium can feel frustrating and flaky, but after digging in, I've always found it was a diagnosable problem that could be fixed (like this ). (Se pushes us to terrible extremes: We actually wrote a ssh job triggered in TeamCity that logged into a windows machine and restarted the selenium server there. Ultimately we didn't use it.)
