The string with the hex values that you gave appears to be a UTF-8 encoding. You are getting this because Perl ‘likes to’ use UTF-8 when it deals with strings. The LWP::Simple->get() method automatically decodes the content from the server which includes undoing any Content-Encoding as well as converting to UTF-8. You could dig into the internals and get a version that does change the character encoding (see HTTP::Message's decoded_content , which is used by HTTP::Response's decoded_content , which you can get from LWP::UserAgent's get ). But it may be easier to re-encode the data in your desired encoding with something like use Encode; ...; $cp1255_bytes = encode('CP1255', decode('UTF_8', $utf8_bytes)); The mixed readable/garbage characters you see are due to mixing multiple, incompatible encodings in the same stream. Probably the stream is labeled as UTF-8 but you are putting CP1255 encoded characters into it. You either need to label the stream as CP1255 and put only CP1255-encoded data into it, or label it as UTF-8 and put only UTF-8-encoded data into it. Remind yourself that bytes are not characters and convert between them appropriately.
