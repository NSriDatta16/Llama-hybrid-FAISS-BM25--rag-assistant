You will need to add draggable() to your item and add some custom code the start event. With more sample code it might be easier to give fuller advice, jsfiddle.net sample is best EDIT: You could use events api http://api.jquery.com/category/events/ , mousemove and mousedown, to figure which way to move the image, and call the animate event. Re-using draggable , with some clever options and event functions may be better I also need to prevent Firefox from 'picking' the image up. Use the Mozilla CSS Extensions -moz-user-focus:ignore; -moz-user-select:none; might to do the trick.
