Logistic regression: why bothering with the sigmoid?

In Logistic Regression, testing: sigmoid(a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ...) >= PERCENT_THRESHOLD seems to me mathematically equivalent to testing: (a0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ...) >= LINEAR_THRESHOLD such that: sigmoid( LINEAR_THRESHOLD ) = PERCENT_THRESHOLD Calculating the Sigmoid slows down optimisation. Why do we need to compute it, when we can get the same result without it? Are there cases where calculating the Sigmoid is useful, or is it just a mathematical abstraction, that we can disregard in practice?
