EmptyResult jQuery callback issue with $.get

I have some code in a controller (HomeController.cs) that gets called from a $.get method in my view. View Code $(document).ready(function() { $.get("/Home/Toolbar", function(result) { $("body").prepend(result); }); }); HomeController.cs [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)] public ActionResult Toolbar() { if (Request.IsAuthenticated && Roles.IsUserInRole("Agents")) return PartialView("toolbar"); return new EmptyResult(); } My issue here is after the EmptyViewResult is returned to the JS, the code doesn't "post back" to the controller anymore. If I remove the "if" conditional and consisently return the PartialView, everything works correctly. I would like to only include the "toolbar" partial view in the DOM, when the user is in the "Agents" role.
