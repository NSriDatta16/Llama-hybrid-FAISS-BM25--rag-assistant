I'm not sure if I understand you - @news_writers is a collection of Role models? If that assumption is correct, your association appears to be backwards - if these represent authors of news items, shouldn't News belong_to Role (being the author)? At any rate, I would assume the most direct approach would be to use an iterator over @news_writers, calling on the association for each news_writer (like news_writer.news) in turn and pushing it into a separate variable. Edit: Daniel Lucraft's suggestion is a much more elegant solution than the above.
