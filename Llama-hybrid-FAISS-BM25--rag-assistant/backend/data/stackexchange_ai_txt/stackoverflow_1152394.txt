No. Current SSDs are designed as disk replacements. Every layer, from SATA controller to filesystem driver treats them as storage. This is not a problem of the underlying technology, NAND flash. When NAND flash is directly mapped into memory, and uses a rotating log storage system instead of a file system based on named files it can be quite fast. The fundamental problem is that NAND Flash only performans well in block updates. File metadata updates cause expensive read-modify-write operations. Also, NAND blocks are much bigger than typical disk blocks, which doesn't help performance either. For these reasons, the future of SSDs will be better cached SSDs. DRAM will hide the overhead of poor mapping and a small supercap backup will allow the SSD to commit writes faster.
