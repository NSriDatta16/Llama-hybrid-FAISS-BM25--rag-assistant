That sounds like you'd have something like: class Book { private final LinkedList chapters; // Other stuff } class Chapter { private final Linkedist sections; // Other stuff } class Section { private final Linkedist paragraphs; // Other stuff } (You may very well choose to declare the variables themselves to be of type List or perhaps Deque , using LinkedList only when creating the actual objects that the variables refer to. I've only used the concrete type here for brevity.)
