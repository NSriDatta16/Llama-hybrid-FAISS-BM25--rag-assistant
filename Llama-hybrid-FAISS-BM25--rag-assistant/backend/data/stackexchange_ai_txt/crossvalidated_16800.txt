Means of groups A and B differ significantly. I want to classify values into A or B

My data look like this. The variable on the $x$ axis is height in inches. The variable on the $y$ axis is whether someone hovers when urinating at a public toilet. Each of the 103 points is a female university student. According to a $t$-test, the mean height of hoverers is significantly higher than that of non-hoverers. I would like to make an inference in the opposite direction; I would like to know whether taller women are more likely to hover. Is it reasonable to suspect based on my $t$-test that the opposite inference would hold? A logistic regression found no significantly increased odds of hovering corresponding to an increase in height. Is there a different test I should try for this opposite relationship?
