It's a general-purpose allocator, but the Hoard heap claims to have "strict bounds on fragmentation" [1] : All of the blocks in a superblock are in the same size class. By using size classes that are a power of b apart (where b is greater than 1) and rounding the requested size up to the nearest size class, we bound worst-case internal fragmentation within a block to a factor of b. In order to reduce external fragmentation, we recycle completely empty superblocks for re-use by any size class. Dunno if it would help, but it's easy enough to try it out.
