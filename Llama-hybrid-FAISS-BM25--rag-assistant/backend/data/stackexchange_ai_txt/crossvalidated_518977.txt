Time series $MA(2)$ projection $X_t$ onto $H_{t-1}$

I have an $MA(2)$ process $X_t = Z_t - Z_{t-1} + 0.25Z_{t-2}$ where $Z_t \sim WN(0, \sigma^2)$ and I need to find a projection of $X_t$ onto space $H_{t-1}(X_t)$ , but how to do that? I guess my projection will be a linear combination $P_{H_{t-1}}X_t = \sum\limits_1^{\infty}a_iX_{t-i}$ but how to do it legitimately? Or maybe it is easier to find a projection onto $Z_t$ (as $X_t$ is both causal and invertible)? Could anyone explain me what to do in these kind of problems (also when I am projecting onto, for instance, $sp(X_1,...X_t)$ ). Thanks in advance! EDIT: I got $Z_t = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty}0.5^i(i+1)X_{t-i}$ . I know that my process is both causal and invertible, so basically a projection onto $H(X)$ is the same as onto $H(Z)$ . So is my projection just $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}0.5^i(i+1)X_{t-i}$ ? Please notice that I changed $i$ from $0$ to $1$ as I am cutting off $X_t$ as it is not included in a subspace I'm projecting onto.
