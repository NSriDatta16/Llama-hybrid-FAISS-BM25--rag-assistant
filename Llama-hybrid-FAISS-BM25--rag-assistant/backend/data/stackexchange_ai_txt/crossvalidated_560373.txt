How can I quantify the skewness, kurtosis, entropy when all of values of a list is 0?

Background Let's think, there is a list of values which presents activity of a person for several hours. That person did not have any movement in those hours. Therefore, all the values are 0. Then, what is the problem? If I want to calculate skewness and kurtosis for that list of values, I will get undefined value since standard deviation will be 0 in those cases (skewness and kurtosis). In addition, $p(x)$ will be 0 and thus, in entropy calculation, I will have to multiply 0 and undefined value $(p(x) log p(x))$ . However, based on my understanding, undefined values does not have any meaningful interpretation in explainable machine learning and also in statistical analysis (e.g., in correlation analysis). Thus, my question How can I quantify the skewness, kurtosis, entropy when all of values of a list is 0? Note : I have checked several Q&A of this site, StackOverflow, and others (e.g., this one ). However, I failed. I think 0 can be set. But it does not seem to be logical. Update Adding a new variable can be one approach (please, see the insightful comments of whuber). However, if I need to add a new variable, it needs to be added for every such cases. For example, for data of weekdays, weekends, holidays, different semesters, different time periods based on different intervals (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4 .... hours)..... Therefore, lots of new variables will be created. The problem in this case is most of the feature selection approaches do not work when the number of feature is larger than the number of samples ( Reference ). The number of participants in our study is around 100.
