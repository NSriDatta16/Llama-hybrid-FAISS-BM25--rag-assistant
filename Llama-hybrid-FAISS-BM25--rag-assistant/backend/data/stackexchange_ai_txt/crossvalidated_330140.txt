Distribution of weights in a neural network

I am looking for distributions of weights in the neural network as a function of the depth of the layer. Intutively, I expect that near convergence, the deeper layers to have weight matrix will have many near zero values, and a few larger values. Are there any papers on this subject which you could recommend?
