What are multi-variable calculus pre-requisite for Machine Learning

I wanted to complete calculus pre-requisites for machine learning class. I am doing an online course of multi-variable calculus. Can someone please suggest what lectures after Lecture 15 are relevant. Like I know Lagrange Multipliers are used in SVM, but the lectures after I have no clue of application in ML. I have searched through ML books, each one mentions Multi-variable calculus as a pre-requisite. But how much I am confused about that.
