neural network training algorithms

When I first read about neural networks, I learned that Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train the neural network. I am interested if there are other alternatives (or better?) to BP. What are the other training algorithms used in NN? And is BP is the best one, and that's why almost everyone uses it for training the NN model?
