Thank you Jonathan, So you see the one solution I've also perceived: change the name of the file. But, well, that is the point of the question. I have no problems using the script. If I call bison -dy portugol.y from the shell script flexyagcc.sh it gives me y.tab.c and y.tab.h . Why not from a makefile , that is the central point! I do like my file names, it makes all so coherent: portugol.c : handmade routines, portugol.h :header file, portugol.l :lex scanner, and portugol.y : parser. Also, this is not a project I made today, it has being like that for years now, lots of versions (now 3.0). So, it is not an option to change the file names. Beside that, I would end up with portugol.c anyway! But it would be a file automatically generated from bison, aka y.tab.c . So, it is very confusing to stop using portugol.c to have handmade routines, and start using the same name to have the parser. I just want to know what is happening with makefile, and how can I use it to substitute the script the way it is. While I can't, unfortunately, I'll be using the script. The script is very simple: flex portugol.l bison -dy portugol.y gcc y.tab.c lex.yy.c portugol.c -o portugol.bin -lm -ly See, I don't even bother to have the objectives portugol.o , y.tab.o and lex.yy.o . I skip creating them by just running the gcc on the sources directly. I also can do this in the makefile, if after the first attempt to destroy my portugol.c , I rename manually the file created to be y.tab.c . So the problem is that makefile differs from the above script by attempting to create the following: lex the same: portugol.l for both cases (script and makefile) bison: automagically changed from y.tab.c to portugol.c (here the problem!) c code: I would need to change portugol.c to something else, like portugol-funcs.c Thanks for your kind attention!
