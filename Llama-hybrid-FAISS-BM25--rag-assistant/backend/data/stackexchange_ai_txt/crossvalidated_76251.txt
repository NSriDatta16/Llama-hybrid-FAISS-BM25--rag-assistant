Strong Predictor in Random Forests

My statistical learning book asserts that when decision trees are constructed, m out of p predictors are randomly selected for consideration in a split. The idea here apparently is to decorrelate trees obtained in bagging by weakening the effect of a strong predictor. If we have p predictors to choose from, and at each split we can only use m predictors, they say on average, (p - m)/p of the splits will involve the strong predictor. Why?
