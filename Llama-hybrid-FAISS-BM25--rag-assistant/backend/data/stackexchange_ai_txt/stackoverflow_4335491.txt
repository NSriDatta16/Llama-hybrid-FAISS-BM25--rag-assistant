Connecting multiple flex clients to a single java class

I have a multi-user application consisting of a flex client and blazeds/Spring/java backend - I have the main elements working fine ie. sending messages to destination, consuming and producing. Flex clients are able to send and retrieve a string from this class no problem. What I want to do is to have the 2 clients with access to the same variable..in this crude sample I'm sending a guid from each swf which I append to a string _players server side. What happens is when I launch Swf A, it recieves its guid back fine, as does Swf B. Then Swf A recieves the guid from Swf B, but Swf B does not recieve Swf A. BTW this is the same swf code just launched twice each in a different browser. Can anyone see where I'm going wrong or what might be a better solution? public class GameFeed { private static GaneFeedThread thread; private final MessageTemplate template; public GameFeed(MessageTemplate template) { this.template = template; } public void start() { if (thread == null) { thread = new GaneFeedThread(this.template); thread.start(); } } public void stop() { thread.running = false; thread = null; } public static class GaneFeedThread extends Thread { public boolean running = false; private final MessageTemplate template; public GaneFeedThread(MessageTemplate template) { this.template = template; } private static String _players; public void addPlayer(String name) { _players += name + ","; } while (this.running) { this.template.send("game-feed", _players); }
