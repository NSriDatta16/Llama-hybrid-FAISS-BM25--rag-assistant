How does Google animate their logos?

I've been trying to figure out how Google animate their logos since the particle explosion one a while back, and today they have a chemistry set to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Robert Bunsen. I'm assuming this is HTML5 (I'm using Firefox 4, Chrome and Safari 5), but can anyone confirm if so and whether there are any good tutorials on how to do those types of animations?
