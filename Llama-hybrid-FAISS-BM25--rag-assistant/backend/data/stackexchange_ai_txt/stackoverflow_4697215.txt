I am definitely not a design pattern expert but I feel here that you are making this more complex than it needs to be. Also, I'm no UML expert but is it that you have each of your coffee types as a separate class? I think it would make more sense to have a beverage class with a type property/attribute and then to inject a 'cost-detail' class into this which will allow these beverages to report correct prices.
