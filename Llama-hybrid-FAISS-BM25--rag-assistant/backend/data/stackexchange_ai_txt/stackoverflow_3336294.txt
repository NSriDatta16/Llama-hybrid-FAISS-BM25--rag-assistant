I think the log4net documentation explains this quite nicely: Loggers are organized in hierarchies. E.g.: The logger Foo.Bar is child of the logger Foo . This way the loggers create a tree and the root logger is simply the root of that tree (in the example Foo is a child of the root logger). This hiearchy allows for some interesting configuration applications (e.g. disable/enable logging for an entire sub system of your application).
