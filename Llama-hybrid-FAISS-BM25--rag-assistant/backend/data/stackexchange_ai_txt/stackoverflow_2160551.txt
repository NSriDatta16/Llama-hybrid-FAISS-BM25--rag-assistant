Amazon S3 is a storage solution, not a database. If you only need simple key/value your best bet would be to use Amazon SimpleDB in combination with S3. Large files are stored on S3, while meta data for searching is stored in SimpleDB. this gives you a horizontally scalable key/value system with direct access to S3.
