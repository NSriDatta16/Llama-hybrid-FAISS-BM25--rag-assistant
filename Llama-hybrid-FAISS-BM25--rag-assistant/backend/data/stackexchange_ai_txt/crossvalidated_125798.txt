Probability distribution of three random variables

The following formula is a formula I got from a paper that deals with wireless networks specifically when calculating coverage probabilities, it is powerful because one can use it for general distributions. $$\mathbb{P}[ X \geq T( Y+Z )] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathcal{L}_{X}(-2i \pi s)-1}{2i\pi s} \times \mathcal{L}_Y(2i \pi Ts)\times \mathcal{L}_Z(2i \pi Ts)\ ds$$ where $X,Y,Z$ are random variables and $\mathcal{L}$ is the laplace transform while $T$ is a positive constant. Assume the above formula is correct, I would like to use the above formula for a specific example $$X\sim \operatorname{Gamma}(m,\theta)$$ $$Y= 0$$ $$ Z = 10^{-11}$$ I solve it the following way, $$\mathcal{L}_X(s)=(1+s\ \theta)^{-m}$$ $$\mathcal{L}_Y(s)=1$$ $$\mathcal{L}_Z(s)= \mathbb{E}(e^{-s 10^{-11}})= e^{-s 10^{-11}}$$ Then basically substitute $s$ by $-2i\pi s$ for the first Laplace (laplace of $X$), and $2i\pi Ts$ for the other two.. i.e $$\mathcal{L}_X(-2i\pi s)=(1-2i\pi s\theta)^m$$ $$\mathcal{L}_Y(2i\pi Ts)=1$$ $$\mathcal{L}_Z(2i\pi Ts)= e^{-2i\pi Ts 10^{-11}}$$ Am I doing things correct here? Can you find any mistake with my strategy? Do you think when integrating numerically this expression using any computer program, I should add the absolute (magnitude) of the above expression or should it be left as imaginary? The reason I ask this question is because I try to simulate using MATLAB a specific example and I get no result. Thanks for any help.
