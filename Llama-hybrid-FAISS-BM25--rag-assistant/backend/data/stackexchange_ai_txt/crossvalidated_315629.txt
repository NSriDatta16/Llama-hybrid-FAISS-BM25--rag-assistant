Stationarity of MA($\infty$) process

In my time series class, we got taught, that an MA($\infty $) process with $$ \sum_i^\infty \theta_i^2 Obviously the mean exists and is time independent, but why does the second moment, so the covariance, also exist? From the assumption I can only derive, that the variance, but not the covariance with some lag $h$ $$ Cov(x_t, x_{t-h}) = \sum_i^\infty \theta_i \theta_{i+h} $$ exist, which is, as far as I know, required for weak stationarity.
