why does this script not execute in Firefox?

I'm trying to run a very simple browser detect script and it executes just fine in Safari and Chrome (running on a Mac) but doesn't execute at all in Firefox. I can boil it down to the simplest possible form, and it still doesn't execute: if (navigator.userAgent.match(/^.*Chrome.*$/)) {break;} else { location="howdy.html" } This has been perplexing me for hours now. Anyone have an idea? Thanks!!
