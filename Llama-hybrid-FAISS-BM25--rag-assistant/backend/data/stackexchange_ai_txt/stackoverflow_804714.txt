In addition to JITting, other factors could be: The process's output stream blocking when you call System.out.println Your process getting scheduled out by another process The garbage collector doing some work on a background thread If you want to get good benchmarks, you should Run the code you're benchmarking a large number of times, several thousand at least, and calculate the average time. Ignore the times of the first several calls (due to JITting, etc.) Disable the GC if you can; this may not be an option if your code generates a lot of objects. Take the logging (println calls) out of the code being benchmarked. There are benchmarking libraries on several platforms that will help you do this stuff; they can also calculate standard deviations and other statistics.
