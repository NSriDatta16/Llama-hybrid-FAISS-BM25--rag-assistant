What are the factors by which virtual memory is limited?

What i know is that size of Virtual memory is only limited by the number of address lines. But in Operating System internals and design principals by William Stallings i read that virtual memory is also limited by size of secondary memory . 1.How? 2.Is swapping( between main memory and secondary memory) a necessary condition for virtual memory ? I mean if swapping is not allowed then still can we call it virtual memory though the benefits will be limited ? Then i have few follow up questions based on the answer. Edit: I think i must have quoted the exact words of the book: A storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory. The addresses a program may use to reference memory are distinguished from the addresses the memory system uses to identify physical storage sites, and program-generated addresses are translated automatically to the corresponding machine addresses. The size of virtual storage is limited by the addressing scheme of the computer system and by the amount of secondary memory available and not by the actual number of main storage locations. Is there some sort of playing of words here in "virtual memory" and "size of virtual storage"?
