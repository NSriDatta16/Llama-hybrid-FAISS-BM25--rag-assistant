The polymorphic treatment of operators in Java is a form of operator overloading, as that term is traditionally used. For example, read the wikipedia page on operator overloading , and you will see Java style of overloading mentioned in the first paragraph. "In computer programming, operator overloading (less commonly known as operator ad-hoc polymorphism) is a specific case of polymorphism in which some or all of operators like +, =, or == have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. Sometimes the overloadings are defined by the language; sometimes the programmer can implement support for new types."
