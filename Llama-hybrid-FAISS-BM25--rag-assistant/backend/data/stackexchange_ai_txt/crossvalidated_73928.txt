This is an expected result. The matrix $\Pi$ has full rank, when the process is stationary. Of course Johansen procedure usually requires that the time series should be checked for unit roots first. The null hypothesis is that time series are unit-roots and they are cointegrated. If your variables are $I(0)$ then the first step should eliminate the need to use Johansen's test. I would hesitate to use Johansen's test for testing whether the processes are $I(0)$, since it was not designed to be used as such.
