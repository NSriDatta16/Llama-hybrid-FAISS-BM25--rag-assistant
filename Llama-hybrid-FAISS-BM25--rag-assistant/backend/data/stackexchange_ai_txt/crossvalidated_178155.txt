If your DV is a seven point scale, I'd say you probably shouldn't do linear regression at all; ordinal logistic regression is likely to be a better choice. OLS regression assumes a continuous DV. However, you should also note that linear regression does not make assumptions about the distribution of the DV (other than it being continuous); the assumptions are about the errors, as estimated by the residuals.
