Trending topics: 1-word terms vs composed terms

With your perfect help here I've already found out how to compute trending topics (standard score + floating average). My next problem: I have the terms (consisting of 1-3 words) in my database connected with the time they were mentioned. But the trending topics are always only 1-word terms since one part of a term is ALWAYS mentioned more often than the complete term. Example: Yesterday 3 news articles were about "Barack Obama" and today 148. Then "Barack Obama" is rising, of course. But "Barack" is also rising and so it is the trending topic. How can I include the length of a term when I compute trending topics? I don't want to use another algorithm, I'm fully pleased with the algorithm above. Can I multiply the score of all two-word terms with 1.5 or so? Detailed example: My top trends are: Microsoft, China, Hillary Clinton, Dallas Mavericks. I wanted to say that "Hillary Clinton" and "Dallas Mavericks" are never ranked no1 or no2 because they're two-word terms. "Microsoft" and "China" are one-word terms so they're always ranked better. Is there any possibility to solve this problem? I hope you can help me. Thanks in advance!
