Explaining Python variable scope

I'm teaching myself Python and I was translating some sample code into this class Student(object): def __init__( self, name, a,b,c ): self.name = name self.a = a self.b = b self.c = c def average(self): return ( a+b+c ) / 3.0 Which is pretty much my intended class definition. Later in the main method I create an instance and call it a : if __name__ == "__main__" : a = Student( "Oscar", 10, 10, 10 ) That's how I find out that the variable a declared in main is available to the method average and to make that method work, I have to type self.a + self.b + self.c instead. What's the rationale for this?
