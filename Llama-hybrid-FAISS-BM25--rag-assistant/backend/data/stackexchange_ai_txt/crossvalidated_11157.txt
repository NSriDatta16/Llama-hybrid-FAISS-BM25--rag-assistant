What statistical test can I use to detect clumping?

I have time series data that represent dates/times of trades taken in a financial market. I would like to assign a score to this data that represents whether the trades are mostly clustered around particular time values or if they are mostly spread out evenly. I am going to have about 1000+ results per dataset. Example situation one (High degree of "clustering" ): 1. 01/01/01 : 13:00 2. 01/01/01 : 13:10 3. 01/01/01 : 13:15 4. 01/01/01 : 13:25 5. 03/05/01 : 17:20 6. 03/05/01 : 17:35 7. 03/05/01 : 17:40 8. 03/05/01 : 17:45 Example situation two( Low degree of "clustering)" 1. 01/01/01 : 13:00 2. 01/05/01 : 02:30 4. 02/12/01 : 06:40 5. 02/25/01 : 02:30 6. 03/30/01 : 21:10 7. 04/12/01 : 02:20 8. 05/02/01 : 03:25 I can of course convert all the timestamps to posix time or whatnot so doing calculation with the time values won't be a problem. I was thinking possibly standard error? (For those who want more background info: I am using backtest results to modulate the size of my entry position in a complex manner. If the results contain trades that are clustered together, then they don't really count as 1 trade each (more like one big trade). This means that such results are untrustworthy and I should not act on them.) Thanks!
