executeQuery and findAll are a little misleading since the class that you call them on have no bearing on the query or its return type - GORM adds the methods to all domain classes. Given the way you asked the question I'm assuming you want def latestPhotosForUser = PhotoOwner.executeQuery( "SELECT b FROM PhotoOwner a, PhotoStorage b WHERE a.owner=:person AND a.photo = b", [person:person], [max:3])
