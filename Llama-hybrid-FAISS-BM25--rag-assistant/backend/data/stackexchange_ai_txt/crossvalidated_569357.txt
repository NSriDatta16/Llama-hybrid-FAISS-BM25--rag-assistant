There is a general method which works for a lot of these simple types of models. However for some reason it seems that most people somehow just can't or won't see how easy they are. The self-starting approach for these models in r is wrong because the real problem is to find a stable parameterization for the models. Once this is done finding good intial values is easy. Having fit the model with the parameters for the stable parameterization it is simple to calculate the values/std devs of the parameters of interest. Finding Initial Parameter Values for Gompertz Model with Intercept I did that example in some detail so I will just explain the correct parameterization here. The horrible parameter that you have is K. Of course it is also a parameter of great interest. Look at the data. Clearly the population size for the the first and last time are much better determined in general than the carrying capacity K. So Let $P_0$ and $P_n$ be the parameters for the population in the first and last time period. $$P_t=\frac{K}{1+\alpha\exp(-rt)}$$ I have simplified the equation using just $\alpha$ so that this is a more general approach more similar to the Gompertz example. \begin{aligned} P_0&=\frac{K}{1+\alpha} \cr P_n&=\frac{K}{1+\alpha\exp(-rt_n)} \end{aligned} Now one can solve the first equation for $K$ in terms of $P_0$ and $\alpha$ $$ K=P_0(1+\alpha)$$ and substitute this into the second equation to get $$P_n=\frac{P_0(1+\alpha)}{1+\alpha\exp(-rt_n)}$$ which can be solved for $\alpha$ in terms of $P_0,P_n$ , and $r$ . \begin{aligned} \alpha&=\frac{P_0-P_n}{P_n\exp(-rt_n)-P_0}\cr K&=P_0\big\{1+\frac{P_0-P_n}{P_n\exp(-rt_n)-P_0}\big\} \end{aligned} Now one can fix the parameters $P_0$ and $P_n$ and get an initial estimate for $r$ conditioned on the fixed values of $P_0$ and $P_n$ using the parameter estimator of choice. Then the three parameters $P_0$ , $P_n$ , and $r$ can be estimated simultaneously to get the complete solution. This method also works for the von Bertalanffy and the 4 or 5 parameter logistic although it is a bit simpler for those equations due to the linear nature of the parameters involved.
