In order to get rid of (Re)Collecting Debug Symbols in Organizer (which in fact does nothing) each time the iPhone is presented to the XCode, a simple workaround is to copy: DeveloperDiskImage.dmg and DeveloperDiskImage.dmg.signature from the 4.2 (8C134) to the empty 4.2.1 (8C148) folder. The XCode will recognize device and you'll be able to debug your code, but without debug symbols for the IOS framework. But, the gdb console will be alive and you can use it do debug your code (with debug symbols). Btw. you can always use Simulator for the full IOS support :-)
