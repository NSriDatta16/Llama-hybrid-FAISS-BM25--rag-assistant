Causal inference with (only) interval uncertainty?

The modern popular frameworks that I am aware of for causal inference (i.e. potential outcomes or Pearlian) are based on a premise of uncertainty quantified as probability. There's nothing particularly wrong with that, but I like to explore tools and use cases. Interval arithmetic (IA) is a way of quantifying/qualifying uncertainty. Some advantages I have found with implementing interval arithmetic include: Tends to be more comprehensible to non-technical audiences than probability. Intervals can be assigned according to background information (similar to causal inference and Bayesian inference). Calculations for propagation of uncertainty are often simple (esp. for monotonic functions) IA is not a general replacement for probability however, and has some disadvantages of its own: Multiplication across addition is subdistributive (which can confuse people) The dependency problem Division with intervals covering zero leads to splitting the problem into multiple subproblems can be tedious. Finding a tightest interval for the image of a function is tantamount to solving an optimization problem, and optimization problems can get very technical or even infeasible. Ignores degree of uncertainty within or outside interval. Further, it can be combined with probability theory (e.g. pboxes ). But I was thinking about causal inference with intervals only. Has this been researched? If so, I would love a starting paper/book to start reading up on that literature.
