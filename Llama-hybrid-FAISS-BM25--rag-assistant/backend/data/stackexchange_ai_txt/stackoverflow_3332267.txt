just drag the xml into the file tree (solution explorer) in xcode then to get the root directory path, just call [[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath] UTF8String] that gets it as a char*, for c style string stuff. otherwise just leave out the UTF8String [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath] to get the NSString. just add your file name to the end in my experience, it doesn't matter where you dump your xml in the 'solution explorer' it always ends up in the root directory.
