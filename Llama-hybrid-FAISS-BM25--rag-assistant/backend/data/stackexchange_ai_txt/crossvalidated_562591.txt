A classifier is a method that maps from inputs x to outputs l , where l are instances of a set of labels L . There are many methods to build a classifier, an approach is: define a variable y with value 1 when l is a label l' and 0 when is not that label. In this way, we can translate the mapping in estimating a function f(x;θ ) such that y=f(x;θ ) where f is user defined and the parameters θ are selected to meet user stated requirements ( for example low classification errors , few parameters,....). Logistic Regression is an example, using this method allows to leverage on theory, algorithms, ..
