If you're taking HTML as user input, I recommend using simplehtmldom . It has a loose parser with tolerance for buggy html and lets you use CSS selectors to pull element and their content out of the DOM. I didn't test this, but it should work: $html = str_get_html($_POST['input']); print $html->find('p:first')->plaintext; // first paragraph
