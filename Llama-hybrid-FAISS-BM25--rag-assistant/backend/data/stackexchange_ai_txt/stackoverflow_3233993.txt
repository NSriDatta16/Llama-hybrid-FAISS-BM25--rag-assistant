Embedding Third Party Fonts as resource for Win32 Application

I was wondering how i can embed a third party font into my app( and use it ) so i can distribute my app with the font of my choice for users who do not have the font installed on their systems. Is this possible, or do i have to distribute the font if i want the users to be able to use the font in question. Thanks.
