Is it bad practice to use string literals in xpath expressions?

I currently use string literals in my xpath expressions. For example: paragraphList = root.SelectNodes("paragraph"); I know you should generally avoid using literal values, but I figure this is safe, since the names of your xml nodes will rarely change. Is this bad practice, or am I same?
