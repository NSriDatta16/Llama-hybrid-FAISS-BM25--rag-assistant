updates for the year 2008. You shall commit early and commit often. You anger your coworkers when you break the build in the main branch . You shall never check in code that the build-bot doesn't accept . You shall not go home for the day without merging your branch with others' You shall leave a descriptive comment when checking in your code. You need not include your name or the date in the comment as that information is already tracked. DELETED! You shall not use comments to 'save' defunct code. Fear not, for the code you delete still exists in the source control code history and can be retrieved if needed. You shall use source control for more than archiving just code. The source code control repository makes an excellent storage for technical docs, SQL scripts, and other documents and files related to the project. You can even use source control on your OpenOffice Documents using the SVN plugin You shall religiously mirror your branch on a backup server .
