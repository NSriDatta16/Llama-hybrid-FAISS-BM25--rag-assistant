Interpretation of Cointegration Test Results

I ran the Johansen Cointegration Test and "Phillips & Ouliaris" Cointegration Test on the past 7 years of data of Oil Futures (BZ=F), Gold Futures (GC=F), Gold ETF (GLD), and Silver (SLV) returns. Can someone help me interpret the results? A link to a detailed article explaining how to interpret this result will also help. Which of these two tests do you think is better? Notes - K is constant 2 for Johansen Cointegration Test All the time series are stationary Here are the results of Johansen Cointegration Test cajo Here are the results of Phillips & Ouliaris Cointegration Test capo = urca::ca.po(test_data, type = "Pu", demean = "trend", lag = "short") summary(capo) ######################################## # Phillips and Ouliaris Unit Root Test # ######################################## Test of type Pu detrending of series with constant and linear trend Call: lm(formula = z[, 1] ~ z[, -1] + trd) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.273162 -0.011639 0.000862 0.012489 0.247434 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
