There are benefits, if you are drawing from domain knowledge, but there can be serious risks. I would use something like Boruta/permutation-importance, making sure that the package used was something like Ranger that has the bias-fix for random forest variable importance. Variables with many discrete levels are falsely estimated as being more important, but there is a fix. The false, and the fix, are an example of the nature of the risk, and a way to engage that risk.
