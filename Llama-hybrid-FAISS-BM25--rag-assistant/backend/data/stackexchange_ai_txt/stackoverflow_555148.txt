Generally, to add a command to the context menus you'd do the following: Tools | Customize On the "Toolbars" tab put a tick next to the "Context Menus" item - this will add a new toolbar to your IDE, with buttons for Editor Context Menus, Class View Context Menus, Debugger Context Menus, etc Then switch to the "Commands" tab, select the command you want, and drag it to the appropriate menu, and you're done - in this case in the left hand pane select "View", and then in the right hand pane, scroll down until you get to "View Markup". That being said, in this instance, I can add the button to the context menu for the code editor, but it's greyed out, and unusable - I guess it needs some context that it gets from the Solution Explorer that it doesn't get from the Code window - which is odd, because it's pulling the same details through for "View Designer" and "View Code". I guess I'd use Shift+F7 then, sorry about that.
