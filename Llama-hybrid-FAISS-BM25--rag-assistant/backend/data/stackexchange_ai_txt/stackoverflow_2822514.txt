Linq to SQL - Default Insert/Update/Delete functions not present

Using VS2010 and SQL express 2005, Ive created a database, created a simple table, added the database to VS2010, dragged the table i wish to query into a new 'Linq To SQL' class. Now, selecting works as expected - totally great. However it has not generated the Remove() method, mydb.SumbitChanges() does nothing after amending a retrieved object, so I have obviously missed a vital step. I have not defined anything to do updating or removing, but assumed it did this 'out the box'. Can anyone offer any insight?
