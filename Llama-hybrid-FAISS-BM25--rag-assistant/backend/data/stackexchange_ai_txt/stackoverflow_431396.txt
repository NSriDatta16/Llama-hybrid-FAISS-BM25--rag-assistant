If it's easier for technical users to use an API than it is for them to screen-scrape, they will do so. Even better so, if you can encourage people to use your APIs instead of screen-scraping, you should have a much easier time monitoring traffic, because the automated user-agents are clearly distinguished from the browser user-agents. A RESTful JSON interface is a good choice, because it can be scripted from any other language fairly easy ( show me a language that doesn't have a JSON parser and I'll show you a language nobody cares about ).
