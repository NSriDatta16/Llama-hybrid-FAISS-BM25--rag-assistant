Store user-related information in .net apps

What is the preferred way to store user-level information for .NET application? I could use registry or config files - but some users don't have enough permissions to save/load from these. I have heard something about assembly private storage or something like that, is it a way to go? My main concern is to make sure that even users with a minimal set of privileges could be able to access this storage location.
