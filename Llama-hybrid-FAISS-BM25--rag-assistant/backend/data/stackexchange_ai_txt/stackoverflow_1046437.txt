I don't think your going to find what your looking for easily. The AJAX toolkit lacks the slickness of the plugins of jQuery and other popular frameworks. If you are looking to be impressed, you may want to look elsewhere than the toolkit. I'm not sure what framework it's build on, but I have been very impressed by the UI of MailChimp lately. They nailed it, so easy to use and elegant.
