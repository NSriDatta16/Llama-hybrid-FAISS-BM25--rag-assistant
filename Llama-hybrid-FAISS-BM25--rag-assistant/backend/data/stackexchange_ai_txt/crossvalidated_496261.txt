Specifying specific priors for a correlation matrix via Stan

I'm trying to estimate a correlation matrix for a model where I already have a sense of the values of the off-diagonals based on existing studies. I'm quite new to Bayesian analysis so trying to learn as I go along. The Stan package is pretty bullish on using an LKJ prior for correlation matrices ( see here ). There isn't a way for me to encode a specific expected value of the correlation matrix into the prior. From my understanding I could use the inverse Wishart to generate a covariance matrix instead, but that isn't guaranteed to generate a correlation matrix (i.e. diagonal of 1). Can anyone recommend the best approach here? If it's useful at all I'm trying to recreate exactly this example , except specify my prior knowledge about the correlation matrix.
