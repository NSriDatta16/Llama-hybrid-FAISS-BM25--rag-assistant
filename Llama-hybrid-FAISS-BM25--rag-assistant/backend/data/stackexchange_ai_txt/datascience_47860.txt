I can see that you are interested in Data Science, without knowing what lies ahead. Nothing wrong here! your interest is all that matters. Its interesting that you have taught yourself those libraries and Linear Regression. But those are not totally enough. The libraries are just a way to handle data and Linear Regression is very very basic. And not so popular model in real world scenarios. Basic Models Linear Regression Logistic Regression SVM Neural Networks Decision Trees, Random Forests. As for linear and logistic regression, i suggest you to implement them from scratch, this i believe is the best way to learn the concepts in depth. I suggest you to start with Andrew NG videos on Machine Learning (link below) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN Try to implement those as the exercises come up. Much better you can take up his Machine Learning course in coursera. This will clear up your basics. (link below) https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning Additionally, i have created a repository for starters like you during my learning process. feel free to check it out (link below) https://github.com/williamscott701/Machine-Learning Hope this helps ;) Keep the fire on.
