$1/\sigma^2$ is called precision . You can find it often mentioned in Bayesian software manuals for BUGS and JAGS , where it is used as a parameter for normal distribution instead of variance. It became popular because gamma can be used as a conjugate prior for precision in normal distribution as noticed by Kruschke (2014) and @Scortchi . Kruschke, J. (2014). Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan. Academic Press, p. 454.
