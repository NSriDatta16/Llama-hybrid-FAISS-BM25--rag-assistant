If data are nearly normal, then a 95% confidence interval for the population mean is of the form $\bar X \pm t^*S/\sqrt{n},$ where $\bar X$ and $S$ are the sample mean and standard deviation, respectively, and $t^*$ cuts 2.5% of the probability from the upper tail of Student's t distribution with $\nu = n-1$ degrees of freedom. The margin of error is $E =t^*S/\sqrt{n}$ and in most cases you will find that $n$ is large enough that $t^* \approx 2.$ Also, for moderately large $n$ $S \approx \sigma,$ the population standard deviation. So if you know the required $E$ and have a reasonable guess as to $\sigma$ then you can easily solve for $n.$ As an elementary example, heights of women in various populations have a standard deviation of about 3 inches. As a guide in ordering sizes of clothing for women, the bookstore at State U would like to have a 95% CI for the average height of women in the State U population. So we have $E = 2\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ and $n \approx (2\sigma/E])^2 = (6/.2)^2 = 144.$ So a sample of size $n = 144$ should suffice. This formula is based on using $\bar X$ to estimate the population mean $\mu.$ Thus, if women's heights are roughly normal then $\bar X$ should be nearly normal and $t^* = 1.98$ (from R) is plenty close to $2.$ The weak link in the computation above is knowing (or guessing) the value of $\sigma$ and assuming $S \approx \sigma.$ Heights of women are nearly normal, so that would not be a difficulty in the bookstore application. qt(.975, 143) [1] 1.976692 However, in your application, you say the data may be bimodal and hence perhaps too far from normal for the method discussed above to be useful. For samples as large as 144 it would be unusual for this to be a serious problem. But you can use a bootstrap procedure on similar data from previous studies to check the feasibility of using the t confidence interval. Suppose you have the following 350 bimodal data which you feel may be somewhat like the data for your proposed study. Let's see how a bootstrap would work. set.seed(2020) x = round(c(rnorm(150, 65, 2), rnorm(200, 71, 2))) summary(x); sd(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 59.00 65.00 69.00 68.37 71.00 76.00 [1] 3.611185 hist(x, br=20, col="skyblue2", main="Existing Bimodal Data") Let's see how a bootstrap procedure would work. There are many varieties of bootstrap confidence intervals. The following very elementary one (in R) should suffice for our purposes. The vector d.re , based on re-sampling with replacement from the 350 observations available, gives an idea of the variability of the sample mean. The resulting 95% nonparametric bootstrap CI $(67.80, 68.94)$ is of length $1.14,$ which corresponds to a $0.54$ margin of error. a.obs = mean(x) d.re = replicate(10^3, mean(sample(x, 150, rep=T)) - a.obs) UL = quantile(d.re, c(.975,.025)) Boot.CI = a.obs-UL; Boot.CI 97.5% 2.5% 67.79810 68.93826 # 95% bootstrap CI as.numeric(diff(Boot.CI)) [1] 1.140167 # length of bootstrap CI
