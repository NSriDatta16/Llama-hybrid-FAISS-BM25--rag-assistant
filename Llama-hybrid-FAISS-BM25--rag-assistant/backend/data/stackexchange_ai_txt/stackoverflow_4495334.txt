expanding on Alan's excellent summary. If you just want to add the file to one specific page you can use the following snippet in the Layout Update XML field: path/to/my/file.js and place the file into http://example.com/js/path/to/my/file.js or if you want it residing in your skin folder use skin_js js/file.js with the expected location http://example.com/skin/frontend/base/default/js/file.js change base and default according to the package and theme you are using You can also use the above snippet in any other layout/?.xml file just place it within the layout handle you want to address. For example to place it in all cms pages in cms.xml you'll find .... and change it to ... path/to/my/file.js and another easy one for adding a snippet of javascript to all pages go to System > Configuration > Design > Footer > Miscellaneous HTML Further reading: Using local.xml for theme customisations Demystifying Magentoâ€™s Layout XML
