If you are using a random sample of people, how can you choose how many from each group? But maybe you want to estimate a model from this sample (and retrospectively obtained demographic data), to use in future ... Maybe in future you really want to find the people in group 3. Then I would try multinomial logistic regression . Then you would have a starting point. As an alternative, two binary logistic regression models, the first for 1) versus 2&3), the second for 2 versus 3, given they answered.
