How to run paired t-test when number of control and treated experiments aren't the same?

I'm working in a biology lab and I treat some cells with a drug (treatment) or untreated (control), then transplant them into mice. Each experiment starts with the same cells (being exposed to the drugs or not) and then transplanted into a separate mouse. When dealing with transplantation data, because the recipients are different mice, each transplantation counts as a biological replicate. That's why for example, in experiment one, I have 2 biological (not technical) replicates for the treated cells, and one biological replicate for my control. When running stats, we use a ratio paired t-test to determine statistical significance. In one of my experiments, I had 1 ctrl condition but 2 treatment conditions and now I'm having trouble running the ratio paired t-test. This is the results that I have: If I want to run a ratio paired t-test, can I use the Ctrl result from experiment 1 twice as in the image below, and then run the paired t-test? If yes, when I'm plotting the data I should only use 3 datapoints when drawing the control bar plot and calculating the S.D., right? If no, then what can I do? I don't want to average the treatment results from experiment 1, since I will lose a datapoint. Thanks!
