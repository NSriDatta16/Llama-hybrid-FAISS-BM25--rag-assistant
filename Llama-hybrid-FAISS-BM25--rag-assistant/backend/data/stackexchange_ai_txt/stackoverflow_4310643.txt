An "external folder"? What is that? Android only has access to its internal file system (i.e. the internal storage, and the SD card, and whatever else you may have mounted via the Linux operating system). Using a Windows path is definitely never going to work. Where is that data supposed to be coming from? You need to use a proper UNIX-style path that either points to the phone's internal storage, or the SD card, and the path needs to be accessible by your application.
