Is it necessary to scale/process regression targets after PCA?

I have a regression problem where the dimensionality of my targets is too large (40D) so I use PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 15 dimensions. I don't do any more processing to my targets before training, but is it necessary or does it make sense to process the post-PCA targets further?
