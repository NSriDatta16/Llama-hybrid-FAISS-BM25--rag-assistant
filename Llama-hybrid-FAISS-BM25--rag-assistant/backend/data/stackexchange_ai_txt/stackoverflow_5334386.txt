TObject.Free will be called whenever ANY instance of a class in Delphi is Free 'd. This includes a whole host of objects that are created and destroyed simply as part of the normal execution of a Delphi program, including in response to events processed automatically by a TForm object in response to the messages generated by the system simply to maintain the window object itself in existence in the Windows own Window Manager . For example, consider this snipped fragment of code from the TCustomForm WndProc : WM_MEASUREITEM: begin : Canvas := TControlCanvas.Create; with Canvas do try : finally Canvas.Free; end; : end; The key here being that in response to a WM_MEASUREITEM message, a custom form (and therefore a standard TForm derived class, since this ultimately derives from TCustomForm ) creates a temporary TControlCanvas , which it then Free 's when it is finished with it. This may not necessarily be the source of the TObject.Free calls that you are seeing in your particular form's case, it is just an example, but shows how a TForm merely existing can result in other objects being brought into existence and destroyed in response to automatic, system generated messages.
