Causal assumptions when treating time series as a bunch of points

Suppose there are two time series, $x_t$ and $y_t$ , that capture daily counts of some sort. $x_t$ is believed to have causal impact on $y_t$ . Suppose further that a simple regression is fit to the data, disregarding the time aspect: $$y_t = \alpha + \beta x_t + \epsilon.$$ There are at least the following two features that make this case difficult to reason about: the treatment being non-binary and the time aspect. What assumptions are needed in order to legitimately give $\beta$ a causal interpretation?
