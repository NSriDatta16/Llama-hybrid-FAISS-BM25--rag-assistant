It's as if the GUI is showing but all over the under lying logic is not there. Any idea what may be the issue? Without code it is a little hard to say. But some preliminary questions are: Does the code swallow exceptions at any stage? (If so, fix that immediately!) What is reported in the Java Console when the application launches? When debugging, it is essential to ensure the console pops open for every launch of a Java applet or JWS app. Console visibility is configured via the Java Control Panel .
