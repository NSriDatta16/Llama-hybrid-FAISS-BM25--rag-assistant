What gems should I use to have a Ruby app talk to an LDAP server?

My overall goal is to let users of my Rails app authenticate against our organization's ActiveDirectory server over LDAP. (Did I say that right?) I'd like to try the Ruby ActiveLDAP gem. The docs say it depends on either... RubyLDAP or... ruby-net-ldap Does it matter which one I use? Am I heading in the right general direction by investigating Ruby ActiveLDAP? Is there something else that's better?
