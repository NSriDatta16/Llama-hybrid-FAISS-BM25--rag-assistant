Oracle Database: Index-Organized Table with NULL Values (in Multiple-Column Primary Key)

How can I set a column to be an "" (the empty string, equivalent to NULL in Oracle), when that column is part of a multiple-column primary key? This is the motivation... CREATE TABLE entities ( column1 VARCHAR2(10) , column2 VARCHAR2(10) , body VARCHAR2(4000) , CONSTRAINT pk_entities -- can't do this, because sometimes PRIMARY KEY ( column1, column2 ) -- col2 is the empty string (NULL). ) ORGANIZATION INDEX ... Normally, I'd use a "real" primary key like a meaningless sequential id (see this question ) and then put a unique constraint over my data columns, like so... CREATE TABLE entities ( , id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY , column1 VARCHAR2(10) , column2 VARCHAR2(10) , body VARCHAR2(4000) , CONSTRAINT unq_entities UNIQUE ( column1, column2 ) ) ORGANIZATION INDEX ... However, this is a big index-organized table (IOT), so the primary key has to be on the data columns (in IOTs, the data is the index) or else... What should I do? Thanks! â™¥
