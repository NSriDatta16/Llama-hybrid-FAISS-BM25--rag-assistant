As I understand it, a key can store more than one value for a particular element No. A key may map a value with more than one node. So, here: 0"> You're saying: let be $enemyList all the value attributes from attributes child elements from every node wich has a 'enemyItems' key with value equal to context node's key attribute, and if the string lenght of the string value from the first node in $enemyList node set is greater than 0, then output the value of context node's name attribute. EDIT : In your second XSLT fragment: 0"> Now, inside for-each , the context node is every node wich map with the key. So, you could define $enemyList like: This could also return several nodes if there ara more than one attributes child having a value attribute. But now, this: It's de name attribute of the context node... (the one wich map with the key)
