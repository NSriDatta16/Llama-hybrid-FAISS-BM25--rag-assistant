It’s not clear how $R^2$ should be defined in such a scenario. In another answer , Richard Hardy accurately points out the issues of squaring the correlation between the predicted and actual values. I give some graphs of that kind of problem in my answer to a related question. Consequently, such a definition of $R^2$ leads to a calculated value that is less helpful than one might hope. Then there’s my idea to compare the square loss of your model to the square loss of a baseline “must beat” model . However, it is not clear what such a baseline should be in time series forecasting. Do you use the mean of some subset of the data? Do you use the mean of all periods before your forecast? Do you use mean of all true observations, even though you would not have had access to all of those observations when you had to make your predictions? That is how Python's sklearn.metrics.r2_score would do it. For financial predictions, I could see using a historical model of some index, such as knowing the historical return of the S&P 500 or (probably even better) the return on the S&P 500 over the same period. Because of this ambiguity in how to define $R^2$ and what would make for a useful calculation, such a metric seems to be avoided: the obvious calculation based on correlation has major issues, and it is not clear what remedy is appropriate. I do believe there would be value to making such a comparison to some kind of baseline model, however. For instance, a financial advisor might boast to clients about making them a $15\%$ return on their money. That sounds impressive, but if the clients could have invested in the S&P 500 over that same time and made $17\%$ , the clients should be disappointed with their advisor. (There are all kinds of complexities when it comes to a real financial problem, such as older people near retirement not wanting to incur the risks that go along with stock investing, but I think this illustrates why some kind of comparison to a baseline model would be valuable. (An additional complication could be fees paid to an advisor or money manager.))
