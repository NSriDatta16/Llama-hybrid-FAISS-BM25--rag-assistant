Graham helped me solve this over on the mod_wsgi mailing list. http://groups.google.com/group/modwsgi/browse_thread/thread/4046eaf290a49b1e/ae14888450de39f5#ae14888450de39f5 Here's a summary: The problem was my installation of python was done via Homebrew. Homebrewâ€™s python is not installed as a framework OR dylib install so it could not be used for embedding (such as in Apache/mod_wsgi). Instead I installed python 2.6.4 from source: ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/python-2.6.4 --enable-framework=/usr/local/python-2.6.4/frameworks --enable-universalsdk=/ MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.5 --with-universal-archs=3-way make sudo make install I was able to build a version of python 2.6.4 that I could then build mod_wsgi with: ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/python-2.6.4/bin/python make sudo make install To confirm: otool -L /opt/apache2/modules/ mod_wsgi.so /opt/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.0.0) /usr/local/python-2.6.4/frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Python (compatibility version 2.6.0, current version 2.6.0) shows that python is now using the 2.6.4 framework and not the system one. When I start apache, I no longer get the version mismatch warnings. I re-installed django, psycopg2, and so on into my new python installation and everything is working like a charm. Thanks again for your help!
