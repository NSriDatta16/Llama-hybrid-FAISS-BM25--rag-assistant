UAgent CodeIgniter Library Installation Errors

The codeigniter library, UAgent, is giving me errors on installation. Here is the error: A PHP Error was encountered Severity: Warning Message: Missing argument 1 for Shared_Framework::__construct(), called in /system/libraries/Loader.php on line 928 and defined Filename: libraries/Shared_Framework.php This happens when I execute the following code: $this->load->library('Shared_Framework'); $this->load->library('Uagent'); This is what the manual says to do but I can't figure out how to fix the error. Here is the link to the library just in case: http://www.vvvlad.com/resources/uagent
