Only if you have optimisation turned off! Once the optimiser gets hold of your code all bets are off. Common strategies for aggressive optimisations are: Drop the variable if its never used or is just a copy of another variable. Reorder varaibles in the order they are used. This helps greatly if your app is using swap space and also helps cache utilisation (on some machines). Move often used variables into registers. Common on risk machinces with 32 lovely genreral purpose registers. Not so common on Intel with its measly eight single purpose registers. Change the data type. e.g. casting small ints to intgers often speeds up register loading and caching. reorder storage to minimise slack bytes. eg char a, double b, char c, int d could be reordered to double b, int d, char a, char c thus saving 10 bytes.
