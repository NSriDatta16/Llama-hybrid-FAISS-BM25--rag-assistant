display a long string in a table row

i have a tableview which displays the result from the web service the result fron the web sevice is in form of string array, where each string in the array is pretty long. It is like "1|123|JP Morgan|111|2000.0|Pending", similarly there are strings which i diplay in each row of the table. but as you can see the string is very long, to display it in a single table row. in the table view, i can just view first 3 ie "1|123|JP Morgan" the it shows..... how can i display the entire string in the table
