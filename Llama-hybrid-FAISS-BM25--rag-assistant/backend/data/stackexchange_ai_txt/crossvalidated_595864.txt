I know your concern and reasoning is this: Kernels(like for blurring etc) extract/identify certain features they are designed for in normal image processing tasks and so, why the need for them in CNN since their use in CNN is to extract/identify features as well? The answer is simply this: in CNN, you don't know the kernel to use before hand, it is created on-the-fly based on the errors back propagation. Now, the kernels can be in the position of having to extract complex features. What do you think now? Do you think simple multiplication and addition as in the convolutional process is enough to extract complex features? Atleast you need complex functions and hence, the need for non-linearity of activation functions after convolution.
