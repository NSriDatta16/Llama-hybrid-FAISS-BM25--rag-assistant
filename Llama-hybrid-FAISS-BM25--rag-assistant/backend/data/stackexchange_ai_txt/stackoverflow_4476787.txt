Drop the overflow: hidden; on .container and it will work. The problem is that during the drag you're moving a child of .container outside of the .container element, you've told the browser to hide any overflow while you're forcing an overflow during the drag and the browser is doing what you told it to do. General advice: leave overflow alone unless you know what it does and why you need to use it.
