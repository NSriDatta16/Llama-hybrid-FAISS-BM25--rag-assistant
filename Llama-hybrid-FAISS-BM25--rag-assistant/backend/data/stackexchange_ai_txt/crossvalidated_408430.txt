If you have only one predictor x, you can use it on the x axis, on the y axis you can put the binary outcome and additionaly, you can plot the function with the predicted values. Here is such a plot: Further, keep in mind that "one very common way of assessing the usefulness of a binary classifier is the ROC curve" ( here ). So you can also make a ROC curve plot for a logistic regression. For the example above the ROC curve looks like this: If you are not familiar with roc curves you can see the link above or here . The R Code library(ggplot2) set.seed(1) # make it reproducible x1 = rnorm(1000) # some continuous variables z = 1 + 5*x1 # linear combination with a bias pr = 1/(1+exp(z)) # pass through an inv-logit function y = rbinom(1000,1,pr) # bernoulli response variable df = data.frame(y=y,x1=x1) # make a dataframe lmodel = treshold_i, levels=c(TRUE, FALSE)) # create a table table_results
