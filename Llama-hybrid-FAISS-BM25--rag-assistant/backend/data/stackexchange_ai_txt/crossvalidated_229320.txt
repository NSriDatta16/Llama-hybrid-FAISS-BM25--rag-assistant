Applying PCA to data that fail a normality test

We want to apply PCA to monitor our process testing data. After we plot the density of the testing data and do normality tests, we found them to be definitely not normal, but still symmetrical and long tailed. What distribution can these be? If they are not normal, is PCA still be applicable? If not, what other monitoring technique could be used? We have too many of those testing data, so eyeballing them 1 by 1 is definitely not a good choice. shapiro test ARM_Z RAMP_Z DISC_Z RAMP_Z8 ARM_Z1 ARM_Z2 0.0000 0.0032 0.0000 0.0724 0.0246 0.0000 adf test ARM_Z RAMP_Z DISC_Z RAMP_Z8 ARM_Z1 ARM_Z2 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 jarque-bera test ARM_Z.X-squared RAMP_Z.X-squared DISC_Z.X-squared RAMP_Z8.X-squared ARM_Z1.X-squared ARM_Z2.X-squared 0.0000 0.4580 0.0003 0.8591 0.0029 0.0000 They are more peaked than corresponding fitted normal distributions.
