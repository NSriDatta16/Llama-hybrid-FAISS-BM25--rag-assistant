Design: The study is an observational design. Some may call it a correlational design, but I'm not a fan of such terminology because it can encourage the false assumption that the ability to draw a causal inference is related to the statistical test used. Following up on this point, ANOVA does not permit causal inference any more than correlation. The issue is whether a variable was experimentally manipulated. It's just that most of the time variables manipulated are categorical and not numeric, so we end up using ANOVAs to analyse their effect. As a general rule validating a causal proposition is easier where you experimentally manipulate the variable of interest. However, I would argue that correlations drawn from an observational design are still informative, particularly if they are combined with solid theoretical knowledge about the phenomena. Causal Inference: Many of the things related to anxiety experienced in the scanner are themselves related to the concept of anxiety. For example, panic, claustrophobia related thoughts and so on. Thus, showing that they are correlated, to my mind does not suggest causality. Rather, I would say that they are syndrome of co-occurring mental states that presumably have some common cause. I suppose this would be an example of me using prior knowledge of the phenomena and combining this with the correlational evidence. The study is also limited to examining what causes individual differences in MRI anxiety. It does not examine how MRI implementation could be altered to make it more or less anxiety evoking. However, I suppose you could use the reported levels of anxiety in the scanner as evidence that the scanner causes anxiety. Presumably we have an implicit control group in our minds that says most of the time people are not anxious about being in a scanner (particularly if they are not actually in a scanner). I don't think the return rate is a major issue, although it might be worth considering whether this is biasing your results. Some of the other variables are presumably getting at the question of whether anxiety experienced in a scanner is related (or even caused) by a general disposition of the person. The fact that the general measures of anxiety, depression, and so on are measured after the MRI study is potentially a confound, although a researcher would probably argue that such measures are relatively stable over time.
