Allen Holub made a big splash with "Why getter and setter methods are evil" back in 2003. It's great that you've found and read the article. I admire anybody who's learning and thinking critically about what they're doing. But take Mr. Holub with a grain of salt. This is one view that got a lot of attention for its extreme position and the use of the word "evil", but it hasn't set the world on fire or been generally accepted as dogma. Look at C#: they actually added syntactic sugar to the language to make get/set operations easier to write. Either this confirms someone's view of Microsoft as an evil empire or contradicts Mr. Holub's statement. The fact is that people write objects so that clients can manipulate state. It doesn't mean that every object written that way is wrong, evil, or unworkable. The extreme view is not practical.
