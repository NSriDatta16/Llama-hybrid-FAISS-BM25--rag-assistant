Is there a method to check the homogeneity of variance of a single time series?

I have a data frame with prices/dates, is there a method that checks if the variance is homogeneous during all the series? I know there are many test like fligner.test, bartlett.test but I need to pass to those methods few groups....I don't have groups I have only one series and I need to know if the variance is constant. Thank you
