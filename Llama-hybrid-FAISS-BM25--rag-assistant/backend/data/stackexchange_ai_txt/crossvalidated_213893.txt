The other answers are helpful from a general perspective, but there is an additional consideration for this data set: it's too small. Note that you do not really have 114 informative data points from the perspective of logistic regression. The effective data size in logistic regression is the smaller number of the 2 outcome classes. That's only 9 in this data set (the "incorrect" cases). Based on the rule of thumb of 10-20 of the least-frequent case per predictor variable evaluated, that's barely enough to support analysis of the main A versus B effect. Treating the 30 individuals as a random effect in a mixed model adds at least 1 more predictor to the model (if only differences among intercepts are of interest) and adds 2 predictors if you also care about differences in slope (as you seem to, given your initial attempt to look at the treatment/time interaction). So you really need about 3 times as much data to accomplish what you want.
