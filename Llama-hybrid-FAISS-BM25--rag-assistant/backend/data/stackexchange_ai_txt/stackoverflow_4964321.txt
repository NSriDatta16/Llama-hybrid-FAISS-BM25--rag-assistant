Google will follow your links and index the ?img=67 pages, and will not index your #! pages, because it can't see those links. You can tell Google about those links by doing the following: Add to the of your document, and Handle requests for /?_escaped_fragment_= by returning an "HTML Snapshot" of your page that has all your #! links in the tags. Also, to make the most of this feature, you should also handle requests for /?_escaped_fragment_=img=67 by returning an HTML snapshot page with the big image displayed. Remember, GoogleBot doesn't execute Javascript. Using the #! URL tells Google to retrieve an alternate version of the page (A version where #! has been replaced with ?_escaped_fragment_= ) that should render without Javascript .
