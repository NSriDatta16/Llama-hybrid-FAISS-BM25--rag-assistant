I think when you classifier A has a high probability you can trust classifier A. Now the problem is that A misses a LOT and B predicts a LOT. I can think that since both are trained on the same set of data you can try playing with the classification threshold. This will help you better tune Precision & Recall for a model Also, I believe you can build a model on top of the predictions of model A & B. Use the predicted probabilities and labels as features and try to predict the correct class either - using logistic regression will be good.
