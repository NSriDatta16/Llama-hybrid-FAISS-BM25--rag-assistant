Can I rotate a (classical) MDS result with varimax etc.?

I have a matrix of (scaled) co-occurence counts which I would like to summarise using (classical, i.e. PCA-related) Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), and then rotate (with varimax() , quartimax() , or really any other optimisation routine). Let Azra be the matrix of (scaled) co-occurence counts: Azra I first calculate a distance matrix as per this recommendation . Then I plug that into classical MDS aka. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) aka. Torgerson's MDS which, I understand, is basically a Principal Components Analysis , only based on Euclidian distances, not correlations or covariances. Then we plot the results in slices (because we MDS on 3 dimensions), just for kicks and giggles. distances So far so good. Can I now rotate the resulting matrix as I would rotate a loadings matrix from a PCA? It sure is technically possible to rotate and MDS result with varimax() and the results are different: any(varimax(as.matrix(md_scaled))$loadings == as.matrix(md_scaled)) #> [1] FALSE Anyway, can I just rotate the results from this MDS as I please ?
