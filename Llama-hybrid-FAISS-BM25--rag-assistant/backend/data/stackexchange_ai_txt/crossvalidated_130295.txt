Can Hidden Markov Models be used to predict next observation?

I am reading up on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for my research and would like to know if it is applicable to the problem I wish to tackle. My problem is to detect/estimate the next value of a sequence of observations that comes from a finite alphabet. I think I can model the observations as coming from an HMM, as in I believe it is possible to devise a Markov chain where the probability distribution of the observation is only dependent on the current state and at each state a new observation is derived. Now, supposing I formulate such an HMM, is it now possible to make use of the tools available for HMMs to predict the next observation or is it only useful to predict the next (hidden) state?
