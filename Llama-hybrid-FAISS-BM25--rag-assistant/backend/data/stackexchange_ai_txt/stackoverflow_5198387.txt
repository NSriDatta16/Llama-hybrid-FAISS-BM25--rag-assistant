How can I make the iPhone recording and playback audio level meter look the same?

I display an audio level meter for recording and playback of that recording. The level values are from 0 - 1.0. I draw a bar representing the 0 - 1.0 value on screen. To get the audio levels for recording I use: OSStatus status = AudioQueueGetProperty(aqData.mQueue, kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentLevelMeter, aqLevelMeterState, &levelMeterStateDataSize); float level = aqLevelMeterState[0].mAveragePower; For playback I use: // soundPlayer is an AVSoundPlayer float level = [soundPlayer averagePowerForChannel:0]; I normalize level from 0 - 1.0. Right now they look very different when showing the bar. The recording meter bar is more on the low end while the playback bar meter, when playing back that same recorded audio, stays more in the middle. I'm trying to make the two meters look the same, but I'm fairly new to audio. I've done a bit of research and know that the recording is returning an RMS value and the playback is returning it in decibels. Can someone knowledgeable in audio point me to links or documents, or give a little hint to make sense of these two values so that I can start making them look the same?
