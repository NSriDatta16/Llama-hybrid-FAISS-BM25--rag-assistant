How to feed a Knowledge Base into Language Models?

Iâ€™m a CS undergrad trying to make my way into NLP Research. For some time, I have been wanting to incorporate "everyday commonsense reasoning" within the existing state-of-the-art Language Models; i.e. to make their generated output more reasonable and in coherence with our practical world. Although there do exist some commonsense knowledge bases like ConceptNet (2018), ATOMIC (2019), OpenMind CommonSense (MIT), Cyc (1984), etc., they exist in form of knowledge graphs, ontology, and taxonomies. My question is, how can I go about leveraging the power of these knowledge bases into current transformer language models like BERT and GPT-2? How can we fine-tune these models (or maybe train new ones from scratch) using these knowledge bases, such that they retain their language modeling capabilities but also get enhanced through a new commonsense understanding of our physical world? If any better possibilities exist other than fine-tuning, I'm open to ideas.
