Single click in a drag and drop JTable

Sorry if this was asked before, I googled everywhere with no luck. Here's my problem: I'd like to drag and drop rows within a JTable. I cannot get it to work without first selecting the row, which is annoying, I'd like to get a similar behavior the Windows explorer has : if I single click on an item and start moving the mouse while holding the left button, it drags my row, if I single click elsewhere and start moving the mouse while holding the left button, it does a multiple selection of the rows. Any help is greatly appreciated
