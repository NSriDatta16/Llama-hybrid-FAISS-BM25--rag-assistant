Each point on the partial dependence plot is the average vote percentage in favor of the "Yes trees" class across all observations, given a fixed level of TRI. It's not a probability of correct classification. It has absolutely nothing to do with accuracy, true negatives, and true positives. When you see the phrase Values greater than TRI 30 begin to have a positive influence for classification in your model is an puffed-up way of saying Values greater than TRI 30 begin to predict "Yes trees" more strongly than values lower than TRI 30
