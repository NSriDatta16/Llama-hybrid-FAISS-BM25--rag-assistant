What is translation invariance in computer vision and convolutional neural network?

I don't have computer vision background, yet when I read some image processing and convolutional neural networks related articles and papers, I constantly face the term, translation invariance , or translation invariant . Or I read alot that the convolution operation provides translation invariance ?!! what does this mean? I myself always translated it to myself as if it means if we change an image in any shape, the actual concept of the image doesn't change. For example if I rotate an image of a lets say tree, it's again a tree no matter what I do to that picture. And I myself consider all operations that can happen to an image and transform it in a way (crop it, resize it, gray-scale it,color it etc...) to be this way. I have no idea if this is true so I would be grateful if anyone could explain this to me .
