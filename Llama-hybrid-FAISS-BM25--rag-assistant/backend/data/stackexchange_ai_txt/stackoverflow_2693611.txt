jQuery Cookie Help

So I have never attempted to use a cookie and was wondering if someone could possibly help me with some functionality I am trying to achieve.. Essentially I have a jQuery function that is fired when a user visits a webpage. What I would like to do is make it to where that animation only plays once.. Possibly leveraging some cookie that would tell it not to play again for x amount of days. I noticed that alot of people having questions about cookies and jQuery have been mentioned the following cookie plugin , but I dont even really know how to leverage it. Any ideas? Right now the animation is: $('#header, #footer, #secondary-column').fadeTo(600, 1); I would assume that if I could set a cookie to tell it the following: $('#header, #footer, #secondary-column').fadeTo(0, 1);
