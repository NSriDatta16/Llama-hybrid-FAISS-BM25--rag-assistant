In your route table you could do something like this: "items/company/{organizationId?}/{locationId?}/{category?}" and have your controller action look like this: public virtual ActionResult Get(string organizationId, string locationId, string category) { ... } In my opinion, this beats querystrings as it is much more discoverable.
