EDIT: When I completed your test, here was the final URL: http://hofstrateach.org/Roberto/process.php?keys=Grade1&keys=Nathan&keys=North%20America&keys=5&keys=3&keys=no&keys=foo&keys=blat&keys=0%3A0%3A24> This is probably a malformed URL. When you pass duplicate keys in a query, PHP makes them an array. The above URL should probably be something like: http://hofstrateach.org/Roberto/process.php?grade=Grade1&schoolname=Nathan&region=North%20America&answer[]=5&answer[]=3&answer[]=no&answer[]=foo&answer[]=blat&time=0%3A0%3A24 This will create individual entries for most of the fields, and make $_GET['answer'] be an array of the answers provided by the user. Bottom line: fix your Flash file.
