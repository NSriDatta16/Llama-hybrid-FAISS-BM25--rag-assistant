What is the difference between S (singular values) returned by SVD function and latent returned by PCA function in matlab?

I ask this because from my understanding, they both are same, because they both denote variance along most important dynamics. So their corresponding values should be the same, but as clearly seen in matlab this is not the case. why latent values returned by pca matlab are not singular values ?
