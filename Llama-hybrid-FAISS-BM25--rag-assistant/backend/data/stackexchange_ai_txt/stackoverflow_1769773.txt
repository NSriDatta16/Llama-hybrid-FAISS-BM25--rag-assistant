It would seem that flying saucer does not have a way of specifying resources on the classpath, so I work around by making a classpath: protocol url handler at the linked question Post Implementation Findings It would seem that the some of the premises of this question are invalid. After writing my own classpath URL loader, I found that you need to request in the jnlp to be able to use URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory() . In fact, you need to request all permissions to do just about anything fancy (even though you're only modifying your own sand-box). See the full list here . In short, this means that I am able to extract files to the operating system. But it's nice having a classpath loader now...
