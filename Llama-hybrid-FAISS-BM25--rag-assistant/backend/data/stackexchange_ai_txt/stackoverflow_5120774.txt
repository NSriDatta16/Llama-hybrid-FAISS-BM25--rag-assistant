You'll want to encrypt the file, for which your best bet is probably Common Crypto. In order to be able to access the data offline, you need to store the encryption key on the device. The solution is to use the keychain: Use SecRandomCopyBytes to generate a key of sufficient length, and store it in the keychain using SecItemAdd . Then use that key to encrypt the data and write it to the device's local storage in the normal manner. When it comes time to read the file back from disk, use SecItemCopyMatching to load the key from the keychain and use it to decrypt the data.
