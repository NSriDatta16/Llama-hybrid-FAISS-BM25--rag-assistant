Okay after some fiddling around, trial and error and taking reference from another post that I came across in a Google search I've managed to solve my problem! Here's the new code: \nQuery: $agentsquery"); mysqli_next_result($link); mysqli_next_result($link); mysqli_next_result($link); if ($result = mysqli_store_result($link)) { $i = 0; while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)){ $number_of_apps = getAgentAppsWeek($row['agent_name'],$weeknum,$current_year); $i++; ?> "> after sticking mysqli_next_result in there multiple times for each query it magically worked! yay! I understand why it works, because i'm telling it to skip to the next result 3 times, so it skips to the result for query #4 which is the one i want to use. Seems a bit clunky to me though, there should just be a command for something like mysqli_last_result($link) or something if you ask me... Thanks for the help rik and f00, I got there eventually :)
