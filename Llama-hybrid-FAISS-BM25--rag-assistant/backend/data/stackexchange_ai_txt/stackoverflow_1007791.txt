Note this is not going to address the question. An explicitly instantiated and exported singleton should do the trick... -Rick Check out #pragma data_seg here basically, you need to declare an instance of the singleton in a shared section of your code. By default statics are scoped to the dll. It may get tricky with templates, but this is the path to success here that doesn't involve passing / copying static data around.
