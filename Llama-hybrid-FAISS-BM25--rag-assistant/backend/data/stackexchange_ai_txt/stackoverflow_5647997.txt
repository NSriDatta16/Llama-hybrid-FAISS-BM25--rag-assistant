Writables can be used for de/serializing objects. For example a log entry can contain a timestamp, an user IP and the browser agent. So you should implement your own WritableComparable for a key that identifies this entry and you should implement a value class that implements Writable that reads and writes the attributes in your log entry. These serializations are just a handy way to get the data from a binary format to an object. Some Frameworks like HBase still require byte arrays to persist the data. So you'll have a lot of overhead in transfering this by yourself and messes up your code.
