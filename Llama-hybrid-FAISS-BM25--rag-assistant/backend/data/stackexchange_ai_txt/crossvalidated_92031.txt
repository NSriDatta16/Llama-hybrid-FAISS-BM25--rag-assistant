Non-informative prior for Poisson/gamma density

In the Albert book on Bayesian computation with R, exercise 4.8.5 (p.83), it is suggested to use $$ p(a, b) \sim (a \times b)^{-2} $$ as the non-informative prior for the Poisson/Gamma model: $$ f(y\,|\, a,b) = \frac{\Gamma(y+a)}{\Gamma(a) \times y!}\frac{b^{a}}{(b+1)^{y+a}} $$ It does work, but could anyone give me an intuition on that - in other words, why is this prior non-informative?
