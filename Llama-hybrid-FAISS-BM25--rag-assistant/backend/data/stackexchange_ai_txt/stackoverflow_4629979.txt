Nested select statement in SQL Server

Why doesn't the following work? SELECT name FROM (SELECT name FROM agentinformation) I guess my understanding of SQL is wrong, because I would have thought this would return the same thing as SELECT name FROM agentinformation Doesn't the inner select statement create a result set which the outer SELECT statement then queries?
