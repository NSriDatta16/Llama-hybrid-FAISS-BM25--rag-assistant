Drupal : access restriction on comments

I would like to have a restriction mechanism (access restrictions) on the comments that are posted on a node. In my system, all nodes are public. However, I would like the replies to be tied to Organic Groups so that only member of that group can view the reply. ( Ex. Groups could be 'Paid User Group' and 'Free Group' ) Scenario: there is a forum topic which is viewable publicly. It has three replies . Two posted publicily and one tied to Paid user group. when a free user logs in he sees the topic and two comments while a paid user sees the topic and all the three comments . How can this be achived in drupal 6? Will i need to buildmy own permissioning system? thanks
