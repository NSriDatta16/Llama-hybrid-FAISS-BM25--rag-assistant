Some more comments to the OP's code. Consider separating that gigantic uberl33tlist class and break it up into smaller files. Seeing all those friends class declaration is making me rather uncomfortable. There are also some tricky semantics When you're using stuff like friend class UberList; friend class CIter; In some cases those statements also end up forward declaring those classes if they don't exist yet. There's also something not quite right looking about your assignment operator here: UberList operator = (const UberList & OL) { UberList NL = new (OL); return NL; } Also in your main you have it2++; ulist.insertAfter(b, it2); //... You're using postfix operator ++ for it2 but didn't implement that your iterator class. Borland accepts it by using the prefix instead but gives a warning. Gcc actually flags that as an error and rejects the code. Might want to look into that
