storing a Book using SQL Server

Hi and thank you for your attention I'm working on a database system project and i must implement a digital library using SQL Server. I dont know how can i store a book with 1000 pages (page by page and with serching ability) in SQL Server I was thinking about creating a table with 1000 columns with ntext type,but i think it isn't really a wise way. could anyone help me with a suitable method for this problem. I also going to store multipage image books and voice books thank you.
