How to improve this HTML code

Follow up question to achieving hover effect answer , most said that the HTML markup below was abysmal. So I implemented one of their suggestion which is to change tables into divs. Abyssal Warder Fire Orbs: (3) Affinity: Fire Energy: 250 Type: Creature (Giant Destroyer) Charges: 1 Rarity: UR Edition: Lost Souls Weapon: L Size: XL Attack: 2500 Defense: 2500 CardID: Crystal Spikes - Activate to ram Abyssal Warder's crystaline fist into the ground. Crystal Spikes will erupt from the ground and within 4 seconds cover a 20m radius. They deal 570 damage to enemies within it, up to 1710 in total that cannot be warded off with the help of damage reducing abilities as the crystals are able to circumvent every buff or protective shield. Knocks back small and medium units. Only affects ground entities. Reusable every 20 seconds. (Power: 80) Infused Breakdown - Upon dying the unit collapses into pieces that will reassemble on their own to form two large sized Abyssal Warders. If those die their remains will again form to medium sized golems each. All smaller variants of Abyssal Warder are enraged and deal increasingly more damage the longer they attack. Upgrade I: Empire ( Standard ) Honor Tokens: 0 Victory Tokens: 4 Battle Tokens: 30 PvP Rank: 8 Upgrade II: Empire ( Advance ) Honor Tokens: 0 Victory Tokens: 30 Battle Tokens: 60 PvP Rank: 9 Upgrade III: Empire ( Expert ) Honor Tokens: 40 Victory Tokens: 70 Battle Tokens: 120 PvP Rank: 10 Here is before and after the changes. Before I proceed to CSS, is there any html codes I should add or remove? Any div tags I should change? P.S. I will be using Microsoft Excel to automate more than 500 html pages and uploading them manually one by one, so it is important that I get this right.
