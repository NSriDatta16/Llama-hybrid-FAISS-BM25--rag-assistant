I don't think there'd be a noticeable performance difference in storing your parameters in the HttpCache versus a Singleton object. Either way, you need to load the parameters when the app starts up. The advantage of using the HttpCache is that it is already built to handle an expiration and refresh, which I assume you would want. If you never want to refresh the parameters, then I suppose you could use a Singleton due to the simplicity. The advantage of building your own custom class is that you can get some static typing for your parameters, since everything you fetch from HttpCache will be an object . However, it would be trivial to build your own wrapper for the HttpCache that will return a strongly typed object.
