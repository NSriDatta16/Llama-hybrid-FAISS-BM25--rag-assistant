Metropolis algorithm to Bernoulli likelihood and beta prior (Kruschke 7.3.1)

This question pertains to a specific line written in the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis by John K. Kruschke. In section 7.3.1, he applies Metropolis algorithm to a case with: $prior = beta(\theta|1,1), N = 20,$ and $z = 14$ . Then he proposes jumps with $normal(0, \sigma)$ where $\sigma$ can be 0.02, 0.2 or 2. When $\sigma = 0.2$ he writes that jump is between +-0.2 for 68% of the time(which I understand) and proposed jumps are accepted roughly half the time as $N_{acc}/N_{pro} = 0.495$ . I do not understand this - how do I get to this result.
