Database access in GUI thread , bad isn't it?

I'm working through some MSDN examples, and some books on ADO.Net. What they all have in common is using the point/click/drag-drop design time feature in Visual Studio to develop database applications, binding data sets to controls etc. And the resulting code does all DB access in the GUI thread, as far as I can tell. This sounds like bad practice, and annoying behavior of the application of the database access once queries starts to take time. Am I missing something ? Is this how we're supposed to develop database applications ? I usually woudn't think twice about placing network IO in a seperate thread, always.
