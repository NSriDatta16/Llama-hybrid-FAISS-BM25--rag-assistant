Giving links some good tutorial which will help you understand concepts of deep learning and give you enough background to be able to implement simple models for your own problems. https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730 It's approx. duration is three months but with a little more effort you should be able to finish it in two. Another one is Andrew Ng course on Coursera. You should really check it out. Quick intro to Deep Learning: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist/
