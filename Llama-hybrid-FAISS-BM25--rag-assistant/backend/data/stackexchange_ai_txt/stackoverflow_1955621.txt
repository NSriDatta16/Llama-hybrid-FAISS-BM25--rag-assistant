Your best bet is to have the API you expose require a version number to come in with the request. That way you can select the correct object to create. Worst case, every change is breaking and you end up with dozens of classes. Best case is that your design can handle it and you only end up with separate classes every now and then. Inheritance is probably going to be your friend on this one. The bottom line is you're basically screwed if you need to maintain 100% bacwards compatibility with a rapidly changing API. You're either going to end up with one gigantic unmaintainable class, or several classes that respond correctly to versioning.
