Drag-and-drop files onto an NSTableView?

I have an NSTableView which I wish to allow users to drag-and-drop video files onto. When they drop the file, it'll get added as a row in the table view. How would I go about doing this? Currently the tableview's takes its data from an Array Controller (which takes its data from a NSMutableArray) I found this documentation, but cannot seem to make it work.. I have.. made a "TableCon" class (which I changed to inherit from NSTableView, not NSObject) changed the NSTableView class to TableCon set the NSTableView's delegate outlet to that class called registerForDraggedTypes in TableCon's init implemented - (NSDragOperation)draggingEntered:(id )sender; (again in TableCon) ..but, nothing, it acts like I never changed anything (no errors), what am I doing wrong? Edit: I've tried implementing Boaz Stuller's suggestion, and also found this description of the solution (the first reply includes the solution to the first post). So what I have done now is.. Subclass NSArrayController which feeds content to the table view (TableListCon) Add tableView outlet to TableListCon (and pointed it at the NSTableView) Implement validateDrop, writeRowsWithIndexes, and acceptDrop in TableListCon Called registerForDraggedTypes on the tableView outlet. Again, no errors/warnings, but only the awakeFromNib method seems to be called (None of the other methods are called)
