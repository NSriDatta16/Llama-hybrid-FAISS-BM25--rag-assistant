In a Bayesian Framework, can we ever replace nuisance parameters by their MLE?

I am wondering if it is permissible in a Bayesian analysis to replace nuisance parameters with their maximum likelihood estimates. I am dealing with a model which commonly has several thousand of these, and it appears to be a stretch for my MCMC implementation. I would appreciate any research suggestions. thanks
