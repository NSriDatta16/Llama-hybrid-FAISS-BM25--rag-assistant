I would go with Sqlite using Aducom Sqlite components, they are easy to work with sqlite than DiSQLite, free and work as TDataset components, I would vote up for sqlite because: It's very fast and compact database. Very small footprint, just around 200kb Dll. It's can be linked static when used with Aducom components, so no needs for distribute the dll. It has built in support for full text search. It's wildly used and used in many free and commercial applications as external storage. It has most of standard SQL, so most of your knowledge in sql will be used.
