Subject lines are the only universal way I'm afraid. Have a look at GMail, that's how they do it and it can be fooled into threading unrelated items if the subjects are the same. I think email sent from Exchange has some sort of ID for a thread, but that only works inside an organisation running exchange, and I suspect it is not reliable if mails come from outside the organisation. You could try and thread using the subject and apply some heuristics to separate unrelated items (e.g. emails with completely different recipients would be unrelated). It's not foolproof though.
