What design should I use so a class can query one of it's ancestors?

I'm creating an object hierarchy that is representing a table that is draw on a control. My hierarchy looks like this : Table has multiple pages Page has multiple lines Line has multiple cells Cell has multiple glyph I want to have an option (a parameter) on the table to filter the column (cells) displayed. The client code can do something like this: myTable.ShowColumns(8,12) // Will display columns 8 to 12 Displaying and placing cells on the control is the responsibility of the Lines objects.How can I pass the informations of which cells are to be displayed from the Table object to the Line object? Should I give each line a reference to the table object? Should I try to pass the informations to each lines through the hierarchy each time Table.ShowColumns() is called? There must be an elegant way?
