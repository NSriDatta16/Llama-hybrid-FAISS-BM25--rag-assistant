Can statistical models choose themselves?

I am trying to make a criticism of the statement Of course the statistical models used for prediction donâ€™t choose themselves . Someone has to imagine what factors might be relevant, and there is a great deal of expertise and work that goes into designing and calibrating a statistical model. ( my emphasis ) found in the article The Curious Journalist's Guide to Data . Of course, it is the scientist who chooses what variables to consider in the model and one might fail to consider a variable that would explain most of the variance in the variable we are trying to explain. I get confused on the sense of this statement typically when considering methodology of model selection. There are objective(-ish) ways to select models (e.g. minimizing AIC via a backward regression procedure). I also get confused about this statement when thinking of bayesian methods and when thinking about machine learning (e.g. decision trees, classification and other). I suppose part of my inability to make sense of the statement might come from the inability to fully grasp the definition of the term statistical model Is there truth and is there inaccuracy into the above statement?
