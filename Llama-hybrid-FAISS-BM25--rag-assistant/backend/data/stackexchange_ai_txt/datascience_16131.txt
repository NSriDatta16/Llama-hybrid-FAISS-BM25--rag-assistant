which machine learning technique can be used?

I want to understand the intent of the customer using his search queries, let's say if a customer is interested in yoga pants, he can either search for yoga pants or exercise pants or workout tights etc. Is there a model that I can use to find out all the search keywords that can be related to yoga pants?
