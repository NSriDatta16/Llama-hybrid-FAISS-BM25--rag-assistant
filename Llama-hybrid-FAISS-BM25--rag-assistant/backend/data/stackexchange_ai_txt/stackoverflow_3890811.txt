Errors with Java Swing - Unknown changes

I have been working on a Swing based java program for a while now, today I have been editing the JComboBox (using Netbeans so I am unable to directly edit the code for it), at some point between edits the below errors have sudddenly appeared. Obviously at this point there is far too much code involved to post, but does anyone have any idea / experience of what may have caused this? I have made no direct changes to the source code since before this error began, but despite all efforts to undo all changes made today it has made no impact on these errors. I have even tried closing netbeans and restarting it on the off chance that it was just playing up. Also, what is the $1 at the end of Application indicating? I have not seen this previously Thanks for any and all suggestions. 08-Oct-2010 14:07:07 org.jdesktop.application.Application$1 run SEVERE: Application class nodeview.NodeViewApp failed to launch java.lang.NullPointerException at nodeview.NodeViewView.
