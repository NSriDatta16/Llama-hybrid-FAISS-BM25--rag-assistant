SAX parser issue

I am working on a RSS feed reader for a particular RSS feed, and I am having a problem with SAX and the tag. The tag looks like this South Korea vowed Wednesday to completely punish North Korea if it attacks again. ... ]]> My startElement method has this element to handle the description tag looks like this: if (localName.equals("description")) { currentstate = RSS_DESCRIPTION; return; } and my chars method looks like this: case RSS_DESCRIPTION: _item.setDescription(theString); Log.i("DESCRIPTION","characters[" + theString + "]"); currentstate = 0; break; The log file displays this: 12-22 11:21:06.517: INFO/TITLE(489): characters[SKorea holds massive new drills after North attack] 12-22 11:21:06.527: INFO/DESCRIPTION(489): characters[ 12-22 11:21:06.527: INFO/DESCRIPTION(489): ] This is my first attempt at working with SAX, and I am getting pretty close to rewriting the whole thing with a different parser, asking you guys is my last ditch effort. I have tried handling the paragraph tag, that does not work, presumably because it is inside of the CDATA. I have attempted to substring the descriptions like this String theString = new String(ch,start,length); /* if ( currentstate == RSS_DESCRIPTION){ theString = new String(ch, theString.indexOf(" ") + 3, theString.indexOf(" ")); } and the program just halts when it hits it. Thanks in advance for any help!!! -David
