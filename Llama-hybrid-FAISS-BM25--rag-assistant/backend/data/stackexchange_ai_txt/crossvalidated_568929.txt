KS-statistic decile seperation - significance?

I already referred the posts here and here but they are different and doesn't answer my problem. I am currently working on a binary classification problem with random forests, neural networks etc. During assessment of the model, I generated the below KS-statistic While I understand that KS-statistic indicates the seperation power between both classes, a) what does it mean to high seperation in Decile 1 vs 2 vs 5 or 8? and What is a good value for KS-statistic?
