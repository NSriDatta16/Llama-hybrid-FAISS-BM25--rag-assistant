QT warning level suggestion

What is the warning level you use while compiling QT projects? When I compiled with W4, I'm getting a lot of warnings such as: C4127: conditional expression is constant Should I compile at W3, or find other ways to handle warnings at W4, such as: adding a new header file and using pragma's(mentioned here C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices). What are your practices? Thanks.
