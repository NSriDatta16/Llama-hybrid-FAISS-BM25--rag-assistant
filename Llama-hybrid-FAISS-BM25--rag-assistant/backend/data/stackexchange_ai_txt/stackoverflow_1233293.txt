I agree with Hadi Teo that you need to set the transactioncurrencyid. Its been awhile since I ran across this - so here is what I think I remember. If you create a new entity with a money field populated the transaction currency will be set. If you update an entity, the transaction currency field will not be set. I haven't used the Activity to Case function so I'm not all that sure what it does. One thing you can do as a work around is to add the transactioncurrencyid onto the form. Then you can set it before you modify your Case. The other would be to default the currency in code. There are two places to determine the default currency. First off of the user settings. Second (if that is null) off of the organization settings.
