Show PDF inside Flash file? (Alternatives to FlashPaper)

I'm working on an interactive CD for a summer camp. What are my options for showing a PDF file within a Flash projector? AIR or a .NET wrapper are not options because we can't rely on any frameworks that may not be installed on the end-users' machine. (We've used FlashPaper in the past, but it looks bad and its not supported anymore. What's about fscommand?) EDIT: Reading a link posted in Jordan's question, I saw the possibility of embedding a web browser in the flash projector. Is there a way to embed a web browser or trigger a web browser (pointing to a particular local file) in a Flash Projector?
