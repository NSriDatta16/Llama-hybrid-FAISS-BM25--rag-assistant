Engle and Kozicki (1993)'s Serial Correlation Common Feature (SCCF) test

I have two auto-correlated stationary time series of I(o). I want to look for a common feature in them as per Engle and Kozicki (1993). Specifically I want to see if there is a linear combination of these two series that does not have serial correlation. Broadly, I am looking for a method to test for long run relationship between two stationary time series just as co-integration is used to test long run relationship between two non-stationary ones.
