Thank you for patient answers. Both are right: in case of one animation the stop method works. in case of multiple chained animations - sorry, there is no easy way. Reload if you want a short but not so elegant solution. To do it properly - learn javascript to build the logical chain of functions. You can't run long with just jQuery.
