Predicting past data from similar series

I have a data set that contains the amount sold of a product at each month of 2017, for each store that carries it. Some of the stores only opened in July, so for those I only have 6 months of data. The data set looks like this Store Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 1 23 25 19 28 19 23 24 18 12 28 33 34 2 - - - - - - 14 17 18 19 22 27 3 40 52 21 25 26 45 12 19 15 22 27 26 I would like to estimate how much those stores would have sold in the first 6 months of the year, but I'm not really sure how to do it. I thought about adjusting a time series model, including the sales of the other stores as variables to capture tendencies, but I don't know if that makes sense theory-wise. Can I do that? Is there another method that would make more sense in this scenario? PS: The data above is only to illustrate the problem. I actually have a lot more stores and a bigger time frame with more disperse data.
