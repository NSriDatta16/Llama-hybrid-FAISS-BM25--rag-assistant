Actually, that "use" declaration does absolutely nothing. You should import (use) namespaces when they are deeper in the namespace hierarchy (e.g. use Foo\Bar\Baz) or when you want to give them an alias (e.g. use Foo as Bar). I think you wanted to declare that the file itself belongs to MyNamespace: namespace MyNamespace; class NonPersistentStorage implements StorageInterface { /* ... */ } Or, you may also want to import separate functions and classes, using the same syntax as for namespaces.
