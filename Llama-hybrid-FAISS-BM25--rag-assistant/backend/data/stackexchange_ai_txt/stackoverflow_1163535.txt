Interesting concept. I think one of the things you need to consider is which webserver do you plan to use? I think the webserver support for Lua would be flaky at best, no offense to anyone involved but its just not a common web platform. With that said, however, the Lua Libraries And Bindings lists quite a few components that you could seemingly leverage for your efforts. I looked the list over and all things common to the web are there: databases, regex, network, zip, crypto, xml, images, etc. There's even a couple of web frameworks, so perhaps this is less rare than I thought?
