At the moment, there is no easy way to import CMS content into Magento. Neither dataflow nor the webservices contain profiles that would help here. On the other hand, the CMS pages and blocks are contained in only a few tables, so you may be able to import them using PHP (or whatever your language of choice is). Take a look in the database at the following tables: cms_page cms_page_store cms_block cms_block_store Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
