Sorry, it has been years since I've coded Perl. However, since there's no "copy and paste" answer posted for this question yet, here's how to scrape Wells Fargo in Ruby: require 'rubygems' require 'mechanize' username = 'your_username' password = 'your_password' agent = Mechanize.new agent.user_agent_alias = 'Windows IE 6' # get first page page = agent.get('https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon/') # find and fill form form = page.form_with(:name => 'Signon') form['userid'] = username form['password'] = password page = agent.submit form # find the refresh url page.body.match /content="1;URL=(.*?)"/ nexturl = $1 # wait a little while and then get the next page sleep 3 page = agent.get nexturl # If you have multiple accounts, you can use this. If you just have a single account, you can remove this block companies = [['Account1', '123456789'], ['Account2', '123456789']] companies.each do |name, id| form = page.form_with(:name => 'ChangeViewFormBean') form['viewKey'] = id page = agent.submit form available_balance = page.search("#cashTotalAvailBalance").text.strip puts "#{name}: #{available_balance}" sleep 2 end Works Cited: There's a guy who wrote a version of this script, posted it to his code directory and then forwarded the whole thing to his blog. His last name is Youngblood or similar. I found the source in the internet archive/way back machine and modified it to make what you see above. So, thanks Mr. Youngblood or similar, where ever you are - and thanks for teaching me the meta scrape trick!
