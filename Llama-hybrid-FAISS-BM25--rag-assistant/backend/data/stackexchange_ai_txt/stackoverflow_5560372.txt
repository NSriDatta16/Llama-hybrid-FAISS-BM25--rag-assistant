How to avoid unused resources and code from an Android Library Project getting into my APK?

I have an Android Library Project in my Eclipse workspace, that I use as a unique toolbox. By chance(1), I just discovered that resources from the library (xml animations, xml layouts, even drawables!!!) are packed into the APK's of the projects that use the library, even if I don't use them. After reading Does android always package unused resources? , I wonder if it's normal. How can I avoid this? Is the only way having different library projects? EDIT : I've found, decompiling the .dex, that unused code too makes it into the apk. (1) I was trying to test a new icon for my app, /res/drawable/icon.png , but the default icon would keep appearing. I removed the image and it kept showing the default icon! It had to be the /res/drawable-mdpi/icon.png from the library .
