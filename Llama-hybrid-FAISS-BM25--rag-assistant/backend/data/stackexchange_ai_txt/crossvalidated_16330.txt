Fisher's test has the null hypothesis that A is the same as B. Suppose that we have 50 observations each for A and B. Fisher's test puts all 100 observations in a bag, shakes it, pulls out 50, calling them A, then pulls out the remaining 50 and calls them B. Calculate the average of A - B. Repeat this permutation many times to get a distribution of the averages of A - B. Since our alternative is that A is superior to B, we reject if we got a really high value for A - B in the true sample. We count how many permutations were bigger than the one from the actual sample. You said 98% were. This means that A - B from the true sample is really low---only 2% of the permutations were lower. If the alternative hypothesis was that B is superior to A, then we are hypothesizing that A - B is small; this would have a p-value of 0.02---only 2% of the permutations were smaller. We could reject the null that A is the same as B. I caution against forming hypotheses after you see the data, however, as this biases your test statistics.
