You could produce a hash based on the file contents itself. There are two good reasons to do this: Allows you to never store the same file twice - for example, if you have two copies of a music file which are identical in content you could check to see if you have already stored that file, and just store it once. You separate meta-data (file name is just meta data) from the blob. So you would have a storage system which is indexed by the hash of the file contents, and you then associate the file meta-data with that hash lookup code. The risk of finding two files that compute the same hash that aren't indeed the same contents, depending on the size of the hash would be low, and you can effectively mitigate that by perhaps hashing the file in chunks (which could then lead to some interesting storage optimisation scenarios :P).
