How to do external validation of regression models

Very basic question here, so bear with me... I have a data set with 241 patients with 16 variables plus diagnosis (malignant vs benign). There are 3 previously published logistic regression formulas in the field: modelS ~ A + B + C + D + E + F modelH ~ modelS + G modelG ~ A + B + C + H I want to perform an external validation of each. Of course, I have plugged in the variables and have thus calculated the predicted probabilities of malignancy for each patient. Is there a more formal way to compare the performance of these prediction formulas? Of course I have derived my own formula (following Harrell's methodology and using package rms). How can I properly compare my formula with the previously published ones? Is it valid to take the parameters the previous formulas have found to be "significant" and derive the coefficients from my data set, thus deriving newModelS, newModelH and newModelG and then run stats (like C, likelihood chi2, etc) on those? I can also compare the newly replicated formulas by AICc, but does that inform on the previously published formulas? The more general question is "How do you perform an external validation of a logistic regression formula"?
