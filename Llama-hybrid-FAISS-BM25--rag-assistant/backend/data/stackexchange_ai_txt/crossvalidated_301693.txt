I found the previous answer confusing so this is my attempt to explain it. I can see this question two ways: By anomaly here you appear to mean that a particular feature is consistently corrupted, and your question is therefore: " if I do PCA and take the components corresponding to 95% of my variance, will the corrupted feature be present in these components? " If so, the answer is " insufficient data for meaningful conclusion ." PCA operates by looking at the empirical covariance of your data -- if the anomalous feature skews the empirical covariance sufficiently, then it will be present in the components you remove (assuming you mean standard PCA). So if the range of all your features is, say, [-0.1,0.1], you have few samples, and the anomaly is what you describe then it is going to heavily skew your PCA projection. Generally speaking, this is not a good idea at all. You might also be asking, "Some of my trials are anomalous, but only in a few dimensions. Does PCA for dimensionality reduction get rid of the anomaly?" to which the answer is "no." PCA, assuming it is applied to the data on which it is computed, looks at all dimensions and datapoints equally. If you are interested in outlier detection (which this would correspond to), and you know it is isolated to certain dimensions, your best bet is to simply run some sort of standard outlier detection procedure on each dimension independently.
