I had a similar problem. My solution: In the draggable object constructor I have: addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, onStartDrag); And in the onStartDrag() I put: stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE,onDrag); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, onDrop); You get a notification whenever the mouse moves, in our outside of the flash player, and a MOUSE_UP notification as soon as the button is released, also regardless of the mouse pointer position. Might not be applicable in your particular situation, but works like a charm for me. Don't forget to remove MOVE and UP listeners in the onDrop().
