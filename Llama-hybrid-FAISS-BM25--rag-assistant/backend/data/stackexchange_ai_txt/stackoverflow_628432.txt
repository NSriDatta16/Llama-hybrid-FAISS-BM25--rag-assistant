Take a look at BTrees . It look like you need one of them. As far as I understood you need structure that will support relatively cheap insertion of element into storage structure and cheap sorting operation (or even lack of it). BTrees offers that. I've experience with ZODB.BTrees, and they scale to thousands and millions of elements.
