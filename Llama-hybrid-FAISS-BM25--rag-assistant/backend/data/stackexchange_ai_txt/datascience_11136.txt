Logbook: Machine Learning approaches

In the past, when trying different machine learning algorithms in order to solve a problem, I used to write drown the set of approaches on a notebook, keeping details such as features, feature preprocessing, normalization, algorithms, algorithm parameters... therefore, building a hand-written logbook. However, currently I'm concerned about using a 'more professional' tool, so that I can keep more details and even share it with other team-members, who are also able to stamp their approaches. It would be great an automated and collaborative tool that keep track of the work done, considering details like: features, algorithms, algorithms parameter, data pre-process, data, metrics... beyond a collaborative Google Drive Spreadsheet for instance. How are you solving this? How are you keeping track of the work done? What's your logbook tool? Thank you very much in advance.
