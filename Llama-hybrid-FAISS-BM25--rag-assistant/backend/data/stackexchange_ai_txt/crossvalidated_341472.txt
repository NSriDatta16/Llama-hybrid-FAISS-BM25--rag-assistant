I would go for a train/validation/test sets if you have enough data. Choose your validation set as close as possible as the test set, which should be as close as possible to testing the performance of your model in a productive environment. In this case, is the main focus to predict the target for new subjects (then split 1 would be better) or mainly for existing subjects (split 2)? If the focus is for existing subjects (split 2) you could also add features with historical information (e.g. time elapsed since last target, etc.). Which would be more difficult to do for new customers as their history will be much shorter. Note: if this problem is a time series analysis, you should use cross-validation only if you have no temporal issues / you de-trended all features. If you have temporal issues, you should use a train/validation/test set.
