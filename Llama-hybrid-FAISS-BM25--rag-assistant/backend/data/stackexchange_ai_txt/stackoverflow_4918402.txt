Hold down the Control key, click and hold on the button, then drag a line over to MySecondWindow. It'll give you a little black box full of methods: choose makeKeyAndOrderFront: . What this does is it makes the button (an instance of NSButton) send the makeKeyAndOrderFront: message to the window when you click the button. The button is a subclass of NSControl which implements what is called the target/action system in Cocoa. Interface Builder, when you drag the line, sets the target of the button to be MySecondWindow, and the action to be makeKeyAndOrderFront: . NSButton is then programmed internally to send the action message to the target when it receives a click. Make sense?
