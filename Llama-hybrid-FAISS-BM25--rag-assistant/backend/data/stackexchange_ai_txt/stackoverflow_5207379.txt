Do you have the org.eclipse.runtime.compatibilty plugin in one workspace but not the other? The way you're doing this is deprecated, you should have a separate "startup" class and specify that as the class attribute of your element. From the Eclipse docs on the startup extension point : Do not specify the plug-in class as the value of the class attribute, or it will be instantiated twice (once by regular plug-in activation, and once by this mechanism). If the extension does not provide a class as an attribute on the startup element, the plug-in's activator (plug-in class) must implement org.eclipse.ui.IStartup. Note that this form is deprecated and should no longer be used. Its functioning relies on the availability of the org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in and the org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility.registry fragment.
