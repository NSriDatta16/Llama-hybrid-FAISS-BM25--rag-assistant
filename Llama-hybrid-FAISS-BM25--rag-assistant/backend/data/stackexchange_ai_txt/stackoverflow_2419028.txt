Top 3 reasons not to develop a "blog system" that generates aspx files on the fly

In this question the OP implies that he wants to base the blog system he is developing on automatic creation of .aspx files, one for each new blog entry. In my answer to his question (which is related to something else), I told him that I would discourage him from using such an approach, but without giving any real reasons. He is now wanting reasons why it is not a good idea, and I'm using this question to see if the community can come up with a compelling enough list of reasons for him to use another approach, such as one using a dbms, code-reuse, url-rewriting, MVC, and what not.
