Spying while dragging the windows title bar

Let's suppose a click on a normal WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW window's title bar, followed by a few mouse drags and a button release. Summary of messages obtained from Spy : WM_SYSCOMMAND (SC_MOVE) WM_MOUSEMOVE (*) WM_CAPTURECHANGED WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE WM_MOUSEMOVE (*) . . . WM_MOUSEMOVE (*) WM_LBUTTONUP (*) WM_CAPTURECHANGED WM_EXITSIZEMOVE WM_SYSCOMMAND (return) I'm trying to understand the messages with (*). They don't make sense to me since : 1) The mouse movements and the button release are NOT in the window client area. Therefore, instead of WM_MOUSEMOVE and WM_LBUTTONUP, I should have WM_NCMOUSEMOVE and WM_NCLBUTTONUP. 2) If I put a break, on those messages (WM_MOUSEMOVE and WM_LBUTTONUP), in my window procedure, I don't intercept theses mesages while dragging the window's title bar !!!
