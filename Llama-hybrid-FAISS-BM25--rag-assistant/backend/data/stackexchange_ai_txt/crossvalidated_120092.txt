$\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}$ You can use some kind of regression here! You have a (complicated, costly) model $y=f(x)$ that you want to approximate, where $x \in \R^d$. You can define some kind of regression model (linear or nonlinear, I will use a linear model in the discussion) to approximate $f$. To take into account interactions and maybe other nonlinear transformation of variables, define an observation vector $x^*$ which is some (known) function of $x$, which have as components the components of $x$, products of components of $x$ (interaction terms) and so on. That gives as model $y=\beta^T x^*$ for some parameter vector $\beta$ to estimate. The error in this regression model is $f(x)-\beta^T x^*$. What is different from the usual regression model is that this error function in principle is a known, deterministic function, (only to costly to calculate). So this does not make sense as a statistical model in the usual frequentist sense, since the errors will be identical on repeated application, so do not have a distribution in the frequentist sense. But we can make sense of this model in bayesian terms, so the error term can have a distribution which represents our lack of knowledge. But typically, errors for nearby points (in the space of $x$-values) will be similar, so we need a model for dependent errors. One possibility is to assume the errors form a stationary Gaussian random field. Regression under such a model is known as kriging , and heavily used in spatial statistics. Kriging outside spatial statistics is also known as gaussian process models. The use of statistical models as above to represent the output of complicated computer models, is known in some circles as metamodelling . This could be seen as a kind of bayesian modeling, the metamodel working as a kind of prior.
