How to use Floor/Ceiling in a ReportModel expression field?

I'm working in an SSRS 2005 Report Model Project . I want to create an expression field on a ReportModel that does the same as this C# method: private static int GetClosestWholeNumberToward0(double delta) { return (int) (delta > 0 ? Math.Ceiling(delta) : Math.Floor(delta)); } I tried this: IF(delta > 0, Ceiling(delta), Floor(delta)) But it seems that ReportModel expressions don't support the Ceiling or Floor functions. Is there a way to do this? Update : Due to changing requirements that added additional complexity to this report, I'm going to start over with the Report Designer in Visual Studio. So I should be able to use the Math.Ceiling() and Math.Floor() in an expression field on the report.
