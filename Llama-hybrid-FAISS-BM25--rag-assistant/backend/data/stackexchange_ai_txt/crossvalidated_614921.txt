Interpretation ARDL all variables in log

I was hoping someone could help me confirm or correct me on my interpretation of my estimated coefficients of ARDL model. All my variables are converted into natural log form, ln, both Y and Xs. My interpretation of say a coefficient on varibale Y first lag, L1, of .726 will be: a 1% change in the first lag of Y is associated with a .73% increase in Y on average. or a L2 of an X variable with coefficient -.432 will be interpreted as follows: a 1% change in the second lag of X is associated with a .43% decrease in Y on average.
