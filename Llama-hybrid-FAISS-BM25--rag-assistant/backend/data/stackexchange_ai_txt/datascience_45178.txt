MOOC importance

My problem is that at our masters program we have already been taught R, Statistics, Neural nets, Python (pandas, sklearn, etc) . Also my master thesis is directly related to Deep Learning and Computer Vision (PyTorch, Tensorflow) . Thus, i avoided entering MOOC on this topics. Now i have free time to pass all the MOOCs. But how much more important is the record about the MOOCs passed than just master program for job appliance in Data Science?
