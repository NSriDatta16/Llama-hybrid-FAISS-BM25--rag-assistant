What is a good clustering fitness metric for DBSCAN?

Usually, my go-to goodness of fit for evaluating clustering (e.g., k-means) is the average silhouette. However, for DBSCAN it doesn't work since there are lots of non-clustered points. So increasing the stringency of the parameters removes neighboring clusters, and therefore increases the difference between intra- and inter-cluster distance -- just because there are less points clustered. What is a good clustering method for DBSCAN that takes into account this issue or is robust to number of points clusters?
