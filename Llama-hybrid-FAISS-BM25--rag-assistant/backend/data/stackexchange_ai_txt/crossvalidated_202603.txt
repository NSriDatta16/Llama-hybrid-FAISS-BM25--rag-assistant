What you are looking for is the goodness-of-fit measure of a statistical model. These measures summarize between the observed values and expected values (from the model). Depending on certain conditions, you could use the AIC , Bayesian Information Criterion , etc. If you are looking for more than just goodness-of-fit measure, you could use methods involving the model mimicry. Model mimicry is a concept where one model tries to account for the data generated by the other model. The "better" fit model of the two normally accounts for its own data and to a certain extent accounts for the data generated by the competing model. (Note that, the two models should be competing models). Look at this paper where Wagenmakers et al. describe model selection by quantifying the model mimicry. This intuitive procedure can be easily coded in R. Hope it helps!
