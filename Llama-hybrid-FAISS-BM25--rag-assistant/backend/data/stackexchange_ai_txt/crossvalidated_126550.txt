Principled way of combining time series with different spans and granularity into an econometric model

I want to forecast the price of something given various time series as inputs. The problem is that they are of different frequency (annual, quarterly, monthly, daily) and time periods (the more granular ones only cover the recent past). It would be a shame to merely consider the intersection of them all and discard the rest. I'm not used to modeling time series for econometrics, but I assume these are common problems, so what are the standard solutions?
