You cannot determine which machine learning algorithm and hyperparameters are ideal until you fit models based on a combination of machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters. To find out which algorithm is optimal, you'll have to try a few beyond just the two you've listed. To do this, use a nested cross-validation approach to optimize which combination of hyperparameters to use for each machine learning technique. Split the data into training and testing sets. For each machine learning algorithm, determine potential combinations of hyperparameters by examining the specifications of each machine learning algorithm. For each combination of hyperparameters, fit models using the training data and cross-validation; and calculate the mean accuracy. Choose the model with the hyperparameter combination with the highest mean accuracy. This will be the optimal model for this machine learning algorithm. Compare the accuracy of each optimal model between the machine learning algorithms by testing them using testing sets.
