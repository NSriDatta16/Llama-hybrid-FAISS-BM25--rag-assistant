I don't know of any such feature for Hibernate. But this seem to be a very limited and manageable context. I would try to do that is the code. Various ways seem possible at first sight: If your code is well known, the complexity is manageable. Suppose you have a code A, that calls codes B and C, both of them need the query. You can run the query once in A, as pass the result to B and C . Maybe you already have a context object that you send to B and C? That would be simple, elegant, meaningfull... Suppose the opposite, that your code is a real mess, and you can't pass a context around. You could have a ThreadLocal variable that contains the result . If not set inside the current thread, call it and store it. Otherwise, just retrieve it. Note that, in the second case, you would have to take care of cleaning the ThreadLocal when going out. Between these opposites, solutions are possible, one of them is probably better than others...
