In my opinion your problem is not about that expression but about modelling. You have different clues (clouds, scared dogs) which provide evidence for a forthcoming event (rain). In other words, if I understand you, your question is actually more about: how to combine different clues?. This question is dealt with in the field of graphical models. Let me refer to the corresponding Wikipedia site , and the references therein. Specially the paper by David Heckerman ( A Tutorial on Learning With Bayesian Networks ), and the reference to Christopher Bishop's Machine Learning book. The example you give is very similar to those presented to describe the explain away effect, that is nicely described in this video .
