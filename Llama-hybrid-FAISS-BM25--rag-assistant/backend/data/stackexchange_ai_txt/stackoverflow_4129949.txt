how to stop OS X Core Data Spotlight help tags showing external record file path?

I am developing a non-document-based core data app for OS X 10.6. It is based on the template generated by XCode 3.2.4 when "Create document-based application" is not checked and "Use Core Data for Storage" and "Include Spotlight Importer" are checked. My spotlight importer sets kMDItemDisplayName to a summary of the row of the main database table. No other kMDItem attributes are set. No metadata is imported from the persistent store, only from the external record files. Everything works fine with one exception: When I hover my mouse over a Spotlight result, the yellow help tag shows the path to the external records file for the corresponding database record. That looks like gibberish to the average user, i.e. /Users/username/Library/Caches/Metadata/CoreData/appname/uuid/entity/x/y. Is there any way to stop that from happening? Ideally, I would like the help tag to refer to my application's name. I tried setting several of the other kMDItem attributes, but they don't appear to change the displayed help tag.
