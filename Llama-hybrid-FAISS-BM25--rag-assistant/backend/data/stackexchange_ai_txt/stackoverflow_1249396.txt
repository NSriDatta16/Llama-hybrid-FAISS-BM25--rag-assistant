Cocoa bindings and KVC with CGColorRef

I'm trying to bind a CGColorRef on one of my objects to the " shadowColor " property of a CALayer . Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure this out - it's probably something really simple! The CGColorRef is implemented as a property: @property (readwrite) CGColorRef labelShadowColor; My binding is straight forward too: [aLayer bind:@"shadowColor" toObject:aScreen withKeyPath:@"labelShadowColor" options:nil]; Where I'm coming unstuck is valueForUndefinedKey: - how would I implement this for a CGColorRef ? I'm currently getting the boilerplate: 2009-08-09 03:13:50.056 Hyperspaces[33161:a0f] An uncaught exception was raised 2009-08-09 03:13:50.060 Hyperspaces[33161:a0f] [ valueForUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key labelShadowColor. 2009-08-09 03:13:50.064 Hyperspaces[33161:a0f] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[ valueForUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key labelShadowColor.' I can work around this by putting an NSColor property on both ends and setting the CALayer 's " shadowColor " manually whenever the color is changed, but that seems inelegant.
