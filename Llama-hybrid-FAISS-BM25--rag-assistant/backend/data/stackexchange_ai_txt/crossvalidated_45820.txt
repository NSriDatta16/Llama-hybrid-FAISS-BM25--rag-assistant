Minimum sample size for PCA or FA when the main goal is to estimate only few components?

If I have a dataset with $n$ observations and $p$ variables (dimensions), and generally $n$ is small ($n=12-16$), and $p$ may range from small ($p = 4-10$) to perhaps much larger ($p= 30-50$). I remember learning that $n$ should be much larger than $p$ in order to run principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis (FA), but it seems like this may not be so in my data. Note that for my purposes I am rarely interested in any principal components past PC2. Questions: What are the rules of thumb for minimum sample size when PCA is OK to use, and when it is not? Is it ever OK to use the first few PCs even if $n=p$ or $n Are there any references on this? Does it matter if your main goal is to use PC1 and possibly PC2 either: simply graphically, or as synthetic variable then used in regression?
