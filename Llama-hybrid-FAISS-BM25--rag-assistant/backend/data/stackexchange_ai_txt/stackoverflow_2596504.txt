In general files that are created as part of the build process are not checked into version control. However, you very well might want to archive all or some of these files (maybe at specific milestones, and in particular if you release them outside of your dev organization) in case you need to deal with problem reports/bugs found in testing or by end users. Whether you want that archiving to occur in the same depot (or even using the same version control software) as your source artifacts is a different decision. often an archive of this sort isn't really a version control system, but might be a network share that has directories that follow a particular naming convention so the those artifacts can be matched to a particular revision of the source. How the lifetime of those items are managed (and what the lifetime should be) is another issue that needs to be determined by the needs and policies of your particular organization.
