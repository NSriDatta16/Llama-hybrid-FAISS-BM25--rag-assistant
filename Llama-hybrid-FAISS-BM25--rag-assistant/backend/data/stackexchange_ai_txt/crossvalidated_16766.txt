Simulated data For example, take this simulation in R, where I generate some data where x an y are orthogonal to one another. > x y dat table(x, y) y x 0 1 0 25 25 1 25 25 If we run a logistic regression, x would predict none of y and the p-value of the coefficient associated with X would be one. > m1 summary(m1) ...
