Hi: All of the theory behind arima time series depends on weak stationarity ( there are a few different types of stationarity and weak is the least restrictive. I tend to get confused with the names so check what I say here ) which means that the first two moments of the response, the mean and the variance, are constant. So, if you have a trending series, then, by definition, the mean of the series isn't constant which implies that all of the arima theory cannot be applied. By differencing, the hope is that the mean becomes constant and, of course, you still need the constant variance also. Note that there are some cons to differencing that other time series fields attempt to deal with. The main negative is that, even if differencing does seem to induce stationarity , it can cause a loss of information.
