This is a good question. Is a neural network essential for deep learning? Yes, your teacher provided you with a correct definition of deep learning. You can still do machine learning (a broader category) without neural networks, but you need a neural network for it to qualify as 'deep learning'. Isn't it possible to do deep learning without a neural network by using PCA? (Example: PCANet) Based on the answer to the last part, no. It by definition wouldn't be 'deep' anymore. PCANet is actually a neural network, by the way. PCA, on the other hand, isn't 'deep'. If you stack several layers of PCA on top of each other, then there is an equivalent single-layer PCA you could have done, because composing those linear transforms will just give you another linear transform.
