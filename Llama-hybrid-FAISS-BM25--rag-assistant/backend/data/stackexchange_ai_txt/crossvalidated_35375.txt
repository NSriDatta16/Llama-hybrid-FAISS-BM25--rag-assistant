I think you could fit a logistic regression model using player, ahead/behind, home/away, percentage success and number of shots taken under those conditions as possible covariates. Then difficulty with player is that you have over 200. I think that success percentage under specific conditions could serve as a substitute for player since the player and his past performance under the conditions should be highly related to the outcome. To predict for individual players you just use that player's other covariates.
