There is a class of Neural Networks designed specifically to "clean" observations from noise. They are Denoising Autoencoders : they are Autoencoders that learn to map a noisy signal with its clean counterpart. They are typically used to clean image or time series data, but they can potentially be applied to any task. I don't know much about your data and your problem specifically, so I can't say how hard it'd be to gather enough training data, but it could be worth to give it a try.
