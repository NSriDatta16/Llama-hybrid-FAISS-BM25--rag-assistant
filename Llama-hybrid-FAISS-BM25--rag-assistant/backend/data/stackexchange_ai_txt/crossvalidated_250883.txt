Is it enough to compute the estimated cost function?

I am using ls-svm lab toolbox in matlab for regression analysis. Here is the code: %% %read from file filename='datasample500.xlsx'; data=xlsread(filename); input=data(:,1:12); oilOut=data(:,13); waterOut=data(:,14); liqOut=data(:,15); %gasOut=data(:,11); %% %train model type = 'function estimation'; kernel='RBF_kernel'; fold=10; [gam,sig2,cost] = tunelssvm({input,oilOut,type,[], [],kernel},'simplex','crossvalidatelssvm',{fold,'mse'}); [alpha,b] = trainlssvm({input,oilOut,type,gam,sig2,kernel}); The function tutorial for tunelssvm states: Tune the tuning parameters of the model with respect to the given performance measure to sum up its explanation: First, for every kernel, first Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) determines suitable starting points for every method..... costfun gives an estimate of the performance of the model Possible functions for costfun are crossvalidatelssvm, leaveoneoutlssvm, rcrossvalidatelssvm and gcrossvalidatelssvm. Actually, the tunelssvm function estimates the regularization parameter gam and the squared kernel parameter sig2 . It also computes the estimation of cost function( mse in here). I want to use cross validation method to avoid overfitting problems. There is also a notification in crossvalidation function as below: CAUTION!! Use this function only to obtain the value of the crossvalidation score function given the tuning parameters. Do not use this function together with tunelssvm, but use crossvalidatelssvm instead. The latter is a faster implementation which uses previously computed results. As you see I used crossvalidatelssvm in the tunelssvm . My question is that if this estimated cost function in tunelssvm is a good representative of the exact cost function to report? is not it needed to use cross validation through the process of training model instead of in the process of parameter estimation in tunelssvm ? the tutorial for ls-svm lab is available in here .
