Importance of Categorical variables in regression

I am performing regression analyses in R and want to test several categorical variables consisting of more than ten classes. For example, University of graduation, profession, city, etc. The goal is to define income per year. By doing regression analysis, I get that some coefficients that characterize the importance of these variables (for example, profession is more important than a city of living). In addition, I need to analyze which profession is more important and graduates of which university could get a bigger income. For example, lawyers from Stanford. How can I do this? How to define the most profitable professions? Iâ€™m a newbie in Data Science and would be really grateful for any help!! Thanks in advance!
