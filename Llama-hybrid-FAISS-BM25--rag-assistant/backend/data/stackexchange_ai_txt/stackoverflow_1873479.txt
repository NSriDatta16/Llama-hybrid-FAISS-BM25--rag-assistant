This is a classification problem, but harder given the number of distinct classes you will have. One option might be to reduce the size of each document using Feature Selection ( more info ). Feature selection involves selecting the top n terms (excluding stop words , and possibly applying stemming to each word as well). Do this by calculating, for each document, the mutual information ( more info ) of each term, ordering the terms by that number and selecting the top n terms for each document. This reduced feature set of top n terms for each document can now form the basis for performing your duplicate selection (for example, if there are more than x% common terms between any documents, again x calculated through backtesting), Most of this is covered in this free book on information retrieval .
