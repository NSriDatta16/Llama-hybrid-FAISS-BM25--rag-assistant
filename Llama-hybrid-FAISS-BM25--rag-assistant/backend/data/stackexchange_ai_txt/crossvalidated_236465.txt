Sampling from mixture of *unnormalized* densities

Suppose I have $n$ unnormalized densities $g_1(\textbf{x}), \ldots, g_n (\textbf{x})$, for $\textbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and $n \gg 1$, which largely overlap but in a nontrivial way. I need to sample from the mixture: $$ f(\textbf{x}) = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i f_i(\textbf{x}) $$ where $f_i(\textbf{x}) = g_i(\textbf{x}) / \int g_i(\textbf{x}^\prime) d\textbf{x}^\prime$, and for some fixed mixture weights $w_i \ge 0$, $\sum_i w_i = 1$. Is there any sampling technique I could use, besides sampling separately (via MCMC, rejection sampling, etc.) for each $g_i$ and then combining samples according to the weights? Due to the overlap between distributions, it seems it should be possible to do something better that exploits the overlap/similarity between $g_i$'s, but the lack of normalization seems to be a major and perhaps insormountable obstacle.
