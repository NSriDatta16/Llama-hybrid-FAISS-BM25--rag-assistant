How to efficiently allow a user to sort a list with AJAX

In my application, users have a list of items that they can put in any order they like. The database schema looks like this: Items + Id : int + Name : string + Order : int so when the user puts things in order, it sets the Order field accordingly, so that I can sort it later. Great. Now, I want to make the sort ajax-y, such that the user can drag and drop items into order (and use up/down arrows), and it will just automagically save everything. (If you're familiar with Netflix, they do a similar thing.) The issue I'm having is that in order to persist the user's changes as they make them, I will need to do an AJAX call every time they do something. If the user moves an item from position 10 to position 1, that implies that I have to update 10 records in that little ajax call. Meanwhile, the user may have queued up 3 more AJAX calls to update other records. This seems inefficient and like it might be error prone (due to race conditions and so on, if the AJAX calls take a long time.) Should I be worrying about this? Is there a more efficient way to do this? If it makes a difference, I expect most users will have fewer than 5 items to sort.
