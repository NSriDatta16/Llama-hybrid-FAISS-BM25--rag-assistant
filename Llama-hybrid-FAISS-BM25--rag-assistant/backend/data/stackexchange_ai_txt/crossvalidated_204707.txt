I am not sure I understand your question completely, but I guess that, as long as you have a minimal period of exposure and a label to tell whether the patient has suffered the outcome, then you can proceed with the analysis. Note indeed that the proportional hazard assumption implies that hazard ratios are constant over time, and so the differences in exposure would not meaningfully impact on effect estimates if this assumption is true (or held true). Otherwise, you could use a dummy variable for multivariable adjustment, to highlight which patients miss their actual start date. Consider as well that your scenario is not hypothetical nor paradoxical, and is typically approached with standard analytical methods. For instance, in an observational study on heart failure, patients are followed over time since enrolment, and outcomes appraised accordingly (for instance comparing the prognostic impact of body mass index). However, time to event is not computed as time since birth (not meaningful) nor time since heart failure occurrence (often slippery to identify), but simply and pragmatically (albeit imperfect) time since enrolment.
