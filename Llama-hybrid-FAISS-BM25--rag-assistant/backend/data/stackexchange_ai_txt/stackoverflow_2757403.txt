Error using session in IIS 7

After deployment of my website to IIS, I'm getting the following error message when trying to access a session: Session state can only be used when enableSessionState is set to true, either in a configuration file or in the Page directive. Please also make sure that System.Web.SessionStateModule or a custom session state module is included in the \\ section in the application configuration. I access it in Page_Load or PreRender events (I tried both versions). With Visual Studio Dev Server it works without a problem. I tried both InProc an SessionState storage, 1 and multiple worker processes. I added a enableSessionState = "true" to my webpage explicitly. Here is part of web.config : What else do I need to do to make it work? I tried to monitor if IIS accesses the aspnet_client folder with Process Monitor and didn't get any access.
