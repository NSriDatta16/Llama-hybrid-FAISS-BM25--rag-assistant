In providing more insight on the suggestions already posted: Location Information The reference to "Deep Cast" on CodeProject makes use of Google's web service for inferring one's location from a Cell Tower ID in addition to the GPS hardware in the phone if present. It is assumed that Google has wide coverage on cell tower IDs making the method perceivably reliable. The downside of this method is that it isn't clear what Google's view is on some one making use of the service. Google's possible dispositions could include (1) against this functionality being used by other programs (2) encouraging developers to use the functionality or (3) apathy (ie not retricting use of it but not supporting use of it either). The danger of the apathy disposition is that at some point in the far future Google could change the interface to the service without warning. If you intend to make a program for commercial reasons then you will really want to get clarity on Google's disposition. The Skyhook Wireless service is extremely reliable. Apple uses Skyhook Wireless for their WiFi location in the iPhone and iPod. As of a couple of months ago Skyhook expanded upon the service so that instead of only doing WiFi based location on Windows Mobile Phones it will now use WiFi, GPS, and Cell Tower location. The downside of this service is if you plan on using it commercially you will need to consider licensing. Using this SDK from a .Net / managed application was initially a pain because of limitations in the interop abilities of the .Net Compact Framework. I managed to make a .Net wrapper and posted it to the Skyhook Wireless discussion group. Location Based Reminders A few months ago there was an MSDN article on location based reminders. For more information see the article and example code at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.wm6gps.aspx Ambient Noise Detection There was an MSDN Magazine code example from a few years ago that demonstrated how to automatically adjust your phone's volume based on the ambient noise level.
