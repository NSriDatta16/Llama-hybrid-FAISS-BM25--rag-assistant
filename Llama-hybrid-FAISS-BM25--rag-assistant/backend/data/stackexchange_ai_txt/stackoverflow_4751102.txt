I always use a single hidden layer. Theoretically, there are no functions which can be approximated by 2 or more hidden layers that cannot be approximated with one. To make a single hidden layer more complex, add more hidden nodes. Typically, the number of hidden nodes is varied to observe the effect on model performance (as measured by accuracy or whatever). Too few hidden nodes results in a worse fit due to underfitting (the neural network's output function is too simple, and misses important details in the data). Too many hidden nodes results in a worse fit due to overfitting (the neural network becomes so flexible that it chases every bit of noise in the data).
