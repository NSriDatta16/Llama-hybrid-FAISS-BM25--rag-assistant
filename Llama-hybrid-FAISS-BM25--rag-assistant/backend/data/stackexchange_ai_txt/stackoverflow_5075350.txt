Extending Visual Studio 2010 'Professional' edition with additional features available in 'Premium' edition

If not programming , this certainly is a programmer's question. Visual Studio 2010 Express and Ultimate editions are two extremes wherein the former is for hobbyists and the latter is (primarily) for Architects/Designers . The price gap between Professional and Premium editions is HUGE; however, both target developers (testers and DB guys too) primarily. In case I wish to extend my Professional edition with most of the features provided with Premium edition additionally, I look up to the Open Source world and/or other commercial alternatives. Therefore I request people to suggest good quality alternatives to the additional features in the Premium edition. I am hereby enlisting the additional features available with the Premium edition w.r.t. features available in the Professional edition: Debugging and Diagnostics - Static Code Analysis - Code Metrics - Profiling Testing Tools - Code Coverage - Test Impact Analysis - Coded UI Test Database Development - Database Deployment - Database Change Management - Database Unit Testing - Database Test Data Generation
