This is not the most elegant solution, by any means but I'm wondering if you can accomplish what you need by using a "SQLProjection"? I'm a Java guy, so the code may not be exactly right here, but the following approach looks like it works for me using Postgres: criteria.SetProjection( Projections.ProjectionList() .Add(Projections.SqlProjection("DISTINCT ON(A) ID")) .Add(Projections.Property("A")) .Add(Projections.Property("B")) ); Which generates the optimized SQL query you gave in your question. Again, this approach may not work if you're doing something highly dynamic, but it is A way of tackling the problem.
