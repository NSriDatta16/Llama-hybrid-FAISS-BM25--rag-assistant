Should one be concerned about multi-collinearity when using non-linear models?

Say we have a binary classification problem with mostly categorical features. We use some non-linear model (e.g. XGBoost or Random Forests) to learn it. Should one still be concerned about multi-collinearity? Why? If the answer to the above is true, how should one fight it considering that one is using these types of non-linear models?
