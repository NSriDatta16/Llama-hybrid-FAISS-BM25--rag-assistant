How to display four sides scrollbars on JScrollPane

I have JScrollPane that contains a panel like JScrollPane scrollWindow = new JScrollPane(window); I overrided getPreferredSize() to display the scrollBars on the right and the bottom when I drag a shape outside the screen, that's worked fine The problem is when I drag to the left or the top, no scrollbars shows. Any suggestions ?
