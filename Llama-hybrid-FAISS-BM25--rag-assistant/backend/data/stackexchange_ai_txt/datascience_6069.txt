Rearange input data - unknown size of input

I have some data of form showed below to squezze through some neural network. Customer Step Var0 ... VarN 0 0 some ... stuff 0 1 again ... stuff 0 2 foo ... bar 0 3 bla ... blub 1 0 other ... stuff 1 1 and ... ongoing 2 0 and ... so on . . . ... . . . . ... . . . . ... . As the neural network has a fixed input layer size, but the customers step count can differ at each customer, I have following question: What is the best practise (if exists) to rearange the given data for using as input of a NN?
