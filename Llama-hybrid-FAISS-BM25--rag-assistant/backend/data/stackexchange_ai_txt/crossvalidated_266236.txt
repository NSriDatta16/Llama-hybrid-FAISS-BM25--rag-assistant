What does small STDEV tell you about survey data

In measuring Customer Satisfaction using surveys, consider you have a 15 question survey questionnaire and each question could have 1 of 11 responses (0 to 10, with zero being Extremely Dissatisfied and Ten being Extremely Satisfied). With the growing condition of "Survey Fatigue" that is born of the fact that consumers or inundated with survey request, I wish to know if concerns over the quality of these data sets can be determined mathematically using STDEV. One might expect a certain amount of variance among questions that ask for customer perception responses to very fluid situations. However, we are seeing increasing low STDEV of the datasets, leading to concerns that results are being "pencil whipped" rather than thoughtfully considered with more surveys coming in all top box responses. I'm just not sure that STDEV alone can make this determination. Any help with this is appreciated. Best, Robert
