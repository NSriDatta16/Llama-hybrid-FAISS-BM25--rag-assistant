Well, my first thought while reading this was "what about the month of the year?" and the plots reinforce that, as there are 12 bands. You note that this is all at one location, and, while you don't say which location, at most places in the world there are rainy seasons and dry seasons. So, I'd add "month" to the model, and maybe change "time" to "year". The other idea I had was to use time series methods that allow you to disaggregate a time series into trend, cyclical, and random components. There is an R package tempdisagg and I think there are other packages that do this, as well. tempdisagg has a vignette and an article associated with it (see the package documentation).
