Using the Hat Matrix to detect influential observations in logistic regression

I'm currently running residual diagnostics for a logistic regression model, aiming to identify possible influential record could influence the parameters estimate. I wonder about if it is possible to detect such record on the base of the diagonal hat matrix (Pregibon, 1981) and estimate beta parameters by deleting influential record in the hope to get better model performance in terms of accuracy (e.g. concordance statistic, AUROC). By running a logistic regression model with SAS PROC LOGISTIC option INFLUENCE, I should get the diagonal value of the Hat Matrix (is it correct?), underlined in the image attached below: Now, according to Pregibon , the hat matrix diagonal should help to identify influential points; from the SAS PROC LOGISTIC documentation I cannot understand what I can do with such values. Could you provide a brief description of what one can do with such values and what they are? Alternatively, could you suggest a rule of thumb to detect influential points given the table reported in the image? Thanks in advance for your help!
