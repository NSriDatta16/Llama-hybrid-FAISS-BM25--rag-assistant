You need to learn CSS, not fight it. CSS has been used to create much more complex layouts than what you have described. And it is the only way you should be styling your web pages and implementing a layout design. CSS gives you much more control over the presentation of a webpage and positioning of elements than frames can (frames only give you frames to put load multiple pages in; you still need to style those pages separately). This is a rather broad question, so I'll just say this: Use HTML to semantically organize/structure your content. Use CSS for your presentation. In other words, don't use any of the following tags or similar tags: (use instead) (use instead) Remember to use structuring tags where appropriate like: up to And use semantically correct tags. So if you have a definition list, use , and . If you have a form, use , e.g.: First Name: Don't use tables for layouts. Use them only for tabular data. And when you do, make sure you use proper semantic markup , , , etc. Put title attributes in your links and alt attributes in your images for accessibility and usability. And use stylesheets (preferably external ones for DRY) instead of inline styles. Lastly, as Jan_V mentioned, w3schools.com is a great resource for CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and most web standards. There is a lot for you to learn, but luckily there's a ton of tutorials, references, and other resources on the web to help you along. Learn how to properly use CSS/HTML, and you will produce higher quality webpages as well as save time in maintenance. If you're struggling with the layout you have in mind, start with something simpler and work your way up. E.g. try an evenly drawn 2 column, 2 row layout first. Once you get that working, start changing the proportions and adding more columns/rows.
