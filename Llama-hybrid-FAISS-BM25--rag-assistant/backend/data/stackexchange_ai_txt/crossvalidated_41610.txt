'N' or number of samples is usually the number of cases, this can be the number of subject (assuming you have one measurement of each feature per subject) or the number of measurements per feature. If you have multiple measurements per feature, per subject you will need to account for this. Generally, EEG channels should be considered separately, as different activity patterns can be observed in different locations, i.e. occipital alpha activity may have different characteristics to frontal alpha for a given subject. For this reason I would recommend calculating each feature separately for each channel. IF it is justifiable for the application you can average each feature across all channels for each subject. One solution could be to take the mean value of each feature across all four trials, calculated for each of the 3 channels (electrodes) giving 9 features for each subject. You can use hypothesis testing such as a t-test or rank-sum test to examine how well each feature distinguishes between the two classes. However, if you are performing classification, feature selection should be performed within each fold of cross-validation.
