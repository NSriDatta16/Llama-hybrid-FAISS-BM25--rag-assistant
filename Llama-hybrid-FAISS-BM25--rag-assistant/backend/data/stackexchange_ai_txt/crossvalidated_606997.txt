ARIMA D coefficient for seasonality lesser than frequency

Lets suppose we have a time series with monthly data (frequency=12) my_tS When I plot it, I can see a seasonality every 6 months. So, to remove it, I should compute a differencing every 6 months: my_tS_stationary I check it with KPSS and its stationary. Now, I want to model it with ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[12]. Which value should I use for D? A value of 1 is for 12 months seasolnality (the frequency of my TS), but mine is every 6 months... Edit: As requested, I Add the images od the graphs I made to check seasonality EDIT AGAIN: Added season plot... Data are flights through year. Now, with season plot, I think it has a 12 months seasonality with two peaks in the year. Thanks, Stephan and Richard, for guiding me to find this!
