The simplest way to send an email to multiple recipients without each of them seeing the list is to use BCC (blind carbon copy) : message.addRecipients(Message.RecipientType.BCC, address); When each recipient gets their message, they only see their own address. You still need to set a TO, but you can use a single fixed dummy address for that. I'm not sure what you're asking about the sent date, though. The sent time on an email is the time (and timezone) it was sent by the sending agent, and it's up to the recipients's email software to render that in the correct local timezone. Or do you mean you want to fake the sent time for each recipient?
