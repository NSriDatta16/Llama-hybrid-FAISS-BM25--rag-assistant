You always had time tracking with mylyn tasks (this is why it is called "Task Timing"). Since Mylyn3.3, you can even: Time tracking can now be turned off independently of focusing. Time tracking has always been optional and private since it required task activation and stored all tracking information in the workspace. But it was not previously possible to use focusing without active time being captured. Note that the preference is off by default, since Mylyn makes all activity tracking and automation opt-in. zvikico mentions in the comments the webminar " Code at the Speed of Thought with Task-focused Programming " on that topic: Watch Webminar , and see presentation slides , from: Mik Kersten , creator and lead of the Eclipse Mylyn project and CEO of Tasktop Technologies, and Roy Ganor , Zend Studio and PDT Project Lead. alt text http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/121/mylyntasktiming.png
