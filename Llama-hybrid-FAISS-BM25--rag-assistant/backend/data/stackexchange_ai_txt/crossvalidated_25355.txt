Multi-value categorical attributes in R

I have a training data set with both numerical and categorical variables, and one class variable. I want to build a classification model (e.g.,SVM), and for this goal I need to transform all variables into convenient format. I m confused about my categorical variables. Let me give you an example about one of them. The categorical variable in each observation represents a Google search query (usually 3-10 comma-separated words, see example below). ----------+----------------------------+-------------------+---------------- search_id | query_words (categorical) |..(other variables)| class variable ----------+----------------------------+-------------------+---------------- 1 | how,to,grow,tree |.. | 4 2 | smartfone,htc,buy,price |.. | 7 3 | buy,house,realty,london |.. | 6 4 | where,to,go,weekend,cinema |.. | 4 ... | ... |.. | ... ----------+----------------------------+-------------------+---------------- The words in this categorical variable are disordered and the same words may occur in different observations (that's logical). Number of unique words for all observations = few thousands. Number of observations: ~150.000.000 Since this categorical variable (query_words) is very important for my classification analysis, I need to train my model with it. My question is how to represent it to use for e.g., SVM. In each observation I can sort words alphabetically to order them. If I will use a numeric vector with few thousands elements (one per each unique word) I can represent this variable for each observation as e.g.: query_words[1] = (0,0,..1,..0,..1,..1,..0,...1,..0) # very big vector But I don't believe it will work effectively. How should I handle this categorical variable. I m using R for analysis.
