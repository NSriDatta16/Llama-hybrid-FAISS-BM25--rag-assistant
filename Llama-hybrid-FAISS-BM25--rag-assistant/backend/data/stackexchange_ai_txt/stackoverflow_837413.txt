I had a similar problem once and got round it by building all the queries as strings and executing them using the Exec() call. That way the queries (selects, inserts or whatever) don't get parsed till they are executed. It wasn't pretty or elegant though. e.g exec('INSERT INTO TABLE1(COLUMN_THAT_NO_LONGER_EXISTS,COLUMN_B,COLUMN_C) SELECT 1,2,3 FROM TABLE2')
