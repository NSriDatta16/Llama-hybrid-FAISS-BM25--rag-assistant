I have to unask many of your questions. Did you know that Windows uses UTF-16 for its APIs, but still defaults to the various "fun" legacy encodings (e.g. Windows-1252, Windows-1251) in userspace, including file names, differently for the many localisations of Windows? you need to encode output, and picking the appropriate encoding for the system is achieved by the locale pragma , and that there is the a POSIX standard called locale on which this is built, and Windows is incompatible with it? Perl already supported the so-called "wide" APIs once? Microsoft managed to adapt UTF-8 into their codepage system of character encoding, and you can switch your terminal by issuing the appropriate chcp 65001 command?
