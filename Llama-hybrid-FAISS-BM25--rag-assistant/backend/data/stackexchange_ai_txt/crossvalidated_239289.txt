First of - Yes, an extended Cox model can handle time dependent covariates (and coefficients) with ease, and with no change to the underlying model. Mind you that the data set needs to reflect this time dependency. For example: subject time1 time2 event var1 var2 1 0 15 0 25 1.3 1 15 46 0 25 1.5 1 46 73 0 25 1.4 1 73 100 1 25 1.6 var2 is a time dependent covariate. coxph(Surv(time1, time2, event) ~ var1 + var2, data = data) coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p var1 -1.072 0.342 0.262 -3.44 0.00058 var2 -0.0574 0.944 0.022 -2.61 0.009 So in this made up example, var2 can be said that holding var1 constant each additional unit of var2 reduces the weekly hazard ratio by 5.6% on average. The interpretation seems similar to non-time varying covariates, yet there is an underlying difference - that is that the time is taken into account. In a dummy variable that is time dependent it is simpler to understand - The time while the variable is not existent (0) is taken into account when calculating the effect on the hazard ratio. You can see Using Time Dependent Covariates and Time Dependent Coefficients in the Cox Model by Therneau (creator of the survival package) for further explanations.
