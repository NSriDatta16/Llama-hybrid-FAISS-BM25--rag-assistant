The output ("E") behaves exactly as one would expect it to behave. The reason: The dynamic (i.e. runtime) type of that reference is E. You are doing a static upcast to D, but that does not change the actual type of the object of course. That's the very idea behind virtual methods and dynamic dispatches: You see the behavior of the type you were instantiating, which is E, in this case.
