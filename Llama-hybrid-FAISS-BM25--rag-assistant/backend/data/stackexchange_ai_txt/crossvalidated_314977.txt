There seem to be two main approaches for decision making in Bayesian A/B testing. The first one is based on a paper by John Kruschke from Indiana University (K. Kruschke, Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t Test, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 142, 573 (2013)). The decision rule used in this paper is based on the concept of Region Of Practical Equivalence (ROPE). Another possibility is to use the concept of an Expected Loss. It has been proposed by Chris Stucchio (C. Stucchio, Bayesian A/B Testing at VWO). It is another approach that I would consider. The approach suggested by Cam.Davidson.Pilon of looking at the posterior distribution of $(p_A - p_B) / p_A$ makes a lot of sense and would fit well within the ROPE method. Using the ROPE method has the added advantage of giving also a rule for when the experiment is inconclusive (not just when the "A" or "B" variants can be declared winners). You can find more in this blog post: Bayesian A/B Testing: a step-by-step guide . It also includes some Python code snippets that are mostly based on a Python project hosted on Github .
