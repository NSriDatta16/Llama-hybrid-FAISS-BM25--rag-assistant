The safest way to manage this issue is Method 4 - create an indicator variable for answered/did_not_answer. The advantage of Method 4 is that you retain all the information from your survey respondents. Marking N/A may be qualitatively different from filling out a score from 1 to 5. By treating N/A as an indicator variable, you give yourself the ability use it as a predictor variable without making risky assumptions or imputations beforehand (or, worse, analysing the data and making post hoc 'predictions' about what N/A means). Related to the above paragraph, Methods 1, 2, and 5 decrease the informational value in your data. Method 3 would be better for the same information-preserving reasons that Method 4 makes sense, but the results will be harder to interpret, and you will lose the informational value that the 1-5 values are ordinal . So, as an example with some Stata pseudo-code, let's say you have a rating scale from 1 to 5, where 'Not applicable' is coded as 6. Then: gen ratingapplicable =. replace ratingapplicable = 1 if rating != 6 replace ratingapplicable = 0 if rating == 6 label define ratingapplicablelab 1 "Rating applicable" 0 "Rating not applicable" label values ratingapplicable ratingapplicablelab // Then, you can regress some new variable (let's say it's 'bonus') // on rating and ratingapplicable regress bonus rating ratingapplicable // Note that you'll get a coefficient for rating, let's say it's 3045. replace rating = 600 if rating ==6 regress bonus rating ratingapplicable // Note that the coefficient for rating will still be 3045. Hoorah! // Note that you'll still *also* have a coefficient for ratingapplicable, // which represents the effect (on bonus) of the rating being applicable at all. Edit: Method 3 may make a lot of sense if you're not sure that you should treat the scores as ordinal. This would be equivalent in Stata to using i.rating as a covariate, which will treat rating as a factor variable with no specific ordering between Very happy, Happy, Neither happy nor unhappy, Unhappy, Very unhappy, and N/A.
