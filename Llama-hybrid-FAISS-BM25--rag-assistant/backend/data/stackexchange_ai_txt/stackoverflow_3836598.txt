I agree with Kragen - your code may look "big" because of all the checks, but you are really writing exactly what the program needs to do in order to validate these things, so any sort of clever approach that reduces the number of lines of code you write isn't actually going to speed things up that much. Question though: do you have to validate the textbox on the server? If you are only validating that the textbox isn't empty, I'd suggest using client side validation. That will save you server time and bandwidth, since your user won't be allowed to submit the form to your server until their browser has validated that they aren't empty. You'd still want to validate on the server side (in case they don't have JavaScript enabled on their browser or they are attempting some kind of malicious behaviour). The native ASP.NET way of client side validation involves adding an ASP.NET validation tag to your ASPX. It's actually quite easy. Here's an example on MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479013.aspx#aspnet-validateaspnetservercontrols_topic3 I've simplified their code a bit to match your requirements:
