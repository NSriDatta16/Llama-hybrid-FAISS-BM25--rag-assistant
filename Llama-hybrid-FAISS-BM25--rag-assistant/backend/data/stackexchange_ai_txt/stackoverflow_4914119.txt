Here are some things I noticed. Not sure if it will solve the problem, but you need to fix some of these; some of them are just observations. dj_amount is not declared nor referenced; my guess is you mean documents.events.dj_amount You should put a ; at the end of every statement in javascript, including the end of var txt = document.getElementById("error") You don't need to escape the string in the txt.innerHTML line; you only need to escape like quotes, such as "\"" or '\'' , not "'" or '"' You don't need the window.document referenced; document will do in almost all cases EDIT - As Guffa points out, FONT is an old and deprecated element in HTML. It's not the cause of your problems, but modern markup methods mean you don't need it. Consider omitting and applying the style to the paragraph tag instead. See edits below. function submit_events() { //Check to see if a number is entered if the corosponding textbox is checked if (document.events.dj_card.checked == true && document.events.dj_amount.value == "") { //Error Control Method //alert ('You didn't enetr an Amount for DJ\'s Card!'); var txt = document.getElementById("error"); txt.innerHTML = " You didn't enter an Amount for DJ's Card! "; document.getElementById("dj_card_label").style.color = '#FF0000'; //Reset document.getElementById("company_amount_label").style.color = '#000000'; document.getElementById("own_amount_label").style.color = '#000000'; } else { document.events.submit(); } } Consider Firebug so that you can see and log to console javascript errors and messages: http://getfirebug.com
