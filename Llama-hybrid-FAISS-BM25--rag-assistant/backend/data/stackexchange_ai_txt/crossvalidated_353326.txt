In my field we use a lot of machine learning techniques to do exactly this! When animals are equipped with accelerometers, we'd try to automatically assign the data to behaviours or activity types. Perhaps you could use some of the same techniques in your case? Here are two examples I was able to find that are open access, so you should be able to read the papers wherever you are. https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40462-014-0027-0 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088609 Good luck!!
