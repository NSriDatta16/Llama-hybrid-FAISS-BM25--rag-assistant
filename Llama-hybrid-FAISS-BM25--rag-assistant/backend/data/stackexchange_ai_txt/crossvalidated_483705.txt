Calculating standard deviation without original measurements

Assume I have the monthly data for the price of items like this: num_items = [10, 22, 13, 4, 15] avg_cost = [200, 103, 143, 412, 123] Now, I do not have the original list of item-wise cost table. From this, I know we can get the overall average, but Is it possible to calculate the overall standard deviation? Assume I can also add Standard deviation and variance per month, how would I go about calculating the overall std?
