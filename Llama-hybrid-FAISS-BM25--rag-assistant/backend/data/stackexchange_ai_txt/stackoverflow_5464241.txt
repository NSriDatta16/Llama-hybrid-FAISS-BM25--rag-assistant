What does getExternalStorageDirectory() return on the XOOM? Literally, it returns /mnt/sdcard . However, this points to some on-board storage, much like many other Android devices do. My guess is that they chose /mnt/sdcard for greater compatibility with developers who hardwired that value into their apps. Will this change when the SD card is enabled? You are better asking off that question on the MOTODEV discussion boards .
