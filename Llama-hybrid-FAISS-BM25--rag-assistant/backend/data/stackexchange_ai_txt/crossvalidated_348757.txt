What is the precise definition of unsupervised learning?

Let's look at a special case: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). (For those who don't know what a GAN is: for this purpose they are two neural networks that are trained using user generated labels, that distinguish "fake" (generated) data and "real" (observed) data.) I would argue that GANs are unsupervised (not CatGAN, or GANs that do classifications, obviously). Wikipedia defines unsupervised learning (without any sources) as Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from "unlabeled" data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations). Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output by the relevant algorithm [...] However, MATLAB seem to have a different definition ( on their home page ): Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. A GAN uses labeled response, and also there is an evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output. So my question is: what is the most precise (or actual) definition of unsupervised learning?
