From analysing their previos transactions how can I predict for what type of product is the customer more likely to take take an EMI

So basically I need a kind of product/ category affinity for EMI for all customers eg - Customer A is more likely to take an EMI on her insurance premium. One approach I had thought was to broadly categorize the the transactions into 3-4 categories and predict the amount( linear regression) that a customer is going to spend on each of the category in that particular month.eg It is estimated that customer A will spend huge amount on category 1 in month of September, then this customer A will be targetted for a marketing campaign for taking EMI for products in category 1 in September Another approach I had thought was to do a multi class logistic regression to classify each customer into 3-4 category and marketing can target customers for EMI of specific products Or I could do clustering and check the conversion for EMI of different types of categories in each cluster Please let me know if I'm going in the right direction or if there is any other approach I could take or any algorithm I can use. Thank-you
