askswOrder is correct that the Eclipse plugin has not seen much attention for quite a long time. The JIRA you reference does provide a fix, but it's only been applied to Hadoop 20.3 and above. One option would be to try to apply the patch to 20.2 and recompile, but that's asking quite a lot from a newbie. I'd second the suggestion to use Karmasphere; it's a great product for working with MapReduce and those gents have taken on the work of staying current with Hadoop releases.
