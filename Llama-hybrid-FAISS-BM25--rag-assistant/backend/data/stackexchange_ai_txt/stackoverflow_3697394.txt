Most databases support some sort of TIMESTAMP data type plus assciated DAY(), MONTH(), DAYOFWEEK() functions. The only valid reason for separate DAY or HOUR columns in a separate table is if you have procomputed totals and averages for each timeslot. Even then its only worth it if you expect a lot of filtering based on these values, as the cost of building these tables is high, and, for most queries the standard SQL "GROUP BY ... HAVING .. " will perform well enough. It sounds like you may be interested in a "STAR SCHEMA" wikipedia a common method in data warehosing to speed up queries -- but be warned designing and building a Star Schem is not a trivial exercise.
