Is there any difference between classifying images by their type and by the objects they represent?

Let us suppose that I would like to train a machine learning model for classifying images according to their types (for example, photographs and drawings). The techniques that I can use for this would be different from the techniques used for classifying images in the classes of the objects represented in them (dogs, cats, birds, etc)? Or both tasks are so similar that I can use the same techniques in both?
