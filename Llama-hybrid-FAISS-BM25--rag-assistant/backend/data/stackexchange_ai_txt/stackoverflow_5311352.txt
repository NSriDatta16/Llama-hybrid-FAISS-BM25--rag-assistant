Hi Build and run will only use saved files to guild and display your programe. However IB (the program in which you drag and connect your label) is/was separate from XCode and it gets confused about what is and what isn't saved already. -make sure to save your interface in IB before you run -make sure that your label has text in it -make sure you are editing the write file (close IB and open your .xib file again) do not worry, everybody was there at some point
