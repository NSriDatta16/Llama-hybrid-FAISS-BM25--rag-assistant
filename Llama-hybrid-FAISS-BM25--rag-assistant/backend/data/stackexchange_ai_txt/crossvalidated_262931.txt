I would recommend ordered logistic regression if your dependent variable is measured on ordered scale (-5 to +5). But to keep things simple from the beginning I would just switch to binary dependent variable (happy/unhappy) and use ordinary logistic regression. From the experiment point of view, it seems to me the best is to prepare a plan for what you will eat in the next months day by day and to follow the plan. This way it should be ensured that you don't just pick up food according to how you feel (inverse causality)
