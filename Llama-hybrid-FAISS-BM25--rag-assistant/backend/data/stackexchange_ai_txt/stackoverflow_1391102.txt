For clarification I'm posting this link as the answer: http://www.dotnetopenauth.net/developers/code-snippets/the-axfetchassregtransform-behavior/ This link provides configuration file settings for AXFetchAsSregTransform behavior in a small configuration example (as mentioned by Andrew) which allows using ClaimsRequest() to get both SREG and AX information. This allows retrieval of some (but not all) request information. For Google it works with email address retrieval at least. To make a request: var req = openid.CreateRequest(Request.Form["openid_identifier"]); var fields = new ClaimsRequest(); fields.Email = DemandLevel.Require; fields.FullName = DemandLevel.Require; req.AddExtension(fields); return req.RedirectingResponse.AsActionResult(); to receive the response: var claim = response.GetExtension (); string email = null, fullname= null, password = null; if (claim != null) { email = claim.Email; fullname = claim.FullName; } Note that Google only seems to pick up the email address and it needs DemandLevel.Require, otherwise nothing gets returned.
