First, making an reproducible example would be helpful to answer the question. With this level of details, it is very hard to tell what happened on specific data. Second, I would suggest reviewing bias variance trade-off concept in machine learning. Here is a good resource . It is perfectly OK that logistic regression out perform regularized logistic regression. Regularization will make a "simpler" model. If un-regularized logistic regression is better than regularized version, it be indicative that the data is complex, using logistic regression may not be sufficiently to capture the pattern of the data, and if we add on regularization, it may be worse.
