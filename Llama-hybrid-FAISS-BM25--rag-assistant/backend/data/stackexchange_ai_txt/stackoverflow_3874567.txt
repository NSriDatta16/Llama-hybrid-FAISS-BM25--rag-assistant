I'd generally argue apps should never care if they are running as the root or in a sub-uri. I'd also say that, in 2010, with IIS Express coming, it makes no sense investing any time nor heartache in fighting cassini. That should support your requirements much better. EDIT FOR MORE DETAILS Interesting updates about IIS express. We do some of the same things for our design types -- we'd rather they implement the designs rather than the programmers lose hours of their life pursuing individual pixels. We found it easiest to basically treat the designers' machines as essentially continuous integration build agent. They run IIS and build using the same command line build script the CI boxes do. Works surprisingly well. In both cases you have a machine that can't care for itself, so everything needs to be scripted. The IIS bit gets setup once generally as we keep it pretty simple and it rarely needs tweakage with modern versions of .NET. Hope this helps.
