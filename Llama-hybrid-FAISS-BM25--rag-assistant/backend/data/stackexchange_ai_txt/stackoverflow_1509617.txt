Objective-C: elegant solution to conditional creation of objects?

This is an Objective-C/iphone SDK question. I have a dashboard view that is used to switch to different views in my application. Essentially the view has six buttons that shortcut to a different view. Here is an example of the button event handling code: - (IBAction)moreButtonPressed:(id)sender{ // switch view here if(self._moreViewController == nil){ MoreViewController *moreViewController = [[MoreViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MoreView" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; self._moreViewController = moreViewController; [moreViewController release]; } [self SwitchView:self._moreViewController]; } I can duplicate this code for each button and change the appropriate classes (view controller classes)), but I would love a more elegant solution. Does anyone have any idea of how to do this?
