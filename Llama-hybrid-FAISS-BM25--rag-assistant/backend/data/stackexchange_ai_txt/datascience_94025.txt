Tree complexity and gamma parameter in xgboost

According to xgboost paper, regularization is given by: $$\Omega(f) = \gamma T + \lambda || w||^2$$ where $\gamma$ is the complexity of a tree (i.e., number of leaves in the tree). The parameter gamma in xgboost library, on the other hand, controls the minimum split at a node in order to proceed. Hence, is the $\gamma$ in the equation above used by xgboost software package? I could not find any reference to it.
