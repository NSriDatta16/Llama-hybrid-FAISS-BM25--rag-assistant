IPHONE (in-app purchase): What do I have to do to get the prices in local currency

I am creating an application with 3 different languages: english, spanish and french. I have created in-app purchases in these 3 languages and have created users on itunes sandbox for these 3 stores: France, USA and Spain. Before the user can click on the BUY button, even before the user logs in with his itunes username and password, I have to retrieve the prices of each product. This retrieval is done at the beginning of the application using this lines: SKProductsRequest *request= [[SKProductsRequest alloc] initWithProductIdentifiers:IDobjects]; request.delegate = self; [request start]; In theory, this code should retrieve, among other things, the price of all objects in the local currency. By local currency I mean based on the language the user has its iPhone adjusted but in practice this code always retrieve the price in dollars? What am I missing? Another point is this: if the user is not logged in on iTunes, he/she will always see the message in English and the prices in dollars. After logging in, he will see the name of the in-app object in his language and the price in his currency, but the rest of the window will be in english. See next image: thanks for any help. Caixa is the object's name in spanish, 0,79â‚¬ is the correct price in local currency but the remainder of the window is in english!? This window should be totally in the user's language!!!!!
