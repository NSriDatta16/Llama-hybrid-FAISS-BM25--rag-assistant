It makes perfect sense, and setInterval wouldn't bog down the browser, as long as you make sure not to register it once more when it's already registered. You only want to run clearInterval on the click of one specific button ("no, don't poll the browser", or "log out"), so i don't quite see the problem in your last paragraph...? Other than that, I'll just add that upon 401, you shouldn't refresh to login screen. Just notify the user that the session seems to have been lost, so that the user can decide on his own to save anything he might be working with, or perhaps to log in again in a new tab.
