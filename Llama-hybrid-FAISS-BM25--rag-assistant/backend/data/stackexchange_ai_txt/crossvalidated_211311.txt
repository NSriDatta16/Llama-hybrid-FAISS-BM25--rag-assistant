Everybody has its moment on moments. I had mine in Cumulant and moment names beyond variance, skewness and kurtosis , and spent some time reading this gorgious thread. Oddly, I did not find the "moment mention" in " H. A. David's paper. So I went to Karl Pearson: The Scientific Life in a Statistical Age , a book by T. M. Porter. and Karl Pearson and the Origins of Modern Statistics: An Elastician becomes a Statistician . He for instance edited A History of the Theory of Elasticity and of the Strength of Materials from Galilei to the Present Time . His background was very wide, and he was notably a professor of engineering and elastician, who was involved in determining the bending moments of a bridge span and calculating stresses on masonry dams. In elasticity, one only observe what is is going on (rupture) in a limited manner. He seemingly was interested in (from Porter's book): graphical calculation or, in its most dignified and mathematical form, graphical statics. Later : From the beginning of his statistical career, and even before that, he fit curves using the "method of moments." In mechanics, this meant matching a complicated body to a simple or abstract one that had the same center of mass and "swing radius," respectively the first and second moments. These quantities corresponded in statistics to the mean and the spread or dispersion of measurements around the mean. And since: Pearson dealt in discrete measurement intervals, this was a sum rather than an integral Inertial moments can stand for a summary of a moving body: computations can be carried out as if the body was reduced to a single point. Pearson set up these five equalities as a system of equations, which combined into one of the ninth degree. A numerical solution was only possible by successive approximations. There could have been as many as nine real solutions, though in the present instance there were only two. He graphed both results alongside the original, and was generally pleased with the appearance of the result. He did not, however, rely on visual inspection to decide between them, but calculated the sixth moment to decide the best match Let us go back to physics. A moment is a physical quantity that takes into account the local arrangement of a physical property, generally with respect to a certain ordinal point or axis (classically in space or time). It summarizes physical quantities as measured at some distance from a reference. If the quantity is not concentrated at a single point, the moment is "averaged" over the whole space, by means of integrals or sums. Apparently, the concept of moments can be traced back to the discovery of the operating principle of the lever "discovered" by Archimedes. One of the first known occurrence is the Latin word "momentorum" with the present accepted sense (moment about a center of rotation). In 1565, Federico Commandino translated Archimedes' work (Liber de Centro Gravitatis Solidorum) as: The center of gravity of each solid figure is that point within it, about which on all sides parts of equal moment stand. or Centrum gravitatis uniuscuiusque solidae figurae est punctum illud intra positum, circa quod undique partes aequalium momentorum So apparently, the analogy with physics is quite strong: from a complicated discrete physical shape, find quantities that approximate it sufficiently, a form of compression or parsimony.
