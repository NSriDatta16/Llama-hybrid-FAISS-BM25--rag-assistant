In the following github repo, we provide Python software that assigns random probabilities to the nodes of the Napkin Bayesian Network. The software then does the marginalizations necessary to calculate P(y|x) and the right hand side of the Adjustment Formula given by Cinelli above. We find that they are always equal, no matter what the random probabilities are. Hence, Cinelli's Adjustment Formula reduces to P(y|do(x))=P(y|x) https://github.com/rrtucci/napkin-do-calc
