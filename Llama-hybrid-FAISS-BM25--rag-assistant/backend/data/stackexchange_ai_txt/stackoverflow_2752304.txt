From the MFC CEdit::GetLine documentation : Remarks: The copied line does not contain a null-termination character. So you need to pay attention to GetLine 's return value to determine how many bytes were copied into the buffer and then add your own NUL-terminator. Also, I would recommend that you pass in the buffer size to make sure you don't have a potential buffer overflow.
