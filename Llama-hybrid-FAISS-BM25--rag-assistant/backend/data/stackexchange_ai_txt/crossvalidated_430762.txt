Should I use traditional machine learning or time series?

I have a debate with my supervisor on whether to use a traditional machine learning model or time-series/Markov chain to solve this problem. We have a set of feature that arranged according to time: Day 1: A, Day 2: B, Day 3: B, Day4: A…Day 60: A A and B are features on the same scale, let’s say they are the weather on each day. Now we want to predict Y using features collected in 60 days. Y is whether you will play tennis. My way of doing it is to see the feature of 60 days as a vector and use it in SVM or Bayesian (classic ML example in the lecture). However, my supervisor wants me to use a Markov chain or time series? I’m very confused; Y is not a state. My understanding of Markov chain is you use the previous sequence to predict the next state, here it should be the weather on day 61. Am I correct?
