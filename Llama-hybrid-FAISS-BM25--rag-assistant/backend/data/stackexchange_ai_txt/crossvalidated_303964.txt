Is it possible you haven't chosen the correct transformation when you were testing them? I would suggest performing a Box-Cox test test on the data to see what the algorithm recommends (if you haven't already). The 'caret' package has a useful function called preProcess() which let's you run the Box-Cox, then fit it to your data using predict(). On a side note, when you perform a Breuschâ€“Pagan test, what p-value are you getting (is it borderline?).
