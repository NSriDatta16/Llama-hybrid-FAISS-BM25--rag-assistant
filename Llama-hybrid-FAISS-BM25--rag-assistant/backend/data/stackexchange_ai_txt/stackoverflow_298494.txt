How to bulk-amend the job step command in ALL sql server agent jobs

I have many jobs that have a step to send 1 specific email out to a list of people. That list of reciepients is hardcoded in the step command and I need to remove one person from that list, in all jobs. How do I loop through ALL the jobs in the Sql Server Agent and modify the command text to find+replace a specific piece of text. I am using sql server 2005 and have already looked at sp_update_jobStep but doesn't appear to be exactly what i want. Cheers.
