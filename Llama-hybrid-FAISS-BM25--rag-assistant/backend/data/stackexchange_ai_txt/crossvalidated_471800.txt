PCA for non-stationary time series

I would like to use principal component analysis (PCA) to identify common components/factors of some time series. However, the data is not stationary, so I took the first difference to make sure the data is stationary. Then I did the PCA on the first difference: prcomp(data, scale. = TRUE, center = TRUE) But actually I'm not interested in the common components of the first difference but of the actual data. Can I use this information from the first difference to find out more about common components of the data? Or is there another way to make the data stationary? The aim is to implement something similar to https://static.norges-bank.no/contentassets/78c009376c6548e799c27b94c036d480/working_paper_5_17.pdf on page 17f. Thank you in advance.
