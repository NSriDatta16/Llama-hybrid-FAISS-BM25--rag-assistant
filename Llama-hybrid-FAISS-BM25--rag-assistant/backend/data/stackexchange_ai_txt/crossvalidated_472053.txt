I'm interested in why you think your proposed approach is costly? Surely, the business would not be surprised that customers game the system. To me, this sounds like the only way to solve the problem (barring cases where you might have prior information). I don't think a classifier is the right approach here. You would probably want risk estimates (i.e. probabilities) rather than 0/1 predictions. That way you can at least check that your model is well calibrated. Given that you have a well defined population from which you can sample from, I also think that you should avoid purposefully balancing the classes. If the risk of returning the product is low, then your model should learn that rather than erroneously learn that the risk for the average customer is something like 50% just because you chose to balance classes.
