How to interpret Realized Volatility and TSRV using R

I am looking at some high frequency data and I would like to know how to interpret and compare Realized volatility (RV) and Two Scale Realized Volatility (TSRV). References below. Given X is the log return of a stock $$ [X,X]_{T}^{all} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} (X_{t_{i+1}} - X_{t_{i}})^2 $$ Here subscript all means use all the data. In my case my data is second by second so it would be the sum of the differences of squared log returns 1 second apart. To compute RV in R I have a function that takes prices, takes there log, then differences, squares them and sums them up: RV the Two Scale Realized Volatility (TSRV) partitons the whole sample 1 to n in to K subsamples. In my case K= 300. So there will be a moving window time301-time1, time302 -time 2...and the RV for those windows will be averaged over. $$[X,X]_{T}^{K} = \dfrac 1K\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-K+1} (X_{t_{i+K}} - X_{t_{i}})^2 $$ THEN $$ TSRV = (1- \dfrac zn)^{-1} [X,X]_{T}^{K} - \dfrac zn [X,X]_{T}^{all}$$ where z = (n-K+1)/K. Taking the difference between $$[X,X]_{T}^{K}$$ and $$[X,X]_{T}^{all}$$ cancels the effect of microstructure noise. The factor (1-z/n)^-1 is a coefficient to adjust for finite sample bias. In R there is a function to calculate TSRV: myTSRV I took tick data for IBM for about 2 hours and calculated the RV and and TSRV with K= 300 seconds and J= 1 second for about 2 hours. I have a few questions. The RV is in the range of .00002 to .00005. How do I interpret this? In the literature RV is also called integrated variance. I want the volatility so do I need to square root these number to get to .0044 to .007? Even if I square root them what does .0044 or .007 mean? The volatility for IBm during those 2 hours was .44% to .7%? Does .0044 and .007 need to be normalized to an annual or daily number somehow? Can you suggest how? How does one compare the RV or TSRV from different length intervals. Let's say I have an RV that is calculated using 2 hours of data. How do I compare it to and RV using 6 hours of data?
