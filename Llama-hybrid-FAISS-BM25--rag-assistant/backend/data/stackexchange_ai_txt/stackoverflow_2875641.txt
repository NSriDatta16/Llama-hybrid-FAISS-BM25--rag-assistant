Emma - Block Coverage vs Line Coverage

I have a strange scenario... while doing a EMMA coverage for UT, I get the total block coverage size more than line coverage size. For block coverage, the total size is some 50,000 while the line coverage is out of 18,000. I get (block-coverage-value) / 50,000 and (line-coverage-value) / 18,000 in the report. Is it possible? How can the number of blocks be more than the number of lines in code? btw, you can assume that I know what Block Coverage is: http://emma.sourceforge.net/faq.html#q.blockcoverage
