I really think that your research question calls for a sequence analysis approach. Given your post it seems that you have little prior knowledge and hence have to read some introductory material. I can recommend the TraMineR user guide: Gabadinho, A., G. Ritschard, M. Studer and N. S. Müller, Mining sequence data in R with the TraMineR package: A user's guide, University of Geneva, 2009. ( http://mephisto.unige.ch/pub/TraMineR/doc/TraMineR-Users-Guide.pdf ) If you prefer to work in Stata instead of R you could have a look at: Brzinsky-Fay, C., Kohler, U., & Luniak, M. (2006). Sequence Analysis with Stata. The Stata Journal, 6(4), 435–460. https://doi.org/10.1177/1536867X0600600401 A more comprehensive introduction to SA is provided in the book I wrote together with Emanuela Struffolino: Raab, M. & Struffolino, E. (2022). Sequence Analysis. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. The book's companion webpage ( https://sa-book.github.io/ ) illustrates how to replicate the results shown in the book using R and TraMineR. Given your example, the "classical" sequence analysis approach would (1) start with defining your sequences, (2) comparing them by computing a pairwise dissimilarity matrix, (3) conducting a cluster analysis using this matrix (4) predicting cluster membership with variables measured prior to the onset of your sequences by estimating a multinomial logistic regression. How you define the sequences depends on the available information. If you observe all children for the same amount of time (say from age 5 to 15), you could create sequences of equal length that not only include information on the order of events but also on the timing - which might be quite interesting from a substantive point of view. Alternatively, sequence analysis would also allow for discarding timing information by exclusively focusing on the order of events (as outlined above). In the latter case, you would work with sequences of length eight, assuming that every child experiences every event. Response to comment If you want to avoid the clustering step, you could consider a discrepancy analysis instead. Within the discrepancy framework, you could analyze the factors (e.g., gender, race, religion) that "explain" the variance in the discrepancy of your sequences without lumping the sequences into clusters. The approach is introduced in Studer, M., Ritschard, G., Gabadinho, A., & Müller, N. S. (2011). Discrepancy Analysis of State Sequences. Sociological Methods & Research, 40(3), 471–510. https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124111415372 (It's also covered in chapter 6 of our book, of course) Particularly the regression tree approach might be interesting in your case.
