How to impute the missing values in time series for long periods

I have electrical consumption data between 2016-2019. The data was recorded every 30 minutes for 4 years. There is no data between 13/03/2019 - 31/03/209. I started with pandas.DataFrame.interpolate and I almost tried all methods without any fix for this problem. You can see below some of the results. df.interpolate(method="nearest") df.interpolate(method="akima") df.interpolate(method="time") Now, I am thinking to use the same data of the last year March 2018 to fill the missing values in March 2019. Do you think it is the best method to handle this problem? If not, do you have other suggestions? I am asking if there are some packages to handle this problem.
