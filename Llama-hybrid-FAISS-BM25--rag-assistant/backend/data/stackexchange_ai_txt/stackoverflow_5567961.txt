As already suggested, you should never assume type safety. Not because someone can hack you, also because YOU can make a mistake or the person who configured your server. Since PHP's sessions can be stored in the file system (default), they can be stored within Memcache or you can write your own session storage handler (storing sessions in db). Say a mistake occurred - you saved sessions to the database, you tampered with the db and you changed a value by mistake to something else, and instead of integers (or floating point types), you're receiving strings with commas and what not - which do not fit your query you posted above - and voila, you're getting errors. No one likes to get errors and read error descriptions - especially not your users. So, to answer your question - it is bad to TRUST anyone. Never trust foreign input, there's always more than one point of failure - clean your input for safety, be it _POST, _GET, _SESSION or anything else.
