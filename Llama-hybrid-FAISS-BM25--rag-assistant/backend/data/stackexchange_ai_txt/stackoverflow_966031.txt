Redirecting packets to user space TCP stack without modifying application

I'm using a user space TCP stack based on the Linux stack running under Linux. Unfortunately it requires applications to specifically call its own modified versions of the normal sockets API functions and then just grabs incoming packets it receives in response using libpcap. Now my question is whether there is any way to redirect packets from an application to this TCP stack without having to modify the application itself. To put it differently, I am looking for a way to intercept calls to the sockets API and redirect them to the user space equivalent. Hope it is more or less clear what I mean.
