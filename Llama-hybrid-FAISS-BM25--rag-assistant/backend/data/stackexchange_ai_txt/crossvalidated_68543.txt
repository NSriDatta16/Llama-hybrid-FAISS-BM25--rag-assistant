Aggregating samples for clustering time series

I want to cluster a set of 512 time series. The time series have sampling intervals of 1 day over a time period of 5 years. Thus, each time series consists of about 1800 samples. However, many of the samples are zero. So, my question is: Is it ok to aggregate the samples to larger sampling intervals, e.g. days or even years, despite the information loss that comes with aggregation? Isn't aggregation some form of data tampering? If not, how do I chose the appropriate temporal unit for aggregation?
