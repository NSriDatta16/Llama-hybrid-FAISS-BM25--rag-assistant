I would create a Common schema. You don't want to give your users access to the dbo schema if you can help it. Especially if you have stats, etc there. Schemas are a great way to separate namespaces as well as administer security. Take advantage of that and organize your databases as simply as possible. It makes it much more readable when you're going through that list of tables!
