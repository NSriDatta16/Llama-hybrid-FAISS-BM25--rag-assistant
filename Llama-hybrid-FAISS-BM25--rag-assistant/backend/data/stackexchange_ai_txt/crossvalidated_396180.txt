I am thinking about this problem now. Here are my findings: (1) Delta Method (2) Bootstrap Resampling (3) Bayesian method (4) Mean-Variance Estimation (MVE) The idea is trying to estimate the two sources of the prediction variability, uncertainty from the model parameter estimate and the irreducible error. Here are several references: Machine Learning approaches for estimation of prediction interval for the model output, Durga L. Shrestha, Dimitri P. Solomatine, 2006 A comparison of some error estimates for neural network models, Robert Tibshirani, 1995 Comprehensive Review of Neural Network-Based Prediction Intervals and New Advances, Abbas khosravi, Doug Creighton, 2011 Hope this helps and correct me any of the above is inappropriate. I'd like to hear more from others.
