Machine learning with weighted / complex survey data

I have worked a lot with various nationally representative data. These data sources have a complex survey design, so the analysis requires the specification of stratification and weight variables. Among the data sources that are within my area of study, machine learning tools have not been applied to them. One obvious reason is that machine learning methods (currently) do not take into account weight and stratification variables. The goal of the weighted / stratified analyses is to obtain adjusted population estimates, which is different than the goal / purpose of machine learning. What thoughts do people have about using the nationally representative data sources and ignoring the weight and stratification variables? In other words, what would be your thoughts if you reviewing a machine learning study that was used nationally representative data but ignored the weight and stratification variables, assuming that the researcher / author was up-front about this methodological decision and was not making claims of nationally representative results? Thanks in advance!
