I don't think it is working right. If you're doing OCR, then your doing multiclass SVMs, so you'd have multiple regions partitioning the 2D plane, each colored differently, like this . But you're picture shows a single region, colored blue. Another suggestion, since you're doing OCR, use Polynomial kernel and with a soft-margin SVM. Don't use a linear kernel.
