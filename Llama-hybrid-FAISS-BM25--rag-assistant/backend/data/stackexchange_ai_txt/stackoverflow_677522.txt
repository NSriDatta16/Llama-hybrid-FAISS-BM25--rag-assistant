Binary Worrier, I have used your suggested code, and it is rather good, I have just one minor addition to it: public static string AddSpacesToSentence(string text) { if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(text)) return ""; StringBuilder newText = new StringBuilder(text.Length * 2); newText.Append(text[0]); for (int i = 1; i I have added a condition !char.IsUpper(text[i - 1]) . This fixed a bug that would cause something like 'AverageNOX' to be turned into 'Average N O X', which is obviously wrong, as it should read 'Average NOX'. Sadly this still has the bug that if you have the text 'FromAStart', you would get 'From AStart' out. Any thoughts on fixing this?
