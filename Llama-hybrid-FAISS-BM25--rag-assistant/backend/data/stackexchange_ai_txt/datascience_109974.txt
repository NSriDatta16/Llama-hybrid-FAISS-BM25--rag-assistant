From a model point of view, there is no "time" concept. What you are trying to do is to use a feature vector $x_t$ , for $t$ ranging from 2015 to 2020 (why not 2021 as well?). This is not a problem of time series forecast, but rather a time series (binary) classification. Each example is a time series, with an outcome retired or not.
