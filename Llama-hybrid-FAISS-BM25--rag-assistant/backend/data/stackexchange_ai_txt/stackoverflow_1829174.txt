Stacking CSS3 Structural pseudo-classes

While practicing different scenarios in which CSS3 pseudo-classes and selectors might come in handy, I ran across something I just can't figure out! Here's the situation. I want to modify the :first-of-type::first-letter of the first non-empty paragraph for a block of text. I'm not sure that pseudo-classes can be stacked though. Here's what I've come up with (Doesn't work, of course) .article-body > p:not(:empty):first-of-type::first-letter { ... } Given the following markup: The "T" in this paragraph should be the one affected. The only guess I can come up with is that pseudo-classes (ie; :not() and :first-of-type) can not be stacked upon each other. Which is odd since you can stack pseudo-elements upon each other, and other pseudo-classes... Any ideas for how this can be accomplished?
