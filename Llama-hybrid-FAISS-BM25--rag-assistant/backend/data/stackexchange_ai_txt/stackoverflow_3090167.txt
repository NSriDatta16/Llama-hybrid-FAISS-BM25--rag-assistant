You need to consider your application memory use carefully, but just so you know the options, I've successfully used a modified class based on http://www.modejong.com/iPhone/PNGAnimatorDemo.zip which can, on the first generation iPad hardware, handle 15fps full screen (1024x768) png animations. But keep an eye on your application bundle size. This is definitely not going to be the best option for most applications.
