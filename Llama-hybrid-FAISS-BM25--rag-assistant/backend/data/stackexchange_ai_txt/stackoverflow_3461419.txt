Copy a file included with an Adobe Air application out of the Application so that it can be modified

Is it possible to provide an existing SQLite file with an Air installer, and have the Air application copy it out to local storage upon first execution so that it can be modified? Or do I need to take my pre-made db and recreate it on the fly with Air on execution (store all the queries required to create the tables/data in the application)?
