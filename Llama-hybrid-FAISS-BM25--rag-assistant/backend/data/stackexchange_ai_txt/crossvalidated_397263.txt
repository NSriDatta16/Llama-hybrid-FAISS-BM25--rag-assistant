Estimate the asymptotic efficiency of a Markov chain sampling by the method of batching

In the paper Efficient Metropolis Jumping Rules , the author is writing that he used "the method of batching" for the estimation of $\operatorname{eff}_{\overline\theta_i}$ in Table 1 (on page 605). Could somebody explain to me what he is actually meaning? By the answer to my other question , it is clear to me how we can compute the autocorrelation of a one-dimensional set of samples at any lag. How do we estimate $\operatorname{eff}_{\overline\theta_i}$ from that?
