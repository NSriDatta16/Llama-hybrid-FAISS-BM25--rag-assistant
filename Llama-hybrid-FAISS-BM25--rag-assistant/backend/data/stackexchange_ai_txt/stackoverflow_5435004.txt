There has long been discussion on how to identify which particular distro your software is running on without a very satisfying answer. There are many hacks to do this but what might be most useful is to use the Linux Standards Base tool called "lsb_release". It is included in MeeGo and you can use it like this; $ lsb_release -a Which produces; LSB Version: :core-3.1-arm:core-3.1-noarch:core-3.2-arm:core-3.2-noarch:core-4.0-arm:core-4.0-noarch:desktop-3.1-arm:desktop-3.1-noarch:desktop-3.2-arm:desktop-3.2-noarch:desktop-4.0-arm:desktop-4.0-noarch Distributor ID: MeeGo Description: MeeGo release 1.1.90 (MeeGo) Release: 1.1.90 Codename: MeeGo On my image. If you just want the release you can do 'lsb_release -r'. Unfortunately, Maemo does not pay attention to the Linux Standards Base, see this bug: https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10756 So you'll likely have to use /usr/bin/osso-product-info on Maemo.
