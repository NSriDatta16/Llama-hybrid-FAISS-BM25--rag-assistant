Logistic regression does seem like one of the more obvious ways of dealing with a yes/no outcome. When you say that logistic regression failed to classify the 1s, this may point at several things. Firstly, it may be hard to predict the outcomes from the explanatory variables ("covariates", "independent variables") you have available. You did not say anything about those and how you tried to model them, but I assume that with this large a dataset a lot of options should work well (unless there is a huge number of covariates available). A symptom of that might be that after doing your best you still get no predicted probabilities for being a yes that are much different than the average probability. Sometimes it is just not possible to predict with great certainty. On the other hand it is possible that there is something to be gained in treating covariates differently. E.g. it may be a good idea to allow for non-linearity in continuous covariates, take into account seasonality (e.g. certain things typically happen more at certain times of the year), transforming covariates in a way that is known to make sense (e.g. often GDP per capita may make more sense than GDP) etc. Secondly, perhaps you are too focused on a yes/no prediction (logistic regression after all provides a p) and/or it is difficult to set a threshold that works well, which may be related to point one. It may be that to set a threshold on the predicted probability that catches most of the 1s, you need to end up predicting that a lot of 0s would be 1s. In fact, if you have in some sense a good model, then when you use $P(Y=1)=0.5$ as a threshold for predicting a 1, you would expect half of the predictions that are made exactly on the threshold to be wrong. In general, I cannot see a way, in which aggregating data will really help for modeling. As you say, you throw away information and it becomes more difficult to take covariates into account. Using mean covariate information on aggregated percentages for groups is very problematic due to aggregation bias. However, that does not say that it is something one should never do. E.g. it may still be a reasonable way of presenting results or illustrating them, e.g. "Our model predicts that XXX with characteristic YYY are more likely to ZZZ. In fact, when you simply look at those characteristic YYY you immediately see that the proportion is much higher than..." Of course, one problem is that this kind of "na√Øve" univariate look at the data can easily be misleading or not reflect relationships that are there once you account for other explanatory variables.
