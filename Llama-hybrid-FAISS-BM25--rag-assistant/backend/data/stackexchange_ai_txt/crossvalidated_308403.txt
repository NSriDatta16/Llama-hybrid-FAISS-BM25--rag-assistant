Likert-normality and multiple regression assumptions?

I have a questions measured through Likert scale (1-5) Independent variables: I believe xx is a problem strongly disagree(1) disag neutral agree s-agree(5) I believe yy is a problem strongly disagree(1) disag neutral agree s-agree(5) Dependent variable xyz (1,2,3) ---not a binary I am planning to run some tests. I found there are lots of debate on parametric vs non parametric on it. Some test needs normality. What about normality test in this case? Do I need to carry out normality test on Likert scale.Or is it logical? but lets suppose that in question 1, most of the respondents agree that xx is a problem(4 or 5), so how would data be a normal distributed? obviously it will be skewed(right). So does normality make sense in it? (unless the result is kind of neutral). I saw lots of debates going on but for an academic research what can i do? (Likert scale score vs category score or continuous and so on) Since my dependent variable is not binary, I am planning use multiple regression(cannot use logistic regression, but log regression is much lenient on assumptions), but problem is for some reasons my all questions replies are not meeting the criteria for multiple regression (especially normality of data, and standard residual). so what kind of do? Is it needed to carry out all assumption test to run multiple regression on likert scale question? What may be my options(to predict or test the hypothesis)? thank you
