Creation of a Target Variable

So i'm new to machine learning and data science, i've been looking tutorials and i'm working on self made project at the moment and i'm having an analysis paralysis with the data preprocessing portion. I think i'm over complicating this but here are some questions I have. So for example, I have survey data from people about a store and I hope to use this data to help them find out whether or not they're willing to spend money on the store. I have things like median household income, age, gender, whether or not they're happy, but for what I want my target variable to be would be something along the lines of "Would this person buy stuff from this store," this obviously isn't in the data set. How would I go about creating this as my target variable? Is this feasible to do in the first place? All tutorials online have their target variable already in the data set so they can train on it, would creating the target variable with 0 values be feasible? Would I need to create logic to fill the values from already established predictor variables?
