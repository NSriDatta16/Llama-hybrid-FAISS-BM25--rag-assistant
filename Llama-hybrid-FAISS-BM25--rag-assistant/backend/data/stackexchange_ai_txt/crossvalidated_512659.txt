Source recommendation for statistical modeling: theoretical and practical aspects

I have asked following question few days ago. Fitting distribution: Covid-19 confirmed cases It turned out that I have a deeper problem beyond the statistical issues that I am dealing with. I didn't ask the right question in a right way. Thanks to @whuber I corrected some of that issue. I figured that I have been working on theoretical probability and lost the touch with the more important one, the practical statistics which really solve the real problems. I model dynamical growth of social interactions, like epidemic behaviors, using differential equations. I have a fairly enough background on theoretical aspect of statistical modeling, but zero on the practical aspect, and that just hit me hard after asking the above question. I decided to hold everything for 3 months and try to learn the practical implementations of statistical modelings with R programming. So I ask anyone whom can give me some recommendation, books, lecture notes, website etc, that can help me with it. What I am trying to learn includes the followings 1.preparing real-world data for the later statistical inference. 2. Fitting distributions to real-world data and all the tests, like goodness of fit, related to this task. 3. Being able to recognize the best approach toward the data mining, like should I use time series or a stochastic process or a random variable. 4. Doing previous steps in R environment. I searched through the website and found some great books on subjects related to these but non of them really had these task in particular. I really don't have time for reading a lot of books, So I am asking people who are experts in the subject or got in tough with the same issues, to introduce me to the right resources so I won't waste a lot of time with searching through all the books and websites that have something in common with the subjects. Edit In the way of modeling epidemic kind of behaviors, what is most importan(say 90 percent of data mining task of the modeling) is fitting distributions. So I should've emphasized that in my question. I am also aware of this book https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Fitting-Statistical-Distributions-R/dp/1584887117 that is contributed entirely to fitting distributions. However the method is GLD, I wanted to know if there is a book like this for this task with outer methods rather than GLD. For example, through Q_Q plots, Histograms, Moment estimations,Bootstrapping and methods like these as their chapters. Thanks in advance.
