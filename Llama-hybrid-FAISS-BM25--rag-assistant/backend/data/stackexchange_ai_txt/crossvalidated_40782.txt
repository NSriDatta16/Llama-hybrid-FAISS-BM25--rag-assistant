From the README file, on the topic of precomputed kernels: Precomputed Kernels =================== Users may precompute kernel values and input them as training and testing files. Then libsvm does not need the original training/testing sets. Assume there are L training instances x1, ..., xL and. Let K(x, y) be the kernel value of two instances x and y. The input formats are: New training instance for xi: 0:i 1:K(xi,x1) ... L:K(xi,xL) New testing instance for any x: 0:? 1:K(x,x1) ... L:K(x,xL) That is, in the training file the first column must be the "ID" of xi. In testing, ? can be any value. All kernel values including ZEROs must be explicitly provided. Any permutation or random subsets of the training/testing files are also valid (see examples below). Note: the format is slightly different from the precomputed kernel package released in libsvmtools earlier. Examples: Assume the original training data has three four-feature instances and testing data has one instance: 15 1:1 2:1 3:1 4:1 45 2:3 4:3 25 3:1 15 1:1 3:1 If the linear kernel is used, we have the following new training/testing sets: 15 0:1 1:4 2:6 3:1 45 0:2 1:6 2:18 3:0 25 0:3 1:1 2:0 3:1 15 0:? 1:2 2:0 3:1 ? can be any value. Any subset of the above training file is also valid. For example, 25 0:3 1:1 2:0 3:1 45 0:2 1:6 2:18 3:0 implies that the kernel matrix is [K(2,2) K(2,3)] = [18 0] [K(3,2) K(3,3)] = [0 1]
