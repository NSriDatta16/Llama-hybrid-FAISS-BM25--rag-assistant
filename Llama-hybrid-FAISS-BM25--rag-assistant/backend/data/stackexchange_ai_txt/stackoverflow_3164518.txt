This is going to be tough if it needs to be watertight. Ideas: Maybe easiest: If the computers all have fixed LAN IPs, maintain a table of IPs and users. Allow users to log in from "their" IP only. Use a cookie to tie a computer to a user. Create a "connect this computer to my user account" page. That page set a cookie that lasts forever on the user's computer. The cookie contains an ID that is associated with a user name on your server's end. This requires the trust that the user is actually on their computer at the time of "connecting", but you wouldn't have to do any work on their computer directly. If your colleagues are confined to using one Browser, see whether you can use that browser's user agent and inject some unique value. This can be done for Internet Explorer by modyfing a registry value IIRC. This would require you to access each computer individually. Install a small service on each user's computer that sends back a pre-defined ID code when connected to. The ID identifies the computer the user is accessing the site from. This would require you to access each computer individually. re your comment: Totally crazy idea: Write a script that logs into the network router, parses the "DHCP clients" table, thus finding out which MAC address has which IP address. Not a quick job and not a clean solution but, if the router has a web interface, it might be possible. Of course, you may have to adjust your script when the router gets an software update. None of this will be reliable enough to protect against criminal activity, but should do to identify a computer under normal circumstances.
