The most obvious way to predict two correlated categorical variables is to merge them into a single variable! Instead of predicting classes $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$ for the first target and $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$ for the second target, you can predict 9 classes like $a_1b_1$, $a_1b_2$, $a_1b_3$, $a_2b_1$ etc. for the joint target. This structure is flexible enough to allow for any kind of correlation between the response variables. And because the resulting problem is an ordinary multiclass single-response classificaton, you can plug in any model you want, from multivariate logistic regression to ensemble of decision trees.
