FYI This isn't really a data science question, it's really related more to SQL and should be asked on those forums. But I'm going to try and help you anyways. This is something where you need to do matching by pronunciation using something like SOUNDEX in MySQL (I'm not aware of other RDBMS that offer this). Overall, it's really something that requires an iterative approach where the first pass you're doing straight matches, the next pass you're doing matches with wildcards and then the next pass you use SOUNDEX. In theory, that should leave you with very few (if any) unmatched items for you to do manually.
