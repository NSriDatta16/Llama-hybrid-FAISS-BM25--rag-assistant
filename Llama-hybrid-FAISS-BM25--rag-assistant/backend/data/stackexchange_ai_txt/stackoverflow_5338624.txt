In the case of git , I don't know of any easy way to override the method for calculating the binary deltas that are used for efficient storage in pack files. (Pack files are generated with most transports for efficient transport of data to and from the server.) However, you might want to take a look at the bup project for git. This takes the approach of directly generating git pack files for the case of using git for backing-up huge amounts of data. That sounds broadly similar to what you want to do. [I understand that you explicitly exclude this in your question, but in case another reader finds this question who is interested in nice user-visible diffs of binary files, I'll point out this useful example from Pro Git .]
