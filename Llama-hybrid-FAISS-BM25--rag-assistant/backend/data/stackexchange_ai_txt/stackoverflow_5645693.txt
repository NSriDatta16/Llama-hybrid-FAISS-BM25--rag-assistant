I am assuming that you have two viewControllers ( first )one for tableView and another ( second ) viewcontroller where you will display tabbarController . Now in in second viewControlers xib you drag n drop UITabBarCotroller from library using IB. In app Delegate create a reference for this viewController and also make it as property so that you can access it. also initialize it in didFinishLaunching method of appDelegate . and in first viewController's didSelectRowAtIndexPath(delegate method of UITableView) access second viewController from appDelegate . and push(if your first viewcontroller is navigation based) or present it. Thanks.
