Cross-platform desktop development

I need an advice for cross-platform engine/framework for desktop PC application development (Windows, MAC, Linux). I see 3 possibilities, Qt, Java and Adobe AIR. It must be easy to install (run-time is a drawback, but C++ wrapper and/or installer can solve the issue I think). It must be fast and have a rich GUI (not 3D game, but definitely some 2D graphics). The development environment must be easy to establish and the UI development tool must have drag&drop functionality to define application layout. Target application must have native look and feel. The professional paid support should be available.
