What is the effect of merging categories on logistic regression estimates?

I have a logistic regression with a number of predictors variables including a factor with, say, 5 categories. The estimates for that factor compare categories 2-5 in turn to the reference category zero. If I merge 2 of the non-reference categories (say merge 2 and 3) then the estimates for the other change slightly. I think this is because estimates will be correlated in a non-orthognal design but I'd like confirmation or a more thorough explanation please. Edit to be honest my colleague has such a problem with conditional logistic regression but the same issue occurs with ordinary logistic regression and I suspect in regressoin generally. for myself I'd like to know for general knowledge what the issue is (as well as to reassure my colleague I hope it is OK to post code (I hope it doesn't get too scrambled - I indented the code) but this illustrates the occurence with the generally available (e.g. in R package MASS from the Venables and Ripley book) dataset birthwt where binary outcome "low birthweight" is modelled by logistic regression - I have a factor ftv (which I make groups 0-4 by merging then I create s copy fvt2 where groups 1 and 2 are merged to be "2". The estimates in both analyses compare group zero to the other groups and you can see below the comparison of group 4 to 0 changes (slightly - I've put them in bold). Why? the data for those 2 groups in unaltered but I can see there is an issue of correlated estimates here. Many thanks for any advice. library(MASS) data(birthwt) birthwt$ftv 3,4,birthwt$ftv) # change 4 or more to 4 birthwt$ftv2 |z|) (Intercept) 1.15892582 0.852443200 1.3595344 0.173977321 ht 1.87181914 0.710991788 2.6326874 0.008471227 ui 0.90472684 0.442643299 2.0439185 0.040961597 lwt -0.01627838 0.006638716 -2.4520372 0.014204999 as.factor(ftv)1 -0.55718506 0.419152552 -1.3293133 0.183744632 as.factor(ftv)2 -0.39179846 0.501082892 -0.7819035 0.434271296 as.factor(ftv)3 0.76139653 0.837278585 0.9093706 0.363154537 as.factor(ftv)4 **-0.17724595** 1.183684076 -0.1497409 0.880969020 low_log |z|) (Intercept) 1.14052105 0.850496353 1.3410064 0.179918375 ht 1.84783639 0.704472332 2.6230078 0.008715729 ui 0.91241494 0.441875434 2.0648691 0.038935385 lwt -0.01612754 0.006620628 -2.4359530 0.014852614 as.factor(ftv2)2 -0.49476082 0.354944684 -1.3939097 0.163344887 as.factor(ftv2)3 0.76274256 0.836785227 0.9115153 0.362023910 as.factor(ftv2)4 **-0.17931225** 1.183211033 -0.1515471 0.879544125 Actually if you remove the other variables - ht , ui and lwt , then the estimates/contrasts for groups 4 and 3 vs 0 are unaffected! The estimates are always the difference in log odds between the 2 groups I am uneasy this is well understood (at least by others).
