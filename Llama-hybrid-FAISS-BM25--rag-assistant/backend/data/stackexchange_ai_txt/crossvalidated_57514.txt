I do not have much knowledge about stock market prediction but for SVM, it can be used as classification or regression. For classification you need to have a dependent variable as categorical (or binary for two class classification), for regression you need to have a dependent variable as numeric. In this situation, you should have independent variables (or features) that define your dependent variable somewhat. So you can ask these questions to yourself. What's your main reason? What do you want to predict/forecast or classify by the means of some variables in the stock market? If you have a continuous dependent variable, you can classify it by doing some research.
