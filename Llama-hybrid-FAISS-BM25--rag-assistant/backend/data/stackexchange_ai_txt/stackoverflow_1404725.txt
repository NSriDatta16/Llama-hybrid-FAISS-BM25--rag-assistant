In Visual Studio 2008, the icon specified by ToolBoxBitmap is not added to the toolbox for any of the components in the current solution for performance reasons. The standard 'gear' icon is used. If you manually add your assembly through the Toolbox...Add Items...dialog, the custom icon will display which is the behavior you are experiencing. Moreover, when you drag ErrorProviderEx to a form, the icon you specified will be used, which again is the behavior you noted in a comment. Note, in your case, you are using typeof(ErrorProvider) so you will not have the normal problems of using a custom bitmap. (This behavior may also been true for Visual Studio 2005. Visual Studio 2003 spoiled us by displaying the icon.) (I personally do not like this new behavior. I am willing to wait an extra second or two for the IDE to retrieve the icon for all controls and components in the solution. I wonder if there is a registry hack to show the icons.)
