Can queries that read table variables generate parallel exection plans in SQL Server 2008?

First, from BOL : Queries that modify table variables do not generate parallel query execution plans. Performance can be affected when very large table variables, or table variables in complex queries, are modified. In these situations, consider using temporary tables instead. For more information, see CREATE TABLE (Transact-SQL). Queries that read table variables without modifying them can still be parallelized. That seems clear enough. Queries that read table variables, without modifying them, can still be parallelized. But then over at SQL Server Storage Engine , an otherwise reputable source, Sunil Agarwal said this in an article on tempdb from March 30, 2008: Queries involving table variables don't generate parallel plans. Was Sunil paraphrasing BOL re: INSERT, or does the presence of table variables in the FROM clause prevent parallelism? If so, why? I am thinking specifically of the control table use case, where you have a small control table being joined to a larger table, to map values, act as a filter, or both. Thanks!
