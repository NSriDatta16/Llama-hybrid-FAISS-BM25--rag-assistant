Decision tree and SVM for text classification - theory

I used 4 classifiers for my text data: NB, kNN, DT and SVM. As for NB and kNN I fully understand how they work with text - how we can count probabilities for all words in NB and how to use similarity metrics with TF-IDF vectors in kNN I don't understand at all how decision tree and support vector machine work with text data . I implemented all algorithms in Python so all I need is some resource or explanation how the other two classifiers work with text... I understand DT with non-text data - it seams logical for example nodes with checking if some data is more/less than some number. But with text I get confused. Does it operate on text or with numerical vectors? The same applies to SVM...
