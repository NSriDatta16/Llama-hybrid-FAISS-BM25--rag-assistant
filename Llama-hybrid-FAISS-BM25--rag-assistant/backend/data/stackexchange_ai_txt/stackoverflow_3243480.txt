I am not sure I understood your requirements very well, however I did decipher some key points. What I am suggesting will let you deliver a complete working application in a single package (say a JAR) that will not require much (if any) configuration or administration of servers. Some Required skills: Java programming langauge JDBC, SQL JSP and Servlets (for the Web tier) I'm trying to make use of a local database to create a desktop style application [...] I Want some Java help with connecting to a truly local database ( no access to server tech ) Datastore JDBC can be used with any database that has a JDBC driver, which isn't necessarily a database in "network mode", it can be used with embedded databases as well. Here is an example with Derby in embedded mode : When an application accesses a Derby database using the Embedded Derby JDBC driver, the Derby engine does not run in a separate process, and there are no separate database processes to start up and shut down. Instead, the Derby database engine runs inside the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as the application. So, Derby becomes part of the application just like any other jar file that the application uses. Figure 1 depicts this embedded architecture. Here are some 100% Java and embeddable databases: http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html http://db.apache.org/derby/ http://hsqldb.org/ Web tier You can also embed a Web server like Jetty . Jetty has a slogan "Don't deploy your application in Jetty, deploy Jetty in your application". What this means is that as an alternative to bundling your application as a standard WAR to be deployed in Jetty, Jetty is designed to be a software component that can be instantiated and used in a Java program just like any POJO. Embedding Jetty . Please note that there are other web servers that you can use this way.
