Detect if image is loaded on page

My question is not like this one: Browser-independent way to detect when image has been loaded I have advertisements on my site for which I get paid per impression, now recently I have seen a dramatic drop in the number of impressions that each ad has been getting however I have been getting more average hits/month. Is it possible for me to detect if an image has been loaded or if something like a 404 (common with cheap ad blockers) has been loaded instead?
