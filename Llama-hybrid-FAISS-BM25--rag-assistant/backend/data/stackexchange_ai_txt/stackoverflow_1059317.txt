Check out the Common Service Locator project: The Common Service Locator library contains a shared interface for service location which application and framework developers can reference. The library provides an abstraction over IoC containers and service locators. Using the library allows an application to indirectly access the capabilities without relying on hard references. The hope is that using this library, third-party applications and frameworks can begin to leverage IoC/Service Location without tying themselves down to a specific implementation. Edit: This doesn't appear to solve your desire to use attribute-based declaration of dependency injection. You can either choose not to use it, or find a way to abstract the attributes to multiple injection libraries (like you mentioned). That is the basic problem with declarative interfaces -- they are tied to a particular implementation. Personally, I stick to constructor injection so I don't run into this issue.
