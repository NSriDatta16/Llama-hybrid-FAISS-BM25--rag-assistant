The best way to explore the Java world and to connect all the dot’s is to just use one of the frameworks, as all use web.xml, context.xml and Java EE components (all can persist the Pojo entity beans). As you already know the Stripes framework, I can recommend this book (it’s short an handles all the aspects you named): Stripes: ...and Java Web Development Is Fun Again , by Frederic Daoud, Pragmatic Programmers, ISBN: 1934356212 A more thoroughly approach for a deeper understanding of these Java EE technologies would be to gain all the knowledge necessary for passing these two Java Certification exams: Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD) Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD)
