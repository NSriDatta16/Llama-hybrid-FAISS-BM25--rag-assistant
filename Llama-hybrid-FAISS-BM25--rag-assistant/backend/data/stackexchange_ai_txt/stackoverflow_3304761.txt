As the C# extension methods do not work well together with extern aliasing, I would advise you not to put the interface in the System namespace as it will break people who use both Rx and your library, I would put the interface in the Foo namespace. People who want to use your library and Rx as well can then always build an extension method like this: static System.IObservable ToSystemObservable (this Foo.IObservable source) Also the Observable interfaces in Rx have been moved to a seperate dll System.Observable.dll for exactly this reason, I strongly encourage you to reconsider using those. This dll doesn't version from Rx build to Rx build so should not have versioning issues. This way anybody using your library can use any (recent) build of Rx that they want to do queries over your observable objects.
