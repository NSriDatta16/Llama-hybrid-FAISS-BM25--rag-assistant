Out-of-sample reconstruction error with PCA when space dimensionality is larger than number of sample points

I've got a question and I have done several experiments in R, yet couldn't figure out why. The question is for a data set of N*D, N for number of data points and D for dimension, the maximum number of principal component is max(N, D). Then I discovered a fact that, when N is larger than D, by using D principal components, any old data(data within the data set) could be reconstructed absolutely the same as it was, so can any new data, the result of ((new_data - mean) %*% loadings %*% t(loadings) + mean) ### code in R is the same as new_data. However, when D is larger than N, by using N principal components, reconstruction of data within the data set is still precise, that of the new data differs from the originals. I just can't figure out why. Can you please explain or give some hint?
