I'm unit testing EF4 easily without mocking. What I did was create a repository interface using the code from http://elegantcode.com/2009/12/15/entity-framework-ef4-generic-repository-and-unit-of-work-prototype/ as a basis I then created an InMemoryRepository class that used the IRepository interface. I then replaced the IObjectSet with a List inside of the class and changed the retrieval methods accordingly. Thus if you need to do unit testing, pass in the InMemoryRepository rather than the DataRepository.
