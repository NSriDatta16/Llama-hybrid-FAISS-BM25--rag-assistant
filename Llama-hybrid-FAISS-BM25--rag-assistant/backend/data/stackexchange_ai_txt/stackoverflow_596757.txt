did you try and set the DEFER="DEFER" attribute on the script. that would tell the user agent that the script should wait for the page to load and render before it loads the script. Else you could hack it by setting a variable at the one script, that is set to true when script is loaded. In the other you placed logic that tested (think loop and timeout method) if the script was loaded and then calls your logic when both scripts are loaded. not very nice, but you need some kind of logic to handle execution, and not just run the methods inline in your script. To nathan: sequences in delegates are used to determine which of the delegate controls to load. This should have nothing to do with the issue in question. As i understand it the JS files just set the value on a script that just happens to be a delegate control.
