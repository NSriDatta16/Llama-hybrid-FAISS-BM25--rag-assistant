Spurious correlation

I've read that if two time series, $Y_t$ and $X_t$, are trend stationary, then regressing $Y_t$ on $X_t$ results in a spurious regression because of an omitted time trend variable . Let $Y_t = \delta_0 + \delta_1t + u_t$ and $X_t = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1t + v_t$. I want to show that $Y_t$ is a linear function of $X_t$, a deterministic time trend and an error term. Can somebody please provide a mathematical proof of this?
