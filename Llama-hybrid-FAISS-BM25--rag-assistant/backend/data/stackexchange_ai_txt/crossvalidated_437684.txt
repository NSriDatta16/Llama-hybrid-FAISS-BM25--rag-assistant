Plot Actual vs Predicted SVM Regression

I am building an SVM regression model using caret package, however, I am not sure what is the best approach to plot predicted vs actual values. I have the code below. You can reproduce the output by executing the code in your R environment. library(ggplot2) library(caret) generateModelPlotOnTest $DataSizeMB Input_data_size/1048576)) allDataOriginal $DataSizeGB Input_data_size/1073741824 allDataOriginal $ExMem = as.integer(gsub("g", "", allDataOriginal$ ExMem)) allDataOriginal $data kmeans$ plot I have also tried using two geom_lines but again interpreting that would be hard in my opinion. Because I am not sure if the x-axis representing the index of the observation would make any sense.
