I've wistfully wondered the same thing, as described in the answer to: What tool/application/whatever do you wish existed? While it's easy to imagine a great number of benefits I think the biggest hurdle that would have to be addressed is that no-one has produced a viable alternative. When people think of alternatives to storing source as text they seem to often immediately think in terms of graphical representations (I'm referring here to the commercial products that have been available - eg. HP-vee). And if we look at the experience of people like the FPGA designers, we see that programming (exclusively) graphically just doesn't work - hence languages like Verilog and VHDL. But I don't see that the storage of source necessarily needs to be bound to the method of writing it in the first place. Entry of source can be largely done as text - which means that the issues of copying/pasting can still be achieved. But I also see that by allowing merges and rollbacks to be done on the basis of tokenised meta-source we could achieve more accurate and more powerful manipulation tools.
