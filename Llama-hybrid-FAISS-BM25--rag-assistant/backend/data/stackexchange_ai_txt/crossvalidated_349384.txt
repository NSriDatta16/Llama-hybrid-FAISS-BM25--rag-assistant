What is the difference between invariance to translation, covariance to translation and equivariance to translation?

I get stuck at understanding the difference between invariance to translation, covariance to translation and equivariance to translation in the context of of convolutional neural network. What does it mean : Convolution is equivariant to translation ? Convolution is convariant to translation ? What is the difference between covariance and equivariance ? Are convolutional layers equivariant to translation ?
