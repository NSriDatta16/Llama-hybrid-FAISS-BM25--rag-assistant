Have you thought about a non-parametric test such as the Mann-Wilcoxon ? You could test the before and after distribution to see if the average value has shifted significantly in one direction or the other. Edit @Scortchi is correct in that in your specific case, the Wilcoxon signed rank test would be a more appropriate non-parametric test.
