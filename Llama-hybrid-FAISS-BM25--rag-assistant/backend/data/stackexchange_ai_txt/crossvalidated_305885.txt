For self-studying it could be useful to read the general aggregation of time series as in Granger and Morris: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345178 Technically you applied the formulas correctly. Still check the second line after "So", since $\Phi_Z(B) = 1$ and $\Phi_Y(B)$ is missing (corrected it in your post). The left hand side will be driven by exactly the same polynomial of the ARIMA process $Y_t$ $\Rightarrow$ ARI(1,1) rather than AR(2). While $Q_t$ is a MA(3) part of the right hand side. True that Gaussian, but with some colored dependence $\Rightarrow$ is not a white noise, strictly speaking. So, what you get as an answer then? And, as far as I see, you still missing a discussion in your answer. So, think about any practical situation, when to a process with a stochastic trend some extra disturbance is added.
