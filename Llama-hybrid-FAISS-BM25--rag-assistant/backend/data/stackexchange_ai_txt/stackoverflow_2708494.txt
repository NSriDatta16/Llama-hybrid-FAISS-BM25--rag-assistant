REBOL: How to do another task while waiting an alarm to trigger?

So I have created an alarm function: alarm: func[seconds message [string! unset!]][ wav: load %attention.wav sound-port: open sound:// wait seconds do [ insert sound-port wav wait sound-port close sound-port if (value? 'message) [ print message ] ] ] which works like this: alarm 30 "Will trigger in 30 seconds" Now how can I for example show a timer which increments while waiting for the alarm since Rebol doesn't support thread ?
