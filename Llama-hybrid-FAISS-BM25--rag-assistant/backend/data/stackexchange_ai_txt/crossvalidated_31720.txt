PCA components changing over time

If I do the PCA on the whole dataset I get 7 components that can explain 90% of the variance, if I split the dataset into 2 (sorted by time), the number of significant components in the first half goes to 5 (with 15 variables present in one or more components) and in the second half goes to 8 (with 21 variables present in one or more components), can we infer that some of these variables become more significant in the latter half compared to first half?
