The simplest explanation is that cTime ends up either greater than the total time of the audio file or it ends up negative somehow. Both will cause the player instance to set its currentTime property to zero. As an aside, I think having the player in a timer's userInfo dictionary is fragile. Unless it just absolutely must be embedded in the timer, I would move it to a property of the class so that all the methods can easily access it. The timer can still call the methods but you won't run the risk of the player being lost while swapping from timer to timer.
