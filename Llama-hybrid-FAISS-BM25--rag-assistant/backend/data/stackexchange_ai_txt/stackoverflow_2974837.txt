It seems that you're misunderstanding the Python jargon. The Python term "object" means an actual run-time instance of a class. As far as I can tell, you have "sub-classes" of the Shape class called ball , circle and triangle . Note that a sub-class is also a class. You are keeping the code for each such sub-class in a separate file, which is fine. I think you're getting mixed up because you're focusing on the file layout of your project far too early. With Python it is often easier to start with just one file, writing everything you need in that file (functions, classes, etc.). Just get things working first. Later, when you've got working code and you just want to split a part of it into another file for organizational reasons, it will be much more obvious (to you!) how this should be done. In Python, every class does not have to be defined in its own separate file. You can do this if you like, but it is not compulsory.
