jquery uploadify and codeigniter session id problem

I know this is famous question but i am not able to make it work refering to those links :- The problem is the same. No session id is being passed which causes a lot of problems. This is my config.php :- $config['sess_cookie_name'] = 'ci_session'; $config['sess_expiration'] = 2700; $config['sess_encrypt_cookie'] = FALSE; $config['sess_use_database'] = FALSE; $config['sess_table_name'] = 'ci_sessions'; $config['sess_match_ip'] = FALSE; $config['sess_match_useragent'] = FALSE; $config['sess_time_to_update'] = 300; As you can see i have already set sess_match_useragent to false but still my session ids are getting changed. Can anybody tell me how do i pass my session ids in scriptData? Because Codeigniter doesn't use querystring approach instead it builds up pretty urls. Thanks in advance :)
