In C++ a struct can have a constructor with an initialiser list to perform automatic initialisation. A struct is a data type, and type does not determine initialisation. Storage class determines initialisation. So a statically allocated object of the struct type will. like any other static object, be initialised to zero. Any object declared with the static keyword or declared outside of a function scope is statically allocated.
