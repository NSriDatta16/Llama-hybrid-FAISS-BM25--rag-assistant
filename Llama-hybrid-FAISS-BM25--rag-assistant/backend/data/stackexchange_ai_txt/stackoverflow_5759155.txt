Relative Layout Issue For Xoom Tablet

I am having issues with layout for Xoom Tablet. Basically, I want one fragment (ListView) on the left side and the other fragment right to the ListView Fragment. But, I am having two issues on this. Firstly, I dont want to hard code the android:layout_width for the listview fragment which is set to 200dip (Refer code below). I tried wrap_content, fill_parent but it didnt work for me. Secondly, this UI is not rendered on the whole screen. Its only capturing a small portion of the whole tablet screen. Even hard coding from fill_parent to other values din't have any effect. The code is as shown below. I would really appreciate any sort of help on this problem. ~Thank you !!
