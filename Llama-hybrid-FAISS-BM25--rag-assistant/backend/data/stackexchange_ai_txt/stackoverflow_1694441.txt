I second the recommendation for Sprouts . Generating the build scripts is probably the biggest hassle you are going to run into developing Flex application without the Flex Builder IDE. I know you aren't an "IDE guy", but the open source FlashDevelop IDE will give you most of features you'll find in the Flex Builder IDE without the cost. Getting code assist with MXML is a little more complicated but there is a schema out there for Flex 3, so you can get some code assist using a schema aware XML editor. As far as learning resources I usually find all the help I need in either the Flex help or the Flex API reference (these exist for Flex 2 and Flex 4 as well). Adobe's Devnet also has some good "getting started" tutorials , just make sure that they are related to the same Flex SDK version you are developing with. I don't agree with the recommendation that you should steer clear of the framework classes however. It is probably true that you could meet your development requirements using just the base Actionscript libraries found in PlayerGlobal.swc, and you might want to reevaluate whether you need the framework at all. To the point of your question however the framework libraries are what Flex is essentially, so if you aren't leveraging them then you aren't developing Flex applications.
