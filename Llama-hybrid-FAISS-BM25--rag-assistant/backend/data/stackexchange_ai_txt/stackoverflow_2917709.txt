Organizing files on sdcard into directories

I have images uploaded on the simulated sdcard on my emulator. I downloaded them from the browser, using the long-click on each image. When I look at the file explorer in the DDMS perspective, I see that they are in the directory sdcard/download . Now if I want to download some audio files and use them in an app to, say list the title of all audio files, will they go in the same directory? (I am trying to push the audio files manually from my computer to the emulator). This doesn't seem right. Shouldn't the media files of different types (pictures, audio, video) go into different directories? Also, thinking this through a little, how is something like this related to the physical directory on the sdcard? Uri mMedia = android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI; Thanks!
