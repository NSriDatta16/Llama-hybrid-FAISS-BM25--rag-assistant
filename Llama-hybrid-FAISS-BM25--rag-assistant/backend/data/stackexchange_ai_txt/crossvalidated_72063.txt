Reference for hierarchical Bayesian modelling

I am currently reading "Bayesian Data Analysis" by Gelman et al. and my main goal was to learn about Hierarchical modelling on chapter 5. I read until chapter 4 and the book is written terribly for a taste of a math student as it is pretty sketchy and engineering oriented. I decided to not to continue anymore with this book and I would be very grateful if somebody could introduce a reference with a more rigorous approach to the topic.
