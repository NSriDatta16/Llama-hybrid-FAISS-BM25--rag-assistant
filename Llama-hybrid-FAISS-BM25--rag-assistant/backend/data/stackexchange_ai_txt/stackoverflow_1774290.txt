You really want to limit the cache size of sqlite in iphone applications. When you launch your application and initialize your database run a command like: const char *pragmaSql = "PRAGMA cache_size = 50"; if (sqlite3_exec(database, pragmaSql, NULL, NULL, NULL) != SQLITE_OK) { NSAssert1(0, @"Error: failed to execute pragma statement with message '%s'.", sqlite3_errmsg(database)); } this will prevent sqlite from caching your queries and slowly consuming all of your memory.
