asp.net dynamic forms question

I'm trying to figure out a way to create a page that can be used for generic forms. What i had in mind was someone here at our office would use the obout edit to create html that would look like a form. This html would be saved to a database. When the user wanted to fill out the form and mail it, they would click on the correct form retrieval and this html would be put into a label control. So now the page has a label control on it with some html as the text of the label. The user could type in the values that they wanted. So the html might look something like this: Quarterly Report of Employees Serverd Employee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Address: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The user would type in the input type="text" a value of say John Smith and then type into the address input type as well. Now I want to grab all this html and mail it off. I know how to do the mailing portion, but the grabbing the html I'm not getting. I can grab the html in the label, but the text that that user typed in is not included in that text. So how do I get that html and the text the user typed in. Any ideas. thanks shannon
