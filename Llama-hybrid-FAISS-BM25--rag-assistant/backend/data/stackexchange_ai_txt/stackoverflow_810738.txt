Safari 4 (beta) (for both Mac and PC ) may help you, but after you download it and install it you'll need to go into your preferences and turn on the Developer settings, then restart Safari. This will give you a Developer file menu item with choices to change the User Agent, JavaScript Profiler and Debugger and a great little Web Inspector window (either docked or floating) which gives you access to (X)HTML, CSS, Resources (assets and timing), JavaScript, JavaScript Profiling and HTML5 database. In addition it gives you a JavaScript console so you can make calls into the current rendered page to check for settings, variables, DOM walking and many other various little goodies, all in real-time. Quite powerful and really nice. Once you've tweeked what you're tweeking, simply copy your changes (or note them then) make the changes to your source. I've only started accessing the power of it and I have to say, it's so far been a real joy to use - surprisingly so.
