How To Detect "Touch Down" in superview of UIScrollView?

I have a UIView that contains a UIScrollView and I want to be able to capture the "Touch Down" event in the UIView any time the user taps on the UIScrollView . I've tried including all the touchesBegan/Ended/Cancelled handlers in my UIViewController but none of them get fired when tapping inside the UIScrollView contained in the main UIView . What is the best way to accomplish this?
