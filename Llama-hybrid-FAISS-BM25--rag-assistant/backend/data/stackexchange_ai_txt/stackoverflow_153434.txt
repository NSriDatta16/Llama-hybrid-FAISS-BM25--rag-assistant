Crudely, the "We don't want" section has to go. Either you want it to be right, or you want it to stay as it is. There's no point in not creating a class when you need one. "We have plenty" is a bad excuse. Indeed, it is bad to expose all the internal classes, but in my experience, creating a class per concept (i.e. a User, an ID, a Database concept...) always helps. Next to that, isn't a Facade pattern something to solve the existence of loads of BizRules classes, hidden behind one well-organized and clean interface?
