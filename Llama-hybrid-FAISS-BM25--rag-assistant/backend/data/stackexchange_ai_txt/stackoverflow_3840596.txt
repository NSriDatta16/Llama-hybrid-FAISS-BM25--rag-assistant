From everything I can tell, it's not possible to do what I wanted to do. What's worse, I decided to use cookies instead of session variables, thinking that since cookies are created and maintained by the client and based on the domain, that would work. Unfortunately, somehow when created with C#/ASP.NET even cookies can't be shared. So I had to use C# to insert Javascript to create cookies so I could do what I wanted. End result is an inelegant solution to what should be a simple problem (IMHO).
