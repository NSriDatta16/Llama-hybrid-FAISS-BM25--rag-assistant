Is the following a good method for determining learning rate in a neural network?

Start with a default Learning rate of 0.1 Run the gradient descents normally. If the cost function ever gives a higher value than the previous iteration, divide the learning rate by 10. Repeat steps 1-3 until the learning rate becomes $10^{-6}$ .
