The Huawei U8120 (Vodafone 845) phone is one of those USB devices that present themselves as USB storage devices to the host operating system to serve up files for Windows driver installation. To switch them into the USB slave from Linux mode you need to use usb_modeswitch. You can download the latest usb_modeswitch package from the homepage, it includes support for your device. Or just use this call on the command line: $ sudo usb_modeswitch -v 0x12d1 -p 0x1031 -s 20 -M "55534243123456780600000080000601000000000000000000000000000000" However to use it with the Android tools you need to solve another problem, because the Huawei U8120 (Vodafone 845) provides no serial number. There might be other workarounds, but the one that made it work for me is a patch for the "adb" utility that can cope with devices that have no serial number. $ ./tools/adb devices List of devices attached noserial-/dev/bus/usb/001/036 device The patch is here: https://review.source.android.com/#change,13552 and here you can find an "adb" binary if you trust that source :) www.mediafire.com/?oizmyyw0wwz see also http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=4365
