How to interpret incidence rate ratio?

I ran a negative binomial model and then decided to also calculate incidence rate ratio but I am not sure if I understand the ratios correctly. My dependent variable is the number of individuals who joined X organizations per city. My main independent variable is the percentage of educated individuals per city. I got a 1.93 for my main independent variable. Does it mean that a one percent increase in the percentage of educated people per county will result in 1.93 increase in the number of people who joined the X organization?
