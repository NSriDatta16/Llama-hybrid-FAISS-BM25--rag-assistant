Venn diagram as trees

I am faced with the problem of representing a Venn diagram as a tree structure in order to process the information as XML. Do anyone have an elegant way for doing this, or maybe some acute observations? Please note that I am not able to handle individual elements in the sets. Diagrams would be illustrating situations equivalent to "There are 20 students in all, of which 5 do sports, 8 play chess and 3 do both".
