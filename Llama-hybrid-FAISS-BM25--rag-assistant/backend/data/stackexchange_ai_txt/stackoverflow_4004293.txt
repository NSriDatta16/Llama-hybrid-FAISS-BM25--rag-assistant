mod_rewrite on fasthosts

I've installed Wordpress here http://www.trsmithroofing.co.uk/flat_roof_blog and I've noticed that URL re-writes are working nicely. Here's an example of one. http://trsmithroofing.co.uk/flat_roof_blog/index.php/2010/10/single-garage-flat-roof/ Knowing this works, I'm wondering why I cannot get re-writes to work on the same server... I have a simple rule which I can get working on my local host, but when I try it out 'live' it doesn't work... Here's the rule I've got Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine on RewriteRule retest-choice-(.*)\.htm$ retest.php?choice=$1 On a localhost I can navigate to retest-choice-1.htm and it will correctly request retest.php?choice=1 It just won't work on the fasthosts account. I've been struggling with this for a long time, but now I know Wordpress has managed to get it working, I'm asking if anyone can explain how so that I can use the same method. Thanks in advance, you guys on Stack overflow have yet to fail me. Shane
