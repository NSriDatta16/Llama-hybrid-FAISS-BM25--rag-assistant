You might benefit from random forests instead which aim to achieve the same objectives you are aiming for, i.e better generalization through pruning to remove overfitting. scikit learn's random forest algorithm will let you specify how many or what proportion of variables you want to automatically drop across the many trees whose results will be averaged for even better generalization performance.
