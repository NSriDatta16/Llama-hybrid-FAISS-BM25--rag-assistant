Disclaimer: This idea might be foolish & I'm not going to pretend to understand the theoretical implications of what I'm proposing. " Suggestion " : Why don't you simply impute 100 (I know you normally do 5) datasets, run the lme4 or nmle, get the confidence intervals (you have 100 of them) and then: Using a small interval width (say range / 1000 or something), test over the range of possible values of each parameter and include only those small intervals which appear in at least 95 of the 100 CIs. You would then have a Monte Carlo "average" of your confidence intervals. I'm sure there are issues (or perhaps theoretical problems) with this approach. For instance, you could end up with a set of disjoint intervals. This may or may not be a bad thing depending on your field. Note that this is only possible if you have at least two completely non-overlapping confidence intervals which are separated by a region with less than 95% coverage. You might also consider something closer to the Bayesian treatment of missing data to get a posterior credible region which would certainly be better formed & more theoretically support than my ad-hoc suggestion.
