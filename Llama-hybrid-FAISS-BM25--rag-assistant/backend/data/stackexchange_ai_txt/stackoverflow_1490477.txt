Try DataContractJsonSerializer : Serializes objects to the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and deserializes JSON data to objects. Use the DataContractJsonSerializer class to serialize instances of a type into a JSON document and to deserialize a JSON document into an instance of a type. For example, you can create a type named Person with properties that contain essential data, such as a name and address. You can then create and manipulate an instance of the Person class and write all of its property values in a JSON document for later retrieval. This JSON document can later be deserialized into the Person class or another class with an equivalent data contract.
