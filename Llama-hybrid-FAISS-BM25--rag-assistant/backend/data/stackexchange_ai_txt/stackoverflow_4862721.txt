Note that format strings in F# are specifically designed to take a statically known number of arguments, so there's not a particularly elegant way to do what you want. However, something like this should work: let rec myPrintHelper (fmt:string) : string list -> 'a = function | [] -> sprintf (Printf.StringFormat (fmt)) | s::rest -> myPrintHelper 'a> fmt rest s let myPrint fmt = myPrintHelper fmt myPrint "one: %s two: %s three: %s" ["first"; "second"; "third"] This will throw an exception at runtime if the number of "%s" es in your string doesn't match the number of strings in the list.
