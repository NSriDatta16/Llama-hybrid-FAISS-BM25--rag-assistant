Which modeling technique is appropriate when I have nested/hierarchical data (individual and group) but user inputs will only be at the group level?

I am trying to create a predictive model that will be built on individual data, but user input will only exist at the group level. Reasoning is that I have 5 million rows of data at the individual level, but only 100 companies exist in that data. For example: I want to calculate the % increase in earnings an investment firm earns year over year. My Level 1 data would contain fields such as: Analyst_Id, Company_Name, Age, Earnings_2019, Earnings_2020, Level_of_Education, Company_region, Number_of_Trades I can use this data to calculate characteristics for each Company_Name: Total_Earnings_2019, Average Investor Age, Average number of trades made, and company region. The results should be interpreted at the Company level - ie, a user can input a company's average age, region, and average level of education and the output will be a predicted earnings trend for a company with those characteristics. I've been looking into Multilevel modeling / hierarchical lineal models / nested data structures, but these techniques appear to combine individual & group level variables in the final model, whereas I would be building a model that only has group characteristics. Which modeling techniques would make sense for this scenario? Edit: Alternatively, are there ways that I could synthetically generate more companies from my underlying individual data, so that I could train a model on >100 data points at the group level?
