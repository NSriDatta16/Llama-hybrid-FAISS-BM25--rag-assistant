How does HttpContext.Current work in a multi-threaded environment?

So I'm left wondering how exactly asp.net is able to scope a static property, when (to my knowledge) asp.net is multi-threaded. One theory goes that the ASP.NET guys maintain a different appdomain for every request ... but that doesn't seem feasible. Another theory goes that the .Current method looks at the current Thread, and then uses that to look up the http context in some hashtable (or other static storage mechanism). Either way, it's a technique that seems really useful ... I'd like to utilize it, but definitely don't want to be debugging shared state bugs :-/
