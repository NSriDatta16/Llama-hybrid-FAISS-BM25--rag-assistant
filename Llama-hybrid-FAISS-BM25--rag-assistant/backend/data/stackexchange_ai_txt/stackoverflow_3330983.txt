IronPython: Is there an alternative to significant whitespace?

For rapidly changing business rules, I'm storing IronPython fragments in XML files. So far this has been working out well, but I'm starting to get to the point where I need more that just one-line expressions. The problem is that XML and significant whilespace don't play well together. Before I abandon it for another language, I would like to know if IronPython has an alternative syntax.
