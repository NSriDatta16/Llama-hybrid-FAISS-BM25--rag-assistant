Exporting a Certificate as BASE-64 encoded .cer

I am trying to export a cert without the private key as as BASE-64 encoded file, same as exporting it from windows. When exported from windows I am able to open the .cer file in notepad. When I try the following and open on notepad I get binary data...I think it is...not readable. X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2("c:\\myCert.pfx", "test", X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable); File.WriteAllBytes("c:\\testcer.cer", cert.Export(X509ContentType.Cert)); I tried removing the 'X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable" but that doesn't work. Am I missing something? Edit - I tried File.WriteAllText("c:\\testcer.cer",Convert.ToBase64String(cert.Export(X509ContentType.Cert))) and that seems to work, however, missing the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
