You might be better off doing a string replace first: @html.gsub!(/\r\n?/, "\n"); body = simple_format(@html) This because simple_format only works on \n and \n\n, not \r\n: From the API : Returns text transformed into HTML using simple formatting rules. Two or more consecutive newlines(\n\n) are considered as a paragraph and wrapped in tags. One newline (\n) is considered as a linebreak and a tag is appended. This method does not remove the newlines from the text.
