First off, it depends what your dependent variable (Y) is. If it is numerical then most multiple regression models would be sufficient. If it (Y) is categorical then you need a logistic regression or a similar categorical regression model. As for how to handle independent variables, the numerical ones will fit neatly into almost any regression model. The categorical ones will need to be "factored". I use R. In R, you specify categorical variable "k" in a data frame by running Data.Object[DollarSign]k In other languages/softwares you do it differently. But definitely make sure the categorical data is being treated as such regardless of which software you use. No, there is no magic algorithm or software that lets you wave a magic wand and factors all these for you. This is a common problem, and if you think 40 is bad, consider the problem with 100. As for the "best" regression to run when thrown a data set like yours?...well, it depends on what you/your bosses are looking for. The tricky part for you is interpreting the labels into something meaningful. Say you have a variable "What is your political party?" If 1 is "republican", 2 is "democrat" and 3 is "independent" then you won't have a variable for each. You'll have a variable for "democrat" and "independent" and both values equaling zero would mean "not democrat and not independent". In this case, the regression coefficient of "democrat" will show the change in Y if the individual is a democrat. The coefficient for "independent" would show the change in Y if the person is independent. Most importantly, the base case, for all other coefficients, is a republican. So any interpretations you make for other variables should adjust for that base case. There ARE algorithms to make that adjustment easier, but I don't know any off the top of my head.
