Defence in depth is a good principle. But false security measures are a bad principle. The difference depends on a lot of details. If you're truly confident that any URL over N is invalid, then you may as well reject it. But if it's true, and if the rest of your input validation is correct, then it will get rejected later anyway. So all this check does is potentially, maybe, mitigate the damage caused by some other bug in your code. It's often better to spend your time thinking how to avoid those bugs, than thinking about what N might be. If you do check the length, then it's still best not to rely on this length limit elsewhere in your code. Doing that couples the different checks more tightly together, and makes it harder to change the limit in the next version, if you change the spec and need to accept longer URLs. For example if the length limit becomes an excuse to put URLs on the stack without due care and attention, then you may be setting someone up for a fall.
