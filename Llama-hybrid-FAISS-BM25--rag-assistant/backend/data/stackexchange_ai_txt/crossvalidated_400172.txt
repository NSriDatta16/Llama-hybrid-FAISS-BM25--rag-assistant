This can be achieved with style transfer, a technique in which the application of convolutional neural networks is quiet common. I believe the most relevant paper in this subject is by Gatys et. al. (2015) , which states: The class of Deep Neural Networks that are most powerful in image processing tasks are called Convolutional Neural Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks consist of layers of small computational units that process visual information hierarchically in a feed-forward manner. This post by the TensorFlow team has a great tutorial on how to start with it. There's also this really famous repo with a Torch implementation.
