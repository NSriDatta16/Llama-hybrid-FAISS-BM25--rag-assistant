I have recently used ckeditor and as far as I can see it it is capable of doing everything you need: Templating : No problem, see Templating Image Uploading : Possible. It's described here . Though they use an own (not free) file manager AFAIR. But writing a simple file browser with jquery isn't really a hard task (see jQuery file tree as a simple example). You just need to integrate it with the ckeditor file upload dialog (but all this is described in the docs quite well). Of course you can also spend some money in order to use their file manager and don't worry about integrating your own. Storage : CKEditor creates pure HTML markup. I don't know why there should be a problem storing this markup in your database of choice.
