I'm not a big fan of PHP, however I would suggest that there's little point in wholesale ditching your deployment platform for .Net when all you really need to do is re-architect / refactor your existing PHP application. There is obviously some other unspoken impetus that you haven't detailed in your question, since you imply that your only options are to stay with PHP or move to .Net... Depending on the application, it's requirements and development roadmap, there may be a number of other development options available. It's also difficult to suggest anything concrete when the purpose and integration requirements of the application are unknown. Update Thanks, I appreciate your comments.. as for other unspoken The managers have gotten all excited about .NET for some reason and are suggesting that we need to rebuild in .NET. I am looking for some evidence that there is anything to benefit from doing that or if we should just stick to php. â€“ Tim From the way you worded the original question, this is what I imagined. I'd say that the fanfare around .Net should be taken with a pinch of salt, a lot of $$$ go into marketing .Net and a lot of people eat it up whole. That said, PHP is hardly the poster child for #1 language design and consistency, however, we're talking about the devil YOU know here, and it's a known quantity within your enterprise. However, If the bosses are willing to invest in solid re-training, for you and your team, moving to .Net could be a good thing, particularly for you and your colleagues career development, since, bottom line you will have a more valuable skill set as an experienced C#/.Net developer. I'd suggest pragmatism over fanaticism in either case.
