How should I refer to "external storage" in the UI on Android?

Apparently external storage on Android (referred to by Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory) doesn't have to be an SD card. In fact, it doesn't even have to be external! How can I refer to this storage in the UI? For example, if it is currently not accessible, I want to surface an error to the user. If I say "external storage" or "SD card", I may confuse users of some devices. Is there a way to appropriately identify it?
