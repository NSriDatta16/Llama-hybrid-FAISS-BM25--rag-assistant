Is there a measure or notion of correlation (or association) without assuming finite second order moments?

When we study correlation or association in real data, do we always (implicitly) assume a finite second order moment for any hypothetical population distribution? If we do not assume this, what statistical measure may we use? I am not sure if it makes sense to study correlation (or association in general) without assuming a finite second order moment for a generating probabilistic model. In the generalized version of pearson correlation ( wikipedia general correlation ), the norms in the denominator of the expression should implicitly assume a finite second order moment. I ask this question simply to keep track of what we do and do not assume when we look into association in datasets. I think that association does not make sense without assuming a finite second order moment for any population distribution. However, maybe there is a nonparametric measure that I am not familiar with. Since both Spearman's and Kendall's correlation coefficients can be expressed in the form in 1 , I think this implicit assumption of a finite second order moment applies to these two association measures also. Any insights would be greatly appreciated! This stackexchange question seems relavent: PCA without finite second moment . However, as far as I can tell, it does not definitively answer the question as I understand it.
