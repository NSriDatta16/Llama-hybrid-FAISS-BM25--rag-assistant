Bind the CornerRadius property to the Expander.IsExpanded property and attach an IValueConverter that returns rounded corners when false and straight bottom corners when true. It's not the most elegant, but it will get the job done. The other way to do this, if using MVVM, would be to expose a boolean property and bind it to the Expander.IsExpanded property. Then expose another property for the CornerRadius , which checks the boolean property and returns the appropriate values. This is definitely the "best practice" way to go about this.
