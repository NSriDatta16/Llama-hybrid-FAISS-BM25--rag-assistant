Events For Window Dragging in Java

I'm trying to implement an OS X drawer like feature in Java, and so I'm going to have one window hiding under another. However when I drag the primary window (JFrame) I need to send updates as it moves to the secondary window (JWindow) below. So it'd be something like thisâ€¦ --------------- | |---------- | JFrame | | | | JWidow | | | | | | | | | | | |----------- --------------- That said, ComponentListener in OS X doesn't send constant updates for componentMoved, only when you pause for a second or lift off the mouse. This seems to differ from Win/Linux, so I was wondering if anyone had a different solution. Without completely understanding everything, I was hoping to get and deal with whatever is drawing the window's titlebar (something about the rootpane it seems). I'm not even sure if that is going to be possible to do, but it is the only other solution I can think of to determine when the whole window is being dragged. Any help is appreciated!
