In episodic settings, you can set $\gamma = 1$ , since an episode is certain to terminate in finite time. This generally happens because episodic MDPs have "absorbing states", i.e., states for which the system gets stuck and remains there forever. In other words, an episode terminates when an absorbing state is reached. The optimal value of an absorbing states is a known constant, for example, $v(j) = 0$ , if $j$ in an absorbing state. This acts as a boundary condition in the optimality equations, so that they can be solved.
