Is there a way to identify key points of change in length-frequency (histogram) data through statistical means?

I am performing a length-frequency analysis (read: histogram) of data in fishes. This is a common way in which fish biologists analyze life history data in fishes. An example of the data is as follows. fish_lengths hist(fish_lengths, main="Histogram of Fish Lengths", xlab="Length") A major feature I've noticed in the data is that the fish in general just show up in the study area at a certain size, which is probably due to juvenile fishes migrating out of their spawning grounds once they reach a certain threshold of size. In the above histogram this threshhold is at about ~180. I am trying to figure out a way to explicitly calculate a value for this threshhold statistically, rather than arbitrarily guessing it based on the histogram. The primary issue I am running into is I cannot simply define the size at which these fish leave the spawning grounds as the minimal size recorded in the dataset, as there are a few babies which wander out of the spawning grounds before they can survive on their own and thus get caught and recorded in the dataset (i.e., the few individuals recorded That is, in the present dataset just looking at the data this value would seem to be about 175-181, given that is when the abundance of individual suddenly spikes, but how can I demonstrate this more rigorously? Something similar that I have seen done in other analyses of fishes is calculating the median length at sexual maturity using a logistic analysis. That is, recording whether each fish is mature or immature and then calculating a median age-at-maturity using a logistic regression. However, this is something that requires data of individuals on both sizes of the critical threshold, it doesn't seem to have a way to calculate this value if you only have individuals on one side of the threshold (i.e., individuals at spawning grounds/in open water). Is there any way to statistically model at what length this key shift happens given there seems to be a clear point at which individuals just show up in the study area (minus the few small stragglers)?
