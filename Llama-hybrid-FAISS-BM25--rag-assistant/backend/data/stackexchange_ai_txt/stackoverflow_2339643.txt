I do a file->Load Java Program , file->Reset every compile to avoid exiting the simulator. A real device will have to reboot as well. edit 02/28/10 from The BlackBerry Developer After experimenting quite a bit, and posting a few questions, Mark Sohm from RIM (BlackBerry Developer Journal) has filled us in on the conditions that an application update forces a restart: The application is running or the library is in use. The application has any open resources (ie: a library could be holding onto something). The application has an active listener registered with the system. The application has added menu items to any BlackBerry applications. It is an auto start application. The application is listening for incoming IO connections (this would also fall under the "application is running" reason). The application makes use of persistent storage and/or backup/restore features.
