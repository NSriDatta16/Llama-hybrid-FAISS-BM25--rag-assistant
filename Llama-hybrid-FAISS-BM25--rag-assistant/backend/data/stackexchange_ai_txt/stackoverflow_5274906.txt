JSON result is an stdObject but how to traverse it?

I have my data in a variable which when output looks something like this object(stdClass)#1 (20) { ["Link"]=> object(stdClass)#2 (2) { ["Text"]=> string(30) "A.Ilkley Moor Medical Practice" ["Uri"]=> string(87) "http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/gppractices/25599?apikey=LDVVTHBM" } ["Address"]=> object(stdClass)#3 (6) { ["Line1"]=> string(28) "Ilkley Moor Medical Practice" ["Line2"]=> string(17) "The Health Centre" ["Line3"]=> string(12) "Springs Lane" ["Line4"]=> string(6) "Ilkley" ["Line5"]=> string(0) "" ["Postcode"]=> string(7) "LS298TH" } Question is how do I get to each individual element. I have tried converting the object to an array but is this necessary?
