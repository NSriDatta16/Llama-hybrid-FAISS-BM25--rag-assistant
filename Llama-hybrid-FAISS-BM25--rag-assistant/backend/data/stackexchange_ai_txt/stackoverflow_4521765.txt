One approach would be to create a CAShapeLayer to use as your mask—you'd have a fair bit of work cut out for you making a version of your “sync” icon with Bézier paths, but shape layers incur a much lower performance cost per-transformation than bitmap ones. Unfortunately, you can't be sure that the rotation is where the performance issue is coming from—it could very well be the masking causing most of the lag, in which case you'll have done all that vectorizing for little benefit. I think the best solution is to use UIImage 's animation capabilities: create a filmstrip of every frame of the icon-rotation animation and simply display that animated UIImage in your tab bar. It's not the most elegant solution, but a number of animations across the system—the Mail and Notes trash-can “delete” icon and the various forms of activity indicator, for instance—are implemented the same way.
