Taking a WAG (wild-ass guess) here. Haven't cobol'd since my last year of college. Your error message says, at the bottom, STATISTICS: HIGHEST SEVERITY CODE=S, PROGRAM UNIT=1 Okay, so I figure you have some warnings (possibly CODE=W), and one or more errors that are actually causing your program to fail. So, scanning the error message, I see lots of W-s, and one line with an S: C:\FSC\PCOBOL32\samples\SAMPLE6\SAMPLE7.COB 7: JMN1104I-S PROGRAM-ID PARAGRAPH IS MISSING. PROGRAM-NAME GENERATED BY SYSTEM. So it seems you're missing your Program-ID paragraph. Looking at your program, I do see a n identification division, which has a program-id. I can conclude four things from this: 1) Your identification division paragraph is malformed 2) As Neil said, you aren't running your snippet, but a sample that does not have an ID paragraph. Open sample7.cob and see 3) Some other issue is causing the error, but it is being hidden or misinterpreted as an ID paragraph error
