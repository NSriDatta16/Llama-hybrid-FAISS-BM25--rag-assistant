do-while condition without declaring a separate variable

I have a do-while loop inside a function that resembles something like this: do { // a bunch of stuff if (something other stuff) { if (something != other stuff) { return false; } else { return true; } } } while (condition); My issue here is with the condition at the end. The only way I can thing of to keep track of this would be to declare a boolean variable before the loop, and have it's value set to match the return value and have the while() check for that after each iteration. While this would work, it's seems rather inelegant to me and I was wondering if there was a way I could have the while() tap into the return value instead.
