You could also look into Prism . From what I understand, they are two different frameworks to do pretty much the same thing. Prism allows you to create modules by having a class in a dll that implements the IModule interface. You can just drag and drop dlls into a folder this way just like in MEF. You can statically or dynamically load modules, and do a bunch of other things I don't even know about. Prism also has other features bundled with it, i.e. the Unity dependency injection container (which I like to call "The Magical Black Box"), a neat event and command system, etc. I'm sure MEF has all these things too.
