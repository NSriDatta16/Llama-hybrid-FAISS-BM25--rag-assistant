Arranging Nodes in A JTree

I have a JTree in which the user can drag/drop or re-arrange nodes, upon saving I have to re-arrange the nodes such that File type nodes must appear before Folder type nodes. I don't need to sort the files/folders name. User Tree: -FolderA +FFA1 -FA1 -FA2 -FolderB -FB1 -File1 -File2 +FolderC -File3 Resulting Tree: -File1 -File2 -File3 -FolderA -FA1 -FA2 +FAF1 -FolderB -FB1 +FolderC I have the following codes below, it worked but I don't know if it is the proper way or the good practice perhaps. Can you suggest which of the 2 solutions is better, or can you suggest other way. Thanks you very much. Solution 1: private void arrange(DefaultMutableTreeNode parent){ DefaultMutableTreeNode sorted = new DefaultMutableTreeNode(); List files = new ArrayList (); List folders = new ArrayList (); for (int i = 0; i 0) parent.add((DefaultMutableTreeNode) sorted.getChildAt(0)); sorted = null; files = null; folders = null; } Solution 2: private void arrange(DefaultMutableTreeNode parent){ DefaultMutableTreeNode sorted = new DefaultMutableTreeNode(); List nodes = new ArrayList (); for (int i = 0; i 0) parent.add((DefaultMutableTreeNode) sorted.getChildAt(0)); sorted = null; nodes = null; }
