Can webrat browser-automation tests be parallelised?

Is there a facility similar to SeleniumGrid that I can use to run webrat (or other, similar framework) browser automation tests in parallel across a farm of coordinated agents? Coordinated via TeamCity with rake? Edit: We're looking at using cucumber+webrat to do functional and acceptance testing as described in Testing ASP.NET Web Applications
