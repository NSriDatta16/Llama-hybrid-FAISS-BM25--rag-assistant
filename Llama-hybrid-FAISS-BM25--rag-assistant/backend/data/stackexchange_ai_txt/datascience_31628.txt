What values should I choose for P and Q?

I am trying to forecast energy data generated by LoadProfileGenerater . This data is generated every half hour for 2 years. I am following this tutorial . I have checked it for stationarity using Dickey Fuller Test Results of Dickey-Fuller Test: Test Statistic -1.684705e+01 p-value 1.126331e-29 #Lags Used 5.200000e+01 Number of Observations Used 3.503500e+04 Critical Value (5%) -2.861623e+00 Critical Value (1%) -3.430537e+00 Critical Value (10%) -2.566814e+00 Results indicate that the time series is very close to stationarity ( Test Statistic ). I have therefore used ARMA for forecasting. However I am not being able to determine the values of p and q . Both, PACF and ACF charts indicate intersection with the upper confidence line at 0.01 . What values for p and q should I use? EDIT 1: I tried differencing as suggested in the comments. Rolling mean has dropped to nearly 0 but rolling std has increased to 0.75. ACF and PACF have generated similar charts as without differencing.
