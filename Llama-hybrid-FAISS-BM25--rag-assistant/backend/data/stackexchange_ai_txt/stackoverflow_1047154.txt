Java Webstart Options

I am using javaws to run an application in OS X 10.5.7, Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_13-b03-211), and it seems that the command line arugments are broken in os X. I run the following command in linux and it works fine. javaws -wait -J"-Djavaws.package.runtype=debug" http://company.com/launch.jnlp and the runtime gives me the property javaws.package.runtype=debug. But when I run the same arugment in os X, I get jnlpx.vmargs = -Djavaws.package.runtype=debug Is this an error, or just an unknown feature?
