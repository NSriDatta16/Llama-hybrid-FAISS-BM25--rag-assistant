How to show only one result from each type in a mysql array php

I have a php array to display information from a database. I want to be able to show items like this ex. Space Quest (3) The '(3)' represents the number of times found in the database. Right now it is pulling the info and listing the results as many times as shows in the database like this ex. Space Quest Space Quest Space Quest which link to the individual stories. Here is my code: No stories are posted for this category yet. "; } else { while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) { $title = $row['Title']; $result2 = mysqli_num_rows($result); echo " "; echo "&nbsp;&nbsp; (" . $result2 . ")"; echo " "; echo "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"; } } ?> This code shows all the items that come from type, but I want to organize the results to show the items only once but then the number of stories in each category.
