A good try would be to reverse your jar file into a class diagram. I have found this tutorial which explain how to reverse project composed by jar files into UML class diagram: http://www.ejb3.org/jar_file_reverse/jar_file_reverse.html You will be able to reverse at package level at see package relation but also to see clases from one package having relation to other packages. Once the project has been reversed you can reorganize it as a model and give this documentation to the implementation team.
