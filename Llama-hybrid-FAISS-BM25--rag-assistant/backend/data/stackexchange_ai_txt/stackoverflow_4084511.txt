Not the most elegant solution, but you could always stagger the release of the different button types. Eg, show the 'no count' button initially, then display the 'horiztonal count' say, a week from the publication date. (i'm making the assumption you're running some type of blog) Again, not great, but it partially solves your problem - you'll display the 'zero tweets' button less often. Regards Luke
