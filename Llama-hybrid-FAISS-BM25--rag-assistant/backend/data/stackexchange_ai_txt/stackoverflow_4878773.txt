Match dataframe rows according to two variables (Indexing)

I am essentially trying to get disorganized data into long form for linear modeling. I have 2 data.frames "rec" and "book" Each row in "book" needs to be pasted onto the end of several of the rows of "rec" according to two variables in the row: "MRN" and "COURSE" which match. I have tried the following and variations thereon to no avail: i=1 newlist=list() colnames(newlist)=colnames(book) for ( i in 1:dim(rec)[1]) { mrn=as.numeric(as.vector(rec$MRN[i])); course=as.character(rec$COURSE[i]); get.vector If anyone has any suggestions on 1)getting this to work 2) making it more elegant (or perhaps just less clumsy) If I have been unclear in any way I beg your pardons. I do understand I haven't combined any data above, I think if I can generate a long-format data.frame I can combine them all on my own
