Is there a practical example on how to define the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) in Bayesian estimation?

I've been reading up on Bayesian estimation and see the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) as a potentially very useful concept. It seems to be analogous to the rejection region in classical hypothesis testing. Is there a practical example(s) (preferably in R) that walks you on how we select the ROPE for a particular user case?
