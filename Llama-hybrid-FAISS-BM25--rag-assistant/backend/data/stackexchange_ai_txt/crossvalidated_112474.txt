How do I combine multiple time series models to create a generalizable predictive model?

I have several time series that are each observations of the same phenomenon, for example: Observation 1: 10, 25, 36, 72, 80, .... Observation 2: 32, 46, 78, 90, 100, .... Observation 3: 12, 27, 34, 75, 36, ... .... Observation 100: 7, 33, 45, 56, 32, ... Each of my measurements within each observation are taken at equivalent periods of time. I can use a variety of methods to fit curves to my time series and predict performance for each individual series. However, how do I then combine these curves to create a generalizable model that takes into account all 100 observations?
