building embeddings for Phrases from scratch

I have a datadet with many phrases which I would like to embed them from scratch. I dont want the cosine of the words in order to get a phrase embedding, this is because the phrases may appear in a different enviroment and I want to embed the two words together, or the tree words together in their own envoroment. Is this possible? If yes how exactly? Thank You in advance.
