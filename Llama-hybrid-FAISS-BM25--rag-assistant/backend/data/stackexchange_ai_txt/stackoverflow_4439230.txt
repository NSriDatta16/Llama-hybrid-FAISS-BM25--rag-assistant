I'm not sure why you need a loop if there is a break statement at the end of the loop. Arent you just iterating once, no matter the situation? Anyway, you'll usually find two differing opinions concerning this on SO, one being that break statements shouldn't be used at all, and one being that it depends on the situation. I tend to fall in with the latter group, but the way that your loop works uses superfluous break statements. I'd much rather structure such a loop like this: bool valid = true; for(... ; .... && valid == true ; ....) { if (!condition1) valid = false; if (!condition2) valid = false; if (!condition3) valid = false; } This allows a loop exit that I think is more elegant.
