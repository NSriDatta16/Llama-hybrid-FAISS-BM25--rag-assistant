To get the posterior predictive distribution, you would need to calculate the integral $$ \int p(y_{rep} \mid \theta) \cdot p(\theta \mid y) \, \textrm{d}\theta $$ Notice that the code snipped from your first link does, it draws samples for the particular values of $\theta = (\alpha, \beta, \sigma)$ . The example uses MCMC for Monte Carlo integration , i.e. instead of calculating the integral directly, you sample from the distribution and average over the samples. generated quantities { array[N] real y_rep = normal_rng(alpha + beta * x, sigma); } You need many samples because you approximate the distribution with the empirical distribution of the Monte Carlo samples.
