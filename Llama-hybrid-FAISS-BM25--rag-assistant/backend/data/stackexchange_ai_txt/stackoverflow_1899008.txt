Weights from linear SVM model (in R)?

Using kernlab I've trained a model with code like the following: my.model Since it's a linear model, I prefer at run-time to compute the scores as a simple weighted sum of the feature values rather than using the full SVM machinery. How can I convert the model to something like this (some made-up weights here): > c(.bias=-2.7, f1=0.35, f2=-0.24, f3=2.31) .bias f1 f2 f3 -2.70 0.35 -0.24 2.31 where .bias is the bias term and the rest are feature weights? EDIT: Here's some example data. gold
