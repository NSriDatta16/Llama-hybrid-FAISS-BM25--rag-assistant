is scaling in SVM always necessary?

I've already read some posts here about SVM scaling and why it is so important. Now I'm wondering if scaling in the ksvm function is always necessary if my data are already normalized. I have a RPKM dataset, already normalized with the log2 function: miRNA on columns (features) samples on rows (tumoral vs normal samples), a very small dataset (22 samples, 11 normal and 11 tumoral). For some features, the value is unvarying for the majority of samples selected (I'm performing a cv-10), so I get a warning from the SVM function saying that scaling is not possible, I think that could be a variance problem, but if I set scaled=FALSE I can fix the warning. Do I need do scaling anyway?
