Fastest way to parse XML files in C#?

I have to load many XML files from internet. But for testing with better speed i downloaded all of them (more than 500 files) of the following format. 36 Adam Gilchrist Australia Gilchrist A Gilchrist Nov 14, 1971 Left-hand bat Right-arm offbreak Wicket-Keeper Western Australia, New South Wales, ICC World XI, Deccan Chargers, Australia Deccan Chargers ODI 287 279 11 9619 172 9922 149 1000+ 0 55 417 55 16 96.95 35.89 . . . . . . . . . ODI 378 58 64 3 0 0 19.33 6.62 21.33 . . . . . . . . . I am using XmlNodeList list = _document.SelectNodes("/player-profile/batting-statistics/odi-stats"); And then loop this list with foreach as foreach (XmlNode stats in list) { _btMatchType = GetInnerString(stats, "matchtype"); //it returns null string if node not availible . . . . _btAvg = Convert.ToDouble(stats["average"].InnerText); } Even i am loading all files offline, parsing is very slow Is there any good faster way to parse them? Or is it problem with SQL? I am saving all extracted data from XML to database using DataSets, TableAdapters with insert command. EDIT: Now for using XmlReader please give some code of XmlReader for above document. for now, i have done this void Load(string url) { _reader = XmlReader.Create(url); while (_reader.Read()) { } } Availible Methods for XmlReader are confusing. What i need is to get batting and bowling stats completly, batting and bowling stats are different, while odi,t2o,ipl etc are same inside bowling and batting.
