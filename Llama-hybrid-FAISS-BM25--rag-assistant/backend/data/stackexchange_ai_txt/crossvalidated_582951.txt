Forecasting avg. flight occupancy

I have about 15 month time series data of average flight occupancy. I wish to forecast how the average flight occupancy would look like 1 year from now. There are alot of work done on this it seems (Example: https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/Latest-air-traffic-forecasts-illustrate-encouraging-recovery-and-higher-growth-in-global-air-travel.aspx ) How can I approach this? can I assume what happen in past to repeat in future as well, basically past average occupancy to repeat? how the recovery of market can be taken into account? how leap year to be taken into account? given this mean 366 days instead of 365? How can we take into account special days like Christmas where people travel more? Any pointers?
