Does the iPhone compress images saved within my app's documents directory?

We are caching images downloaded from our server. We get the data from an ASIHTTPRequest callback like this: #pragma mark ASIHTTPRequest callback -(void)imageDownloadFinished:(ASIHTTPRequest*)aRequest { NSString* fileName = aRequest.url.path.lastPathComponent; [self imageDidArrive:[aRequest responseData] forFileName:fileName]; } We write the image data to our local storage like this: NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSCachesDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0] ; NSString* folder = [[documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"flook.images"] retain]; NSString* fileName = [folder stringByAppendingFormat:@"/%@", aBaseFilename]; BOOL writeSuccess = [anImageData writeToFile:fileName atomically:NO]; The downloaded images are always the expected size, around 45-85KB. Later, we read images from our cache like this: NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSCachesDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES); NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0] ; NSString* folder = [[documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"flook.images"] retain]; NSString* fileName = [folder stringByAppendingFormat:@"/%@", aBaseFilename]; image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:fileName]; Occasionally, the images returned from this cache read are much smaller because they are much more compressed - around 5-10KB. Has the OS done this to us? Edit - it turns out that we are downloading the small images, so the issue isn't on the iPhone
