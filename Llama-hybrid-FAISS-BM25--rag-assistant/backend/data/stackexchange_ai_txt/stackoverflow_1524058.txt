Explanation about Annotations

Can anyone please explain what the following two paragraphs mean, in simple english? (Taken from http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-cwt08025.html ) "Annotations are more flexible in terms of how you use them, with options for whether the annotation information is to be included in class files output by the compiler and made available to the application at run time" Not sure what these means. Can Annotations be configured to optionally change the bytecode? While annotations are ideal for metadata that relates to a particular component, they are not well suited to metadata with cross-component application. IMHO most web applications would be cross-component ones. What is the author trying to say here?
