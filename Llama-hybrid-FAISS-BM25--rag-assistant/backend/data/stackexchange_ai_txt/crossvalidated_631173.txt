The discretization of a continuous markov chain, is still a markov chain?

So I'm reading the Guihenneuc-Jouyaux & Robert paper from 1998 about discretization of Markov Chains in which they claim that a naive discretization of a continuous Markov chain is not usually a Markov chain. I can't find a way to prove it, and i just need the proof that a naive discretization does not lead to a Markov chain. Does anyone know how to?
