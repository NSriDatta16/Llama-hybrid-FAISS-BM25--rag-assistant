Classification and regression on same deep learning models?

Suppose I have a dataset of photos of people's faces. One face per image. What does the output vector for a single sample look like, and how do I train the network if I want it to: predict the age (in days) of the person in the image classify the person's gender classify country of origin (say, out of only 7 possible options) predict (x,y) coordinates of person's nose within the picture (where each coordinate is a value between 0-1, indicating percentage of the distance from top left corner of the input image)
