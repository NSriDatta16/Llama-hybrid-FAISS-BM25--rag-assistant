In order to draw conclusions from this one building's data on other buildings on the campus, you would need a set of parameters shared between the building you know about and the buildings you want to predict for. For example, if the monitored building is of a male dormitory type , perhaps you can infer something for male dormitories; if the building is at location X, perhaps you can infer something for buildings at or close to location X. You'd need as many as possible of such additional columns to extrapolate knowledge to other buildings. As for visualizing/predicting resource usage of that single building, I suggest you try data mining tool Orange , which I find phenomenal for prototyping machine learning workflows. It also has a time series add-on , which I can't vouch for, but it does seem to have some forecast capabilities . (source: readthedocs.io )
