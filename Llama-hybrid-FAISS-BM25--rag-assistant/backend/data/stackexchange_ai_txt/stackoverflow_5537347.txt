Chain FileReference.save

I'm in the process of creating a mindmap flash app which has to save all images that are imported into a single folder, along with an xml for data storage. While my current app works when not embedded in a HTML, it breaks as soon as it is due to security violations. By clicking a save button, the code loops through the array of images and creates a FileReference for each of them and calls FileReference.save to save the image. As stated in this documentation, each save needs to by triggered by UI interaction: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/405/kb405546.html But it also states a chain of saves can be made by calling them from the same function. However using my images array loop, only the first image gets saved and no popup is being called for subsequent images. My guess is that only one native popup at a time is allowed, but how would I go about doing this? Has anyone tried chaining filereferences before?
