Text mining via N-grams would be perfect for this. It will start by looking at all count frequencies of singletons: a,b,c,d..., then doublets: ab,ac,ad,ae,...,triplets, aab,aac,aad,aae,.... up to what ever you want. If you go above 5-grams the algorithm can appear to hang since there are so many combinations(permutations). This falls in machine learning because the algorithms behind n-gram analysis are statistical and machine learning based, such as spherical k-means clustering.
