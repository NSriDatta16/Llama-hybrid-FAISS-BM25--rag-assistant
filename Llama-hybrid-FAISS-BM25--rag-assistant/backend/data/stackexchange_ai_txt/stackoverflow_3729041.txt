Short of writing your own HTTP client, you're pretty much stuck with WebRequest or WebClient (which leverages WebRequest for its work). A component of our website relies on downloading data from other webpages, and we recently replaced all of the code reliant on WebRequest / HttpWebRequest with our own Socket based code and gained considerable CPU cycles back, but it's a tricky job that will take one dev who is very familiar with HTTP protocol at least a week to complete. Not for the faint of heart.
