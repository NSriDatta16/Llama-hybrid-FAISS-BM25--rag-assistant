There are no disadvantages to setting it as default , as that just matters once you don't set a value to it. If the value becomes NULL, it may have implications on lookup. This is because MySQL looks through files, and skipping fields with a known length is easy, as you just jump across that length. But if a column may contain NULL, then that needs to be checked for before the jump is made. Doesn't take too much time though, so I don't think it matters all that much. The advantage is obviously space saving, but storage is cheap. It's 2009 after all. The fastest way to lookup stuff is to set all columns NOT NULL, and rather use stuff like empty strings and -1 (or even 0, if that doesn't mean something else) for storing 'null' values. It doesn't take THAT much more space, and it's always faster, because the length of the data is guaranteed. Though, if your database is relatively small and doesn't need to filter 800 million rows in 2 milliseconds, then feel free to use NULL values. ;)
