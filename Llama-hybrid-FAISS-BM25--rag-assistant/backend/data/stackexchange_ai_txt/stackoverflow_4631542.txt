Preserving priority of operands in one-liner Xpath 1.0

I can't really formulate it properly, better with example. XML: XSLT: &#xa; The result: someId someClass someClass someId What I need I need that "priority" of attributes remained as stated in my xpath expression. So, if we call @id | @class an expression with two operands, I need that the attributes would be taken not in a document order, but in the order of how two operands were specified in the expression. So, the result should be : someId someId someClass someId @class should be taken only if @id is not present. I know, that it can be done with conditional logic, but I'm really interested in a short solution, because it's common and used as attribute value template . It might be obvious and I am missing The Elegant One. Do note that I'm speaking in terms of XPath 1.0 .
