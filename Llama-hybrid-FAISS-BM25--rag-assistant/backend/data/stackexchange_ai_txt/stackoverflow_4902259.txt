python grep look for a pattern and then a number of lines before

I'm looking to do the equivalent of _grep -B14 MMA I have a URL that I open and it spits out many lines. I want to find the line that has 'MMa' then print the 14th line before it I don't even know where to begin with this. import urllib import urllib2 url = "https://longannoyingurl.com" opts = { 'action': 'Dump+It' } data = urllib.urlencode(opts) req = urllib2.Request(url, data) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) print response.read() # gives the full html output
