AR(2) ACF Derivation

Suppose I have the following AR(2) time series process: $z_t = \delta + \psi_2 z_{t-2} + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t \sim (0, \sigma^2)$ is a white noise process. I am hoping to calculate the ACF function for this process. Here are my thoughts thus far: \begin{align} Cov[z_t, z_{t-k}] &= Cov[\delta + \psi_2 z_{t-2} + \epsilon_t,\ z_{t-k}] \\\\ &= Cov[\delta,\ z_{t-k}] + Cov[\psi_2 z_{t-2},\ z_{t-k}] + Cov[\epsilon_t,\ z_{t-k}] \\\\ &= \psi_2 Cov[z_{t-2},\ z_{t-k}] \\\\ &= \psi_2\gamma(k-2) \\\\ &= \gamma(k) \end{align} Now I know that $\gamma(0) = \sigma^2 \frac{1}{1-\psi_2^2}$ as long as I did my calculations correct. I just found the variance of $z_t$ which is $\gamma(0) = Var[z_t] = \sigma^2 \frac{1}{1-\psi_2^2}$ which I derived by taking the variance of $z_t$ in its $MA(\infty)$ form. Hence, \begin{align} Var[z_t] &= Var\left[\frac{\delta}{1-\psi_{2}} + \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \psi_2^i \epsilon_{t-2i}\right] \\\\ &= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\psi_2^i Var[\epsilon_{t-2i}] \\\\ &= \sigma^2 \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \psi_2^{2i} \\\\ &= \frac{\sigma^2}{1-\psi_2^2} \end{align} So $\gamma(k)$ would then be $\sigma^2 \frac{\psi_2^k}{1-\psi_2^2}$ which can be deduced since we already know $\gamma(0)$ . Then to find $\rho(k)$ , which is the ACF, we do the following: \begin{align} \frac{\gamma(k)}{\gamma(0)} = \psi_2^k = \rho(k) \end{align} Is this correct or am I totally jacking something up somewhere along the way?
