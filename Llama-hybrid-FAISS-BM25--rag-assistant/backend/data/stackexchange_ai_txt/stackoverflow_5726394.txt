I Would do it this way for a normal list not sure about observable collection : List employees = new List { new Employee{age = 12}, new Employee{age = 14}}; Func , int> func2 = (b) => GetAverageAge(b); private static int GetAverageAge(List employees) { return employees.Select(employee => employee.age).Average; //Thats quicker i guess :) }
