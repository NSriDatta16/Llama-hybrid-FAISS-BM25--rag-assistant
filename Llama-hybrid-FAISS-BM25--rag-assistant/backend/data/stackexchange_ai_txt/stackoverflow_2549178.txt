linq-to-sql combine child expressions

I need to create and combine several expressions for child entity into one to use it on "Any" operator of a parent. Code now looks like this: Expresion startDateExpression; if(String.IsNullOrEmpty(startDate) startDateExpression = t => true; else startDateExpression = t => t.start_date >= startDate; Expression endDateExpression; if(String.IsNullOrEmpty(endDate) endDateExpression = t => true; else endDateExpression = t => t => t.end_date > Combined = Expression.Lambda >( Expression.AndAlso(startDateExpression.Body, endDateExpression.Body), param); //but now I am trying to use combined expression on parent //this line fails just to give an idea on what I am trying to do: //filter type is IQueryable ; var filter = filter.Where(p =>p.Children.Any(Combined)); How can I do that? Is there better(more elegant way way of doing it? Maybe I should convert child expression into parent expression?
