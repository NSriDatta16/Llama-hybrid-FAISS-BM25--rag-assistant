Eclipse wont let my app run

I'm trying to install the app I making on my phone. But I keep getting an error Installation error: INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES I'm using Eclipse. I've never seen this problem before. I have run my app on my phone hundreds of times. No apparent errors exist in any files of my project. I edited the Manifest file upping the version, but it didnt work. I cleaned my project. I uninstalled the current version of my app from my phone. But none of this works. I have absolutely no idea what the problem is. The LogCat claims it is a problem with my main.xml file. ERROR/PackageParser(956): Package ##MY PACKAGE NAME has no certificates at entry res/layout/main.xml; ignoring! I havent touched this file so I dont know what could be the problem. UPDATE: Things got more confusing. Before the problem occured I drag-n-dropped a few png files into the drawable folder (where there are already a few). After pulling my hair out it dawned on me the problem might be these files. I deleted them all (5 in total) and it works now. Only problem is I dont know why they screwed up installation.
