Cross-validation gives a measure of out-of-sample accuracy by averaging over several random partitions of the data into training and test samples. It is often used for parameter tuning by doing cross-validation for several (or many) possible values of a parameter and choosing the parameter value that gives the lowest cross-validation average error. So the process itself doesn't give you a model or parameter estimates, but you can use it to help choose between alternatives.
