If you are willing to assume that $Y$ has a symmetric distribution within the two groups, then the medians of the two groups (i.e., $q_{21}$ and $q_{22}$) could be used in place of the means. Furthermore, if you are willing to assume that $Y$ is normally distributed within the two groups, then you could make use of the relationship between the IQR and the SD for the normal distribution, namely, $SD \approx IQR / 1.35$. So, you can compute the two IQRs with $IQR_1 = q_{31} - q_{11}$ and $IQR_2 = q_{32} - q_{12}$, transform them to SDs, pool those two SDs in the usual manner, and then you have all of the pieces to compute the standardized mean difference. Example: For your example data, this would be $$IQR_1 = 174 - 58 = 116$$ $$IQR_2 = 158 - 31 = 127,$$ so $$SD_1 = 116 / 1.35 = 85.93$$ $$SD_2 = 127 / 1.35 = 94.07.$$ Therefore, $$SD_p = \sqrt{\frac{(80-1)85.93^2 + (46-1)94.07^2}{80+46-2}} = 88.97.$$ And finally: $$d = \frac{85-79}{88.97} = 0.07$$ Now you could use the usual equation to estimate the sampling variance of $d$ (Hedges & Olkin, 1985): $$v = \frac{1}{80} + \frac{1}{46} + \frac{0.07^2}{2(80+46)} = 0.034.$$ Remarks: Under normality, $d$ should be an okay estimator of the true SMD. However, the use of medians in place of means and the estimation of the SDs via the IQRs involves a loss of precision. The usual equation for the sampling variance of $d$ does not reflect that, so it yields values that are probably too small (on average). Also, the appropriateness of this method hinges on the symmetry/normality assumption. Unfortunately, authors typically choose to report medians and IQRs whenever they suspect that $Y$ has a non-normal/symmetric distribution. So, I would regard this method only as a rough approximation. References: Hedges, L. V., & Olkin, I. (1985). Statistical methods for meta-analysis. Orlando: Academic Press.
