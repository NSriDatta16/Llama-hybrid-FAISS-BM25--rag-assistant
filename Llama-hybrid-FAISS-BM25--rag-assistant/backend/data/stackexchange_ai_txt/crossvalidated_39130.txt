The answer to your question is given by the mapping at the bottom of Page 6 of the original Laplacian Eigenmaps paper (Belkin & Niyogi, 2003): $x_i \rightarrow (f_1(i), \dots, f_m(i))$ So for instance, the embedding of a point $x_5$ in, say, the top 2 "components" is given by $(f_1(5), f_2(5))$ where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to the two smallest non-zero eigenvalues from the generalized eigenvalue problem $L f = \lambda D f$ . Note that unlike in PCA, it is not straightforward to obtain an out-of-sample embedding. In other words, you can obtain the embedding of a point that was already considered when computing $L$ , but not (easily) if it is a new point. If you're interested in doing the latter, look up Out-of-Sample Extensions for LLE, Isomap, MDS, Eigenmaps, and Spectral Clustering (Bengio et al., 2003) .
