Error : Could not find HelloAndroid.apk

I am very new to Android development. I followed every steps from developer.com to install ADK. Now my issue is, when I tried to run HelloAndroid application, I get an error as I mentioned in the title. I hav JRE1.6 installed. Is tat enuf? Because I read tat ether jdk or jre is ok. I am clearly blank about the concept of this apk error. And I am using Eclipse Ganymede. Kindly give a solution for my issue. Thank You. :)
