Can statistics based on crude units of measure be improved?

I'm collecting online recipes in order to calculate average ingredient proportions for, say crepes or pastry. Most volume based units of measure in english recipes (cups, tablespoons, teaspoons) differ from country to country and sometimes differ within the same country depending on whether traditional, metric or government standardised units are used. I have used my own guesses to convert from these units to milliliters. So, for example, if it is unclear exactly which cup measure is indicated, I use a metric cup (250ml). I wonder if there are tools that can be used to infer the most likely conversion for these crude units given that a percentage of the data is recorded using more accurate units (grams, milliliters). Or, failing that, to account for the uncertainty in some way (larger confidence intervals?). Update: I see that some questions have comments asking what the stats are used for. In case it is helpful, I'm using them to answer questions like "How do crepes differ from Swedish pancakes?" and "How do English recipes for crepes differ from French recipes?". For example...
