Table-Valued Functions in Entity Framework?

Is it possible to call a Table-Valued Function (TVF) using Entity Framework? I have three TVFs defined in my database, and they do not show up in the Entity Framework's model, or in the "Update Model from Database" wizard. It's easily possible to do this in Linq-to-SQL, you simply drag the TVF onto the design surface, but in L2E it doesn't seem like it's possible. So far I haven't found anything that even mentions TVFs and Entity Framework together.
