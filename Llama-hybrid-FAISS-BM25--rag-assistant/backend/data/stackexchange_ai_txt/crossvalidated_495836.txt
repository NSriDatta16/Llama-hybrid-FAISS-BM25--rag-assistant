How can I handle null or missing values in a Naive Bayes classifer where all the predictor variables are categorical nominal

My data set has: 20 categorical nominal predictor variables, each variable has on average 5 distinct possible values 1 dependent binary class variable to be predicted by the Naive Bayes classifier 8000 rows/observations For one specific categorical nominal predictor variable about half (4000) of the rows/observations have a null/missing/NA value. I will refer to these as NA values. Is it valid to include the NA values in the training of the classifier model? If I omit all rows/observations which have a NA value in that single variable I will lose half my training data. If I omit that single variable from all rows/observations I will lose some useful training information. Intuitively to me it appears valid to include the NA values, but I am unable to implement a model in R using caret that includes the NA values, so I was wondering if theoretically it is incorrect.
