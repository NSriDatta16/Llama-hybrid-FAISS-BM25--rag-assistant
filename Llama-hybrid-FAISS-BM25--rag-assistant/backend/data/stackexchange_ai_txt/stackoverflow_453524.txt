A number of years ago I was involved in a project to produce a prototype Python module based on a C API. We decided to use SWIG to get us started since none of the people on the project knew the Python C API. Whilst in principle the idea of having some auto generated functions sounded great in reality it caused us more work since we needed to tweak and customize the SWIG generated code to fit our needs. From a PHP perspective I maintain a PHP C extension and don't believe that for your "simple" C function(s) going with SWIG will be of help, writing the code by hand will be easier. It may be worth you getting or reading Extending and Embedding PHP by Sara Golemon.
