Problem when using UIImageView's or UIButton's inside a UIScrollView

I'm using a UIScrollView to hold a varying number of images sized at 80x80, and when a user taps one I want it to launch into a modal view showing it fullscreen etc. The problem I'm having is detecting touches on the images inside the scrollview. I've tried two ways so far, but each one has an issue. I'm posting both ways but I only need an answer to one of them. I have an array of images and loop through it, this is the first method I tried using a UIImageView for each one: for (i=0; i The problem this causes is that after this loop I have to set userInteractionEnabled to NO on the UIScrollView so I can override touchesBegan and detect touches, but doing this of course disables scrolling so the user can only see the first 6 images or so. Is there a way I can re-enable scrolling so to speak? photoScroller.scrollEnabled = YES; has no effect since user interaction has been disabled. ... The second way I tried was using a UIButton for each image, the code for the loop in this case is as follows: for (i=0; i Now this code works almost perfectly, the only problem is that the user can only scroll if they touch in whitespace. Is there a way I can make it so if a user is dragging on the UIButton it will still scroll the UIScrollView?
