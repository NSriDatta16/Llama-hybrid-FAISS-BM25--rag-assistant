I have two thoughts in addition to those in Peter Flom's simple, straightforward, and helpful answer. First, the biologist in me finds the increase in variability with lower temperature to be perhaps even more interesting than the change in average development time. Biological processes would generally be expected to slow down with lower temperature, but that wouldn't necessarily mean greater variance. Don't see the difference in variances just as a problem, see it as an opportunity. Second, do consider the suggestion from Bj√∂rn to treat this as a survival model (time-to-event analysis). Here the time to event would be the time to final development. Kaplan-Meier curves for your 5 temperatures might be quite informative.
