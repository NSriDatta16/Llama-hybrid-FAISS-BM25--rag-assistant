Can you view websites with the iPhone SDK? And do different user-agent strings affect Safari CSS rendering?

I'm trying to figure out some layout issues with Safari Mobile 3.1.1. – I want to know whether or not I can view sites with the SDK before I commit to installing it on my Mac. My other dumb question is… does changing the user-agent string used by desktop Safari have any affect on how it renders CSS? I understood that the UA string just announces which browser version is behind the request.
