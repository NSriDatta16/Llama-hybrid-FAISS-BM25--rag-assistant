Random sequence generator algorithm non informative piror distribution

I want to conduct a Bayesian statistical analysis of a sequence generation phenomenon. The sequences generated contain elements from a known alphabet. Working on that, I have tried to define the prior probability distribution of frequencies of each element of the alphabet without any information about the phenomenon except the alphabet. My intuition is that there is no specific reason that the priors would not be 1/n with n given by the length of the alphabet, because of the "Principle of Insufficient Reason" . But what would be the shape of the frequency probability distribution? More generally I assume the question is equivalent to : If I randomly generate a sequence generator algorithm, that takes as input an alphabet, without any assumptions can I define a prior probability distribution function for the frequency of each element of the alphabet?
