How to synchronize Nokia smartphone with a PC?

I want to develop an application using Qt and deploy it on both Symbian S60 smartphone and PC. I want the instances to synchronize their data when devices connected. I don't care about connection type (USB, Bluetooth, etc.). Does Ovi Suite provide a service for the task? Or could I use some Qt API for that? I know that Ovi can synchronize files between devices, so I could use a file system as a transport, but I'm looking for a more elegant way of doing sync. Thanks!
