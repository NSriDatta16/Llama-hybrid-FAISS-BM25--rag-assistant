A few thoughts: If you're standing by your poster, figures should be big enough that you can point to them without your fingers obscuring the picture. Your poster is a presentation not a paper. Like a PowerPoint presentation, it should cover the highlights, provide fodder for discussion, and a context in which to place your research. What it should not be is a several foot wide copy of your manuscript. I too am a fan of simple design. A neutral background (or white), simple fonts and clean, crisp figures. "Too much text" - when your audience starts reading several paragraphs, or this starts read like a paper and not a simple narrative description, you've gone too far. Keep it to a small number of main figures/tables. I generally try to limit myself to no more than four. These should be memorable depiction's of your research and jumping off points for discussion. Make them count. Consider having printed 8.5x11 copies of your poster, and absolutely bring business cards.
