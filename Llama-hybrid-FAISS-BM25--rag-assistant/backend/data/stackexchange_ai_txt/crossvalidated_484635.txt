After quite a bit of searching - this is the density of a Generalized Inverse Gaussian random variable. There are a number of algorithms for sampling from this distribution. R packages include GIGrvg , ghyp and Runuran . More details can be found in the following papers. Wolfgang Hörmann and Josef Leydold (2013). Generating generalized inverse Gaussian random variates, Statistics and Computing, DOI: 10.1007/s11222-013-9387-3 J. S. Dagpunar (1989).
