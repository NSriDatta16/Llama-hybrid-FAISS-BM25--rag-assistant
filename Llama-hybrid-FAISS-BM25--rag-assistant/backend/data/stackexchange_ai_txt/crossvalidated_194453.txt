Interpreting accuracy results for an ARIMA model fit

I want to know how accurate one ARIMA model is for estimating a second time series. I've built the model: mod1 accuracy(refit) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set -0.8 1.549193 1.2 -69.33333 77.33333 0.8 -0.05 Now I am not sure how to interpret these results. How good is the fit? Is there an accuracy or some measure like that?
