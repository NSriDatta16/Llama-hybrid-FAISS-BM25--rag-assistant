In my limited experience short texts don't make things appreciably harder. Word count data is hopelessly sparse anyway, so vigorous regularisation of some sort is needed anyway. Basically, you've got a document classification problem with really small documents. Since you're already looking at Lingpipe, you may find the book Text Analysis with Lingpipe helpful. It's a work in progress, but the basics of classification are there. For a more introductory exposition, without accompanying software package, there also Manning et al.'s Introduction to Information Retrieval (don't be fooled by the title). Since 'accuracy is important' the precision, recall, and confusion matrix discussions in these texts will be important to understand. You may find that some categories simply cannot be reliably distinguished, a fact which is important to communicate and/or that one of recall and precision is much more important to you than the other, so you'll want to threshold your classifier decisions carefully.
