I'll throw my hat in the ring. I'm a computer scientist with a strong interest in data science. I have experience teaching data science and would like to see this community grow and be successful. When I got started in my studies as a student, I benefitted enormously from being able to ask questions on Usenet; today I see Stack Exchange as a superior format, and I'd like to pay it back by contributing to the success of this site as a place for high-quality information about data science. I have moderation experience (I am a moderator on Computer Science Stack Exchange). I know what's involved and am comfortable with it.
