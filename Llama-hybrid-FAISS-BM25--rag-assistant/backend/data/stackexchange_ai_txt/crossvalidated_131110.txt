To provide the purely abstract mathematical answer, denote $v$ the brain volume and $q$ the IQ index. Use $1$ to index men and $2$ to index women. Let's assume that the following are facts: $$E(v_1) > E(v_2) = \beta E(v_1), 0 0, \;\; \rho(v_2,q_2)>0 \tag{1}$$ Note that while the quoted text talks about "correlation between brain volume and IQ" in general, the supplied image makes a distinction with the two trend-lines (i.e. it shows the correlation for the two subgroups separately). So we consider them separately (which is the correct way to go). Then $$\rho(v_1,q_1) >0 \Rightarrow {\rm Cov}(v_1,q_1)>0 \Rightarrow E(v_1q_1) > E(v_1)E(q_1)$$ $$\Rightarrow \frac {E(v_1q_1)}{E(q_1)} > E(v_1) \tag{2}$$ and $$\rho(v_2,q_2) >0 \Rightarrow {\rm Cov}(v_2,q_2)>0 \Rightarrow E(v_2q_2) > E(v_2)E(q_2)$$ $$\Rightarrow \frac {E(v_2q_2)}{\beta E(q_2)} > E(v_1) \tag{3}$$ Does the above obtained inequalities necessitate $E(q_1) > E(q_2)$?? To check this assume on the contrary that $E(q_1) = E(q_2) = \bar q \tag {4}$ Then it must be the case that $$(2),(4) \Rightarrow \frac {E(v_1q_1)}{\bar q} > E(v_1) \tag{5}$$ and that $$(3),(4) \Rightarrow \frac {E(v_2q_2)}{\beta \bar q} > E(v_1) \tag{6}$$ Well, it certainly can be the case, that inequalities $(5)$ and $(6)$ hold at the same time, and so "equal IQ on average" is perfectly compatible with the initial assumptions that we took as facts. In fact it could very well happen that we could have a higher average IQ from women than for men, for the same set of facts in $(1)$. In other words, the correlation assumptions/facts in $(1)$ do not impose any constraint whatsoever about the relation between average IQ's at all. All possible relation between $E(q_1)$ and $E(q_2)$ may hold, and be compatible with the assumptions in $(1)$.
