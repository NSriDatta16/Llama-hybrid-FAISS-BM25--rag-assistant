More weightage to a categorical feature for an Autoencoder model

I am using autoencoder for anomaly detection. I don't have any labels already and so its unsupervised. If I have categorical variables, I usually one hot encode before giving it to the model. I would like to know if we there is a possibility to give more weights to one particular categorical feature before giving it to the model. Any help is much appreciated!!
