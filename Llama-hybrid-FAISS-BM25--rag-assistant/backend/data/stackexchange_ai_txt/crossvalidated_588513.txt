Reverting differencing for Time Series VAR model component wise?

I have data with seasonality so I used seasonal and then first order differencing to make the series stationary in order to fit VAR model. After the model is fitted on the differenced level I can revert in the usual way using the cumulative sum and the original series. However, I would like also to have the 'components' of the model in the original scale. That is to say, I would like to decompose the fitted result into a constant term and summands from each series on original non-differenced level. Is this possible?
