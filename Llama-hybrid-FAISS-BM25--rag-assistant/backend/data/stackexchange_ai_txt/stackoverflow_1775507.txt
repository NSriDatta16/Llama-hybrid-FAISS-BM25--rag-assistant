Looks like things didn't get cleaned up correctly after running coverage on IIS or a service. Check out HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\Environment in your registry. If Cor_Enable_Profiling and Cor_Profiler are there as keys, you're going to want to delete them. Also, you'll want to delete NCover_Pid, NCover_Admin, COMPLUS_ProfAPI_ProfilerCompatibilitySetting, NCover_Process_Module, and NCover_All if they're there.
