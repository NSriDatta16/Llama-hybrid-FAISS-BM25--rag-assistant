XSL apply templates not working...could be XPath error

All that it outputs is the sex node and the userlevel node. I think it has to do with my Xpath. All i want is to output the information, nothing else Registered Members Registered Members USER ID: NAME: ADDRESS: CITY: COUNTY: POSTCODE: TELEPHONE: MOBILE: EMAIL: mailto: SEX: USERNAME: ACCOUNT TYPE: Normal User Volunteer Organiser Administrator and some of my xml Abbie Hunt Female 108 Access Road Wells Somerset BA5 8GH 01528927616 07085252492 adrock@gmail.com AdRock 269eb625e2f0cf6fae9a29434c12a89f 4 2010-03-26T09:23:50 South West Aidan Harris Male 103 Aiken Street Chichester Sussex PO19 4DS 01905149894 07784467941 ambientexpert@yahoo.co.uk AmbientExpert 8e64214160e9dd14ae2a6d9f700004a6 2 2010-03-26T09:23:50 Van Driver,gas Fitter South Central
