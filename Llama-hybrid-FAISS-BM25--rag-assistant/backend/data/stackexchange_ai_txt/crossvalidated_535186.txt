What statistical test to perform ? How do I compare the feature for two categories?

I have a data set of 200 observations and 24 nominal features , 100 of those observations are for product A and remaining is for product B . I want to check how differently those features attributes towards product A and product B . My initial approach was to run a logistic regression and check the coefficients, but that doesnâ€™t really make any sense since we will be checking for probabilities then . Next I thought maybe check for Anova , but can I really check for example feature 1 of product A vs feature 1 of product B ? What should be the right approach for this ?
