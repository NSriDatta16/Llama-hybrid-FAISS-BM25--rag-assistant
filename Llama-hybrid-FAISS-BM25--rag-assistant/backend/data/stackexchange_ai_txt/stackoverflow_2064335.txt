The first response is correct. If you organize your data into relations, and create one table for each relation, the data will be a lot easier to work with. The background learning you need to do in relational database design will teach you more about this. If you use the Team and Game structure from the response, you can still convert that structure into the kind of structure you imagined in your question. This process is called "crosstabulating" or "pivoting" and it's well documented in the tutorials. While it's easy to move from a relational structure to a crosstabulated one, it's monstruously difficult to go the other way. It's also difficult to compose other queries against crosstabulated data. An example might be finding the highest score scored against each team. If you put your data in a database, sooner or later you are ging to want to do more than one thing with it.
