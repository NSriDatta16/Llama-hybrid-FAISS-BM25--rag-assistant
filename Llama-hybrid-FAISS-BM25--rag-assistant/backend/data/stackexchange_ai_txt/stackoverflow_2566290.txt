HTML: How to create a DIV with only vertical scroll-bars for long paragraphs?

I want to show terms and condition note on my website. I dont want to use text field and also dont want to use my whole page. I just want to display my text in selected area and want to use only vertical scroll-bar to go down and read all text. Currently I am using this code: text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text Two Problems: It is not fixing the width and height and spread until the all text appears. Second it is showing horizontal scroll-bar and I don't want to show it.
