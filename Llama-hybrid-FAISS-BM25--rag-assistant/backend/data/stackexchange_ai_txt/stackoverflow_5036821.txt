You should be able to set up a draggable , and droppable and tap into droppable 's drop event handler, which is fired when an item is dropped: $("#target").droppable({ drop: function() { // Empty the droppable div: $(".message").remove(); } }); Demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/andrewwhitaker/rUgJF/2/ As for doing something similar on load, if you provided your markup it would make providing a solution a little easier (is there a specific element inside the droppable div that you could check for?) Hope that helps.
