Posterior distribution of $\theta x^{\theta - 1}$ with $Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)$ prior

Random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d given $\vartheta = \theta$ and have the following pdf: \begin{equation} p(x|\theta)=\begin{cases} \theta x^{\theta - 1}, & \text{if $0 $\vartheta \sim Gamma(\alpha, \lambda)$ (a) Find posterior $\pi(\theta|x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ (b) Find one-dimensional sufficient statistic (c) Find $\mathbb{E(\vartheta|x_1, \ldots, x_n)}$ Background: I'm self-learning Bayesian statistics from scratch. For (a) I have \begin{equation} \pi(\theta|x_1, \ldots, x_n) \propto \pi(\theta) \Pi_{i=1}^n p(x_i|\theta) \propto \theta^{n + \alpha - 1} e^{-\lambda \theta}\Pi_{i=1}^n x^{(\theta - 1)} \end{equation} However, this doesn't look like the pdf of any distribution I know and I would expect (perhaps mistakenly) $X_i$ s to be conjugate with the Gamma distribution. I also can't find information about any distribution with $\theta x^{\theta - 1}$ probability density function in the distribution tables of any textbook I own so I don't know what information to search for online. Perhaps I've made some basic mistake in calculating the posterior or I'm missing some other fundamental concept?
