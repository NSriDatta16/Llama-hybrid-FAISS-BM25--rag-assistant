A time series is composed of signal and noise. A forecasting method attempts to extract and extrapolate the signal, and discard the noise. (By definition, noise is random and unforecastable, so trying to forecast the noise will make the forecast worse.) The spikes you see may be systematic, as in AR or MA dynamics, in which case they will be modeled and forecasted. Or, more likely, they are noise, in which case they will not be forecasted, and this is correct. A forecast is always smoother than the original series, because the noise has been removed. As to where the ups and downs come from: most likely from seasonal or ARIMA behavior your model has detected. If I fit a straightforward forecast::auto.arima() to your data (which is inappropriate, given the seasonality), I get an ARIMA(1,1,3) model, which does exhibit some dynamics. ARIMA models are not very happy about "long" seasonal cycles. You may want to look at bats or tbats models. Then again, if you have already included Fourier terms, these models will likely not improve matters dramatically. You may want to look at some material on forecasting, e.g., Forecasting: Principles and Practice . Or at How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
