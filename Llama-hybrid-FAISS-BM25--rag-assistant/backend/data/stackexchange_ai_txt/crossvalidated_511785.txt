A correction factor is necessary for linearized power models fitted using OLS. How does it works for a linearized power mixed effects model?

It is common to fit a (non-linear) power model, e.g. Y = a*X^b , through OLS as log(Y) = log(a) + b*log(x) . The prediction on the original scale of Y would be Y = exp(a + b*log(x)) * Correction factor . The correction factor is given as the exp(var[res]/2) , where var[res] is the model residual variance. If one would fit the model log(Y) = log(a) + b*log(x) using the lmer R function, let's say, with random intercepts, how it would work regarding prediction? I mean: Is a correction factor necessary to predict Y on its original scale? I am sorry if this question is silly. I appreciate the attention. All the best.
