Question: "Why are future values found by projecting onto the subspace..." Answer: Because the projection is the conditional expectation of $Y_{t+1}$ given the sigma-field generated by $Y_1,\dots,Y_t$, and it is known in time series analysis that this conditional expectation is, in a specific sense , the best predictor. Here is a sketch of the geometry behind the first claim: Take $Y$ as being $Y_{t+1}$, and $\mathscr{G}=\sigma(Y_1,\dots,Y_t)$.
