By default, caret keeps the components that explain 95% of the variance. But you can change it by using the thresh parameter. # Example preProcess(training, method = "pca", thresh = 0.8) You can also set a particular number of components by setting the pcaComp parameter. # Example preProcess(training, method = "pca", pcaComp = 7) If you use both parameters, pcaComp has precedence over thresh . Please see: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-77/topics/preProcess
