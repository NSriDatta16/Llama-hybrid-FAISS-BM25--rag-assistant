What is the difference between multiply and dot functions that is used to merge layer in Keras?

I want to merge two CNN deep learning model using Keras and would like to know what is the difference multiply and dot functions that is used to merge layer? keras.layers.multiply(inputs) keras.layers.dot(inputs, axes, normalize=False)
