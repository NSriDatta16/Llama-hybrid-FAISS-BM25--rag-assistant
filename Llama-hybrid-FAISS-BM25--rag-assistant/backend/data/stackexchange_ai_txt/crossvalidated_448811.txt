Dependent observations in neural networks?

Is there an option such as mixed models for neural networks in which dependent observations can be grouped and compared to each other? As an example say we have a questionnaire with 3500 observations but these observations only come from 300 people having answered the questionnaire. Or is independence of observations not a requirement for NN? (I'm new to them).
