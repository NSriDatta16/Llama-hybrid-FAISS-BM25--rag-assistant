Looking at my own code, I never checked the coordinates in the Begin/End states. I just treated them as separate events, no related to the position on the screen. In the End case I assume the last coordinates sent by Changed. And in the Begin case I cannot trust the coordinates because they were determined after the gesture moved a little and the gesture began, so I ask my tap recognizer where the initial coordinates were. I suspect that this was the original intent, that Changed be used, but in 4.2 and 4.3 they started filling in the final coordinates for End as well, just to be consistent.
