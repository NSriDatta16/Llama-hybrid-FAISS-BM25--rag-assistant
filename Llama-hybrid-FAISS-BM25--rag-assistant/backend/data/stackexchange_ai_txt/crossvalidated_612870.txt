data preprocessing with zeros dominating

I'm working on a machine learning classification project and i faced some difficulties: all of my features distributed like this: I'm not sure what should i do, should i use any scalers/other preprocessing methods? All features means count of some events for a specific person. What problems can this distribution cause after fitting the models? Also, is there any name for this kind of distribution?
