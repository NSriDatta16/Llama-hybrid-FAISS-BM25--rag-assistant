Calculation of propensity score using cox regression analysis

I want to assess the association of a treatment with survival time in patients. The background information of patients like age and severity differ between the treatment group and non-treatment group. So I want to do propensity score matching to pick up patients with the treatment and background-matched patients without the treatment. After the matching, I want to assess the association using cox regressoin analysis in the matched data. The treatment is a time-dependent covariate. Thus, the start of follow-up is not same as the treatment time. The background information of patients are not time-dependent covariates. The information was obtained at the start of follow-up. In general, the propensity score was calculated by the logistic regression analysis. (dependent variable: treatment or non-treatment, independent variables: background information) In this case, is it possible to calculated the propensity score by the cos regression analysis? (dependent variable: tmee-to event data (event = treatment), independent variables: background information) Could you give me any advice?
