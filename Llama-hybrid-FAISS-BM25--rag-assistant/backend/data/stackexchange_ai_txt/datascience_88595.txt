A situation that validation accuracy is higher than test accuracy at its minimum loss region

This case would be an example. Around epoch = 800, we have the validation loss(orange line) reaches its minimum region. Should we record the accuracy of the model as an average value from epoch 780 to 800? Or shall we take the accuracy after it became an almost straight line (after epoch = 1200)? If we record the accuracy at the minium point of validation loss. The accuracy may not be the highest. For example, at epoch = 800, val_loss = 0.627,val_accuracy = 0.783 . At epoch=909, val_loss = 0.624, val_accuracy = 0.761 what is the best way to do it for such a situation? Thanks
