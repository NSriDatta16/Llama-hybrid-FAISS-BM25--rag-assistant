You answered your own question. If you explicitly give the array a length, as in: const char hex[16] = "0123456789ABCDEF"; then of course it won't be null-terminated because there is no storage reserved for null termination. ( hex[16] is outside the bounds of the object and thus reading or writing it is undefined behavior. If it happens to read as 0, that's UB for ya...) It's only if you leave the length implicit, as in: const char hex[] = "0123456789ABCDEF"; or if you use the string literal as an object rather than as an initializer, that it will have null termination. By the way, why do you care if the null termination is there or not, if you're not planning to use it. Are you trying to shave bytes off your binary? :-)
