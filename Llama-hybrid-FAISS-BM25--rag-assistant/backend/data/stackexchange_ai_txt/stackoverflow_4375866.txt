Hibernate, DB2 - Slow running queries

I'm doing a search on one of my tables (legacy database) and recieving a horrible time here. The query is build by criteria api of hibernate, e.g.: Criteria crit = getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession().createCriteria(P1.class); crit.add(Restrictions.sqlRestriction("{alias}.compno like ?", "%" + s + "%", new StringType())); crit.setMaxResults(25); crit.setFirstResult(0); crit.addOrder(Order.asc("compno")); crit.list(); As you can see I'm already doing a paging here to improve the perfomance. This criteria needs ~6 seconds on average. Well the native query which looks like this select * from SCHEM.P1 where compno like '%100%' order by compno fetch first 25 rows only takes only 10 ms which is a huge difference imo. Why does the criteria runs so slow? Need I switch back to the native sql query? Good point on the comments: Yes there are some relationships which I didn't had on the scope:
