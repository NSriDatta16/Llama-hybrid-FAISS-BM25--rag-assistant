running "complex" queries with amazon SDB (simpledb) - aws-sdb + ActiveResource

I am considering the following a "complex" query, given the fact that simpledb is a really simple data storage: I am trying to query a aws-sdb domain with an OR query. using ruby, rails (2) and ActiveResource. I am using the code examples from http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1242 (which don't show Or queries by the way) class Team select code (not working): Team.find(:all, :from => :query, :params => "['player1' = 100001160313805 or 'player2' = 100001160313806]") select code (working, but no OR): Team.find(:all, :from => :query, :params => "['player1' = 100001160313805]") i am very thankful for any insights, since i am struggling with this for a few hours now. thanks a lot in advance for all comments.
