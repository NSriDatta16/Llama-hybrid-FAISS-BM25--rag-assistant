Maven: Repository no longer exists! Now what?

I have just begun my journey in Maven2 and found the dependency repositories logic a little weird... As far as I understand, I need to point Maven to a repository from which it can fetch the various POMs found in my dependencies. In other words, instead of downloading all the dependencies in my lib folder, as I did in the Ant era, I now have to look into various Maven repositories and, hopefully, find what I need. OK, thanks to MVNBrowser things get a little easier. But! What if the Maven repository no longer exists? For example, I use Slick in my project. Among the other dependencies, slick uses JNLP (for some reason). The artifact for jnlp is: javax.jnlp jnlp 1.2 According to MVNBrowser , javax.jnlp can only be found in one repository, Freehep. Which is no longer available. So now what?
