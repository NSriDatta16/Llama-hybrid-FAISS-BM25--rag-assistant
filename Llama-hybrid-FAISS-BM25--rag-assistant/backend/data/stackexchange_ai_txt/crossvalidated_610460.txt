Choose optimal lags in months for annual data

I try to forecast annual monthly price changes using annual monthly X changes. To choose the best lag, I run the VAR model and aim for the minimal AIC value. The problem is that the price is determined by different factors each month, so I have to do it for each month at a time. When I run VAR in the most basic way, it returns the result without differentiating between the months. If I filter the data to include only one month, I will lose all the point of finding monthly lags. I was thinking of modifying the data manually, each time for d lags and running it in a loop with lag=1. This would lead to the right result but would be extremely non-elegant. Any suggestion for what I can do? and apologies for the basic question... Just for the example, I use the default vars dataset. It is quarterly, but imagine it is monthly. Then, I try to forecast e as a function of prod . The easiest way, which is wrong: library(vars) test_d
