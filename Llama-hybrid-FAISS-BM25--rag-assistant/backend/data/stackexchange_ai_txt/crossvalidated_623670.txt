I believe that a beta regression is what you need. You have two issues to deal with: your response variable is bound between 0 (0% humidity) and 1(100% humidity), so the model predictions need to account for that; the closer the average model predictions are to 0 and 1, the more asymmetrical the distribution of the single observations become around the expected mean. For an average predicted mean humidity of 0%, observed variability can only be 0% or more; for an average predicted mean humidity of 100%, observed variability can only be 100% or less. Beta regression accounts for these two issues as follows: it fits a logistic model to the data. A logistic model is sigmoidal i.e. S-shaped and bound between 0 (0%) and 1 (100%); it assumes that the model residuals follow a beta distribution, which is usually a good approximation when data are rates and proportions (see, for example: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1365-2745.13200 ). You can fit such a model in R with function betareg() from package betareg : https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/betareg/versions/3.1-4/topics/betareg It should also be possible to do so with function glmmTMB() from package glmmTMB : glmmTMB(humidity~temperature, family=beta_family(link="logit")) You can (and should) check if your model residuals are "well-behaved" using diagnostic plots. Package DHARMa produces diagnostic plots for generalised linear models and generalised linear mixed-effect models. See: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html
