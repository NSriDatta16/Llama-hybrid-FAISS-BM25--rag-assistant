How to decompose the component that is influenced by X from time-series Y?

There is a time series Y, which is the remaining part of the initial time series after removing the trend and seasonal periodic components. And there is also a time series X, which represents the change of water level. (the data file is here: https://github.com/jacktang/dataset/tree/main/decompose ) I've read some papers and they talk about time series decomposing trend, season component, and few talk about how the decompose the remaining part. Time series Y is influenced by X, so I think time series Y should contains the influence of X and some noise. I've analyzed the Y is not white noise: I have visualized X and Y respectively, and compared them after standardization. In addition, I plotted a scatter figure of Y vs X and its standardized version. But I did not find an obvious relationship. Does anyone know how to decompose the influence of X on Y from time series Y? Thanks!
