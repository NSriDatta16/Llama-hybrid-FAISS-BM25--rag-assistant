Unity is a dependency injection container with support for interception. EntLib is a library of 9 application blocks, one of which is Unity. EntLib has a much broader scope, it handles other cross-cutting concerns - think of logging, validation, exception management, data access, caching, etc. Back in 2008 when we were designing Unity during our work on EntLib4.0, we quickly realized that it is something that many developers can benefit from by itself. That's why we shipped it standalone. EntLib5.0 is fully DI-driven, and it uses Unity container by default. You can swap it out for another container if you wish. The same goes for Prism, which is container-agnostic. If EntLib was designed to be leveraged in any layer of your app, Prism was designed specifically for building composite UIs (in WPF and Silverlight). EntLib and Prism are complementary, not overlapping.
