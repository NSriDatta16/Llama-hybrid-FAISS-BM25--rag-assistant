What's the transition probability according to this PDE?

I'm trying to figure out how I can simulate markov chains based on an ODE: dN/dt = alpha N (1 - N / K) - beta N Thus N denotes total population, and I want to simulate through sampling for each present individual N(t) if they'd birth new ones alpha (1-N/k) or die due to death probability beta . I don't want to use exponential distribution for these.. But I don't know what to do when e.g. beta>1 or K>N , as then alpha(1-N/K) may not be a proper probability.
