See the key events compatibility table. Opera does not cancel a keypress when keydown preventsDefault. Use the keypress event instead to cancel keyboard input. (Although, this is rarely a good idea. Intercepting keypresses does not stop a field being changed by other means than keys, for example drag and drop. Set the readonly or disabled properties true to properly stop the value being changed.)
