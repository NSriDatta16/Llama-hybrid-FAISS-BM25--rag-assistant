What is the difference between maximum likelihood hypothesis and maximum a posteriori hypothesis?

I am a student and I am studying machine learning. I am focusing on the concept of Bayesian learning and I have studied the maximum likelihood hypothesis and the maximum a posteriori hypothesis . I have seen that the maximum likelihood hypothesis is the hyposesis that maximizes the likelihood of seeng the data, and it is defined as: $h_{ML}=arg_h max P(D|h)$ while maximum a posteriori hypothesis is the hypothesis that maximizes the posterir probability of seeng the data, and it is defined as: $h_{MAP}=arg_h max P(D|h)P(h)$ I am really confused by these two definitions, since I can't grasp what is the difference between the two. I have understood that the maximum likelihood hypothesis is the one that, given some observed data, finds the parameters of the distribution such that I am most likly to understand the data. But I cannot unserstand what is the MAP hypothesis. I have tried to read some interpretations and definitions, m√¨but I can't understand the difference between the two. So, what is the difference between maximum likelihood hypothesis and maximum a posteriori hypothesis?
