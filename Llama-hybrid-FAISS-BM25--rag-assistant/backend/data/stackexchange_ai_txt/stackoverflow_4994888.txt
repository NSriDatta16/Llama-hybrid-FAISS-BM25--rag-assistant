multi store and multi stock with magento

I'm using the free version of Magento and i just finished setup multi store option, so from now on this feature is working, but I didn't find the way to handle differents stock according to each multistore, for example: helmet#1 is only available in store-A helmet#2 is only available in store-B and store-C helmet#3 is only available in store-A and store-C but with differents prices ? Can I do this with magento free edition ? Thx
