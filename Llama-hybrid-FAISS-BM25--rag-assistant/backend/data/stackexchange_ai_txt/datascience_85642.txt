If we classify new objects using transfer learning: We delete the top Dense layer of the pre-trained neural network. Now suppose you have to classify 5 classes, so your final dense layer will contain 5 nodes. Also you will add some dense layers prior to your new 5 nodes Dense layer, so that you can train the model with new data. All the layers prior to the few dense layers you added will be frozen. Now you will train your new model with your dataset. The Logic behind these steps is: As CNN uses hierarchical-based learning, meaning the initial layers will try to learn basics features in a dataset ie. lines, corners, shapes, etc . So the frozen layers of your model have already learned the basic features which are common to your dataset as well as the dataset it has been previously trained on. The few Dense layers you added, will try to learn high-level features specific to your dataset when you train your model with your dataset.
