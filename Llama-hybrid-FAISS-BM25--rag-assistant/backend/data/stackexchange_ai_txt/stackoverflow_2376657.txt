How to Create a Downloadable Product through Magento API?

I am new to Magento, and are using their API. What I want to ask, is it possible to create a downloadable product through the API? The documentation example is just for creating a new simple product, and if I use the API to view the product.info of a downloadable product, I don't see any attribute that link to a downloadable file assigned to that product. Any help would be appreciated, thanks :)
