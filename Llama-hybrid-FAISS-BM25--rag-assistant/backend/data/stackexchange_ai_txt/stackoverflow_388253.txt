As of v1.7, the DotNetZip distribution now includes a version built specifically for the .NET Compact Framework, either v2.0 or v3.5. http://www.codeplex.com/DotNetZip/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx . It is about ~70k DLL. It does zip, unzip, zip editing, passwords, ZIP64, unicode, streams, and more. DotNetZip is 100% managed code, open source, and free/gratis to use. It's also very simple and easy. try { using (var zip1 = Ionic.Zip.ZipFile.Read(zipToUnpack)) { foreach (var entry in zip1) { entry.Extract(dir, ExtractExistingFileAction.OverwriteSilently); } } } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show("Exception! " + ex); } There's a sample app included in the source distribution that unzips to a storage card. CF-Unzipper app http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/ce5ad6a964.png
