I think what I would do is create a variable for each respondent which would be dichotomous: yes this person takes their medication on the correct schedule, or no they don't. From there, you calculate the proportion of respondents that take their medication on schedule (e.g. "0.75, or 75% of respondents take their medication on schedule"). Then, you can create a confidence interval around this proportion. Be sure to use a technique that is appropriate for determining a confidence interval for a proportion, and appropriate for your sample size. The interpretation depends upon if this interval includes certain proportions of interest. I don't know what these would be. It depends on your experience and opinion, but as examples: If the interval includes 1.0, then that is good news, as the proportion for your sample is not statistically different than everyone taking their medication on schedule. If the interval includes 0.50, then your sample is no better than 50/50 at taking their medication on schedule. If the interval is below 0.50, then, I imagine, that is bad news. The same type of result could be obtained with a binomial test, testing against different proportions of interest (e.g. 0.9, 0.5, 0.25), but I think the confidence interval approach is more elegant in this case.
