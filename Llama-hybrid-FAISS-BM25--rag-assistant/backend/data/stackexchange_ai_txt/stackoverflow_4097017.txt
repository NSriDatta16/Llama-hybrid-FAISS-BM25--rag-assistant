My experience with compilers/linkers for chips with limited memory is that, as long as you don't use recursive functions and inform the compiler about that, then the compiler is very capable of determining the minimal amount of stack-space that is needed. I have even seen compilers that give each variable with automatic storage a globally fixed address (no stack at all), where several variables got allocated to overlapping memory, as long as their lifetimes did not overlap. The general advise when doing (speed or space) optimisations is: make measurements to prove that your optimisation actually has a positive effect.
