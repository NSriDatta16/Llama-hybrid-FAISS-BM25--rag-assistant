Is it a good idea to keep all the enums in one place?

When I'm building a class library I usually create a file Enums.cs to hold all the enums used in the assembly. Here is an example: namespace MyNamespace { public enum Colors { Red, Green, Blue } public enum Shapes { Circle, Square, Triangle } } This makes all my enums easy to find, well organized and easy to access in code. I'm wondering if there is any reason why this would not be such a good idea?
