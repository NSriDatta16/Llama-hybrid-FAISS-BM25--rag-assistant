Detecting if an image can be made BW/Greyscale/Colour

I am attempting to classify images of documents into Black&White, Greyscale and Colour. I originally get these images as colour images and in order to save space I want to change the bit depth where possible without a loss of 'content' from the original image. I have hand labelled around 3000 documents (I could do more) based on what I though they should be changed to (BW/Greyscale/Remain as colour). Generally speaking I labelled them as the lowest possible bit depth without a loss of 'content'. It was acceptable to lose colour apart from in the case of things such as photographs where the amount of colour in the document was large. I have tried a number of approaches such as taking the image histograms from the grey scaled and black documents and using them as a feature in a number of machine learning models such as a RandomForestClassifier. Creating an ensemble of classifiers, created a CNN LSTM where there were 3 input images. The colour image, the grey scaled image and the black a white image. I have tried doing some transfer learning in order to try an make up for my relatively small dataset and I have also tried a small conventional CNN, non of which where able to go anywhere above 83%. The dataset has a rough split of BW = 1700, Greyscale = 800, Colour = 500. The most confusion is between the BW and Greyscale class. I'm running out of ideas as how to tackle such a task as I have looked online and have never seen someone try and approach such a problem. I am wondering if there are any particular model architectures anyone has used before or features I could extract from the images to help my classification accuracy.
