Choosing buffer size for FTP and HTTP transfers

How does one choose the size of a buffer (bytes I read from or write to socket) for the maximum throughput when implementing a low-level HTTP and FTP transfer? My application should transfer data with HTTP or FTP on connections varying from 130 Kbps to 3 Mbps (I know the expected speed beforehand). Sometimes it's a one way transfer, sometimes it goes in both directions. Should I stick with some average buffer size or I must vary it depending on the connection speed? Thanks.
