How to give a ML model an information that a store is closed or open?

When predicting sales, how can you make ML models predict 0 sales when the shop is closed? I tried to use a dummy variable with 2 columns one for open and the other one for close but it's not efficient. I don't understand why my models can't figure out that when there is a 1 in a column they should always predict 0. edit : Indeed, to predict 0 sales with a model of ML, just simply remove the days without sales or if the variable store_open = 0 do not use the prediction algorithm and simply predict 0. However, the reason I asked this question is to use my dummy variable with time series. I wanted to check if an ML model was able to predict 0 for a closed day and therefore understand in a time series that some days are at 0 because the shop is closed and others are at 0 because there were no sales. That's why I try to predict sales when a shop is closed. This being said, in the case of a model using time series as an RNN, how can I integrate the closed and open day in my data?
