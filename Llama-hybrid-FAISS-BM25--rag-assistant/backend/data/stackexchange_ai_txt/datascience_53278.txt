Using predicted probabilities and bayesian inference to update beliefs

I'm currently working on a project to predict the likelihood of an outcome. I'd like to implement a system where the belief the event will happen is updated after running the model on new data. However, I'm having trouble figuring out exactly how to implement that. Any explanations of updating beliefs using Bayes theorem would be helpful.
