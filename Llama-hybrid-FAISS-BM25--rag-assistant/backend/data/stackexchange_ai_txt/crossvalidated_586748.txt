Calculating trends with `emtrends` for three-way interaction model results in same slope estimates

I have fit a multilevel gam ( mgcv ) that includes a three-way interaction between a continuous variable ( prev.rain ) and two categorical variables ( level and roya_present ). The model also has some random effects ( quadrat , plantID , and year ) as well as a global and group-level smoothers based on month and month / level , respectively. I treat all the random effects and smoothers as nuisance variables when calculating trends with emtrends . Here is the formula for the model: level_bam7 When I use the following code to calculate the slopes of prev.rain at each level and roya_present level: emtrends(level_bam7, specs = c("level", "roya_present"), var = "prev.rain", nuisance = c("quadrat", "plantID")) I get the same values at each factor combination: level roya_present prev.rain.trend SE df lower.CL upper.CL bottom 0 3.37 1.98 18882 -0.504 7.24 mid 0 3.37 1.98 18882 -0.504 7.24 top 0 3.37 1.98 18882 -0.504 7.24 bottom 1 3.37 1.98 18882 -0.504 7.24 mid 1 3.37 1.98 18882 -0.504 7.24 top 1 3.37 1.98 18882 -0.504 7.24 Results are averaged over the levels of: 2 nuisance factors, year Confidence level used: 0.95 I thought it might be because there is smooth effect of month varying by level , so it might be important to specify by month . So when I try: emtrends(level_bam7, specs = c("level", "roya_present"), var = "prev.rain", nuisance = c("quadrat", "plantID"), at = list(month = c(1,6))) I still get the same result, though month is listed among the levels that results are averaged over. I believe the slopes should differ by these factor levels and calculating the marginal means over prev.rain seems to support this. What am I missing to be able to calculate and compare these slopes?
