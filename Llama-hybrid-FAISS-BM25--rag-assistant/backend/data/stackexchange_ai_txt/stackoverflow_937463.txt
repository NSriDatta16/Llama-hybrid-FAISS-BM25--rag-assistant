Enterprise Library is big... which part were you particularly interested in? In general, you won't have any problems, since Azure now supports full trust. However, some parts won't really make sense... for example, you can't use Enterprise Logging to log to a "C:\MyLog.txt", since you won't be able to log anything to a "local drive" in the cloud. Perhaps you could write a logging provider to Azure table storage however, for example.
