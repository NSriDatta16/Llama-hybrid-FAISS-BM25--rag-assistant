Depending on what you are trying to accomplish there's several different ways to go about it. Some examples are - Make bitmap transparent Dim bmp As Bitmap = Bitmap.FromFile("test.bmp") bmp.MakeTransparent(Color.Magenta) ' magenta in bitmap will be transparent PictureBox1.Image = bmp Make the picture box transparent PictureBox1.BackColor = Color.Transparent If you really need a transparent image I would suggest not using the picturebox and just render a transparent bitmap directly.
