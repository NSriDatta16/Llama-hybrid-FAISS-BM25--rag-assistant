What are the different low-level operators in Genetic Algorithm?

For my exam, I want to elaborate on different Low-level GA operators. But I found different texts says about different Low-level operators. Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning by David E. Goldberg lists Dominance Inversrion Intra chromosomal duplication Deletion Translocation Segregation as low-level operators. And lists migration, marriage restriction and segregation as higher level population oriented operators . But some other texts like Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic and Genetic Algorithms: Synthesis and Applications by S. Rajashekaran and G.A. Vijayalksmi includes migration in low-level operators. What is the difference between this low-level and high-level operators.
