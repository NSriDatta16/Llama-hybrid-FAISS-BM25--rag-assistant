What are some statistical tests for exchangeability of a data set?

The representation theorem of de Finetti is seen by some as motivation for the use of Bayesian and/or hierarchical modeling. In some settings, it may be plausible to assume measurements are exchangeable, but in others, this is not necessarily a straightforward assumption. How does one decide if data are exchangeable, for instance, with a test? A cursory search has not yielded much on this topic, but I'd appreciate feedback if such a literature exists.
