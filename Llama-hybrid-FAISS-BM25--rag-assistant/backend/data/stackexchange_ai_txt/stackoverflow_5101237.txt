I was finally able to resolve the problem after searching online. The solution was to go to about:config and filter by useragent. Then make the following changes- general.useragent.vendorComment to lucid from maverick general.useragent.vendorSub to 10.04 from 10.10 This is just a temporary workaround I guess. This is what worked for me. Other people had suggested changing Ubuntu to Firefox. Also you may need to clear cache, history etc and restart browser.
