There is slack in the index, but not a gap . I make the distinction to imply that there is technically wasted space, but it's not like NTFS has to parse the 8MB in order to enumerate/query/whatever the index. It knows where the root of its tree is, and it just happens to have a lot of extra allocation leftover. Probably too detailed a response, given how unhelpful it is. Fragmentation is likely a separate issue altogether.
