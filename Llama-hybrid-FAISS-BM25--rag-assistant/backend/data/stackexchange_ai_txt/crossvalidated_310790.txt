Linear regression, primary components etc need complete data to work upon. The most standard variant of dealing with that are omission of observations, if data is missing at random or multiple imputation, which you say does not make sense in your setting. Classification trees and Random forests work very well with missing data, probably even, if not missing at random. If there are missing values, CART and CRUISE use alternate splits on other variables when needed, C4.5 sends each observation with a missing value in a split through every branch using a probability weighting scheme, QUEST imputes the missing values locally, and GUIDE treats missing values as belonging to a separate category.
