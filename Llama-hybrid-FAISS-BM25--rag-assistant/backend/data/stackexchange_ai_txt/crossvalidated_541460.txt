Is there a simple generalization of the OLS "weighted average of the slopes" interpretation of the slope coefficient to multivariate predictors?

The slope coefficient of univariate (single predictor, single response) OLS can be written as a weighted average of the pairwise slopes between $(x,y)$ pairs, specifically: $$ \hat{\beta} = \frac{\sum_{i\neq j}(y_{i}-y_{j})(x_{i}-x_{j})}{\sum_{i\neq j}(x_{i}-x_{j})^2}\\ = \sum_{i\neq j}W_{ij}\frac{(x_{i}-x_{j})}{(y_{i}-y_{j})} \text{ where } W_{ij} := \frac{(y_{i} - y_{j})^2}{\sum_{i\neq j}(x_{i}-x_{j})^2}$$ Let $\|X\|$ denote the Euclidean norm of $X$ . Is the generalization to multivariate OLS obtained by replacing $(x_{i}-x_{j})^2$ everywhere in the above with $\|x_{i}-x_{j}\|^2$ true? I can obtain something that looks like it could at least potentially be put into such a form (with some extra work) In the following way: Plug $\hat{\beta} = (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}Y$ back into the OLS objective function, diagonalize the positive definite matrix $X^{T}X = UDU^{T}$ and make the change of variables $Z = XU^{T}$ . Then expanding the resulting equivalent problem back into iterated summations looks suspiciously like it could work, but I don't see quite how to finish up. I strongly suspect that I'm missing some easy trick that would let me make the last steps. Or $\ldots$ is it just not true?
