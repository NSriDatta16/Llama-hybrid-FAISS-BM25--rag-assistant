How do I write out the results for this analysis in APA format?

The results will simply be two correlations: one relating total quantity over the last 7 days (a.k.a average sleep) with performance (to give us an indication of the effect of an accumulated sleep debt on performance), and (night before) the other relating only the quantity from the last 24 hours (a.k.a night before). I am not clear on how to write the results down in my lab report. This was what I came up with the following: To assess the size and direction of the relationship between sleep and average memory span, a Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient (r) was calculated. The correlation between these two variables was positive and moderate, r(134) = .57, p My question is: Is the result I have written fully describing the SPSS analysis?
