If you need explicit and interpretable interactions you should use MARS of 2nd or 3rd degree. If you need explicit but not interpretable interactions (you will not be able to extract the interaction features after fitting the model) you could use SVM with polynomial kernels. If you are ok with implicit and flexible interactions, as Firebug said, you can use a universal approximator such as a Neural Network with non-linear activations. I guess you could also use SVM with radial basis kernel for this purpose, as it is also a universal approximator, however, I am not completely sure of how would be this model able to model interactions (I posted a question specifically for this matter that has not been answered yet).
