Cocoa: How to morph a drag image while dragging

In Interface Builder.app (and some other cocoa apps), image dragging has a very nice/sexy effect of morphing the drag image while you drag a draggable item out of its window. For example in Interface Buildler.app: Show the Library Palette (⇧⌘L, or Tools Menu -> Library) Drag an item out of the Library palette NOTE: as you drag the item out of the Library Palette window, it morphs from an image of the original list item to an image of the icon of the dragged item. I have fully implemented drag and drop in my Application using the normal Cocoa NSDragSource/NSDragDestination facilities. However, I can't find a hook for doing this image morph while dragging. I'm returning the initial drag image by overriding -[NSView dragImage:at:offset:event:pasteboard:source:slideBack:] But this is only called at the beginning of the drag. How do you signal that you would like to replace the current drag image (ideally using the sexy morph effect).
