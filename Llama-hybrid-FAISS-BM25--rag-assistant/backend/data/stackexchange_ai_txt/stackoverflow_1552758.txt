Simplifying tuzzolotron's answer : Where the following outlet is properly connected in your xib IBOutlet UITextView *myTextView; Use this in the view controller: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([myTextView isFirstResponder] && [touch view] != myTextView) { [myTextView resignFirstResponder]; } [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } A tap on the View Controller's View, outside of the Text View, will resign the first responder, closing the keyboard.
