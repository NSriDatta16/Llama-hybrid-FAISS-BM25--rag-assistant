Interesting question. But you sure lift a lot of barriers, selecting a language/environment with lot of voluntary limitations to limit access to the underlying system... I like Robert's suggestion, Xavante is really lightweight. Otherwise, I think a viable solution could be to use a Java applet with JDBC access. I think you would need to sign the applet, which shouldn't be a problem. I searched java applet jdbc in Google and saw lot of promising titles, IBM gives the source code of such applet (for DB2 access but it should be easily adaptable). [EDIT] There is another way, to wrap mysqllib.dll with an XPCOM DLL, as explained in Native code in javascript . No idea how to really do it, but perhaps it can get you started.
