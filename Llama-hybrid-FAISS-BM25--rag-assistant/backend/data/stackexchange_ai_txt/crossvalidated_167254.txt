It is the probability distribution of a variable (node) in probabilistic graphical model (PGM) conditioned on the value of all the other variables in the PGM. It is equal to the distribution of the variable conditioned on the values of its Markov blanket which is formed by the children, the parents and coparents of the node. As suggested by Stephane this is useful for MCMC sampling.
