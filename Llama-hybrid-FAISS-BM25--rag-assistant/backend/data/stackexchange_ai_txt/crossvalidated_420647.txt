I would not trust a model with evidented heteroscedastic errors ... thus my preferred approach is to .... (AFTER adjusting for pulses,level shifts,seasonal pulses and local time trends i.e. adjusting the conditional mean structure ) pursue this thread . To treat heteroscedasticity consider employing the GLS approach suggested by TSAY http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . The weights he generates lead directly to Weighted Least Squares. I have had success with this feature which I incorporated into AUTOBOX, a commercial time series package to treat deterministic change points in model error variance AFTER validating that the model parameters didn't change over time which surprisingly is generally ignored elsewhere ! If doesn't resolve your problem then
