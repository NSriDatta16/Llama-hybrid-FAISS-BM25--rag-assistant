If you want to detect with javascript inside the browser, you can probably use the collection "navigator.plugins". It works with Firefox, Opera and Chrome but unfortunately not with IE. Update: In FF, Opera and Chrome you can test it easily like this: if (navigator.plugins["Adobe Acrobat"]) { // do some stuff if it is installed } else { // do some other stuff if its not installed } Update #2: If it is an ActiveX object in IE you can test if it exists by using something like this: function getActiveXObject(name){ try{ return new ActiveXObject(name); } catch(err){ return undefined; } }; Another approach for IE is something similar to what JohnFx suggested (I found it here and have not tested it): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Curr entVersion\Internet Settings\User Agent\Post Platform
