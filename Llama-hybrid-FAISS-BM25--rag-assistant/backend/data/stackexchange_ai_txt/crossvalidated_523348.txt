Isn't frequentism flawed, at least in the case of small samples?

In his talk on Frequentism and Bayesianism , Jake VanderPlas discusses Bayes' billiard game (10:57). Jake sketches how frequentists arrive at an odds 0.053 of winning for Bob after three more moves when Alice is 5:3 ahead after eight moves, while Bayesians arrive at 0.091 which is almost twice as high. Jake charmingly skips the answer who of both is right – but one of them has to be right, I guess. To answer the question, I wrote a tiny JavaScript (see below) which unambiguously decided that the Bayesians are right – and indeed perfectly right. Bob's odds of winning definitely are 0.091. That seems to imply that the frequentists are wrong , at least in the case of small samples. But can this be the case in view of all the predictions and parameter estimations that are made on frequentists' assumptions? And is it really a matter of philosophy (as Jake suggests)? Or isn't it a matter of right and wrong? This is the script: var experiments = 1 var gamesPerExperiment = 10000000 var bobWinsFrequentist = 0 for (var experiment = 0; experiment threshold) alice++ else bob++ } if (alice == 5 && bob == 3) { // consider only these cases gamesConsidered++ for (var move = 0; move threshold) alice++ else bob++ } if (bob > alice) bobWins++ } } if (bobWins/gamesConsidered 1) console.log("Bob's odds It outputs almost surely Bob's odds = 0.091... . If you run the script with experiments=1000 and gamesPerExperiment=1000 you will find that frequentists are possibly right in approx. 10% of the experiments.
