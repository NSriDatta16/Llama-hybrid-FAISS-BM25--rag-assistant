you just have to start! see https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml decide on your criterion (eg error in predicted revenue^2?) [I would do revenue as the criterion rather than ROI because you don't care about amazing roi on a minuscule investment - you care about your overall revenue] create a benchmark (time series crossvalidation of next week given previous data) what's the simplest model you can come up with? eg roi next week = roi last week/month/all time. what gives the best results? iterate. personally I would use logs of your data, eg $\log(\text{revenue}) = \log(\text{investment}) + \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \log (\text{revenue (week-1)}) - \beta_1 \log(\text{investment(week -1)}) + \dots \alpha_n \log (\text{revenue (week-n)}) - \beta_n \log(\text{investment(week -n)})$ ie $$\text{revenue} = \text{investment} \exp(\alpha_0) * \frac{\prod_i(\text{revenue}^{\alpha_i})}{\prod_j(\text{investment}^{\beta_j})}$$ the point is that your regression could chose some weighted (geometric) average of the previous weeks' ROI. (not exactly correct.. will revisit)
