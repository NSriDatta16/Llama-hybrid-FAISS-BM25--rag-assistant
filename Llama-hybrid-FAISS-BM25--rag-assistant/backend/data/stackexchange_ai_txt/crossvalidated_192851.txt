How to perform grid search effectively for tuning SVM parameters in cross validation?

I have C and gamma parameters for RBF kernel to perform SVM classification through cross validation in R software. How to fix values for grid search to tune C and gamma parameters? For example I took grid ranging from [50 , 60 , 70 ....,600] for C and Gamma [ 0.05, 0.10,....,1]. I used a validation set for fine tuning the parameters. I fixed the gamma value and varied the C and got the optimum C value. Then I fixed the optimum C value and varied the gamma values to find the optimum gamma value. Is it right or are there any other way to perform effective grid search?
