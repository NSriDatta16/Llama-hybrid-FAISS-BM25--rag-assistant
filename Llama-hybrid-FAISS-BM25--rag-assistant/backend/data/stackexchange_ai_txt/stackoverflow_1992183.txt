How to hide the .html extension with Apache mod_rewrite

I have a small number of static sites where I simply want to hide the .html extension: the URL /foo fetches the static file /foo.html the browser still displays the URL /foo The client can then send out bookmarks in the style example.com/foo rather than example.com/foo.html . It sounds very simple, and I've used mod_rewrite happily before (say with WordPress or for redirects), but this is proving much harder to crack that I thought. Perhaps I'm missing something really obvious, but I can't find a solution anywhere and I've been at it all day! We run our own server, so this can go wherever is the best place. Addendum The solution checked below worked fine. Then after running the site awhile I noticed two problems: all pages began to appear unstyled. I reloaded, cleared the cache, etc., but still no-style. I've had this trouble before, and can't locate the source. There's a directory AND an HTML file named 'gallery', so the /gallery link shows a directory listing instead of the HTML file. I should be able to sort that one, but further tips welcome :-)
