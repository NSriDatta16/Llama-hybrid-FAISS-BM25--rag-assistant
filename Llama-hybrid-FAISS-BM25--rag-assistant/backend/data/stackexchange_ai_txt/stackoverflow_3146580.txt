The missing variable are the number of employee in each category, and of course not all of them have the same salary, that's why we need the average salary and the number of employee in each category. Assume the average salary for Category A is SA, B is SB and C is SC Assume the Employ Number for Category A is NA, B is NB and C is NC then 50,000 = ((3N*SA*NA) +(2N*SB*NB)+(N*SC*NC))/100 + ((SA*NA) +(SB*NB)+(SC*NC)) N= ((50,000 -((SA*NA) +(SB*NB)+(SC*NC))) *100)/((3*SA*NA)+(2*SB*NB)+(SC*NC)) let we assume the constant K =100/ ((3*SA*NA)+(2*SB*NB)+(SC*NC)) M=((SA*NA) +(SB*NB)+(SC*NC)) the amount 0 and Y=N then Y=(X-M)*K linear equation
