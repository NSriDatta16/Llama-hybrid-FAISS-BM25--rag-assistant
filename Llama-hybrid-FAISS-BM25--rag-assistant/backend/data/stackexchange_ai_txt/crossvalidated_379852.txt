This is my first time answering a question in this site. I think this setting violates the requisite universal in almost all machine learning algorithms, that is the examples $(\mathbf{x}_i,y_i)$ have to be independently drawn from same underlying distribution $\mathcal{D}: \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}$ . In this sense, it is not likely that $\mathbf{x}_i$ 's do not provide any information about $y_i$ 's. However, in practice, this might occur because of inappropriate measurement of your data (either $\mathbf{x}_i$ 's or $y_i$ 's), but this has nothing to do with machine learning algorithm itself but related to your measurement and some data preprocessing techniques might be relatable to your question.
