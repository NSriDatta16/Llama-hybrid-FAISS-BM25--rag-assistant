Is Cassandra database row size limited by available memory?

I'm working with very long time series -- hundreds of millions of data points in one series -- and am considering Cassandra as a data store. In this question , one of the Cassandra committers (the Ã¼ber helpful jbellis ) says that Cassandra rows can be very large, and that column slicing operations are faster than row slices, hence my question: Is the row size still limited by available memory?
