Can I Imitate Another Browser/Platform? There are many ways to spoof user agent strings. In firefox, there happens to be an extension called "User Agent Switcher," which allows you to imitate other browsers. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59 User Agents Checking the user-agent often times can tell you this. For instance, my user-agent is: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.38 Safari/532.0 Which platform am I on? Javascript Option You can also use the navigator object in Javascript to get some information too. For instance: alert(navigator.platform); // alerts Win32 alert(navigator.userAgent); // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0... PHP Options You can get the user-agent in PHP from the $_SERVER array: print $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]; // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT... PHP also has further goodies, such as the get_browser() * function in PHP which returns an array of information, including the platform : Array ( ... [parent] => Firefox 0.9 [platform] => WinXP [browser] => Firefox [version] => 0.9 ... ) * get_browser() relies upon browscap.ini - See http://www.php.net...php#ini.browscap for more information.
