probably belongs on serverfault. But i think i know what Tarun is talking about. IMHO the best way to take a copy of all your SQL Server agent jobs is to script them out using management studio. You can do this by clicking on jobs in object explorer, then object explorer details window. All jobs in this instance will be listed here, Select all, and pick script jobs from the right click context window. This will generate a t-sql script with all the jobs on the server. If you do wish to restore the msdb database ( to keep job history ect.) then you will need to stop the SQL Server Agent service first.
