With this limited of a data set, you can actually just think about what the data are showing you on a case by case basis. In your case, there is not much to show. In Field 1, you have what seems like a 'large' number of adults (not sure what organism this is - if for example beetles, then perhaps 200 beetles is not a lot of beetles in a field?) and a pretty large amount of heather. Field 2, smaller amount of heather and smaller number of adults. All good. Field 3 breaks the nice little pattern. Without more data, there's no way to know if this is indicative of a 'non-relationship' or just variability. If you have an opportunity to gather data to your heart's content, you should probably work on doing a power calculation. I suspect that you have to take data opportunitistically and that it's a lot of work to collect data for a single field. Something else to keep in mind is that you have percentage as well as count data. Percentage data (capped at something like 100%) sometimes needs to be dealt with as well, either through something like logistic regression, an arc-sine transformation, etc.
