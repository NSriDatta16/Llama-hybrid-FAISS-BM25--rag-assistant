C# delegate to Java conversion

I am in the process of converting some code from C# to Java. I have never used C# before, but it has been pretty easy up to this point. I have a line that looks like this in the C# file: coverage.createMethod = delegate (Gridpoint gp){ //Some method stuff in here, with a return objecct } What exactly is this trying to do? It seems a little bit like an inline class but I am not sure how to go about converting htis to java Edit: more on the specific problem In a file called STKDriver.java i have the following CoverageDefinitionOnCentralBody coverage = new CoverageDefinitionOnCentralBody(...); . . . DClass value = new DClass(STKDriver.class, "invoke", CoverageGrid.class); coverage.setGridPointCreationMethod(value); In the fill DClass.java, which extends CreateCoverageGridPointForAccess I have the following: public DClass(Class class1, String string, Class class2{} . . . public IServiceProvider invoke(CoverageGridPoint gridPoint){ return something; //of the classtype Platform } Is this done correctly? The class definitions are linked here: http://www.agi.com/resources/help/online/AGIComponentsJava/index.html?page=source%2FWhatsNewJava.html Notice that the class CreateCoverageGridPointForAccess is abstract and extends that Delegate class. Does this implementation I have created look correct? I Can write in more code if necessary
