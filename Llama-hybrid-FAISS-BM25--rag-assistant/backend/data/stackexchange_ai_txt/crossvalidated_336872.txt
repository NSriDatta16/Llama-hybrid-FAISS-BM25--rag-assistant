In Ken Tatebe’s “Combining Multiple Averaged Data Points And Their Errors” ( PDF —linked in Steven Howell’s answer ), Tatebe shows that given two "bins" of averaged data points $a$ and $b$ , each reported as an average ( $\bar a$ , $\bar b$ ) and an error ( $\varepsilon_a$ , $\varepsilon_b$ ), with bin sizes $n_a$ and $n_b$ (where $n_a$ + $n_b$ = $n$ is the number of original data points), the average of the entire data set $\bar S$ is given by the weighted average of the averages: $$ \bar S = (\frac{n_a}{n}) \bar a + (\frac{n_b}{n}) \bar b $$ and the error $\varepsilon_S$ is given by $$ \varepsilon_S = \sqrt{\frac{N_a}{N}\varepsilon^2_a+\frac{N_b}{N}\varepsilon^2_b+\frac{n_an_b(\bar a - \bar b)^2}{nN}} $$ Tatebe goes on to state: If more than two averaged points need to be combined, the formulae may be used repeatedly to combine multiple sets. For example, if one has three averaged data points $\bar a$ , $\bar b$ and $\bar c$ one may use Equations 10 and 48… (equations 10 and 48 being $\bar S$ and $\varepsilon_S$ above, respectively) …to combine $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ . This result can then be combined with $\bar c$ to get the final composite point. I’ve written a Python implementation; it’s untested, but in case it’s useful to anyone else, it’s available here as a gist .
