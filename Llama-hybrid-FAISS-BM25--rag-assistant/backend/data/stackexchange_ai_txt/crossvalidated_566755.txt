This is quite fine. A typical time series method also looks back a few days/periods at different time instants. You just need to make sure the dates you use are not inside the test period, for any user. A disadvantage of using a single day/date for training purposes is that the data may fall into a very specific period of time and learn features specific to that time interval, e.g. holiday period. For this reason, it doesn't allow you to utilize time-based features.
