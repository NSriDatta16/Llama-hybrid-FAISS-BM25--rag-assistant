range_error is defined both in your code (in the global namespace) and by the Standard Library (in the std namespace). Your use of using namespace std; to drag the entire Standard namespace into the global namespace creates an ambiguity. You should do at least one of the following: remove using namespace std from the global namespace; either use the namespace within your functions, or use just the names you need, or qualify all the standard names when you use them carefully choose your own names to avoid conflicts with standard names place your own names inside a namespace (and don't pull that into the global namespace).
