I think you are looking for K-Medoids . It's like K-means in that you specify the number of clusters, K , in advance, but it doesn't require that you have a notion of "averaging" the objects you're clustering like K-means does. Instead, every cluster has a representative medoid , which is the member of the cluster closest to the middle. You could think of it as a version of K-means that finds "medians" instead of "means". All you need is a distance metric to cluster things, and I've used this in some of my own work for exactly the same reasons you cite. Naive K-medoids is not the fastest algorithm, but there are fast variants that are probably good enough for your purposes. Here are descriptions of the algorithms and links to the documentation for their implementations in R : PAM is the basic O(n^2) implementation of K-medoids. CLARA is a much faster, sampled version of PAM. It works by clustering randomly sampled subset of objects with PAM and grouping the entire set of objects based on the subset. You should still be able to get very good clusterings fast with this. If you need more information, here's a paper that gives an overview of these and other K-medoids methods.
