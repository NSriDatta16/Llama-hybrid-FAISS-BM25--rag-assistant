Check leverage phenomenon on ARCH-GARCH models in R

I estimated an ARCH(10) and a GARCH(1,1) models on R. I have to verify the presence of leverage phenomenon, graphically or descriptive evidence. Leverage effect: volatility reacts asymmetrically to the changes in prices (i.e. usually in stock returns the volatility increases more after bad news than after good news). How can I test it?
