If you want to use the idea in my other referenced answer (thanks!) of using a pessimistic lower bound on the average then I think some additional assumptions/parameters are going to need to be injected. To make sure I understand: With 10000 votes, every single one of which is "2", you're very sure the true average is 2. With 2 votes, each a "2", you're very unsure -- maybe some 0's and 1's will come in and bring down the average. But how to quantify that, I think is your question. Here's an idea: Everyone starts with some "baggage": a single phantom vote of "1". The person with 2 true "2" votes will then have an average of (1+2+2)/3 = 1.67 where the person with 10000 true "2" votes will have an average of 1.9997. That alone may satisfy your criteria. Or to add the pessimistic lower bound idea, the person with 2 votes would have a pessimistic average score of 1.333 and the person with 10k votes would be 1.99948. (To be absolutely sure you'll never have the problem of zero standard error, use two different phantom votes. Or perhaps use as many phantom votes as there are possible vote values, one vote with each value.)
