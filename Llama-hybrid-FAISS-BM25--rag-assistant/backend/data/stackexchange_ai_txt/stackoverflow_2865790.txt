Seeking jQuery demo of sort and reorder like iPhone icons

I'm trying to duplicate the drag and reorder action of the icons on the iPhone screen. I want to rearrange divs on a page basically. Like in flickr when you organize your images... you drag one and others make room for it. The gap where you removed it from closes up. I want to do the same thing with divs that contain data. I did find one page here that offers some insight... but their demo doesn't even work. So the search continues. I'm new at jQuery, but am getting there. If I could locate a demo of this solution I could work with it. UPDATE... Meh... it is starting to look like I'll just use Sortables and just allow vertical sorting. That should work.
