Transform variables with zero-inflated values and positive skewness

I have over 30 features: several have zero-inflated and highly positive skewed distribution. Those distributions are expected because they are semi-continuous monetary related features. For example: Revenue earned by age. If 70% of all the respondents are unemployed and in school, most of them will have 0. I've read about the different methods: square/cube root, Box-Cox and logistic but I'm not sure which one would apply in my case. If I choose log and add a 1 to each value , what will be the impact? Could that make sense? How would the Box-Cox transformation be beneficial in this example and would it perform better than the logistic transformation ? Cube/square root seems to be an oversimplified technique to achieve this and doesn't seem to properly address my issue. Any thoughts? Note: My end-goal is to apply pca and then Kmeans clustering.
