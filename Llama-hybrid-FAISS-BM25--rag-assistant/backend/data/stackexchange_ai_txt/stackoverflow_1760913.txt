I used to care a lot. Over the last several years using modern IDEs pretty much everything is only 1 or 2 keystrokes away, I've let my standards relax substantially. Now, I start with statics, member variables, then constructors after that I don't worry about it much. In C# I do let Resharper organize things automatically.
