Identity columns can only be integers. If you want it to "look like" EMP001, EMP002, etc then that's simply a display issue and not a storage one (that is, you don't need to store "EMP001", "EMP002" etc, just store it as 1, 2, 3 via a normal identity column and display it in your application as "EMP001", "EMP002", etc)
