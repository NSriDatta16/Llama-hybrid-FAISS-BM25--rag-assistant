The residual plot does look unusual from the point of view of standard OLS (linear) regression. There is, for example, an indication of heteroscedasticity, specifically that the spread of the residuals is larger in the middle than at the two ends. This is not the real problem, however. The real issue here is that you have fit the wrong model. OLS regression is based on the assumption that the response is normally distributed (conditional on the regressorsâ€”i.e., your $X$ variables). Your response is not normal, and cannot be. Your response is a number of seats sold out of a total number of seats in the theater. Your response is binomial . A binomial cannot be modeled correctly with OLS. You need to fit a logistic regression model . There will be some additional issues you will need to address. A couple that are apparent from your description is that you have clustered observations, in the sense that you have multiple observations for the same show (i.e., over the 90 days). You need to address this non-independence, perhaps by fitting a GLMM . Another issue is that there will be a dependence between successive days within the same show. After all, if you have sold $y_d$ tickets on day $d$, you will have sold at least that many on day $d+1$. One way to try to address this is to fit only 89 days of data and to include the previous day's number as a covariate. (Sorry, on re-reading the question, I see you already have included a tickets sold till date variable.) There may well be more issues to be addressed in modeling your data. These are fairly advanced topics; if you aren't familiar with them, you may need to work with a statistical consultant.
