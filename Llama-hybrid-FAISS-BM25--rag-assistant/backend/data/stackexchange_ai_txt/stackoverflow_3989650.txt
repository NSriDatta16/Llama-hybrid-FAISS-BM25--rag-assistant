I decided for custom X-xxx-USER-AGENT one. Main reason to decide against more standard "User-Agent" is that is already "polluted" with http-client library or mobile-device information. A custom X-xxx-USER-AGENT is easier to parse for server and does not intervent http-library which often sets it and could override a custom entry.
