How to model a binary vector by the Beta-Bernoulli distribution in R or Python？

I have a set of data $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3,...)$ ;e.g: $x=(0.1,0.003,0.78,...)$ which follows a beta distribution. Since $x_i$ in my data $x :x_i ~ Bernoulli(p)$ , where $p$ is the prior of average $x$ and follows the Beta prior distribution, $p~Beta( α, β)$ . So is there any R or python script to model a binary vector by the Beta-Bernoulli distribution from my data $x$ ?
