First off, format your code better. It's really annoying having a single long line of code that you need to scroll horizontally to view. Just break it into multiple lines, like: You should also use OBJECT instead of EMBED , as EMBED is not a standard tag. And, according to this page , you need to specify a CLASSID parameter to embed the latest version of WMP. Then you need a uiMode param that tells WMP not to display the controls: Other options for uiMode include full , mini , and invisible . Edit: I personally prefer Quicktime/.mov over WMP/.wmv for embedding streaming video online, but the best cross-platform solution is to embed a Flash player and encode your video as an FLV. WMP/.wmv would be one of my last choices for embedding multimedia on a webpage (next to RealPlayer). According to this site , WMP browser plugin usage has dropped down to 67% since January (when it was at 72%), whereas Flash support has remained steady at 96-97%.
