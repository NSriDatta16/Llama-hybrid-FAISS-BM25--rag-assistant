That is a very ambiguous question. What you want can be done in many ways depending on what you actually want to do. How are your users going to enter the bar code? Are they going to use a bar code scanner? Are they entering the bar code numbers manually? Is this going to run on a desktop/laptop computer or is it going to run on a handheld device? Is the bar code scanner storing the bar codes for later retrieval or is it sending them directly to the computer. Will it send them through a USB cable or wireless?
