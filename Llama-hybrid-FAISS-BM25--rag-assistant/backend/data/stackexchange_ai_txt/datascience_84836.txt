how do tree based methods deal with missing feature columns?

all, i have trained a model using xgboost. Some of the features are one hot encoded e.g. currency where it is either gbp or usd. it seems that when i output the feature importance gbp and usd were in 7'th 8th place respectively. now i would like to use the model to predict whether defaulter or not on australian countries, however the currency for these is in AUD. Therefore when i apply my feature engineering it will create a column AUD once one hot encoded. since my model doesn't have AUD as a feature how does it handle features which have been unseen? i am not clear on this
