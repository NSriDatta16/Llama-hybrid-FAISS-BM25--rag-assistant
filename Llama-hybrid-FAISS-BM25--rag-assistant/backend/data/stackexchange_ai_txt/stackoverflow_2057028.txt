You could just subclass the UISegmentedControl and override - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { return; } method to manage the dragging and location of the touches. Being that you wouldn't be able to tell which segment the drag is on anyway, it might be better for you to do everything manually with touch and track it using those functions.
