Unless there's a substantive theoretical issue that is specific to your field, I think it will be hard to justify transforming similar or identical types variables in different ways, for what's-good-for-the-goose-should-be-good-for-the-gander reasons. Take a look at the Transformations for proportions and percents section in Nick Cox's transformation intro . Perhaps there will be something there that will work for all three proportions, and then we can work on the coefficient interpretations.
