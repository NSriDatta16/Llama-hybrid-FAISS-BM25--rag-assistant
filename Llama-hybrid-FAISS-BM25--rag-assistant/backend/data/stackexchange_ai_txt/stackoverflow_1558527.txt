Which GWT book to buy? Most seem to be for versions 1.4

I was thinking about getting GWT in Practice by Robert Cooper, or Google Web Toolkit Applications by Ryan Dewsbury However those are from May 08 and Dec 07. Both would be written for 1.4 - I was looking through the release notes to see what's changed since then: Nothing seems to have changed from 1.6 to 1.7 http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/1.7/ReleaseNotes_1_7.html But stuff seems to have changed from 1.5 to 1.6 "GWT 1.6 includes direct support for web archive (war) output, faster compilation, new widgets, new-and-improved event handling, and much more." http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/1.6/ReleaseNotes_1_6.html And seems to be changes from 1.4 to 1.5 http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5&s=google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5&t=WhatsNewinGWT15 I really want to get a book when I'm brand new to something because I'd rather flip through pages of distilled knowledge. But I'm concerned these books might be outdated. Any advice guys? Thanks! Ambert
