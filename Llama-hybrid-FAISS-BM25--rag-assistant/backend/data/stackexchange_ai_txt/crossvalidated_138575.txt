With very limited data, I would be more inclined to fit the data using Bayesian techniques. Stationarity can be a bit tricky when dealing with Bayesian time series models. One choice is to enforce constraints on parameters. Or, you could not. This is fine if you just want to look at the distribution of the parameters. However, if you want to generate the posterior predictive, then you might have a lot of forecasts that explode. The Stan documentation provides a few examples where they put constraints on the parameters of time series models to ensure stationarity. This is possible for the relatively simple models they use, but it can be pretty much impossible in more complicated time series models. If you really wanted to enforce stationarity, you could use a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and throw out any coefficients that are improper. However, this requires a lot of eigenvalues to be calculated, which will slow things down.
