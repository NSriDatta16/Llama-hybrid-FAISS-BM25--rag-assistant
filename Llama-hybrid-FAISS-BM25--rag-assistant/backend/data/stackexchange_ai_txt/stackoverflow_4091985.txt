Leaderboard rankings / mass data organization in MySQL

I am creating a new website that will be a 'leaderboard' for a game. Each user will have columns in the database for a statistic (e.g. kills, deaths, points, etc). I need to sort this data and give each user a global ranking for their statistic, which would be another column in the table. I have no idea where to start with this - how would I organize the tables in an efficient manner?
