I don't know the exact version that introduced Get/SetWindowLongPtr, but Delphi 2006 doesn't define either. The below declarations all come from Delphi 2006. WNDPROC's probably a TFNWndProc, in Windows.pas: TFarProc = Pointer; TFNWndProc = TFarProc; Classes.pas' StdWndProc's signature looks like this in Delphi 2006: function StdWndProc(Window: HWND; Message, WParam: Longint; LParam: Longint): Longint; stdcall; assembler; MSHTML.pas defines LONG_PTR as: LONG_PTR = Integer; This definition is the only mention of LONG_PTR in Delphi 2006's source directory.
