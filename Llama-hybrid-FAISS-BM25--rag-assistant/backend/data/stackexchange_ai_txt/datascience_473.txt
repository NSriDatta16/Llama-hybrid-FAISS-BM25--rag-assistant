Is logistic regression actually a regression algorithm?

The usual definition of regression (as far as I am aware) is predicting a continuous output variable from a given set of input variables . Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm, so it produces a categorical output. Is it really a regression algorithm? If so, why?
