optimal subset / joint distribution prediction with machine learning

How can I find the optimal subset of classes for a given entity? For context, say that we have some customers and data about these customers transactions, and a set of possible products to advertise to them. And the objective would be to find the best subset of products to advertise to a customer, such that the joint probability of purchasing all the products is maximized. Multi-label classification is an option to this problem, but to my understanding, the classical multi-label classification using sigmoid and log-loss over multiple classes is optimizing each class independently. I want to optimize jointly given the data. I have seen joint optimization of sentences in Language translation using RNN's, where beam search is used to select the joint optimal sequence from a set of different sequence predictions. But here, we feed in the predictions back into the model in a natural way, thus getting a probability estimate conditoinal on the previous class prediction as well as the data up to that point. Is a similar approach common for non-sequence models, where we can get a class probability estimate conditional on other class predictions as well as the data?
