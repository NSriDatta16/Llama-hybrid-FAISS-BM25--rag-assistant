You could try downloading the appropriate file and storing it in your isolated storage and try reading it from there. you could do this on application startup Since you only have strings in your resx i would suggest that you copy your resource items into a simple text with some predefined format and reading it from there. Let me know if you need help on any specific implementation details.
