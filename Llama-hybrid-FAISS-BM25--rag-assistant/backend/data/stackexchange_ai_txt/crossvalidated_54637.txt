Test for martingale

Given a time series, I am trying to determine whether the underlying stochastic process is a martingale or not. Until now, I have deduced that since I know that the process is always bounded after a deterministic time, if I can prove that it is a Brownian motion, I will be done. Is there a standard test for this?
