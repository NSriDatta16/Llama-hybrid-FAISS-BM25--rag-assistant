Estimate how many wrong measures there is in a sample

This study shows that the average penis mean is 13.24cm and the standard deviation is 1.89cm. Let's suppose we have a population with this mean and standard deviation for penis length. Suppose we ask 30 men in this population what their penis lengths are. Suppose that the selection of 30 men is so that all men from the population have the same probability of being selected. Can we know how many of them are lying about their penis length? Of course, if we calculate a sample mean of 18 cm, we can, based on the central limit theorem say that this sample is an outlier or that there is people lying about their penis size. But can we create a model to estimate how many of them are lying?
