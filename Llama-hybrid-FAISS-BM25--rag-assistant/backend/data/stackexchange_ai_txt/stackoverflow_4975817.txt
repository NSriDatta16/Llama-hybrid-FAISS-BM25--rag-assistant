I'm guessing you're asking so that you can make a simpler fallback animation for weaker systems? One option may be to check the user's hardware string as is mentioned here: GPU Chipset Detection . glGetString can return GL_VENDOR, GL_RENDERER, GL_VERSION, or GL_EXTENSIONS. You could theoretically use GL_VENDOR to identify Intel GMA's as too slow, or compare GL_RENDERER to a list of known poor-performing GPUs. If you're writing code for 10.6+ only, you only have to compare to GPUs used in Intel Macs, so the list shouldn't be too long. This might not be quite the elegant solution you're looking for, but it should do the trick. I would also provide the user with an override to choose the higher or lower quality graphics if they wish.
