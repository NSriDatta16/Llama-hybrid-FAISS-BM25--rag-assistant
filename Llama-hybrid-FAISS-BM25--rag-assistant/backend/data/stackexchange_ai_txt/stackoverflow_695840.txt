In my experience, the biggest problem with code coverage tools is the risk that somebody will fall victim to the belief that "high code coverage" equals "good testing." Most coverage tools just offer statement coverage metrics, as opposed to condition, data path or decision coverage. That means that it's possible to get 100% coverage on a bit of code like this: for (int i = 0; i ... without ever testing the termination condition on the for loop. Worse, it's possible to get very high "coverage" from a test that simply invokes your application, without bothering to validate the output, or validating it incorrectly. Simply put, low code coverage levels is certainly an indication of insufficient testing, but high coverage levels are not an indication of sufficient or correct testing.
