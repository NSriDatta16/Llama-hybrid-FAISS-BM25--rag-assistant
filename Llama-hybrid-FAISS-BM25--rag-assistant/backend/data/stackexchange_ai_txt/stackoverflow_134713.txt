By default, HTML elements are as tall as required to contain their content. If you give an HTML element a fixed height, it may not be big enough to contain its content. So, for example, if you had a paragraph with a fixed height and a blue background: This is an example paragraph. It has some text in it to try and give it a reasonable height. In a separate style sheet, we’re going to give it a blue background and a fixed height. If we add overflow: hidden, we won’t see any text that extends beyond the fixed height of the paragraph. Until then, the text will “overflow” the paragraph, extending beyond the blue background. p { background-color: #ccf; height: 20px; } The text within the paragraph would extend beyond the bottom edge of the paragraph. The overflow property allows you to change this default behaviour. So, if you added overflow: hidden : p { background-color: #ccf; height: 20px; overflow: hidden; } Then you wouldn’t see any of the text beyond the bottom edge of the paragraph. It would be clipped to the fixed height of the paragraph. display: none would simply make the entire paragraph (visually) disappear, blue background and all, as if it didn’t appear in the HTML at all.
