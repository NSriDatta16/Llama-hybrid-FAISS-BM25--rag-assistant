Perfect separation in logistic regression and data transformation -> can it help?

first of all, I am super happy that I found this great community. I am currently having trouble in my logistic regression analysis in that I get the error message display Warning message: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred I read a lot about the issues of perfect separation in this forum. A colleague told me that he is always using the log transformation of his data for his analysis (not logistic regression) and I noticed, that once I transformed the data, I won't get the error message anymore. Could this be a solution as well? For background information, this is my data structure: model With Customer.group being yes (1) or no (0) and Where Price.Index is a calculated measure for each customer consisting of the weighted sum of a price paid for a product in a category divided by the average price in this category. So it is not actual observed data, but a calculated measure.
