The mighty Bart de Smet talks about zip functions here: http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/11/03/c-4-0-feature-focus-part-3-intermezzo-linq-s-new-zip-operator.aspx His most elegant solution takes advantage of an overload of select that takes a 2 parameter Func delegate as its parameter. a.Select((t,i)=>new{t,i}); In this example, i simply represents the index of the item being processed. So you can create 2 new enumerables of these anonymous objects and join them on i. Performance-wise, I'd go with a more obvious yielding loop.
