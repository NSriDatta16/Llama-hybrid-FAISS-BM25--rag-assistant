In the RCP-Designer preview tab It only ever shows the first 500 rows. Mainly for performance I think. In Eclipse 3.5 (Ganymeade) you can go to Preferences->Report Design->Preview->Data and change the number of rows outputed there. Or you can try launching as html or web-viewer, and that might not do the 500 row limit. Once you run it in the correct runtime it wont limit the rows to 500.
