Invoice Extraction

What topics should I read on to prepare myself for data extraction from invoices (in image file or PDF). Basically I will have a file with invoice and need to extract from it such information as number, dates, lines and totals. I will probably use Python but not necessairly. I would appreciate any techinque/articles or event book recommendation. I want to do this task with understanding of what I am doing rather than simply running a library. I did read on Deep Learning in general (first few chapters of http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ ) but feel this problem is not exactly was this book is about. One additional practical problem I have in mind is that abviusly I will need a lot of example invoices to train my model. In addition to authentic invocies which I can gather myself (say one hundred) could "fake" invoices work? PS. If this StackExchange site is not the best for this type of Deep Learning question, please could you recommend a better StackExchange site.
