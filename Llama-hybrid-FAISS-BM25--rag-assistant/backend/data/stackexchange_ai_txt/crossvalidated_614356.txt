Fitting a Vertical Line to Points on a Plot

I have the following data, which produced the following plot. Predictor_Variable I need to fit a vertical line to the points on the plot that extend vertically up and down from the horizontal axis. This vertical portion is not perfectly centered, so I can't simply take the average of the values. Is there a nice, programmatic way of finding this vertical line?
