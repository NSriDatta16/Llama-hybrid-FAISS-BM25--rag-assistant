How to get a density from a forecast with prediction interval

Some reproducible code to have in your environment a time series and a possible forecast: packages % Cl() %>% log() %>% robets() %>% forecast(h = 250, level = seq(from = 51, to = 99, by = 1)) %>% autoplot() I would like to draw a random sample from the distribution of forecasted values, in order to possibly fit a probability density function. The value returned by forecast has some slots which might be useful, like $mean and $ residuals , but I don't know how to draw such a sample. Furthermore, aside from this specific example, I would like to understand the theoretical procedure to get a density from a forecast with expected value and prediction interval only.
