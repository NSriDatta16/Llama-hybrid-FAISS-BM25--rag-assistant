gbm.fit() in R language

I have a data with size of 1200 rows having binary dependent variable and around 20 independent variables which are categorical as well as continuous in nature. I have tried machine learning technique viz. Gradient boosting. I used gbm() in R. I was able to achieve 65-66% accuracy (checked through confusion matrix). I tried one more function gbm.fit() and then the model gave 94% accuracy and it predicted almost all of test data correctly. Is this correct? Also I don't know what gbm.fit() does. I will be glad to know the difference between the above 2 functions as well. Pardon me, i am new to machine learning.
