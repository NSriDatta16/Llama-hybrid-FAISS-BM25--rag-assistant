As a pragmatic approach what you are doing may be okay if you can keep the discipline and never use the DAL from the Web Layer. However, once the reference is there, this can be surprisingly hard to do - and what about other developers on the project? A better option is to split the web layer into two layers : The Application Bootstrapping layer . This is the real web project, but apart from bootstrapping the container and implementing the Views (.aspx pages) there should be nothing else. This is what we call a Humble Executable . It will contain references to all other projects in order to compose them (via the DI container), but otherwise it doesn't do anything. We call this the Register Resolve Release pattern . An Application Model layer . This project would contain all of your application logic (as opposed to domain logic): View Models and Controllers. It needs no reference to the DAL, but will get implementations injected into it by the DI container.
