How to make resizable li elements with CSS only

Scenario: I have an unordered list of width (lets say 200px) with four elements that are sized equally. Therefore each should be 50px. When I add a 5th element each width should re-size to 40px. If I change the width of the to 500px with 5 elements, each element should be 100px. Is this possible with only CSS? If yes, how is it implemented? Currently, I have a solution that meets the above requirements but it includes jQuery to re-size the elements based on mathematical calculations. Thanks for the attention.
