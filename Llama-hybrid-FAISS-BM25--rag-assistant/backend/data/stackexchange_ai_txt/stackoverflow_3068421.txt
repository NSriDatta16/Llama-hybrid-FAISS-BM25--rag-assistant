I wrote a blog post a while back on estimation anti-patterns. It's a funny read but sadly all of the patterns are things I've either seen done or heard of from colleagues. We've gone through about 3 of them on our current project; I don't think there's any team which manages to avoid all of them entirely! http://lizkeogh.com/2009/11/30/estimation-anti-patterns/ Also have a look into systems thinking, game theory and perverse incentives. If the devs are padding the estimates it's because the environment they're working in is encouraging them to do so. Changing that environment will help them.
