This really depends on the organisation, what you want to use your sites for, how your security structure will be, etc. so there is no single answer. Any best practice will only go so far for your unique situation. Just a wild stab in the dark, I'd make everything subsites except: Anything that is a self contained site, like a 'project site' -and- can grow really-really-really large (like their combined total would exceed 40-50GB) or really needs its own complex security structure. I'd create those as their own site collections. The news. You can create 1 News subsite and add different types of news using a different content type (and page layout). Unless you have 2 groups of users adding this news, in that case I would make a separate news subsite for each group. You can add .js or .css to every page using a delegate control. See this post.
