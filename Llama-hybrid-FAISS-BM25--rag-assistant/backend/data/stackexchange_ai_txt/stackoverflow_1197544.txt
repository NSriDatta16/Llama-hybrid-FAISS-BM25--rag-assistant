I'll hazard a NO , even though I'm a big fan of OSGi. Unless you're working with other OSGi bundles or you have a specific problem that you can't easily solve without this sledgehammer. The benefit is elegant classpath separation (IMHO). If you need different versions of the same JAR/class, say because you're upgrading certain portions of an app while it's running, or because you are combining a lot of 3rd party modules, then OSGi is great. That's not an easy thing to achieve, and it's not made easy with OSGi. It's made clean, but at a cost of another layer in the environment stack. And a lot of work to learn and maintain. Not to mention the documentation isn't particularly beginner-friendly. I suggest learning about it -- building Eclipse plugins is one very good way -- but not building it in to your dev plan until you know it well.
