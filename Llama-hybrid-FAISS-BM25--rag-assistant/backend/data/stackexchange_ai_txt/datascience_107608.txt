SVM is NOT needed at end. Last dense layer of CNN network should be dense layer with 10 neurons as there can be 10 logits outputs corresponding to 10 MNIST classes. Then apply a direct Softmax activation at end of above CNN dense layer with categorical cross entropy loss minimization to predict 10 probabilities for 10 possible digit classes. Many many code examples of this online by googling it. You can also find jumpstart projects on MNIST classification in DL and Vision on popular code repositories like Github and others.
