objective c. ScrollView: how to force it redraw visible part each time user scrolls?

I've got my own dynamically changing view inside scrollview. As my view is very big I usually redraw only it's visible part. But when I scroll up or down drawRect method isn't being called. I guess scroll view has a buffer to quickly react on user actions but I don't know exactly a mechanism how it works. UPD Thanks to Wienke, I've got a solution: to implement UIScrollViewDelegate. I've implemented scrollViewDidScroll method: -(void) scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)sender { CGRect visibleRect; visibleRect.origin = [scrollView contentOffset]; visibleRect.size = [scrollView bounds].size; [textField setNeedsDisplayInRect:visibleRect]; } So every time user scrolls even a little this method redraws the whole visible part. That's bad=( How can I redraw only... Let me call that "new region that appeared after scrolling". I guess it's much faster... Thanks for your attention.
