Based on your comment about the respawning dragons and lengthening lifespans, one thing to model would be the lifespan itself rather than the interim health values. If you look at lifespan as a function of generation number or start time, you may find a model that fits. You've observed the lifespans getting longer, and modeling can help you assess whether increase is linear, quadratic or something else. For within-lifespan predictions, the best case would be if all lifespans followed a similar curve, at least loosely. Then you can normalize things by looking at percent of lifespan passed as a function of current health. For past dragon lives, you can retroactively determine the percent of lifespan passed at each point. For the current lifespan, that's what you want to predict. Based on your other comment, the curve would not have a nice formula, but if they do follow similar patterns even something like a spline fit could be useful in making the prediction.
