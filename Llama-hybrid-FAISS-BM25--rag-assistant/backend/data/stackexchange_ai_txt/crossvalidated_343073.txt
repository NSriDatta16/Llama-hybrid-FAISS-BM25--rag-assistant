If you only have to solve this one variable problem, then go ahead and use the formula. There's nothing wrong with it. I could see you writing a few lines of code in ASM for an embedded device, for instance. In fact, I used this kind of solution in some situations. You don't need to drag large statistical libraries just to solve this one little problem, of course. The numerical instability and performance are issues of larger problems and general setting. If you solve multivariate least squares etc. For a general problem you wouldn't use this, of course.
