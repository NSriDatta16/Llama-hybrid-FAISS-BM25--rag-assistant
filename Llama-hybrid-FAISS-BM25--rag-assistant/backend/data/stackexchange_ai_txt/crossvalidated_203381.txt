How do I classify images with non-rectangle shape with CNN?

How do I choose filter? Should I zero-padding the rest of the image and make it a rectangle? Or in a more specific case, while dealing with brain fMRI datas, the 3D models where brains are represented are not perfectly matched into cubes. This may makes the traditional convolutional neural network problematic as it makes us harder moving a filter in all offsets. PS. 2D model (images) is just a simplification for my case. I am currently doing a brain fMRI classification model, though we can view the data in a 60*50*20 cube, but in fact, imagine the shape of the brain (the cube is just created for the ease of assigning coordinates or each voxel), over 50% of the cube has no data (no data means N/A, and not 0, they would not contribute anything to my model). So what should I do now?
