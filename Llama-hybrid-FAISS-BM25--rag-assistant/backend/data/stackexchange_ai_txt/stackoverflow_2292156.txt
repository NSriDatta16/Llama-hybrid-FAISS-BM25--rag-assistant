My answer applies to sortables, I think draggables should be similar. I was able to make it work by using 'clone' instead of the default 'orginal' and using appendTo: 'body'. It's weird because if you use original as the helper it doesn't seem to append the helper to the body even though you would think it should if you set appendTo:'body'. I hope you can get it working!
