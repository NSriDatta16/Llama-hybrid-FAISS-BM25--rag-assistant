Your description of what you're trying to do isn't entirely clear, but automatically naming variables something1, something2, etc. are generally a bad idea. Use a list instead: transientvariables = [] transientvariables.append(makenewtransientvariable()) # ... for tv in transientvariables: print tv Edit: OK, I think I see what you're getting at, although your explanation still isn't exactly easy to read. You have a collection of pipes, with a time series of temperature and pressure recorded for each one, right? The easiest way would be to use a dictionary: transients["tempPipe1"] Or nested dictionaries: transients["temp"]["Pipe1"] Or you could override your class' __getattr__ method, so that it looks in a dictionary, and you can do: transients.tempPipe1 Edit 2: Overriding __getattr__ would look a bit like this: def __getattr__(self, name): if name in self.varMap: return self.varMap[name] raise AttributeError
