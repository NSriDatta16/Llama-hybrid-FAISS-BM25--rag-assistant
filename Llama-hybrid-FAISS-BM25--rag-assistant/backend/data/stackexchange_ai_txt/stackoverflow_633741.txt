My guess, judging from the code you posted, is that you probably aren't allocating your array properly. When creating objects, you need to initialize them as well. Therefore, this: Kana *htemp = [Kana alloc]; Should be: Kata *temp = [[Kana alloc] init]; All objects need to be initialized this way. Thus, if I'm correct and you haven't initialized your array, then your creation needs to go from this: NSMutableArray *hiragana = [NSMutableArray alloc]; to this: NSMutableArray *hiragana = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; For optimization reasons, you should probably also specify an initial capacity as well if you have any idea how many objects you might hold: [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:someNumber];
