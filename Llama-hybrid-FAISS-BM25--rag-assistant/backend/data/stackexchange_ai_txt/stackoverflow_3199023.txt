How can I get links that match a regex using WWW::Mechanize?

I'm trying to use regular expressions to catch a link, but can not. I have all the links, but there are many links that do not want. What I do is to grab all links: http://valeptr.com/scripts/runner.php?IM= To comply with this pattern. I put the script I'm doing: use warnings; use strict; use WWW::Mechanize; use WWW::Mechanize::Sleepy; my $Explorador = WWW::Mechanize->new( agent => 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624', sleep => '5..20' ); #Proceed to access the URL to find all the links in emails $Explorador->get("file:/home/alejandro/Escritorio/hehe.php.html"); #If you want debug DOM Document. #print $Explorador->content(); my @links = $Explorador->links; foreach my $link (@links) { # Retrieve the link URL like: # http://valeptr.com/scripts/runner.php?IM=0cdb7d48110375. my $href = $link->url; foreach my $s ($href) { #Aqui la expresiÃ³n regular my @links = $s =~ qr{ ( [^B]* ) $ }x; foreach (@links) { print "\n",$_; } } } PS: I guess this regular expression will be more than seen but not seen. If so am coming back to put a post with the same. Problem: There is a heap of links and I need cojer the links that expire with the boss: Http: // valeptr.com/scripts/runner.php?IM= For it in the line 19 I have to apply an expression regulate. This variable my @links=$Explorador->links; he returns all the links that exist. But I want cojer only the link that I have put above. Sincerely,
