using markov matrices for projections

Top of the morning folks .. Business context i am doing an experiment with an index time series (NSE, India's national stock exchange ..NIFTY to be precise) and i am using markov matrices to project 1,3 and 6 months into the future. I have 3 different matrices (10 x 10 .. the states are from 5% ..with the states being daily changes) ..one for the bull phase, 1 for the bear and 1 for low volatility .. any ideas on how i could incorporate the projections into one forecast ? Stats context can i assume probabilities of these 3 scenarios and weigh each accordingly and use that as an aggregate forecast ? or can i create the markov chain probabilities using a monte carlo simulation ..so if the probability of moving from +1% to -1% is 0.09, 0.15 and 0.2 in the 3 phases , can i run MC simulations keeping a range of 0.09 to 0.2 for the state +1 to -1 and look at the result after, say 10k runs ? apologies if the mods feel this question belongs to a non stat forum. Regards, vikram
