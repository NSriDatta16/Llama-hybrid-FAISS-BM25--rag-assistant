I think your current under-performance is a data problem. The dataset in your google sheet seems like it contains far too few features that you could conceivably use to predict whether someone would win a tennis match. You should consider some creative feature-engineering options. Stuff like (but not limited to): how many wins or loses in a row has this tennis player had what is the weather during the game how many years of professional tennis have they played how many tournaments have they won (somehow encode their previous accolades) Additionally - you might want to re-structure your data. The schema of having one player on the left and the other on the right of the same row will always make the machine learn that there's a distinction between right and left, when in fact this is just a bias you are introducing via featurizing. You could consider a system whereby you double-up your data and put each match where player 1 is on the left and then the right. This could conceivably force your estimator to consider the match from both sides. As for the estimator consider looking into some ensemble methods like gradient boosting classifier, or random forest classifier instead of logistic regression.
