Is a distribution that is normal, but highly skewed, considered Gaussian?

I have this question: What do you think the distribution of time spent per day on YouTube looks like? My answer is that it is probably normally distributed and highly left skewed. I expect there is one mode where most users spend around some average time and then a long right tail since some users are overwhelming power users. Is that a fair answer? Is there a better word for that distribution?
