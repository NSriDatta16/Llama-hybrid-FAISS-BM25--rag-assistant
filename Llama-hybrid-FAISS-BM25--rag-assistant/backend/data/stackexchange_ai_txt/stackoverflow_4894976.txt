Django Custom File Storage system

I have a custom storage import os from django.core.files.storage import Storage class AlwaysOverwriteFileSystemStorage(Storage): def get_available_name(self, name): """ Directly Returns a filename that's from what user input. """ if self.exists(name): # Remove the existing file os.remove(name) # Return the input name as output return name I want to know where should I put his AlwaysOverwriteFileSystemStorage.py file and how should by settings.py define DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE My Django root folder is /home/username/webapp When I put DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'site.storage.AlwaysOverwriteFileSystemStorage' , it returns an Error Error importing storage module site.storage: "No module named storage" I am not familiar with Python/Django, any help will be much appreciated. Thank you.
