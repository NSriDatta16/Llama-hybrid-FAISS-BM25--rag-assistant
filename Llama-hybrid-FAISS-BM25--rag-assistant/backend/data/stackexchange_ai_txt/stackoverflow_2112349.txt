I think that you are going in the right way. But I will send some suggestions; Move the self.testdata.close() from setUp() to the tearDown() function. Surround the others open/close with try/finally blocks. So, if a file didn't open with success it will be closed. try: file.open() finally: file.close() Organize better your test folders. I suggest you to create a folder named _tests and inside this folder you should put the tests module (at your case you only have one module). Then, for each module create a folder with the name of the module and puts the files used by the tests of a module inside this folder. To know more about TDD and tests you should read the book Test Driven Development: By Example
