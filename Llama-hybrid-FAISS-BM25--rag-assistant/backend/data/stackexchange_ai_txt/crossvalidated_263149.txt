No. There are only two outcomes in logistic regression, adding a zero-inflated component is pointless. Also, having many zeroes does not imply zero-inflation. Zero-inflation means more zeroes than expected under your model. So first fit the model and you'll see that it will manage to deal with the zeroes.
