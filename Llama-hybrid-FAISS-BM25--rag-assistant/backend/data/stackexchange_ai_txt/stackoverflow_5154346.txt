Duplicate file take different times to read

can anyone tell me why two files - duplicates of each other - take different times to load in memory? var fileStream = new FileStream(filename, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read, 16 * 1024, FileOptions.SequentialScan); It's this line that is slow (one file takes 3 times as long...) fileStream.CopyTo(Form1.GlobalMS); ODDLY, when I copy the file (in cmd window) and then try to load that file - it loads very fast... almost as if newly created files are somehow more accessible - could this be something to do with old files getting fragmented in someway? These are all 1G plus files by the way
