How to control for common method bias?

I am doing CFA to test for common method bias using an unmeasured latent construct method. The average common variance I am getting from the common factor is about 31% which is high (as should be less than 25%). I checked for differences in p-values of the trait loadings (between CFA model with ULC and without ULC) and p-values become insignificant for only one scale. What can I do to control the effect of common method variance statistically in this case? I am doing a moderation analysis and I have 6 variables
