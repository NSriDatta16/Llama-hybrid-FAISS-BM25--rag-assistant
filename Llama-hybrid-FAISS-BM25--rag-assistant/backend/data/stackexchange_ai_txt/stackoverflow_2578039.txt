Best way is to create normal movie file and play it with standard controller. If it's unacceptable, you can do something like this. Two threads, one thread loads images from disk, another one shows them per 1/15 (1/30, whatever) of a second. There are several difficulties: iPhone flash storage speed. It's very limited. So you can do something like 128x128 animation with ease, and fail to do so with full-screen one. Such flash using drains battery very fast. Maybe, you can also store some part of your animation in memory (every second frame for example) so you'll have to load less from flash.
