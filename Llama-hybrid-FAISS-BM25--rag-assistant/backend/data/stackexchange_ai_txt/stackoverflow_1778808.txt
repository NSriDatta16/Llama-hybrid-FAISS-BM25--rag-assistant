You already defined the instance variable name in Combatant . Thus Enemy and Player inherit this variable. You don't need to redeclare it. Some of the other answers are also valid and better coding practice. If you don't want to change your code to use either set/get methods or using constructors you can use what are called initializer blocks . The code written in an initializer block is executed by java when an instance of the class is created. public class Enemy extends Combatant { { name = "Dragon"; } } public class Player extends Combatant { { name = "Hero"; } } But be aware that this has some maybe unexpected side effects too. e.g. Consider you declare Enemy2 like this and use it in TestRPG1 instead of Enemy . public class Enemy2 extends Enemy { } .... dragon = new Enemy2(); .... What do you expect the program to output? null or Dragon as name? It will output Dragon . Why? Because initializer blocks are also executed for child classes constructors.
