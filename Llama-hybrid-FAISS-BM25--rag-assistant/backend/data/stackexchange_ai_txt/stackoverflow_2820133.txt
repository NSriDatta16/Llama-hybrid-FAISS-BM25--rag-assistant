I can think of 3 things : 1) You can make code look like code by putting 4 spaces infront of each line. The reason you've gt no answers so far is probably because your question is almost unreadable ;) 2) In your stop method you might want to try this : - (void) stop { [_player stop]; self._player = nil; } 3) Apple highly discourage using an underscore in front of member names. I've never run into problems but I'd rename _player to player .
