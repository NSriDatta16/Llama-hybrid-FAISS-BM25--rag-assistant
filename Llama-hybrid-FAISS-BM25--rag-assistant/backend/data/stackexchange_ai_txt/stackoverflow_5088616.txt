How to implement the zoom trick as in Google Maps?

I would like to rephrase the question I asked before. Let's say there are three images of different size: small, medium, and large. They represent basically the same picture but with different resolutions and so they are slightly different. I would like to display a small image first. When a user zooms it in I would like to replace it with the medium one. Now the user can drag the picture and scroll it in the window. When the user zooms out the medium image, I would like to replace it with the small one, etc. I guess Google Maps does the same trick. What is the best way to implement this trick in javascript (flash is the second option) ?
