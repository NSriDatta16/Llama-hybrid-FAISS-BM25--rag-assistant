Understanding the block coverage measures of Block Testing

I am trying to understand Block Testing using the book: "How we test software at Microsoft" by Alen Page, Ken Johnston, Bj Rollison. On page 118 and 119 of the book I am given two block function examples. I have provided pictures of these functions: Block Example 1 Block Example 2 The book says that block coverage measures the number of contiguous groups of statements unbound by branches. I believe I am not understanding this. Can someone explain why int x = 0, y = 0, z = 0; if (condition) is considered 1 block in BlockExample1 and int x = 0, y = 0, z = 0; if (condition 1 && condition2) is considered 4 Blocks in BlockExample2 ?
