If I understand your PCA model, you started with 13 prospective variables. And, your PCA model used only 7 of those 13 variables that it recombined in a certain number of Principal Component functions. And, this PCA model using just 7 of the 13 prospective variables performs really well. You observe that the correlations between the Xs are very low at = If your 7 X variables have strong correlations with Y, and not with each other; It is very likely you will generate a model with a high R Square (explaining much of the variance of Y)regardless if it is a PCA or an OLS regression. The fact that 6 of the 13 variables are superfluous is a very common occurrence with such models. However, near perfect model performance usually triggers caution. Make sure that your model is not overfit. Your model may fit the data. But, is it predictive? Does it do well in hold out out-of-sample testing, testing on new data, or cross validation. Also, are your Y and Xs variables properly transformed? If you have time series data, you should make sure that such variables are fully detrended to render them stationary. Otherwise, it is very easy to get what looks like perfect models that are truly meaningless and non-predictive. Clive Granger has covered those situations with papers on spurious regressions.
