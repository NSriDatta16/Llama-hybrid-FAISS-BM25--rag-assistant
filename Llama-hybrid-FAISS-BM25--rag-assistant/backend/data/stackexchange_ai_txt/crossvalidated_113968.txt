Identifying what contributes to the increase in one variable

Say I have a dataset with several continuous and categorical variables, and I want to identify what variables (values or properties of these variables) may cause one of the continuous variables to increase. How can I model this problem? Several approaches come to mind (e.g. logistic regression , ANOVA , decision trees ) but most (all?) of them require that I define a condition on my target variable and thus make it a categorical variable and/or treat the problem as a classification problem . But what if my dependent variable is a continuous variable and I am looking for properties of the independent variables (continuous and categorical) that make my dependent variable to increase? Is linear regression the best I can do? What if my goal is to find ranges of the predictors that correlate statistically with increases of my dependent variable? What models do I have available for this problem, and most importantly, what questions should I ask myself about the problem to identify the proper one?
