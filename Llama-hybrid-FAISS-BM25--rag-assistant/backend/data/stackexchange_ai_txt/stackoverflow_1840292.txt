I answered this already in another question Code objects are not related to tangible real-life objects; they are just constructs that hold related information together. Don't believe what the Java books/schools teach about objects; they're lying. Just write something that gets the job done, even if it's ugly, then refactor continuously: eliminate duplicate code ( don't repeat yourself ) increase cohesion reduce coupling But: don't over-engineer; keep it simple don't write stuff you ain't gonna need If you don't end up with massive (and useless) class hierarchy, then you have done a good job, producing elegant and clean code. Remember: OOP is a means, not an end.
