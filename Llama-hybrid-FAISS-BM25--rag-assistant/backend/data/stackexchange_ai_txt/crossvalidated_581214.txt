LDA & PCA are used just in different circumstances. Clustering & PCA are unsupervised. LDA is supervised. - here is good explanation of differencies b/w unsupervised & supervised methods. The main aim of Clustering, as part of EDA, is grouping... or even if outliers are forming Gaussian mixture => Novelty appearance in ds (e.g. compared with another ds). Then you can calc. responces to these generalized groups. But either such grouping will lead to dimensionality reduction or not depends on data themselves. But whether such grouping will lead to dim_reduction or not - depends on case/chance (on data). PCA (also part of EDA) really aims for dimensionality reduction if you have tooo great quantity of features, extracting Principal Components that input into variety in ds. Also used for outliers removal in pre-modelling stage (as is before modelling dependencies). N.B. Non-Gaussian distributed data causes PCA to fail.
