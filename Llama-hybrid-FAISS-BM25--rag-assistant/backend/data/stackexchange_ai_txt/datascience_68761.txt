Bayesian regularization vs dropout for basic ann

Does it make sense conceptually to apply dropout to an artificial neutral network while also applying bayesian regularization? On one hand I would think that technically this should work just fine, but on the other hand if bayesian regularization is like finding the MAP estimate given some prior shouldn't the effect just be that it creates random noise in your outcomes?
