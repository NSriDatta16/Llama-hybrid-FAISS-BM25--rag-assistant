http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#General_principles Date and time values are organized from the most to the least significant: year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The lexicographical order of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This allows dates to be naturally sorted by, for example, file systems. Go ahead with string sorting. If wikipedia is not enough, then surely http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt is, search for strcmp in there.
