stepwise, forward and backward selection when the regressors are too much correlated

Why automated variable selection methods like stepwise regression, backward elimination and forward stepwise regression are not suitable when the regressors suffer from multicollinearity? Could anyone give me some formal explanation of this fact? Could these methods be used also for selecting the regressors in a logistic regression?
