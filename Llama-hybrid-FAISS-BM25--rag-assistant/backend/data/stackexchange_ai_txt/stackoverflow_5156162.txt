First architecture-wise it's OK to build a REST data access layer above a storage see Microsoft's Azure docs for example http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179423.aspx Naturally you will encounter some sort of performance hit when moving outside the app engine and making your queries via urlfetch. I would suggest comparing the billing on datastore vs urlfetch before making the move. If you do create a DAL to make these REST calls to a remote DB, there is no reason to actually make urlfetches to you GAE datastore. Simply write an app engine provider that makes these DB call directly with DataStore API http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/package-summary.html
