For usability reasons, the global navigation generally shouldn't change. Users will expect to see the same options available to them and will get confused (and leave) if they aren't. Could you explain the requirement more? EDIT: Usability issues aside, try adding all necessary items to the top nav, then use Javascript to toggle between tabs. If you don't want to change the navigation PHTML files to add IDs to them, you can use the existing classes to target which nav items to show and which to hide. Since Magento stores cannot function without JS anyway, you should be pretty safe with that solution. Preferably, you can change the top nav's template (I believe app/design/frontend/base/default/template/page/template/links.phtml in 1.4) to use IDs for those LIs as well, in which case you can target those instead. Thanks, Joe
