Conduct PCA to assess proxy measurements of Likert-style scale

I have a two-dimensional Likert-style scale and multiple proxy measurements thereof. Is it possible to compute a Principal Component Analysis to see which of the proxy measurements best reflect this Likert-style scale? I am aware that PCA is usually a technique to reduce the total amount of items in a questionnaire, but thought I can make respective deductions from the factor loadings of a Varimax rotated PCA. I would continue by expanding the original Likert-style scale with the proxy measurements that show the highest loadings and subsequently test the internal reliability with the Cronbach's Alpha. Does that sound like a legitimate plan? Please note, that I am only looking into this in the scope of my thesis and have little to no statistic skills (thats also why I would want to avoid Structural Equation Modelling what seems to be the alternative).
