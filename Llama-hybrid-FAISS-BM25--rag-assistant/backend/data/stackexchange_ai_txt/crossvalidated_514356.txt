Fibonacci numbers and Markov chains I remember a question in which the Fibonacci numbers occurred . While computing the waiting time for the probability of flipping '1-0-0' the probabilities of the state '1' and the state '1-0' are Fibonacci numbers (divided by some power of 2). We can simulate this in several ways Example 1 Generate random binary numbers of length $n$ Eliminate the numbers with double 1's Count the fraction of the numbers with a single '1' at the end among the remaining ones Example code library(binaryLogic) set.seed(1) ### string length n Example 2 This example shows a bit better the similarity with a Markov Chain. Ratio's like these may occur a lot in practice. Requirements: 1 vase/urn 1 fair coin a lot of red and blue marbles (or any other tokens to express a binary option) Algorithm: Start with some marbles in the vase. Draw a marble and remove it Flip twice a coin. For each tails: put a marble of the opposite colour into the vase (opposite to the colour of the removed marble. For each heads: if the removed marble was red, then put a red marble into the vase. Repeat 2 and 3 untill you are fed up with it. Count the ratio of red and blue marbles Example code ### initiate ### we start with some red and blue marbles set.seed(1) red
