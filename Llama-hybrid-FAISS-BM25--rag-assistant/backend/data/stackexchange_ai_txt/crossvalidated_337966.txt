Distances between random points in a hypercube and statistics of exponents

TL;DR: Why is $\text{avg}\left(|a-b|^k\right)=\frac{2}{(k+1)(k+2)}$? I.e. for $k=2$, as for finding average Euclidian distances, the result is $\frac{1}{6}$? I've been reading a book about "Corobs," and having little understanding of math and statistics, I've been wondering why this particular (paraphrased) formula is true: In a unit $n$-cube, the distance between two random points quickly approaches $\sqrt{\frac{n}{6}}$ as $n$ grows larger than 20. In the shower one day, it dawned on me that since the distance formula adds up a bunch of positive numbers, by the law of averages, it makes sense that the expected distance is $\sqrt{\frac{n}{C}}$, where $C$ is some constant. I was trying to remember some simulations I've run. The average absolute difference between two random numbers (range=0-1) is $\frac{1}{3}$. Squaring that gives $\frac{1}{9}$. So why isn't the average distance $\sqrt{(\frac{1}{3})^2+...+(\frac{1}{3})^2}$? I realized it's because we're averaging the total distance, not the differences in each dimension -- which means that we need to simulate the average square of the differences. So rather than figuring $\text{avg}\left(a-b\right)^2$, figure $\text{avg}\left((a-b)^2\right)$. I found that the average square of the difference between two random numbers between 0 and 1 is $\frac{1}{6}$, which makes sense when plugged into the distance formula: $\sqrt{\frac{1}{6}+....+\frac{1}{6}} = \sqrt{\frac{n}{6}}$. However, I still don't understand quite why it's $\frac{1}{6}$ for each dimension and not $\frac{1}{9}$. So I did some more simulations. I quickly noticed a strange pattern for expected differences raised to some power $k$: from numpy.random import * def avg(numbers): return float(sum(numbers)/max(1, len(numbers))) for k in range(1,13): print("k="+str(k)+": 1/"+str( round(1.0/avg([abs(random()-random())**k for _ in range(1000000)])))) Result (I added my notes in parentheses): k=1: 1/3 (3=1*3) k=2: 1/6 (6=2*3) k=3: 1/10 (10=2*5) k=4: 1/15 (15=3*5) k=5: 1/21 (21=3*7) k=6: 1/28 (28=4*7) k=7: 1/36 (36=4*9) k=8: 1/45 (45=5*9) k=9: 1/55 (55=5*11) k=10: 1/66 (66=6*11) k=11: 1/78 (78=6*13) k=12: 1/91 (91=7*13) ... It appears that for any power $k$, the result is $\frac{2}{(k+1)(k+2)}$. Is this intuitive to anyone? Where does this pattern come from, and what's the math behind it?
