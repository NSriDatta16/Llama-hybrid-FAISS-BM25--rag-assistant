If you have not requested offline access for the application you created for the user you are trying to authenticate with, then you need to login to facebook before the application will work. It doesn't have anything to do with AMFPHP. I don't know what kind of environment you are running but take a look at this tutorial . You should be able to glean what you need in order to get your application running. if (isset($_POST['tt'])){ try { $statusUpdate = $facebook->api('/me/feed', 'post', array('message'=> $_POST['tt'], 'cb' => '')); } catch (FacebookApiException $e) { d($e); } Note that $_POST['tt'] is a variable set by the form in the example code. You can use whatever you want in that for example. $statusupdate = $facebook->api('/me/feed', 'post', array('message'=>$myMessage, 'cb'=>''); Pay close attention to step 3 . In that code sample they give some FBML tags that will take care of putting a login/logout button onto your page that will handle logging in the user. Then you don't have to maintain another tab in the browser with facebook logged in on it. Good luck!
