How to adjust/normalize/standardize mean?

I am making a reviews/ratings section for a website, with ratings that range from 0-5 stars. I am not confident that the users of this system will all have the same idea of what these stars mean, so I'd like to pin the average to 3 and pin the standard deviation to 1, and then display the adjusted values for the ratings that the users enter. So if users rate most things 4, then 3 becomes the new 4. Or if users rate most things 0, then 3 becomes the new 0, and all other values are adjusted accordingly (not in the way they are stored, just in the way they are displayed). How should I go about doing this? What is the terminology I should be searching for? I would call this normalizing the data, but the internet seems to have a lot of different ideas about what "normalizing" means.
