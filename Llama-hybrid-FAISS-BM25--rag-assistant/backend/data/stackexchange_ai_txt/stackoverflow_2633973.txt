Displaying a bitmap of arbitrary size without running out of memory

How do I display an image of arbitrary size without OOMing or downscaling the image. I dont want to downscale due to zooming and dragging of the picture? If it isnt possible to display an image of arbitrary size, how do I determine the maximum possible size of the image to display, without causing a OOM?
