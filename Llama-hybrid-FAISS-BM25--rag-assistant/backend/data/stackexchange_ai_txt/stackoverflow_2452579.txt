Decomposition of an IP header

I have to do a sniffer as an assignment for the security course. I am using C and the pcap library. I got everything working well (since I got a code from the internet and changed it). But I have some questions about the code. u_int ip_len = (ih->ver_ihl & 0xf) * 4; ih is of type ip_header , and its currently pointing the to IP header in the packet. ver_ihl gives the version of the IP. I can't figure out what is: & 0xf) * 4;
