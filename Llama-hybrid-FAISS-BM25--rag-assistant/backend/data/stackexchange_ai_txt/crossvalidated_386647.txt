My instinct tells me that this is a panel data problem, since we are looking at test scores both cross-sectionally across individual test-takers, and longitudinally over three testing periods Yes, you are correct. If a dataset has a combination of cross-sectional and time series data, then it is a panel dataset. That said, depending on how big your dataset, you should ensure that you have enough observations across both subjects and time periods to ensure that you have a statistically significant sample size when generating the regression. Fixed Effects: Effects that are independent of random disturbances, e.g. observations independent of time Random Effects: Effects that include random disturbances As you mentioned, this analysis can be accomplished in Python and R, but I will use R for this example. To determine whether your model should be random or fixed, you should firstly apply what is known as the Hausman test. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis, then a random effects model is preferred. However, if the null hypothesis is rejected, then a fixed effects model is preferred due to the estimator being at least as consistent as the random one under this scenario. As an example, let's run the Hausman test on the gasoline data example in R: > library(plm) > > data("Gasoline", package = "plm") > form wi re phtest(wi, re) Hausman Test data: form chisq = 302.8, df = 3, p-value With a p-value of less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected at the 5% level and this indicates that a fixed effects model is preferred. In this regard, a "within" model would be generated using plm: library(plm) plmwithin Taking the above into account, my suggestion would be to run a preliminary Hausman test on your data to determine if the model should be fixed or random, and proceed accordingly.
