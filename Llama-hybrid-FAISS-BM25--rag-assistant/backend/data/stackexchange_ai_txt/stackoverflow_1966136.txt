Don't store the specs in some obscure format that isn't widely available. The tool should not dictate the form of the document. The documents may need to be used by someone outside your group who is only familar with word. Yes, the specs/docs should be stored in a separate repository from the code. Managing a code repository has different requirements than a document repository. You can use the same parallel organization structure (i.e. same project names, hierarchy etc.) in the document repository, which should make it easy enough to find the relevant documents. There should not be a separate repository for each spec/doc. The organization should reflect the organization of the code repository. Do you have a separate repository for every code file in every project? Yes, it is common to put a revision history in the specs/documents regardless of the repository. Documents may need to be used across organizations, and people outside the organization may not have access to the source control but may still need to make changes (which someone in your organization can manage/check in). More commonly, often the documents need to be used across different company departments (i.e. reviewed by the UI team, sales, marketing who don't have access to/familiarity with repositories).
