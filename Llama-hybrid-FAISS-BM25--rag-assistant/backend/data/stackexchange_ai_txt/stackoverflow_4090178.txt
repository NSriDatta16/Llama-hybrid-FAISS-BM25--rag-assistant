Search DB (of businesses) by location

I'm designing a MySQL database and a corresponding RoR app that will hold various businesses, each business will have an address. A requirement of this application is to search the database by City/Country (this will hold businesses across Europe/UK). The search results will be returned by the nearest city in that country. Here is a rough ERD: What is the best way to organize the DB? Should I move the city field into its own table? Should I store GPS coordinates for each business? Thanks!
