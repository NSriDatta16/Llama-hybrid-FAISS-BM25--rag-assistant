XGBoost vs ARIMA for Time Series analysis

Doing time series analysis, I have doubts on choosing the right model. I want to predict the next 30 mins window, from the input dataset which contains the no. of error count for that particular 1 min interval. Should I use XGBoost or ARIMA regressions? Most of article or tutorial I found online use ARIMA for time series, while XGBoost is used more in Kaggle competitions.
