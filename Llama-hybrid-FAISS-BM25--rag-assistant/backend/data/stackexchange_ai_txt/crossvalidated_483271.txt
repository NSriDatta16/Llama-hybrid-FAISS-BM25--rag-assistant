How to merge probability distributions / histograms?

I'm wondering how to create a better predictive distribution based on past conditional events in a stock. For example, suppose I observe that historically after a 5% drop in a stock, tomorrow's distribution has a mean of 1% and a variance of 2% Let's call it conditional distribution 1 N [1%,2%] But then supposed I observe also that historically, since tomorrow is Friday, that every Friday the stock has a mean of 0% and a variance of 3% Let's call it conditional distribution 2 N [0%,3%] Both of these distributions give different results for tomorrow and my intuition tells me that I should take both pieces of data into account to create a new conditional distribution for tomorrow (Friday). How would I approach and create one distribution for what's going to happen tomorrow? I don't think averaging out the mean and variance is the correct approach to this? Would I add weights to the data and create a new distribution by merging the data from both distributions? Would I somehow integrate the normal distributions? Would appreciate any help.
