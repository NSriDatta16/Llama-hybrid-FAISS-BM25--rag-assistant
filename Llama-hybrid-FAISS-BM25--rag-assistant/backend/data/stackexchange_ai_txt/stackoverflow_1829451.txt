I'm not familiar with XNA specifically but I'll give a few suggestions. For one thing, you probably want to keep the pieces in a 2D array or similar rather than having them in their own variables (like wknight1). Otherwise you'll have to check every variable every time the user clicks. I'm assuming you want a system where the user clicks a piece to select it, then clicks an empty square to move it there. Here's some pseudo-code for something like that (I'm using a null board location to mean an empty square here): if(mouse.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed && board[mouse.x][mouse.y] != null && pieceSelected == null) { pieceSelected = board[mouse.x][mouse.y]; selectedX = mouse.x; selectedY = mouse.y } else if (mouse.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed && board[mouse.x][mouse.y] == null && pieceSelected != null) { board[selectedX][selectedY] == null; board[mouse.x][mouse.y] = pieceSelected; pieceSelected = null; } You can add in further conditions like isAValidMove(pieceType, startx, starty, finishx, finishy) where you check that the player is trying to move their own piece and that it's a legal chess move etc. You could probably make this more elegant and OO (and/or event-driven) too (and add click-and-dragging etc) but I'm keeping it simple to illustrate the basic logic.
