According to the C standard, it is undefined behaviour to have more than one references to a variable in a single sequence point (here you can think of that as being a statement, or parameters to a function) where one of more of those references includes a pre/post modification. So: foo(f++,f) Typically a compiler will not change its behaviour for this type of thing (except for major revisions). Avoid it by turning on warnings and paying attention to them.
