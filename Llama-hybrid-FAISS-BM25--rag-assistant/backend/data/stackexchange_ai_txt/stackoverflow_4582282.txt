MouseDragged not released when dragging on other views

I have 2 subclasses of NSView that are subviews to a common superview. They dont overlap and they both intercept mousedragged calls. When I drag from one of the subclasses to the other the mousedragged function will be called until I release the mouse button even when I drag all over the screen. I though the default behavior was for the mousedragged function to be called only when the mouse was over the bounds of the receiver. Iam also using NSTrackingArea for mouse enter, exit and move events, but from what I've been reading does not involve drag events Thank you for your time, Jose.
