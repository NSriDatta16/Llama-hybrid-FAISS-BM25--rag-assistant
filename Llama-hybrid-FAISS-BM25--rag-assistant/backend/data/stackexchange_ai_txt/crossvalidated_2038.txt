Interpretation of biplots in principal components analysis

I came across this nice tutorial: A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R. Chapter 13. Principal Component Analysis: The Olympic Heptathlon on how to do PCA in R language. I don't understand the interpretation of Figure 13.3: So I am plotting first eigenvector vs the second eigenvector. What does that mean? Suppose eigenvalue corresponding to first eigenvector explains 60% of variation in data set and second eigenvalue-eigenvector explain 20% of variation. What does it mean to plot these against each other?
