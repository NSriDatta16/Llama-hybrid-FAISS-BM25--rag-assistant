Along with AES_ENCRYPT for the fields, if you are storing sensitive information, better enable SSL over the wire too. Also consider network separation (vlan) of the sensitive database machines and other standard security practices. Key storage is important (where is that shared aes key hanging out, surely not on the webserver(s)!) and consider the impact on indexes/queries since searching or joining table data will not be as simple as it once was.
