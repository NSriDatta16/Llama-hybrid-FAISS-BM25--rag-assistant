Image generation based on sketch

Are there any instances of image generation models, where an image (a very rough sketch) has been used as an input and was then augmented. For example: This could be a rough sketch, which is then augmented to an image that looks a little bit more like a dog (not a realistic one of course). I was thinking about using GANs for this but I don't think that using this sketch instead of the random noise for the generator input will do it. Thanks!
