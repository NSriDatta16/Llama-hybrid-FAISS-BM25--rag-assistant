Q&A answer comparison multiple sentences using

I have been working on a Q&A app that has a template of questions and answers. The hope is to take answer text from the user, and compare it to the correct answer. I’d like to weight it on the keywords/buzzwords and general accuracy of the response. I’m a mobile developer, not quite a data scientist or well versed in machine learning, so I’m a bit lost in the woods here and not sure if I’m going down the right path. I’ve been looking into natural language process and some related python libraries/models that evaluate sentences. Am I headed in the right direction? or should I go about this another way?
