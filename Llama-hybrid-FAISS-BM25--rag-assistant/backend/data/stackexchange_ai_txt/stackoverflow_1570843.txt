Here's the language agnostic version which you should be able to convert into any language: ONE_MINUTE = 60 ONE_HOUR = 60 * ONE_MINUTE ONE_DAY = 24 * ONE_HOUR ONE_WEEK = 7 * ONE_DAY ONE_MONTH = ONE_DAY * 3652425 / 120000 ONE_YEAR = ONE_DAY * 3652425 / 10000 def when(then): seconds_ago = now() - then if seconds_ago Note that the year/month figures are approximate (based on averages) but that shouldn't really matter since the relative error will still be very low.
