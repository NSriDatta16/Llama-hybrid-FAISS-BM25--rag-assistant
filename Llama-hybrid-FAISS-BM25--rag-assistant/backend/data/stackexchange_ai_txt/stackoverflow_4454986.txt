Is there a way to view wireshark .pcap files in Fiddler?

Is there a way to convert wireshark .pcap files to a format that fiddler understands? Every so often we get network traces generated from wireshark in .pcap files. Most of the time the traces contain mostly HTTP traffic which I find much easier to analyze using fiddler.
