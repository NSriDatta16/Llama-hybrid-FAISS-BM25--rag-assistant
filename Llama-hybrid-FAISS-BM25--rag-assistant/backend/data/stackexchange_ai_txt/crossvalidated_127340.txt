How to perform a conditional cross-tab in R or Excel?

I recently was given a project which consists of: pulling together words from ~500 small tweets and doing a matrix, which shows which words occur together in which tweets. I am wondering how I can perform this crosstab (or matrix) to see which words occur together. A basic count will suffice, but it has to be done by tweetID (the unique identifier for each tweet). So I am thinking of something that would look like this on a much larger scale, where a number indicates the amount of times they showed up in the same paragraph: Ability Amplify Ascertain Aspire Assimilate Ability 1 1 0 1 0 Amplify 1 1 0 0 1 Ascertain 0 0 1 1 0 Aspire 1 0 1 1 0 Assimilate 0 1 0 0 1 I have tried to use the reshape cast package, as my data is laid out as such: tweetID word 1 Ability 1 Aspire 1 Blah2 2 Ability 2 Aspire 2 Blah3 3 Amplify 3 Assimilate But have had no luck. Eventually, we would like to do a sort of network analysis to show which words interact with one another, but I don't necessarily care about the tweetID beyond just helping organize the interactions between words I have software such as R, SPSS, Tableau and Excel at my disposal, but have hit a bit of a roadblock. Can anyone point me in the right direction here?
