Autocorrelation in residuals of a regression model with ARIMA errors (example in Rob Hyndman's book) - Part 1

I am a novice to time series forecasting and I need some help understanding something in Rob Hyndman's excellent Forecasting: Principles and Practice book (3rd edition). After fitting a regression model with ARIMA errors (section 10.3, figure 10.7 for the actual example I am referring to), the book says "There is clear heteroskedasticity in the residuals, with higher variance in January and February, and lower variance in May. The model also has some significant autocorrelation in the residuals, and the histogram of the residuals shows long tails. All of these issues with the residuals may affect the coverage of the prediction intervals, but the point forecasts should still be ok ." (Bold is mine) Given that it is important (or a requirement?) for a forecasting model to have residuals with zero mean, and no autocorrelation (mentioned in section 5.4 of the same book), it appears to me that the example in figure 10.7 violates the requirement that there should be no correlations in the residuals of a good forecasting model. Why does the book then say the point forecasts should still be ok? Does this suggest autocorrelation in residuals will not affect point forecasts? What are the properties of residuals that affects point forecasts? Part 2 is here
