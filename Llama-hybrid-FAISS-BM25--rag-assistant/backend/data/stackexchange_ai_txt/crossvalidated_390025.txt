Just a thought, you could use "boosting", e.g. monitor the relation of two similar sensors. To stick to the example, the ratio of temparature measurement of unit 1 and unit 2 should stay within a certain boundary. I would consider combining sensors that either measure similar things, or use similar technologies, co-variances may be too computationally heavy. Another technique, similar to the above, that is used in a different context is to compare one such measurement to the median and average of all such measurements. If the value of one sensor exceeds a threshold, you can do a relatively simple voting algorithm. This is how aeroplanes select altitudes from four sensors.
