Using advanced CSS 2 selectors, another solution would be possible that does not rely on a class last to introduce layout info into the HTML. The solution uses the adjacent selectors . Unfortunately, MSIE 6 doesn't support it yet so reluctance to use it is understandable. h1 { margin: 0 0 1em; } div, p, p + h1, div + h1 { margin: 1em 0 0; } This way, the first h1 won't have a top margin while any h1 that immediately follows a paragraph or a box has a top margin.
