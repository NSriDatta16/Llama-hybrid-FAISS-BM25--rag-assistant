You seem to have two groups observed at many different variables (milestones for different tasks, with values in 1...21). So this could be seen as a problem of multivariate regression, or maybe manova. But a simpler solution is to use logistic regression, with group (experimental or control) as outcome variable. The logic is that if there is some differences between the groups, they should be able to predict the group. This is proposed at T-tests, manova or logistic regression - how to compare two groups? and otherwise! This should be accompanied with some data visualizations.
