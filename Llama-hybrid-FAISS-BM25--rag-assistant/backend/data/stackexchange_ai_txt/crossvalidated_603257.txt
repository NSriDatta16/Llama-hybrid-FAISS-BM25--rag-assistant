For roughly normal distributions , the median is roughly the weighted average of the mean, the mean and the mode. So a roughly normal distribution with mean of $3$ and mode of $4$ would have median of roughly $10/3$ , nowhere near $5$ . In other words, the example above is implausible. Without some explanation for why the median is so unusual, not even between the median and the mode, it's hard to find a reasonable distribution matching the parameters. Reasonable values of mean, median and mode can often be fit exactly to either a triangular or split-normal distribution.
