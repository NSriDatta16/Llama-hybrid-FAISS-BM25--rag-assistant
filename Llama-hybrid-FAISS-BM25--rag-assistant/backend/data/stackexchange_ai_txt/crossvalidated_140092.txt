How to obtain cross-correlation function from cross-spectrum?

I have implemented a piece of code based on the Lomb-Scargle approach for determining the cross-spectrum of two time series. My cross spectrum contains complex numbers and I have used the basic fft function in R with the option inverse=true to apply a inverse Fast Fourier Transform to obtain the cross-correlation but i get a complex valued cross correlation function which is not correct. What other methods should I use?
