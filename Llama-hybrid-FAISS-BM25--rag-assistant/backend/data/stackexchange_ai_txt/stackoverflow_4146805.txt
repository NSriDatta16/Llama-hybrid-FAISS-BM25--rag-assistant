I think what you are running into is different from what you might think. In IIS 7 when you set the values for properties like you are describing the configuration for that is stored in the web.config for the application, and not applicationHost.config. For example I just created a site and modified those settings, then inside my web.config file the following fragment was dropped in. So what is happening when you perform a sync the web.config in your package is overwriting the web.config which has the modified properties in it. What you need to do to configure your application in IIS 7 as you want it, then grab the node from place it in your web.config file. Alternatively if you want you can place it in either web.debug.config or web.release.config if you want to only have that in your web.config when publishing.
