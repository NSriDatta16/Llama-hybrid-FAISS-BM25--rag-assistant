Firing named functions from an array with JavaScript?

I'm very new to JavaScript, but this topic seems to have attracted only scant forum attention. Given a number of simple functions: function do_something(){...}; function do_somemore(){...}; function do_something_else(){...}; I was expecting to be able to assign these explicitly to cells in an (here 2D) array. myMatrix[5][3] = do_something(); myMatrix[5][4] = do_somemore(); myMatrix[5][5] = do_something_else(); The reason I want to use such an approach are : simple to understand and maintain. eliminates potentially redundant anonymous function assignments in the array. any given function can be assigned to multiple array cells, for example: myMatrix[2][6] = do_somemore(); myMatrix[5][4] = do_somemore(); myMatrix[6][3] = do_somemore(); Unfortunately, calls such as the following (based on various forum examples, plus a little "suck it and see") are all failing. x = myMatrix[5][4]do_somemore(); -> "missing ; before statement" x = (myMatrix[5][4])do_somemore(); -> "missing ; before statement" x = (myMatrix[5][4]do_somemore)(); -> "missing ) in parenthetical" x = (myMatrix[5][4])(do_somemore()); -> "is not a function" x = (myMatrix[5][4])()do_somemore(); -> "missing ; before statement" x = myMatrix[5][4]()do_somemore(); -> "missing ; before statement" x = myMatrix[5][4](); -> "is not a function" x = (myMatrix[5][4])(); -> "is not a function" As I have no knowledge of JavaScript internals, I'd be glad of suggestions how to get the function calls firing .
