Here is the code I used: I added the SoundEffect.h and SoundEffect.m files to my project (you can find them online). Then, I created a sound effect instance: SoundEffect *soundEffect; Then, I setup my UIViewController as the delegate of my UIScrollView by adding to the .h file of the view controller and setting the relevant outlet of the UIScrollView. In the -(void)viewDidLoad method, I initialized my sound effect: NSBundle *mainBundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; soundEffect = [[SoundEffect alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[mainBundle pathForResource:@"Tik" ofType:@"wav"]]; And then, I implemented these two methods: #pragma mark - #pragma mark Scroll View Delegate Methods - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { lastScrollPosition = scrollView.contentOffset.x / 55; } - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { if ((int)(scrollView.contentOffset.x / 55) != lastScrollPosition1) { lastScrollPosition1 = scrollView.contentOffset.x / 55; [soundEffect1 play]; } } I needed the sound effect to fire every 55 pixels to either direction, but you can change this to a constant value that fits your needs. It works great for me, and hopefully, it will help others as well...
