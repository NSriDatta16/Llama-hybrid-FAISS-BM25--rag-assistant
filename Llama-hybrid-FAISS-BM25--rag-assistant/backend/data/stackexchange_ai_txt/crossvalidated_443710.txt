Logistic regression in R - understanding function outputs

I'm looking to gain more understanding on how to properly perform logistic regression using R. I have a matrix x with 20 features (columns) and 1000 samples (rows) and a response vector y with values either 0 or 1. The way I have fitted logistic regression is: model This outputs a list of values. Then to check the performance of the model I use the predict function on unseen data (x2): predicted Which returns a list of values for each of the samples between 0 and 1 corresponding to the probability of being each class. Right? Am I taking the right steps? What other things should I be looking at? Should I be using lambda.min? I think the next step is to find the cutoff point that maximises accuracy for the model. I would also like to plot the resulting curve given my model's parameters, something like this. Or any other way of visualising / understanding what my final model is, what the parameters and regression coefficients are etc. If anyone can recommend a good tutorial with detailed explanations of the outputs of each step and how to interpret and use them that would be fantastic. Thanks!
