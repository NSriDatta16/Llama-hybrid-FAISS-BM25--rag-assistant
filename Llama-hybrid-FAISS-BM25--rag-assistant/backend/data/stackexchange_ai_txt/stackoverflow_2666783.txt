Use a hash table . Insert every number into your hash table, along with its index. Then, let S be your desired sum. For every number array[i] in your initial array, see if S - array[i] exists in your hash table with an index different than i . Average case is O(n) , worst case is O(n^2) , so use the binary search solution if you're afraid of the worst case.
