Is this a good way to generate a string of random characters?

I found this snippet of code that generates a string of random characters. But is there a more elegant/faster/more reliable way to do this? This seems to rely on the fact that the numbers 26-91 are valid characters given the current encoding. /// /// Generates a random string with the given length /// /// Size of the string /// If true, generate lowercase string /// Random string private string RandomString(int size, bool lowerCase) { StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder(); Random random = new Random(); char ch; for(int i = 0; i
