Connect draggable to sortable only if visible?

In the jquery ui docs for draggable, we can specify a sortable to connect to: $( ".selector" ).draggable({ connectToSortable: 'ul#myList' }); is it possible to connect to a sortable only when its visibility is set to 'visible'? Something like: $( ".selector" ).draggable({ connectToSortable: 'ul#myList:visibility=visible' }); I don't want to let the user drop elements on my sortable target unless it is visible, Thanks
