Bootstrap difference in R2 between two models

I apologise beforehand if this is already answered elsewhere, but I have searched for this particular question and didnâ€™t find a post that matched it. I have two logistic regression models: a base model Y ~ X and a full model Y ~ X + Z , for which I computed the pseudo R2. I want to estimate the difference in pseudo R2 between the two models to determine the added predictive value corresponding to variable Z, but using either cross-validation or bootstrap. The objective is to afterwards compare the added predictive value between several Z variables. The thing is I am not sure how it should be done: Use cross validation/bootstrap to compute the R2 for the base and full models in each fold, which are each averaged and then calculate the difference in R2. Use cross validation/bootstrap to compute the difference in R2 in each fold, which is then averaged.
