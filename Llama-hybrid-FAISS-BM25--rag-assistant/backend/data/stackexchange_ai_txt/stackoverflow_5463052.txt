I have a table named dbstorage which has columns like year and weekno . I need to select the year and weekno which is less than current year and current week. I used: select * from dbstorage where year But it is not giving the correct data like if I have a value year:2010 and weekno:25 means, the query is not selecting this record. How can this be done?
