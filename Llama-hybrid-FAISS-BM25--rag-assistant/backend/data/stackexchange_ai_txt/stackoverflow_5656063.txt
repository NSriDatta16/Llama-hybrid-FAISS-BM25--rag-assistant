new can only be used with a Function as the operand. new {} // Error: ({}) is not a constructor Check the type of Users in context: it is not a Function when that exception is raised. Happy coding alert(typeof(Users)) ought to do the trick. The result should be "function" to be usable as a constructor. Take note of what it is in the failing case, and see below for a reason. One problematic scenario (for Users = new Users ) may be: an object is constructed from the Function Users and then the object (now not a Function/constructor) is assigned back to Users so the next new Users will go kaboom! (Look in both showusers and dashboard -- is that behavior really intended?) The 'correct' code is likely: var users = new Users; users.blahblah(...) ; that is, use a new local variable and do not overwrite the global Users variable/property. The reason the error is only generated when "going back" to "#foobar" (a Fragment Identifier ) is that no new page is actually loaded and thus the JavaScript is not reloaded and the current (now corrupt Users ) is being used. kaboom! Excerpt from Fragment Identifier : If the targeted element is located in the current document, a user agent may simply focus the targeted element without having to reload it ...
