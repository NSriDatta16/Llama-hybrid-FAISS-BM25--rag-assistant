Well, you didn't mention the environment you're using but in general, you can also consider stored procedures (if your DB engine supports it). It has the benefit of building an additional abstraction layer in the database itself thus making the exact database schema less relevant to client applications. Using parameterized queries is encouraged most of the time, not only for the sake of performance, but for the security against SQL injection and preventing data type conversion issues (localized date time).
