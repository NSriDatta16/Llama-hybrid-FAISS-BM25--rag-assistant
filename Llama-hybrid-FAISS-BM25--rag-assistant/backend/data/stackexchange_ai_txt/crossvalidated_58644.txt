How can I convert my dataset into a new dataset which is adjusted for confounding covariates?

I have used software before to do linear regression and factor in/out the confounding variables, but what I would like to do is generate a new data set which is adjusted for the confounding variables. How would I go about this? Further explanation: I have 1 dependant variable, multiple interesting independant variables and multiple confounding independant variables. I would like to Adjust the dependant variable for the confounding variables. Do PCA analysis on the interesting independant variables. Colour my data points on the PCA plot by the adjusted dependant variable. I can do steps 2 and 3 but don't know how to do step 1. I can use R and have used MiniTab and SPSS once or twice, so any specific instructions relating to those would be amazing but even to be pointed in the right direction would be great.
