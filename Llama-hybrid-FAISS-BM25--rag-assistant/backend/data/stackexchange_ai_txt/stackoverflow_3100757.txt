nhibernate generate left outer join on many-to-one entity

i'm using nHibernate 2.1.2 and relized that nhibernate will generate left outer join on nested many-to-one entities. it seems start generate left-outer-join on 3rd nested note onwards which start from entity Organization. i have set following in the mapping file to force use inner-join, has anything i missed out in the mapping file? really hope somebody could give me a hint on this. appreciate any helps! lazy="false" fetch="join" Example Entites and Relationships: Sales Record - Employee - Organization nhibernate generate: select... from sales inner join employee left outer join organization Sales.hbm.xml Employee.hbm.xml
