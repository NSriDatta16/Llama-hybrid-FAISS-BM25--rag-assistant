I would run the test for a longer duration and with many more iterations as small differences would average out over time and you should get a clearer picture. Also, make sure you eliminate any external things that may be affecting your test, such as other processes running, non enough free memory, cold start vs warm start, network usage, etc. Also, make sure that your database file and log file have enough free space allocated so you aren't waiting for the DB to grow the file during certain tests.
