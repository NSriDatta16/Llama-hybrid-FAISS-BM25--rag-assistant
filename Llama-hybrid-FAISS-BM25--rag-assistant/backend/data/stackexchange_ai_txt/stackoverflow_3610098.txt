Seeing strange character for apostrophe on wordpress based page, but only in Internet Explorer

I'm gettign this strange character instead of an apostrophe on a page that's powered by Wordpress, but only in Internet Explorer. Other browsers (chrome, firefox) display as the actual apostrophe. â€™ Can somebody tell me what the problem is? Here's the instance in question: http://cure.org/about/management-team/ You'll see under Dale Brantner, 4th staff member from the top, there in the first paragraph of his bio the word organization's and that is the instance which in IE I'm getting the above symbol instead of an apostrophe. I have tried both with the apostrophy character, and with the HTML character entity &apos; but both seem to yield this strange character string. Interestingly, I have noticed it on other wordpress powered blogs from time to time. Also of note, this page is generated by a custom use of the links function in wordpress.
