Concurrency and optimization using OpenMP

I'm learning OpenMP. To do so, I'm trying to make an existing code parallel. But I seems to get an worse time when using OpenMP than when I don't. My inner loop: #pragma omp parallel for for(unsigned long j = 0; j _points is a pointMap_t, defined as: typedef boost::unordered_map pointMap_t; Without OpenMP my running time is 44.904s. With OpenMP enabled, on a computer with two cores, it is 64.224s. What I am doing wrong?
