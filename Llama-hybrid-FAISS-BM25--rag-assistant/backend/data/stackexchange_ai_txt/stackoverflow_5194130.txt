Take care, if you do this from a unix/linux environment, the checkin sees the whole file as changed. So as far as I know the only real solution is to do this on a windows machine, either with cygwin or tortoise (you can first search all files which need the eol-style property with agent ransack or other search tool, and select them all-> right click -> Tortoise SVN -> Properties -> new -> eol-style with value native (or if one of the files already have the property it shows up, select edit -> ok and all other files will also be modified).
