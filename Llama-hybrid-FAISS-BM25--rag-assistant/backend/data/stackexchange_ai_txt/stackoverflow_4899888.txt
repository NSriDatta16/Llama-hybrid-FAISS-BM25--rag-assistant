It sounds like you are wanting the images loaded from your "Load" call to be draggable. The problem with what you have is the "Ready" function fires once the original page is loaded, but does not cover any elements loaded after it is fired. So whatever LOAD function you are using should have a callback. In that callback you will want to recall the draggable function. So the code would look like: $(document).ready(function(){ function createDrag(target) { target.draggable({ drag: function(event, ui){ var pos = $(this).offset(); $("#x").val(pos.left); $("#y").val(pos.top); } }); } createDrag($("#draggable")); $('#loader').load('url', function(){ createDrag($("#draggable")); }); });
