How Do You Profile & Optimize CUDA Kernels?

I am somewhat familiar with the CUDA visual profiler and the occupancy spreadsheet, although I am probably not leveraging them as well as I could. Profiling & optimizing CUDA code is not like profiling & optimizing code that runs on a CPU. So I am hoping to learn from your experiences about how to get the most out of my code. There was a post recently looking for the fastest possible code to identify self numbers , and I provided a CUDA implementation . I'm not satisfied that this code is as fast as it can be, but I'm at a loss as to figure out both what the right questions are and what tool I can get the answers from. How do you identify ways to make your CUDA kernels perform faster?
