Re point 1: Well, my shop was a VB6 house - with lots of VB6 code to support, and we moved straight to C# with no problems. We did have to think about the decision, but I am 100% (or more) confident that we made the right choice. Re point 2: You'd be amazed at how much I don't need this day to day ;-p I have nothing against VB.NET - I simply feel that C# allows me to do my job more elegantly. Re the books etc - I wonder if there isn't a contingent of ex-VB6 developers who are still writing VB6 in VS2008. Making the switch to C# really helped me appreciate the new (at the time) .NET architecture. If I had moved to VB.NET I don't think I would have made that mental leap - at least for some time.
