I would think that it is due to A) the complexity of working with LDAP (much higher than SQL) and B) the fact that your product would be tied completely to it. That is, it would have no market outside of large organizations running LDAP. For less money and effort, I could build an app that works anywhere. Now, internal applications written specifically for the organization that need access to other LDAP data are a different story. But you will obviously hear less about them because they are not commercially marketed.
