Invoking a WPF command from a WPF-embedded Winforms control

I have a WinDataGrid class that extends from an Infragistics UltraGrid . I have embedded my WinDataGrid within a WPF usercontrol using WindowsFormHost . When rows are selected, I need to invoke a predefined DelegateCommand with my collection of selected rows. How would I go about this? As background, I have a WPF app that uses both a WPF DataGrid and an Infragistics WinGrid. The WPF grid is already mostly wired up, and I want to utilize the existing commands etc as much as possible in wiring up my Winforms grid. I realise there may be some mapping required, but figure I should be able to map most things?
