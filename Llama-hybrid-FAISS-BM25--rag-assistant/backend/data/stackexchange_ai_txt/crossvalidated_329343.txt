Average from distribution-fit vs sample average

If I know the functional form of a distribution, is it better to fit the distribution to the data to find the mean, or is it better to just look at sample average. I know sample average is the unbiased estimator of the mean, but I feel like fitting to a known distribution may reduce the effect of outliers. Is that true? If not, is there a way to use the information about the shape of distribution to find a better estimation of the mean? What about other moments? Edit By fitting the distribution to the data, what I had in mind was something like FindDistributionParameter function in Mathematica. This is what it does: The maximum likelihood method attempts to maximize the log-likelihood function $\sum\log(f(x_i;\theta))$, where $\theta$ are the distribution parameters and $f(x_i;\theta)$ is the PDF of the symbolic distribution.
