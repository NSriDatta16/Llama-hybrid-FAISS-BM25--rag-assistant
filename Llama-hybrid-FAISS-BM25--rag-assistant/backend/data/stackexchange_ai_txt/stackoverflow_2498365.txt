I was searching the different Magento forums and extensions for this but i didnâ€™t find anything. What i want is to let my visitors to create a PDF file with image and description for the products they are interested. With this will have the ability to save the product on its computer or print it. This will be some kind of a printout offer. The PDF must include the title, default image, description and price. Thanks in advance!
