Google Analytics Events - Triggering a user exit

I am looking for a way to simulate with Google Analytics _gaq.push that the user has left the page (so GA stops counting on Average time on site). This is some code I use to track AJAX pages in Google Analytics (it counts a page view): _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/ajax/save']); What I am looking for is something such as: _gaq.push(['_exitCurrentPage', 'http://example.com/']); Does anything with that functionality exist? Thanks in advance, Xavi
