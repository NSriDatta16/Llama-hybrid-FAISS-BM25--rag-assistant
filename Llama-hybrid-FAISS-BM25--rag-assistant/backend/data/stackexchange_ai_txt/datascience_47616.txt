Variable Importance in unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms

I am working on an anomaly detection problem to detect fraud in insurance claims. I have used the PyOD package and used algorithms like ABOD, CBLOF, Isolation Forest, and AutoEncoder. I couldn't find any way to identify the important features which make the data points anomalies ( like variable Importance in Random Forest). Is there a way to identify the important features in unsupervised anomaly detection?
