"Token Text in state EndRootElement would result in an invalid XML document"

I'm seeing this exception message coming from XslCompiledTransform.Transform(), but after handling the exception the XSL transform still appears to have been successful. The full exception message is: Token Text in state EndRootElement would result in an invalid XML document. Make sure that the ConformanceLevel setting is set to ConformanceLevel.Fragment or ConformanceLevel.Auto if you want to write an XML fragment. The stylesheet looks like this: I XML BARBAZ FTP The generated XML looks like this: a5e0ec76-6c24-426b-9eb5-aef9c45d913f VN000033 650 9/27/2008 12:51:00 AM I 2 XML BARBAZ FTP The above is what I get when I catch and ignore the exception. I haven't been able to find a way to set the ConformanceLevel (the property is read-only), but at the same time I also don't think there should be a problem here anyway. Does my output constitute an XML fragment? Am I missing something in the stylesheet?
