They are using jquery to do a cross fade between the images and text. Check out line 27 http://elegantthemes.com/preview/InStyle/wp-content/themes/InStyle/js/custom.js I'm not going to cut and paste in the js code for this because it's a paid theme for word press. If you don't want to write it all yourself I suggest buying the theme as it does exactly what you want. http://www.wpthemesnews.com/theme-releases/instyle-a-premium-wp-theme-from-elegantthemes/
