How to determine the confidence of a neural network prediction?

To illustrate my question, suppose that I have a training set where the input has a degree of noise but the output does not, for example; # Training data [1.02, 1.95, 2.01, 3.06] : [1.0] [2.03, 4.11, 5.92, 8.00] : [2.0] [10.01, 11.02, 11.96, 12.04] : [1.0] [2.99, 6.06, 9.01, 12.10] : [3.0] here the output is the gradient of the input array if it were noiseless (not the actual gradient). After training the network, the output should look something like this for a given input. # Expected Output [1.01, 1.96, 2.00, 3.06] : 95% confidence interval of [0.97, 1.03] [2.03, 4.11, 3.89, 3.51] : 95% confidence interval of [2.30, 4.12] My question is how can a neural network be created such that it will return a predicted value and a measure of confidence, such as a variance or confidence interval?
