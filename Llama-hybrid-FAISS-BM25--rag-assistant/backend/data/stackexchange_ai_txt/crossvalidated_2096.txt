For a Poisson process, hits occur at random independent of the past, but with a known long term average rate $\lambda$ of hits per time unit. The Poisson distribution would let us find the probability of getting some particular number of hits. Now, instead of looking at the number of hits, we look at the random variable $L$ (for Lifetime), the time you have to wait for the first hit. The probability that the waiting time is more than a given time value is $P(L \gt t) = P(\text{no hits in time t})=\frac{\Lambda^0e^{-\Lambda}}{0!}=e^{-\lambda t}$ (by the Poisson distribution, where $\Lambda = \lambda t$ ). $P(L \le t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$ (the cumulative distribution function). We can get the density function by taking the derivative of this: $$f(t) = \begin{cases} \lambda e^{-\lambda t} & \mbox{for } t \ge 0 \\ 0 & \mbox{for } t \lt 0 \end{cases}$$ Any random variable that has a density function like this is said to be exponentially distributed.
