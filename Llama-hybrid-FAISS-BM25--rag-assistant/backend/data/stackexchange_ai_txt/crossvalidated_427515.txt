You don't know in advance which inputs are going to be support vectors; you need to do the optimization to figure that out. One way to do that is to pre-compute the kernel matrix for all pairs of inputs, then run the solver on that. Some more efficient SVM solvers will actually only compute the kernel function when it's needed, and can (using various techniques based on only a few kernel evaluations) figure out that a point isn't going to be a support vector, then not compute the kernel between those points and the rest of the dataset. But how those work exactly is complicated.
