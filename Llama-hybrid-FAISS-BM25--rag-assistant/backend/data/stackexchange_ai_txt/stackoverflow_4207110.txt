implement the MKMapView delegate: - (void) mapView: (MKMapView *) mapView didSelectAnnotationView: (MKAnnotationView *) view and you can do whatever you need in there. But i think you are really after enabling the map callout accessory. See MapCallouts sample application http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/MapCallouts/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40009746
