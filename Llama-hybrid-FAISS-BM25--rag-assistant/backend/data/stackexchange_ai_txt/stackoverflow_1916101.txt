I find your original elegant enough - tells the story, easy to read. But that's definitely a personal preference. Luckily there's always at least nine ways to do anything in CFML. You can put that on one line (CFML has no end-of-line requirements): You can also use IIF() Function - it'll do the trick: This construct is a little odd tho' - is more clear I think. The strength of IIF() is that it can also be used inline (it is a function after all). For example: This last form is often used to maintain a clean(er) HTML layout while injecting dynamic code.
