The lower environments should try to match the production environment as closely as possible given the resources available. This applies to all development efforts regardless of whether they are python-based or even web-based. In practical terms, most organizations are not willing to spend that type of money. In this case try to make at least the environment that is directly below production as close to production as possible. Some of the variable to keep in mind are: many times there are multiple machines (app server, database server, web server, load balancers, fire walls, etc) in a production. Keep these all in mind. Operating Systems number of CPUs. Moving from a one CPU lower environment to a multi core production environment can expose multi-threading issues that were not tested load balancing. Many times lower environments are not load balanced. If you are replicating sessions (for instance) across multiple production app servers, you should try to do the same in a lower environment Software / library versions
