Getting an average measurement based on two raters for cases where data is missing for one rater

Context: I'm investigating behaviour in a clinical study involving children. I had both parents and teachers completing questionnaires to inform an understanding of the same underlying constructs, for example reactive aggression. At the conclusion of data collection I have parent data in all cases, n=55, and teacher data for 41 cases - therefore, I have 14 cases where I only have the parent data. For the purposes of our study it makes sense to aggregate parent and teacher observations for each case. As I have a small sample and I do have parent data for every case, deleting cases in a pairwise manner does not seem a viable option. There are several variables for which I need to do this, all of which seem to correlate well. Before aggregating data, I thought it would make sense to address the missing data issue. With regards to 'substituting' I have done some brief reading and am familiar with the basic 'within variable' substitution options, however, I thought there may be a more powerful method available where I could use: (a) the parent score we have in every case for every variable, n=55, 100% of cases. (b) our understanding of the relationship between parent and teacher scores in cases where we have both, n=41, 74.5% of cases Question: Does the general idea outlined above seem reasonable? What would be a good algorithm for implementing it in detail? How could it be implemented in SPSS?
