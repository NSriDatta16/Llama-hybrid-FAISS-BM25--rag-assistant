I'd really suggest keeping your entire repo on your preferred drive. You can then put a bare repo on the beyond-your-control drive, and push to it. This is the best way to minimize your interactions with the bad storage. If for some reason you must split a repo across drives, why not just create the repo on one drive, move the .git directory to the other drive, then symlink .git in your repo to the relocated .git directory.
