remove selection using javascript

I'm working on a image viewer that has a draggable scrollbar. When the user drags the scrollbar, some of the text on the webpage becomes selected. I've tried window.getSelection().removeAllRanges(); but that doesn't seem to work in IE7/8. Also tried the document.getSelection().removeAllRanges(); which seems to work just as "well" with IE7/8. Are there any other ways of doing this? Don't know of any jQuery solutions, but if there are, let me know (: EDIT: This is the context of the onmouse-event $("#slideBar").mousedown(function(f) { mouseDown = true; some more code... } $(document).mouseup(function() { if (mouseDown) { window.getSelection().removeAllRanges(); more code... } }
