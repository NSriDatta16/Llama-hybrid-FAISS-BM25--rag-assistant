Apply same regression model on multiple time points

i have a vector of time series data (1020x30; an index of neural activation measured at 1020 timepoints in 30 participants). I also have assessed 5 covariates of interest at a group level (eg age). I want to estimate how much those factors contribute to neural activation across time. I could estimate an ols at each time point, of course. However, what would be the best way to correct for multiple comparisons? Make a null distribution at each time point by randomly shuffling matrices? Every help would be very much appreciated!
