C++ STL List calculate average

I have to correct some C++/STL code. Unfortunately I have very little C++ experience and know nothing about STL. Nevertheless I finished most of it, but the function below is still giving me problems: C++ source: double MyClass::CalculateAvg(const std::list &list) { double avg = 0; std::list ::iterator it; for(it = list->begin(); it != list->end(); it++) avg += *it; avg /= list->size(); } C++ header: static double CalculateAvg(const std::list &list); It's most likely meant to calculate the average value from a list, but it complies with a lot of errors. I tried to search for a solutions on the web, but I couldn't find anything. I would be glad if someone could help me out. Update: Thank you for your quick replies. The accepted answer solved all my problems.
