I found that unless you use IoC / DI methodology that encourages writing very small classes, and follow Single Responsibility Principle religiously, the unit-tests end up testing interaction of multiple classes which makes them very complex and therefore fragile. My point is, many of the novel software development techniques only work when used together. Particularly MVC, ORM, IoC, unit-testing and Mocking. The DDD (in the modern primitive sense) and TDD/BDD are more independent so you may use them or not.
