PHPUnit does not create code coverage report with ZendFW

I have 2 directories: project1 and project2. When I run PHPUnit in project1/tests, it works fine. When I run it in project2/tests, it works fine, except does not produce any code coverage reports. The phpunit.xml config files are virtually identical. There are some differences in the bootstraps that each calls, however I don't think these are material. (I have checked out the paths and they are fine). Any ideas? How can I go about diagnosing this problem? Here is the phpunit.xml from project2/tests: ./ ..\library\ ..\application\ ..\application\ And here's the TestBootstrap.php: 'localhost', 'username' => 'root', 'password' => '', 'dbname' => 'openco_v1_0' ) ); Zend_Db_Table_Abstract::setDefaultAdapter($db); // Store some stuff in the registry // Zend_Registry::set('testRoot', $root); // Zend_Registry::set('testBootstrap', $root.'/application/bootstrap.php'); // Unset global variables that are no longer required unset($root, $library, $models, $dbtables, $controllers, $tests, $path); Any assistance appreciated!
