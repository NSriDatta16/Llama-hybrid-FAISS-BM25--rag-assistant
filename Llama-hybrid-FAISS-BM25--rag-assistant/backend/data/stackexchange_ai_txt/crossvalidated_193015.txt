What I can conclude from this graph Bayesian, Euclidean and mahalanobis classifier?

I have solved this problem: Generate a set of data of N = 1000 2-dimensional vectors that stem from three equiprobable classes. The three classes are modeled by Gaussian distribution with means $ \mu1 =|1, 1|^T$, $ \mu2 =|12,8|^T$, $ \mu3 =|16, 1|^T$ and their covariance matrices are S1 = S2 = S3 = 4I, where I is the identity matrix 2X2. Use the Euclidean distance classifier to classify the points of X1 based on the ML estimates computed before. Use the Mahalanobis distance classifier to classify the points of X1 based on the ML estimates computed before. Use the Bayesian classifier to classify the points of X1 based on the ML estimates computed before. I did it in MATLAB with the toolbox from this book and I get: Bayesian error: 0.0240 Euclidean error: 0.0230 mahalanobis error: 0.0230 and this graph: I do not know how to conclude based on my data and graph, can someone please guide me? (I know the red points are the 1 class, the green points are the 2 class and the blue points are the 3 class.)
