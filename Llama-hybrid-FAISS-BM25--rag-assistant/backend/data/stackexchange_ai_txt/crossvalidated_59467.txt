AIC vs BIC vs MDL

I am trying to learn the difference between the three approaches and their applications. a) As I understand, AIC = -LL+K BIC = -LL+(K*logN)/2 Unless I am missing something, shouldn't the K that minimizes the AIC minimize BIC as well since N is constant. I looked at this thread but couldn't find a satisfactory answer. b) According to Witten's book on Data Mining (pg 267) the definition of MDL for evaluating the quality of network is the same as BIC. Is there a difference between BIC and MDL? c) What are the different approaches to compute MDL? I am looking for its application in Clustering, Time Series Analysis (ARIMA and Regime Switching) and Attribute Selection. While almost all commonly used packages in R report AIC and BIC, I couldn't find any that implements MDL and I wanted to see if I can write it myself. Thank you.
