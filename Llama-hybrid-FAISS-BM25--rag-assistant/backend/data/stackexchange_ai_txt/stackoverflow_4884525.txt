Yes, that's correct. A union is like a struct except that all the data members have overlappimg storage, so if you write a field of one type and then read back a field of some other type it will reinterpret the bits of the first type as a value of the second type. The code looks weird here because the union is being defined inside a function. Typically one would declare a union at file scope like one would declare a struct, but here since the goal is bit mangling rather than data storage it's being done locally.
