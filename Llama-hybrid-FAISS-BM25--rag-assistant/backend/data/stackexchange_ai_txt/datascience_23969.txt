Sentence similarity prediction

I'm looking to solve the following problem: I have a set of sentences as my dataset, and I want to be able to type a new sentence, and find the sentence that the new one is the most similar to in the dataset. An example would look like: New sentence: " I opened a new mailbox " Prediction based on dataset: Sentence | Similarity A dog ate poop 0% A mailbox is good 50% A mailbox was opened by me 80% I've read that cosine similarity can be used to solve these kinds of issues paired with tf-idf (and RNNs should not bring significant improvements to the basic methods), or also word2vec is used for similar problems. Are those actually viable for use in this specific case, too? Are there any other techniques/algorithms to solve this (preferably with Python and SKLearn, but I'm open to learn about TensorFlow, too)?
