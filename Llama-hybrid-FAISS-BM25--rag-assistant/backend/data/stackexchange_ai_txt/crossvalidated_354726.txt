Count data time series for hospital emergency arrivals

i recently started to work in a hospital and we are interested in forecasting the arrivals to emergency; the only variable we have information about is the number of arrivals to emergency The time series looks like this And the acf and pacf look like this I've been having trouble with fitting a time series model to this data, i'd tried an ARMA model with an autoregressive component of order 7 and an moving average component of the same order as well; nonetheless the time series seem pretty random and by the autocorrelation plot and partial autocorrelation plot, the autocorrelation looks very low so, there's no sense in fitting such a model in my opinion (correct me if i'm wrong); i tried fitting an Poisson Autoregressive model, but the results were quite similar, and the forecast were pretty poor. To this point i'm kinda lost and don't know any other ideas in order to get a good fit and a good forecast for this data, it will be helpful an advice on how to approach this problem. Thank you in advance.
