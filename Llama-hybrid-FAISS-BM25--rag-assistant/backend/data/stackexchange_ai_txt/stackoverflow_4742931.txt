I logically separate them based on their concern. The point of even having a Data Access layer, Service layer, etc. is separation of concerns. I tend to go a little over board, but I do something similar to: app --model ----PersonEntity.java (JPA annotated entity) --service ----PersonService.java (interface) --web ----PersonController.java (SpringMVC Controller, Struts action, etc.) --internal ----PersonServiceImpl.java (Contains JPA EntityManager, e.g.) That is, if you intend to keep everything in the same project. I would probably separate the service and model code into it's own project, in case (for example), you might write a separate web service and reuse the same domain model. FYI, I'm not a fan of DAOs, but they're pretty prevalent. I'm not sure where I would put a dao, but I'd probably follow the same convention. An extra package is just another folder, it's no biggie, and makes sense to organize your code as much as possible.
