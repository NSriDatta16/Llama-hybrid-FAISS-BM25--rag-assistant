Getting $>1$ responses in logistic regression?

Is it normal to get values for response that are $> 1$ even though in logistic regression the response has meaning only in the range $[0,1]$? Does one then have to truncate all $> 1$ values to mean just $1.0$? The reason for asking is that I got something that looked like it might have response $> 1$ using a skin variable (1 means skin that's more prone to get sunburn and 0 means normal skin), a trt variable (1 signifies that the patient took beta carotene and 0 that the patient didn't) and then a cancer variable that signifies, whether the patient got skin cancer during the study. So $cancer \text{ ~ } trt+skin$ produces $$cancer=0.1331410+0.5570949⋅trt+0.627890⋅skin$$ (these coefficients are after taking invlogit() of the coefficients returned by glm() ) which is $>1$ if both variables $==1$. Although, when seeing whether such rows actually exist (where $skin=trt=1$), no such rows exist.
