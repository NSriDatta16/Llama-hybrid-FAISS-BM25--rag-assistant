I had this problem too. It appeared when I installed the m2eclipse plugin. I had not found a solution, but you can use Ctrl + H shortcut instead. And you can navigate between tabs with Ctrl + PgDown or Ctrl + PgUp keys. I've uninstalled the following pluings and it worked. Maven integration PMD eclipse checkstyle plugin EclEmma (coverage) I don't know which of those cause the problem. To uninstall a plugin: Help -> Software Updates...-> "Installed Software" tab.
