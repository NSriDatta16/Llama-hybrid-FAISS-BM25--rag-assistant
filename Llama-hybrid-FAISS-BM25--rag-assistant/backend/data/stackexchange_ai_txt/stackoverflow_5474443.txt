Magento filters url rewrite

I've got one task about Layer Navigation block on site, powered by Magento. We want to make a SEO friendly URL's in filters: Now there are links like mymagazine.ru/category/subcategory1?manufacturer=1926 As you see - manufacturer=1926 is a GET-parameter, which just filter the products. So I need to make this link like mymagazine.ru/category/subcategory1/my_manufacturer Where " my_manufacturer " is an allias to " ?manufacturer=1926 ". There is one way to do this task: we can make allias for all the filter pages manually with the Magento admin. But the site got a great catalloge, so this would be too tedious. I thought, that this extentions could help me, but not in my practice... Yoast-landing-pages Fishpigs_attribute_splash_page If you have any thought about this problem, I would love to hear them. Thank's for your attention!
