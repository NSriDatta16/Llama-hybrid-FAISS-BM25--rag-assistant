Flex 4 - creating pop-up without disabling background / drag image without mouseup trigger?

Sorry to bother you, but I was hoping you could help me. We are currently building a new web site and have run into some issues with our programmer. I am trying to do some research to see if we can find a way for my issue to be solved so that I can let my programmer know. First issue: Go here: http://tinyurl.com/276we3f At the pop-up just enter some example text. Now, when you hover over any text boxes on the left of the card, you will see that the text boxes become highlighted with a border. If you click in a text box, a properties pop-up appears that allows you to change the font, color, alignment, etc. When you click close, it will take you back to the product and will highlight the text. I want the user to be able to click anywhere within a text box to type new text. For example, in the bottom text box, where it says "join us to celebrate", the user should be able to click anywhere in that text to change the wording. They might want it to say "join me to celebrate" instead of "join us to celebrate". However, if they click next to the word "us" so that they can change it....the pop-up appears. Is there a way to just have a pop-up appear to the side and not have the background grayed out and disabled? Also, is there a way to be able to click anywhere in the text box to edit just certain words or letters? Second and final question: If you click on "Click to add photo", you will see a pop-up appear that allows you to upload an image, edit it, etc. After uploading the image, I want the user to be able to move the image around with their mouse by dragging it and positioning it in the exact spot that they want it in. We also have the arrows where they can click the up, down, left or right arrow in the image editor pop-up....but I would like for them to be able to drag the image with their mouse as well. We know how to enable dragging of the image. However, the problem occurs when the user releases the mouse button. On the mouseup when the user is done dragging....the pop-up will appear since the pop-up is triggered by the release of the mouse button. Does that make sense? Sorry for the long message and THANKS SO MUCH for your help!
