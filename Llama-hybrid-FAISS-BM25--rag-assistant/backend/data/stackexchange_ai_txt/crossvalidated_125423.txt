That depends. If your question is really "are any different and which" you should in fact adjust for family-wise error rate. If your question is only "are there any differences, no matter where", you can try some high dimensional global test and don't need multiplicity adjustment. If your question is only "which are different" you can correct for false discovery rate. This is less strict. FDR just makes sure that you don't find too many proteins you should not care about if you knew truth. You didn't find anything. Difference too small, sample size not well, no effect at all, you can never tell. This is frequently done. In this case, the p-values are used as descriptive statistics. If you don't have missing data, this is (usually, as you might have used t-tests) equivalent to compare the standardized differences. As this procedure is embedded in your further investigation, you can do this. There the question is only "which protein is most likely to be different". This is no more a matter of rigorous inferential statistics, rather a Bayesian decision theory to make your research efficient. By the way you can plan to order the p-values for using the Bonferroni-Holm procedure. This is more powerful than ordinary Bonferroni.
