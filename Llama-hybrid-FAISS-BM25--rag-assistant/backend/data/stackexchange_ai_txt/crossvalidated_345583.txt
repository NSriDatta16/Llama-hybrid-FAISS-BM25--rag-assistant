Help to fully understand Convolutional Neural Networks

I've just started to learn about Neural Networks (more specificaly CNNs) and would like to clarify some points. I've been using this tutorial for Neural Networks and this one for CNN . Now I believe that I understand how Convolution, ReLU and Pooling are mathematically done, but I can't understand some other steps through the CNN process: Suppose that we have 1 input image and 4 filters for the first convolution. After the first convolution, how do we go from 4 feature maps to a bigger number of feature maps? I've seen examples where we go from 4 maps to 6 maps, which makes no sense to me. There is also this Link with a visual example, but I can't understand how to go from 6 Maps to 16 Maps at Convolution Layer 2 (this question was also asked HERE with more details but with no answer that I could understand)
