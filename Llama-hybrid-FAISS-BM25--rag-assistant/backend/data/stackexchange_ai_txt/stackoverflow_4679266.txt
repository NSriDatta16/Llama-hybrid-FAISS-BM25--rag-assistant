What web software packages are available to setup a drag and drop canvas for a restaurant floor plan?

Hi I'm looking for a software package that implements a drag and drop plan of a restaurant's floor plan. Any technology silverlight/html5/flash is acceptable. Perhaps there is even a tutorial on how to develop a simple example of this. Essentially I need different shaped tables which can be selected from a shapes panel that can then be dragged onto the canvas and moved around to match the current floor plan of a restaurant. Thanks for any help.
