That expectation would be $\infty$ , as we can interpret, in this context, $1/0$ as infinity. This is assuming tat your discrete variable is non-negative, as in your example. One reason is that the post mentioned, as an example, the binomial distribution, which is nonnegative. So this solution can only be defended, if at all, for nonnegative random variables. The principled solution is in the next paragraph. See also I've heard that ratios or inverses of random variables often are problematic, in not having expectations. Why is that? Alternatively, and maybe better, the expectation is just undefined as it involves division by zero which is undefined.
