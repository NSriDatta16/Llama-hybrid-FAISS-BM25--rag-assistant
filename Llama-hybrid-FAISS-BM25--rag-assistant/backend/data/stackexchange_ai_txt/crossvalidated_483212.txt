Plotting probabilities from firth's logistic regression with ordinal predictor in R

I have fit a model using firth's logistic regression. library(logistf) Model Where b is an ordinal variable with 3 levels. Therefore the summary of the model looks like this coef se(coef) lower 0.95 upper 0.95 Chisq p (Intercept) 0.3 0.37 -0.57 0.9 0.44 0.50 b.L 3 0.8 0.83 3.8 11 0.005 b.Q 4 0.5 -1.2 0.8 0.05 0.9 PLEASE NOTE L and Q in this summary refer to linear and quadratic components of the model. L and Q do not refer to categories of b. Plotting this model as shown in this link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41384075/r-calculate-and-interpret-odds-ratio-in-logistic-regression Will not make sense, as the x axis only has 3 points (1 for each category). Is there an alternative approach to modelling this sort of model? Perhaps just to report the probabilities for each 3 categories.
