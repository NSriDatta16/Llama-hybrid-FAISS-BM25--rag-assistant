Time dependent Classification problem

I am trying to solve a decision making problem. In it, information evolves and increases with time for each event observed, and the history of the event may be useful. The problem is as follows: in an electric network at time $t_0$ there is signal that automatically triggers the possible need of a technical intervention in a network to correct the problem. The system at $t_0$ has a large set of general indicators describing the state of the network based on which I'd like to determine whether to proceed with an intervention at $t_{0}$. It's possible to carry specific measurements at the point where the problem was detected (this takes some time $\Delta t$). At this stage we can again ask whether the intervention is necessary or not? We can iterate this procedure a few times. Then, my question is, which is the machine learning method best suited for this classification problem? Can it be formulated as a Survival problem?
