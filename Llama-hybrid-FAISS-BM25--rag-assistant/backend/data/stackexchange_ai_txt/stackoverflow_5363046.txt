Jquery Portlet horizontal scroll problem

How can I prevent horizontal scrolling when dragging items using sortable portlets? Currently when you drag an item, you can scroll to the right without any limits as seen in the demo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets EDIT: I just noticed that the same thing happens when you drag the element vertically, it just goes on forever. Any way to add some kind of boundaries to the scrolling? Thanks.
