This could be solved using either latent topic modelling (cf. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, or just TFIDF), if you are interested in rather finding similar documents . If you are looking for ocurrences of phrases or words or sentences that are similar in meaning to some list of terms and/or phrases, then what you are looking for is a distributional aka vector semantics model. You could either download pre-computed embeddings (e.g. word2vec ones from google, fasttext from facebook, etc) if it's just words and the domain is fairly general. Or if the domain is something specific or you want more control over the model, then train a model yourself (given the python tag: look into gensim for both that and LDA). The search portion of the task is then is finding words in the target corpus that are similar (in the vector space) to your list of words, and picking the documents where they occur.
