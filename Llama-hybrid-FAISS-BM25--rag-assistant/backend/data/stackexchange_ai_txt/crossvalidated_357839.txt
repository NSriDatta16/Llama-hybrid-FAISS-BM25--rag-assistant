This example is indeed rather poorly conducted and full of typos, apologies from one author!!! First, there is no genuine $n$ (or related sample size) in the picture so the Laplace approximation cannot be universally adequate. The only thing that can replace $n$ in the integral $$ \int_a^b \dfrac{x^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha}e^{-x/\beta}\text{d}x$$ is $(b-a)^{-1}$, in the sense that the approximation becomes better and better as $(b-a)$ goes to zero. This is under the provision that the mode $\hat{x}_\theta$ belongs to the interval $(a,b)$. Second, as you correctly wondered, the constant $\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha$ in the denominator has truly and inexplicably (!) been forgotten in the final formula, which should thus be \begin{align}\int_a^b &\dfrac{x^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha}e^{-x/\beta}\text{d}x\,\approx \\ &\dfrac{\hat{x}_\theta^{\alpha-1}e^{-\hat{x}_\theta/\beta}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^\alpha}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi \hat{x}_\theta^2}{\alpha-1}}\left\{\Phi\left(\sqrt{\frac{\alpha-1}{2\pi \hat{x}_\theta^2}} (b-\hat{x}_\theta)\right)-\Phi\left(\sqrt{\frac{\alpha-1}{2\pi \hat{x}_\theta^2}} (a-\hat{x}_\theta)\right)\right\}\end{align} Third, the formula at the top of page 110 is missing two minus ($-$) signs, as it should in truth be $$h(x)\approx -\frac{\hat{x}_\theta}{\beta}+(\alpha-1)\log \hat{x}_\theta-\frac{\alpha-1}{2\hat{x}_\theta^2}(x-\hat{x}_\theta)^2$$ With these multiple corrections, the table comparing the Laplace version with the exact coverage can be reconstructed, for instance via the following R code: xop xact(5,2,7,9) [1] 0.1933414 > lapl(5,2,7,9) [1] 0.1933507 Once again, my most sincere apologies for this poor attention to details in this example!
