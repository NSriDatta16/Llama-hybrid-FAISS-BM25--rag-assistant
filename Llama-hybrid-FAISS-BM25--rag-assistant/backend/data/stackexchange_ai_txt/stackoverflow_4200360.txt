Magento ACL configuration

I'm developing a small custom module for Magento that edits subscription information in a small form. I have the data model all configured and I have built sample views with HTML forms. However, when I try to post the forms the Magento system does not recognize the URLs due to the fact that the ACL portion of my xml files is not fully built out. I have a viewAction, postAction and editAction inside my IndexController. Does anyone have experience with this who can point me in the right direction? I'm reviewing the documentation but it is confusing for an existing module. Thanks in advance. Kris
