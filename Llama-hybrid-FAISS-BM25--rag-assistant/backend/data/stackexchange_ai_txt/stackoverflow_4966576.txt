You should create a test method class that makes use of the apex trigger. This will take care of the code coverage problem. You then deploy the test class, and your new class at the same time. Whenever you deploy to production, the system performs a "Run All Tests". So, if there are any failing tests, or if there is any insufficient code coverages, your deployment will fail.
