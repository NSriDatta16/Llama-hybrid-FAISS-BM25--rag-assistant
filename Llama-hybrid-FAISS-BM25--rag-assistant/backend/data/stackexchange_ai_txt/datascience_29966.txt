For the problem of overfitting, you could look train models that employ regularization. For instance this examples shows how to regularize an SVM. Another thing I noted is that you have used the tag "unbalanced-classes". If that is the case, accuracy isn't a very good metric. While AUC is good at this, I've personally had trouble with this metric in the past. My suggestion would be to include a metirc like F1-score and most importantly in each case calculate the confusion matrix. This will show you if you are missing one class more than the other. If that is the case you might want to incorporate an oversampling method (e.g. SMOTE) into your pipeline.
