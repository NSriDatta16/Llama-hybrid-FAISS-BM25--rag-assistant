How to select features for a machine learning regression problem

This may seem like a noob question but for a machine learning regression problem, how do we select features for a machine learning regression problem? Background: The problem I am working on has about 190 features and only some of these features are linearly related to my output. Then the logical option would be to choose only the linearly related features for prediction. But, these same features are also highly correlated with each other. I read that features which are correlated are usually removed to improve training speed and increase the generalization capability ( https://towardsdatascience.com/a-feature-selection-tool-for-machine-learning-in-python-b64dd23710f0 ). So far the only algorithms I have seen for regression problems include simple Linear Regression, LassoCV, RidgeCV and these require a linear relationship with the output so I am confused as to which features to select. So coming back to my question, Can someone please explain how they go about selecting features for a machine learning regression problem? Also, what algorithms are usually used for Regression problems? I have read about LassoCV, ElasticNetCV, DecisionTreeRegressor but I would like to know if there is anything else I am missing.
