The biggest gotcha to watch out for is that often 'this' is not defined in the inline closure. Sometimes you can set a 'this', but it's not always the right 'this' that you would have available to set, depending on how you're using them. But I'd say most of the Flex code I've worked on has had inline closures rampantly throughout the code--since callbacks are the only way to get work done, and often you don't need the bring out a whole separate function. Sometimes when the function nested is getting to be too much, I'll break it out slightly with Function variables in the function; this helps me organize a bit by giving labels to the functions but keeping some of the characteristics of inline closures (access to the local variables, for example). Hope this helps.
