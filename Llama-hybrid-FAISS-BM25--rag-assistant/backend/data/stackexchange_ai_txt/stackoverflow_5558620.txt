C language standard, draft n1256 : 6.3.2.1 Lvalues, arrays, and function designators ... 3 Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator or the unary & operator, or is a string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type ‘‘array of type ’’ is converted to an expression with type ‘‘pointer to type ’’ that points to the initial element of the array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has register storage class, the behavior is undefined. Given a declaration of char a[10][10]; the type of the array expression a is "10-element array of 10-element array of char ". Per the rule above, that gets coverted to type "pointer to 10-element array of char ", or char (*)[10] . Remember that in the context of a function parameter declaration, T a[N] and T a[] are identical to T *a ; thus, T a[][10] is identical to T (*a)[10] .
