What is the difference bewteen linear regression using OLS and bayesian linear regression?

Assume that we have Data $D = \{(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n)\}$ where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$. $y_i = w^Tx_i+\epsilon_i$ Using OLS, I can estimate the values of $y$ by calculating the vector $w$. How does this estimated value differ from the value estimated using Bayesian linear regression when informative priors are used?
