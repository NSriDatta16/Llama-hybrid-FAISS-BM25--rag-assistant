A CSR is a certificate request . It's basically a text file with Base-64 encoded values. The process for its creation doesn't matter to the Certificate Authority. The origin/machine of the CSR doesn't matter. The values within the request matter (to you) -- DNS name, location, organization, etc. Your Certificate Authority will respond to your request with a certificate. That certificate can be used on any machine. Once the certificate is received, you don't need the CSR anymore. The important part is where you install that certificate, and how it's configured along with your web server. Matching DNS host names being the most important.
