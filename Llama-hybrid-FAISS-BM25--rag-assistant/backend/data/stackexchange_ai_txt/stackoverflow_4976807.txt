Is there any Settings to Enble the compression of DB size in 64-bit mongoDB?

I am using 64-bit MongoDB and I had done testing with 64-bit MongoDB. The testing details are as follows: I gave one million files as backup to my server using mongodb as my Database Storage. My backup data size is "22.8-GB". The mongodb size is "1.95GB". Are there any settings available to compress the DB-Size before configuring the backup to the server?
