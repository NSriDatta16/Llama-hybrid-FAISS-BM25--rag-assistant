I began to suspect that the constructor cannot call a base constructor with parameters. I removed the call to : base(param1, param2) and the class will import. Edit Okay, made some more tests with this and it seems that, yes, your class can provide parameters to a base constructor as long as the base class is not inheriting the part to be imported to the host.
