How do I interpret the accuracy of relative importance methods?

I'm using relaimpo package of R for measuring the relative importance of different regressors. It contains several methods such as lmg and pmvd. I wish to evaluate the accuracy of these methods and pick up the most accurate one. Ideally I wish to compare their accuracy with other models such as random forest.
