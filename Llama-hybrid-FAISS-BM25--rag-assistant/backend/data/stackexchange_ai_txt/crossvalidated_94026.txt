How can I improve the predictive power of this logistic regression model?

I am using SPSS to analyze a data set which aims to predict whether individuals have cancer based on five symptoms (a, b, c, d, e). In this data set most individuals have cancer. I ran a Binary Logistic Regression and got the following output: This tests the model with which only includes the constant, and overall it predicted 91.8% correct. I understand that the fact that I have significant predictors in the "Variables not in the Equation" table means that the addition of one or more of these variables to the model should improve its predictive power. I then looked at the model after all the predictors were included: The prediction is only very slightly different. Now it's predicting that two individuals will not have cancer. The overall percentage correct remains 91.8%. Why did no improvement occur, despite the predictors being significant? Where should I go from here with this data set? Is it possible to improve the predictive power of the model without including new predictors? How should I assess the model? Is the fact that it doesn't improve over the model with only the constant evidence that the model is useless? Full output viewable here . Data set downloadable here as a google doc.
