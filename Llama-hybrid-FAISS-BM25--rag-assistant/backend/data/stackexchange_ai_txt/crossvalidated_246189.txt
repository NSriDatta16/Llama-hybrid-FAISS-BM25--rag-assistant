Non-linear regression: Developing the functional form

I'm extremely new to this and stats/regressions in general so apologies if this question is not great or seems too simple. Let me know and I can expand/provide further info. The study I'm looking at is the relationship between the average proportion of males per occupation over time (2001-2014) and average occupational socioeconomic status score over the same time period. I'm using Excel and Stata. From the scatter plot below we know it's not a linear regression so have been trying non-linear regressions however both myself and my supervisor are not up to speed on these. We know how to work out the parameters in Excel and then how to transfer this into a Stata non-linear regression however we are stuck at the very first step of developing the functional form. I have roughly drawn the regression line (what we suspect it will look like) on to the scatter plot just using the draw function in Microsoft Word. Can anyone suggest a functional form for this line? Or a way of finding out what it could be? So far we have tried: $\begin{array}{rcl} y & = & a+\sin(x)+1 \\ y & = & a+\sin(x)+1+(b^2) \\ y & = & a+\sin(x)+1+(\log B) \end{array}$ Where '$x$' equals the Status Index score in $\pi$ terms i.e. $$(\pi/2)+(2\pi-[\pi/2]/100)*(\text{Status index score}).$$ I have also just been trying a polynomial form: $$Y_i=B_0+B_1 X_{1i}+B_2(X_{1i})^2$$ Where $B_1$ is a negative number. However this is also not working. I've added a screenshot of the data I'm working with. As you can see we are just experimenting with functions at the moment so any sort of direction would be great. Thanks.
