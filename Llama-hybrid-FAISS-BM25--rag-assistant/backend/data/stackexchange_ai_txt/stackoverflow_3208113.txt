You can find the mean of a list by sum(float(i) for i in lst) / len(lst) If the elements of the list were integers, you could do float(sum(lst)) / len(lst) but in your example they're strings, so you have to convert them. In this case I would actually recommend using Python's list comprehension facility to automatically create a list of the averages. If your original list of pairs is named, say, fruit_list (I know squash is not a fruit, so sue me): averages = [[] if len(values) == 0 else sum(float(i) for i in values)/len(values) for fruit, values in fruit_list] Although it seems a little odd, because then you'll get a list in which some elements are floating-point numbers and other elements are empty lists. Are you sure you didn't mean to use, say, 0 instead of [] when there are no values in item[1] ?
