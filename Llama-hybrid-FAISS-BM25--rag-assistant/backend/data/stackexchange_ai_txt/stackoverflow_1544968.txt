How to create a WPF validation rule to ensure two text fields have the same value?

How would I create a validation rule to ensure Value2 has the same value as Value1? If a validation rule is not the best method then what would be better? I could have the TextChanged event handle this, but I'm wondering if there is something more elegant.
