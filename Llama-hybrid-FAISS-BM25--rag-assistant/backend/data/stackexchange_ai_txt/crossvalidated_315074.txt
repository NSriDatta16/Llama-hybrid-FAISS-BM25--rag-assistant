One very relevant paper is Fern√°ndez-Delgado, Cernadas, Barro & Amorim, "Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems?", JMLR , 2014 . The authors evaluated many classifiers, among them multiple versions of Random Forests, on the entire UCI repository as of that time and find that Random Forest variants indeed perform best. It seems like specific variants of Random Forests may work better for specific classes of problems, but overall, plain vanilla Random Forests work very well indeed. Of course, the UCI repository has grown from the 121 datasets the authors used to (currently) 394 datasets (although probably not all of these are classification), so it might make sense to update that study.
