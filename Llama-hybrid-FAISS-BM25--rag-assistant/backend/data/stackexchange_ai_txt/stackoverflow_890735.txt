If you apply \d to a Unicode string (such as in "\X{660}" =~ /\d/ ), it will match a Unicode digit. If you apply \d to a binary string (such as the UTF-8 equivalent of the above: "\xd9\xa0" =~ /\d/ ), it will match only the 10 ASCII digits. Perl 5.8 doesn't create Unicode strings by default (unless you specifically ask for it, such as in "\X{...}" or use utf8; etc.). So my advice is: only pay attention to the difference between \d and [0-9] if your application uses Unicode strings.
