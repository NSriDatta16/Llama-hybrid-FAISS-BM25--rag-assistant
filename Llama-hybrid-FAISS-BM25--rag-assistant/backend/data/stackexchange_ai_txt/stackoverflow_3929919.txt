Code signing issue: Developer Certificate expired, help?

The last time I deployed on a device was last week. Since that time, I've been tweaking on the simulator. My developer certificate expired on Oct 11th. I tried to deploy on my iPhone today and got some code sign errors. I checked it out and discovered my developer certificate expired, so I went ahead and renewed it on the Provisioning Portal. Well, that didn't fix my problem, because now I see an error I've never had. In the Organizer window, in the Provisioning Profiles pane, under the provisioning profile for my App bundle, I have a Yellow exclamation point: "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain." I don't understand. I have a renewed certificate and my private key is still here. I feel like I'm going to go crazy. Please help! I can take screenshots but I don't know how to post them here.
