Extending a Hierarchical Beta-Binomial Model to account for higher-level groups

I searched all over but was unable to find an answer to this question. Please forgive me if I missed something obvious. In order to analyze an experiment, I recently implemented a Hierarchical Beta-Binomial Model like the one detailed in this blog post . This model fit my needs because I had 5 variants and wanted to measure the proportion of "successes" (i.e., clicks on a particular link) in each one. (In brief, this model works by assuming that each variant's success rate can be modeled as a Binomial Random Variable and that the rate for each Binomial Random Variable is drawn from a common Beta distribution.) Now, this is awesome for my simple experiment; however, let's say I'm also interested in analyzing this experiment for two separate populations: Wizards and Warlocks. I could theoretically split my experiment into ten variants -- WizA, WarA, WizB, WarB, etc. -- but I had a few questions: Would that even be valid? Is there a better way? I suppose I could implement a version of a multilevel regression model, but I was wondering if there was a simple extension either of the conceptual model or of the code in that blog post that would elegantly handle this experimental use case: must I immediately and necessarily look into something more complex? (Also: apologies for my naivete here -- I took basic stats in college but never learned much about these Bayesian approaches. I'm hoping to refine my understanding since this seems much more elegant than running a bunch of t-tests and applying manual Bonferroni corrections, which is all I ever learned how to do.)
