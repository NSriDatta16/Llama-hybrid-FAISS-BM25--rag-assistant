Are you actually doing some server-side programming or you are talking about plain HTML pages. I would advise that you have templates (this is specific to your development environment and tools of choice) and include the JS in those templates. Then the actual pages will all use the template and have the JS available. The question you are asking has in fact nothing to do with Javascript or JQuery, but the way you organize your site... unless I'm missing something.
