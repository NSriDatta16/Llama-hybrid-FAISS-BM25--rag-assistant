Calculate standard deviation with only the averages from a number of samples

I am trying to estimate the standard deviation of a population based on 100 samples each with 1,000,000 data points. I have been told it is acceptable to do this using only the average from each of the 100 samples (rather than using all 100,000,000 data points), but it seems to me that this would be quite inaccurate. My question is, is this a reasonable way to estimate the population standard deviation and, if so, what is the correct formula to use? Are there any adjustments that need to be made? Thanks in advance!
