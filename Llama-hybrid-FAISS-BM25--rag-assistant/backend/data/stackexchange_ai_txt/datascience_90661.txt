The CNN for MNIST: 5x5x32 Convolutional -> 2x2 MaxPool -> 5x5x64 Convolutional -> 2x2 MaxPool -> Flatten -> 1x512 Full connected -> ReLu -> 512 x 10 Full connected -> Softmax. The CNN for MNIST has 8 layers with the following structure: 3×3×32 Convolutional → 3×3×64 Convolutional → 2×2 MaxPool → Dropout → Flatten → 1 × 128 Full connected → Dropout → 128 × 10 Fully connected → Softmax. Converted to both to same formats. They are not the same.
