Drag and Drop Expander in WPF

I have a Expander as a ListBoxItem , I want to to add support for drag and drop the Expander item with in the Listbox. I found some nice tutorial from the following location. http://psiman.wordpress.com/2006/12/07/reordereablelistbox/ i implemented this in my project, but the problem is i am able to drag and drop only when the Expander is Open. But i want to Drag and drop when the Expander is closed.
