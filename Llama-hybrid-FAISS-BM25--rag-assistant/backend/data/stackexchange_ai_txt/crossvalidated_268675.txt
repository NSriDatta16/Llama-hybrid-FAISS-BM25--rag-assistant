Bayesian MCMC when a likelihood function cannot be written

Consider Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior distribution of some unknown parameter $\theta$: $$P(\theta|X) \propto P(X|\theta)P(\theta)$$ Where $X$ is the observed data, $P(X|\theta)$ is the likelihood function and $P(\theta)$ is the prior distribution. My question concerns the case where an expression for $P(X|\theta)$ can not be written however for a given value of $\theta$ it is possible to numerically draw samples from $P(X|\theta)$. How can we draw samples from $P(\theta|X)$? Links to literature would be appreciated. My idiotic and computationally inefficient approach would be: for the current value of $\theta$ in the markov chain draw an arbitrarily large number of samples from $P(X|\theta)$ and fit an empirical likelihood function. However my intuition is that since the number of draws from $P(X|\theta)$ is arbitrary only one draw needs to be taken but it is not clear to me how this would work.
