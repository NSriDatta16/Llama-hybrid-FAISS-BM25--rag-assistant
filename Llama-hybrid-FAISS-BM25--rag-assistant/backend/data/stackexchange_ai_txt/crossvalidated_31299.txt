Whether to use multinomial logistic regression with a three-category outcome variable and many binary predictors?

I have a dependent variable made up of 3 categories and 14 binary predictor variables. I have tried using mlogit and nnet/multinom packages in R. Is there a better approach than multinomial logistic regression for this particular scenario?
