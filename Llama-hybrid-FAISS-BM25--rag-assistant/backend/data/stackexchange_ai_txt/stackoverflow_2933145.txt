You don't need to change any setting on UILabel, just put the character with unicode 0x200F before your string. This is the reason: In Unicode many characters have a specific directionality, which lets the system know it has to be written, say LTR, like سلام. The paragraph usually uses the direction of its first character. That's why your string without the number is typed from right to left automatically. Now some characters, like numbers, have "weak" directionality, so they basically take that of their surrounding. When you type "1. בבוקר", the system first sees 1, so takes the usual LTR direction. Changing the alignment won't help, as it just shifts the whole text to right, or center. To solve this issue, Unicode has two marker characters (LTR: 0x200E, RTL:200F). These are invisible, but dictate the directionality. So while "1. בבוקר" is... בבוקר if you type "#x200F" + "1. בבוקר" it will display like this: ‏1. בבוקר
