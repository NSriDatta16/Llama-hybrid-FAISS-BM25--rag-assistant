Apologies that this is an answer, when it should have been a comment (I do not have the rep), but I wanted to clear up an erroneous claim that DAO/ACEDAO does not support Jet 4.0 record-locking. It does, and that is the default behaviour, irrespective of what certain MS articles claim. The problem is this may introduce huge bloat (hugely fragmented DB file) when using DAO edit/update and you cannot turn it off in DAO/ACEDAO. If you do have this issue, you can turn it off via first opening the database via an OLEDB connection using the correct Jet OLEDB:Database Locking Mode settings, which will allow you to set the database to page-level locking. This property will then be respected by consequent connections, DAO or otherwise, so you can then use DAO for fast updates etc. This will then allow DAO to revert to the usual 8X performance compared to executing SQL statements. Here are a couple of links pointing to the issue: Does ACEDAO support row level locking? http://www.access-programmers.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=47040 MS KB article, including code of setting locking mode with ADO, then using DAO on that DB - http://support.microsoft.com/?id=306435
