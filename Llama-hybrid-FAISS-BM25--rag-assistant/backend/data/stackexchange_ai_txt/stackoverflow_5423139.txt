category product relations

I have this problem with magento 1.4.1.1, when I delete a product it won't decrease the amount of products in the category tree view. I found out that magento is not deleting the entry from the "catalog_category_product" table. Can anyone think of a reason why this is happening? I'm trying to search the core where this function is being called (removing that row from the db) but I can't find it. Help would be highly appreciated.
