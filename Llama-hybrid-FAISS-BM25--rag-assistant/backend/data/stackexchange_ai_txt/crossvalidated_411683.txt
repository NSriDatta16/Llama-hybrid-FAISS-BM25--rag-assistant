Consider this formula Ho: group1 and group2 has the same average (e.g. do they have the same average height) t = (mean-k)/(s/sqrt(n)), basic assumption. variance is known. Ho: Different level of fertilizer (NPK) has no significant effect on plants. F = n(mean-k)^2 / s^2, w/c is simply t^2 from Practicality point of view this could be true correct. 2.If you have a control and treated group form the same population then they will be the same. But say if you have boys vs girls, location1 vs location2, they could be different. Correct. Possibly Depending on your objective. If you simply want to know if the group have different characteristics (like average) then t-test. If you want to know if certain applied factors (like different levels of cigarette's nicotine) have significant effects then use F-test. The formula is related but the application differs depending on your goal. No. since it doesn't makes any sense since t and F test have different goal or problem they're solving.
