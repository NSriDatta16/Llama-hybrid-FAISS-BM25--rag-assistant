Computing odds ratios for multiple dichotomous DVs in a within-person, mixed-effects design?

I have an experiment where people participate in a series of tasks (say 4) and then are scored based on their performance (pass/fail). The order of the tasks is randomized. I want to predict likelihood of passing on a given task based on whether they have previous experience with that task (Yes/No). I have generated some data below similar to what I am working with. df My original inclination was to analyse it using glmer logistic regression, like this: mod Which yields these results: FIXED EFFECTS: ----------------------------------------------------- Est. S.E. z val. p ---------------------- ------- ------ -------- ------ (Intercept) -1.12 0.52 -2.17 0.03 prevxp:tasktask1 -1.50 0.78 -1.93 0.05 prevxp:tasktask2 -0.85 0.56 -1.53 0.13 prevxp:tasktask3 0.04 0.54 0.08 0.94 I used this because I want to account for the within-person effects--ie that someone might have more experience with more tasks and their scores would be more highly correlated. This is in contrast to computing chi-squares for each task. I included only the interaction between prevxp and task because I literally only care about a task given prevxp. But am open to comments whether this is appropriate. Questions: Is this the best way to analyse the data? How else could I analyse this data? For example, I don't like that one of my tasks becomes the "reference group" Importantly, I also looked at the counts for prevxp given task and the number of people in each category does not seem to match up to the results. For example: dplyr::group_by(df, task,prevxp) %>% dplyr::summarise(n()) task prevxp n() 1 task1 0 42 2 task1 1 34 3 task1 NA 4 4 task2 0 2 5 task2 1 73 6 task2 NA 5 7 task3 0 7 8 task3 1 68 9 task3 NA 5 So Task 2 shows 2 vs 73 (in prevxp vs none). Yet, in the output above, Task 2 shows B = -.85, p = .13, sR2 = .012. I think this is because each task is being compared to Task 4 and I don't want this comparison. How do I compute the likelihood for each task while controlling for the within-person correlations across tasks?
