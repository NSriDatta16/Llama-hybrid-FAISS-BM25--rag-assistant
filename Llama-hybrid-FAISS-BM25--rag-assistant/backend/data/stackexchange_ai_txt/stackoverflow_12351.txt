First: This is a really big debate issue, not a quick Q+A. My favourite right now is to simply include Lua , because I can permit things like width=height*(1+1/3) I can make custom functions available I can forbid anything else. (impossible in, for instance, Python (including pickles.)) I'll probably want a scripting language somewhere else in the project anyway. Another option, if there's a lot of data is to use sqlite3 , because they're right to claim Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three. To which I would like to add: backups are a snap. (just copy the db file.) easier to switch to another db, ODBC, whatever. (than it is from fugly-file) But again, this is a bigger issue. A "big" answer to this probably involves some kind of feature matrix or list of situations like: Amount of data, or short runtime For large amounts of data, you might want efficient storage, like a db. For short runs (often), you might want something that you don't need to do a lot of parsing for, consider something that can be mmap:ed in directly. What does the configuration relate to? Host: I like YAML in /etc. Is that reimplemented in windows? User: Do you permit users to edit config with text editor? Should it be centrally manageable? Registry / gconf / remote db? May the user have several different profiles ? Project: File(s) in project directory? (Version control usually follows this model...) Complexity Are there only a few flat values? Consider YAML. Is the data nested, or dependent in some way? (This is where it gets interesting.) Might it be a desirable feature to permit some form of scripting? Templates can be viewed as a kind of configuration files..
