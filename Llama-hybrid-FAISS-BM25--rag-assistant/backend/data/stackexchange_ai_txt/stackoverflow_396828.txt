Very few I think given the intention of any site is to publish (i.e. to make public) information. You can hide your data behind logins of course, but that's a very situational solution. I've seen apps which would only serve up content where the request headers indicated a web browser (rather than say anonymous or "jakarta") but that's easy to spoof and you'll lose some genuine humans. Then there's the possibility that you accept some scrapage but make life insurmountably hard for them by not serving content if requests are coming from the same IP at too high a rate. This suffers from not being full coverage but more importantly there is the "AOL problem" that an IP can cover many many unique human users. Both of the last two techniques also depend heavily on having traffic intercepting technology which is an inevitable performance and/or financial outlay.
