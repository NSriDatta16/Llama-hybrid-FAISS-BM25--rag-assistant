Getting my public IP via API

Is there a public API from some big company to get my public ip from within a program? I've found http://ip-address.domaintools.com/myip.xml , which is exactly what I want, but unfortunately it blocks Python's urllib as well as many other http libraries, unless you spoof user-agent (anything doing that can't be called an API at all). The problem is that I need this data for some potentially open source library, so we have to play by the rules. I also know that I can just do smth like print $_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR] , but I don't want to server traffic to everyone using my library. So, is there something like the URL above, but real API, that allows robots?
