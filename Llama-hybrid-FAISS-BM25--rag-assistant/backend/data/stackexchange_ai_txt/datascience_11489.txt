How to determine if character sequence is English word or noise

What kind of features you will try to extract from list of words for future predicting, is it existing word or just mess of characters ? There is description of task that I found there . You have to write a program that can answer whether a given word is English. This would be easy — you'd just need to look the word up in the dictionary — but there is an important restriction: your program must not be larger than 64 KiB. So, I thought it would be possible to use logistic regression for solving the problem. I don't have a lot of experience with data-mining but the task is interesting for me. Thanks.
