As other commenters have touched upon, the real answer is that you can't change the URL of a web page (other than the "#" fragment identifier, but that's not useful to you) without causing the browser to send a request to that url. You want to not bother trying to change the URL if you're submitting via AJAX. Or, you can make a post request as suggested in other comments.
