I want to use LSTM to predict the arrival time of navires (boats/vessels)

The data that I have contain the time of arrival of the vessel (TA) and also the time spent to berth (ETB) for every vessel during the last year. I want to predict the ETB using LSTM in a deep hybrid model (I'm using different models outputs as an input for other models), but I'm still trying to fully understand if the use of LSTM or any other time series model is the right choice to make, as I think that there is a kinda of time dependency between ETB and the time of the year (different weather conditions)
