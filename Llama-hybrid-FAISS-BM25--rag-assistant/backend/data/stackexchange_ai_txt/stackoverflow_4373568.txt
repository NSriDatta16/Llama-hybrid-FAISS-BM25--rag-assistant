.Net 2.0 - 3.5 and .Net 4.0 has two different GAC's, if I recall correctly. "The size issue is partially solved with .NET 4 installer (x86 + x64) being 54 MB and not embedding full runtime installation packages for previous versions." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework So if you install .Net 3.5, you get the previous .Net runtimes. This might be confusing with .NET 4.0, which does not include these previous runtimes. I believe this means you need to install .Net 3.5 runtime along-side .Net 4.0 to get I also believe if you change the RuntimeVersion, you are getting the .DLL to install into the wrong GAC. It would be interesting, however, if this does work. I wouldn't trust it in a real-time environment, but it would be very interesting indeed.
