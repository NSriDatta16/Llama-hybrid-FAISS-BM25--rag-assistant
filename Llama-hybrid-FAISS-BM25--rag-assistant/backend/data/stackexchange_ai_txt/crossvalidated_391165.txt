Yes, it is possible to use regression where we have a continuous data stream. In particular, we can have a nifty little solution by turning an otherwise static regression estimator to an online estimator by training a simple linear regression model by stochastic/mini-batch gradient descent . As such, instead of sampling our existing data as we would do with standard SGD, we use the incoming data-stream to update our estimated parameters. When new data are recorded our estimated parameters will be adjusted on-the-fly. CV.SE has some great answers on: How could stochastic gradient descent save time comparing to standard gradient descent? and Batch gradient descent versus stochastic gradient descent that can really help built up once intuition on the matter. If you are interested in something more formal, Zhang (2004) Solving large scale linear prediction problems using stochastic gradient descent algorithms and Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2007) Pegasos:Primal Estimated sub-gradient solver for SVM are two standard references on the matter.
