EM should not be that intrusive. I find that it takes about 10% cpu for less then 2 seconds every 30 seconds with the default install (YMMV) and when the system is under load, it doesn't even seem to do that. When I talk about EM here, I am NOT talking about the load on the oracle.exe process, but instead from the nmesrvc and the perl, cmd and emagent processes it spawns. To see its impact on the database itself requires a bit of an oracle expert. I find process explorer a nice tool to help review this real time because it shows the process hierarchy from the service parent nmesrvc. Frankly, if you're actually seeing an end user difference when stopping the dbconsole service, then your box is over capacity and you likely need to grow up or out. If you use a different tool to manage and monitor oracle and other application processes, there's not much need for the dbconsole process to run all the time. To get very specific questions about Oracle answered by some of the top people in the field, check out the Oracle-L mailing list. Response times are amazing and the quality of answers are typically better then you'll find in other places.
