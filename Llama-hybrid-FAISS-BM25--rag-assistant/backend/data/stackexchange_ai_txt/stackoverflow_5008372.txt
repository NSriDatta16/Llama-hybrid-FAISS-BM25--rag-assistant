If you have a really large list of words and want this unscramble operation to be fast, I'd try putting the word list into a database. Next add a field to your word list table that is the sum of the ascii values of the word, and then add an index on this ascii sum. Whenever you want to retrieve a list of possible matches just search the word table for ascii sums that match the sum of the scrambled letters. Keep in mind that you may have a few false matches so you'll have to compare all of the matched words to ensure they contain only the letters of your scrambled word (but the result set should be pretty small). If you don't want to use a database you could implement the same basic idea using a file, just sort the list by the sum value for faster retrieval of all matches. Example Data assumes all lowercase (a=97, b=98, c=99, ...) bat => 311, cat => 312, ... Example php function to figure out the sum for a word function asciiSum($word) { $characters = str_split(strtolower($word)); $sum = 0; foreach($characters as $character) { $sum += ord($character); } return $sum; } Even faster: add another field to the database that represents the string length, then you can search for words based on an ascii sum and a string length which would further reduce the number of false matches you would need to check for.
