How to create a dropdown that contains multiple editable paragraphs (sections) in a Word file?

I need to create a Word template where I can choose from different paragraphs the one I need in the first section of the document. Something like a dropdown just instead of values I need paragraphs. It does not necessarily needs to be a dropdown, but any kind of functionality that will allow me to select from different pharagraphs (something like the optional sections in InfoPath). Thanks,
