Neither cookies nor HTML5 local storage working in anything except Chrome

I'm working on a javascript-driven tool that will store a user's selections locally and then repopulate when the page is next navigated to. It's working fine in Chrome but not at all in IE8 or Safari. I've tried to store this information in cookies using standard javascript, and using the jquery.cookie.js plugin, and also more recently I've tried using local storage instead. I'm storing a lump of XML, so my theory was that perhaps it's too large to store in a cookie, but there's no way it's too large for local storage. I'm testing this on my local IIS under localhost. Can anyone think of any reason why the other browsers aren't working? I'm finding it strange that it affects both cookies and local storage. I can only think it's some kind of a security setting that's restricting any kind of local storage, cookie or otherwise. I've played around with settings in IE, settings in IIS, but can't work it out. Any thoughts or ideas would be most welcome! Regards, Matt
