Graphing low-end prices of goods in a market over time

I have a large sample of market data - that is the prices and amount of goods being sold by vendors at specific, but inconsistent, points in time. Assuming I am a buyer and the quality of the goods are constant across the entire market (consumable goods by one manufacturer, let's say), how would you graph this data? Keep in mind that outliers may exist (fire sales or inflated asking prices). Seeing as I'm only concerned with the lowest-priced goods at a specific moment in time, a market average wouldn't do much for me unless I was buying most of the market's supply. I considered a box plot, but that also tends to be mean/median-biased. A simple line/area/bar graph of the lowest prices over time doesn't seem to give enough information, especially if there isn't much volume available at the lowest price. *I'm not a stats guy, so go easy on me!
