I think the best solution is the following: Using manipulation started will result in subtly non-standard behaviour. On most buttons if you click on it but then drag off, the button click will not fire. However, if you use ManipulationStarted it will fire immediately. The best way to manage these design time considerations is to use Expression Blend. In blend you can right click on the button and edit the template through the design tools, which makes knowing how to edit the xaml less important. It's really worth the effort to learn to use Blend.
