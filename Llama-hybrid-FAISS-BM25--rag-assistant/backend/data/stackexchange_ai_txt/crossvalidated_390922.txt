Multiple linear regression: observations with 2 or more values per factor / categories - a problem?

Is it a problem for linear regression ( lm in R) to have observations that have multiple values for a given factor? For example, I have the weekly average sales Y for many products and for each product I have information about the color ( X1 ), technology ( X2 ), design ( X3 ). With these three categorical variables, I want to see which might be indicative of higher / lower average weekly sales ( Y ). Is it a problem if products can take on several values in a factor? For example, suppose there are 20 different colors ( X1 ) across all products and that product ABC comes in three colors, 5 technologies X2 and 2 designs X3 . Can I handle this with OLS / linear regression using LM in R, or will I get wrong results? Also, it is not a problem that all my predictor variables are categorical, correct?
