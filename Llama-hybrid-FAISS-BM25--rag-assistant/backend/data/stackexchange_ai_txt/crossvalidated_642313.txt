Correct notation for uncertain expectation

I need to write some documentation for a couple of process design options. Ultimately, my organization has to find a way to estimate the values of vector $A$ . I have come up with a model to calculate $E(A|B)$ , the expected value of $A$ given a known value of $B$ . We do not actual know the value of B up front, but we do know $E(B)$ the expected value of $B$ . Through some fiddling of the process we can nail down a value of $B$ but not everyone agrees this is a good idea. The two options I need to document Fixed $B$ leading to a clean $E(A|B)$ . This option has some downsides that are not important here. Unknown $B$ leading to $\int_B E(A|b)f(b)db$ . Is there a standard compact way to represent option 2 that makes it clear that $B$ is unknown and subject to it's own probability distribution?
