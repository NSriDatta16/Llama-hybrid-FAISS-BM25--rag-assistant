Any workarounds to this IE8 bug?

Is there any workaround to the IE8 bug where some elements seem to collapse the vertical margins and reset it when hover over the element? You can test the bug at: http://www.gilbertybolona.com/seguros/generales/ And this is a screenshot: d.pr/Plf8 All of the elements should be equally separated.
