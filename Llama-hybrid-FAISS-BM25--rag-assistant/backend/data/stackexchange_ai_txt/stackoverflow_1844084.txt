If you want to encourage Adobe to fix this bug, here is a bug-tracker link for this issue: https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-1044 Unfortunately you have to create an account to view the issues, but there they are anyway. There are 3 other links, but stack overflow is preventing me from posting them because my reputation is too low.
