Convert two ascii characters to their 'corresponding' one character extended ascii representation

The problem: I have two fixed width strings from an external system. The first contains the base characters (like a-z), the second (MAY) contain diacritics to be appended to the first string to create the actual characters. string asciibase = "Dutch has funny chars: a,e,u"; string diacrits = " ' \" \""; //no clue what to do string result = "Dutch has funny chars: á,ë,ü"; I could write a massive search and replace for all characters + different diacritics but was hoping for something a bit more elegant. Somebody have a clue how to fix this one? Tried it with calculating the decimal values, using string.Normalize (c#) but no results. Also Google didn't really turn up with something.
