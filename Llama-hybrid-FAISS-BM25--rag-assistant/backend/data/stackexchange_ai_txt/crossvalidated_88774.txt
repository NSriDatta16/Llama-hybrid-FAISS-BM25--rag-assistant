p-Value of mean of sample means

I suspect this question is related to: When combining p-values, why not just averaging? Let me explain my problem: Suppose you have a set of sample means and associated p-values, standard errors and degrees of freedom. Let’s denote them as: $\mu_i$, $p_i$, $\text{SE}_i$, $df_i$ where $i=\{1,n\}$ It’s straight forward to figure out the mean of sample means. But what is the resultant standard error and p-value of the mean of sample means? I suspect p-values multiply in some manner…
