Maximum Likelihood Stopping Tolerance

I have a large scale problem that I am training with MLE. It is taking quite a long time. I would like to set a stopping condition. How does one set a tolerance level in MLE optimization? absolute change in logL absolute change in logL/number_of_samples %change in LogL Obviously one can always go with any of them, but which one actually indicates that the change in model is small (at least under some well founded interpretation)? For example (1) ignores sample size hence a fixed tolerance will not make much sense. (2) has some interpretation from KL sense, as average number of bits.
