Use of Stanford Parser in Web Service

I need to use the Stanford Parser in a web service. As SentenceParser loads a big object, I will make sure it is a singleton, but in this case, is it thread safe (no according to http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/parser-faq.shtml ). How else would it be done efficiently? One option is locking the object while being used. Any idea how the people at Stanford are doing this for http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/ ?
