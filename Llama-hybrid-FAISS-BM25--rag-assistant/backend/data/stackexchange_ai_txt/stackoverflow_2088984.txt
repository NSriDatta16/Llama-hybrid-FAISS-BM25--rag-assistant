I think that in this context it means true (so you have 4 booleans and you must produce true when exactly 2 are true). Your textbook should make more sense of the issue. Usually you assert that something is true. Edit. Here's a 3 variable example for Conjunctive normal form . I'm considering the function true whenever two of them are false. Notice how by reading the variables horizontally and then vertically you get the binary representation of numbers. 1 2 3 R L1 0 0 0 0 L2 0 0 1 1 L3 0 1 0 1 L4 0 1 1 0 L5 1 0 0 1 L6 1 0 1 0 L7 1 1 0 0 L8 1 1 1 0 The theory is that you treat each line as a separate equation. If the variable value is 0, you write it as v , and if it is 1 you write it as ~v . You use the logical or ( \/ ) between variables on one line, and logican and ( ^ ) between different lines. You only and together lines which are false. So, considering column 1 - p , column 2 - q and column 3 - r , the first line is p \/ q \/ r and the result is false, so it is added to the final formula, the second one p \/ q \/ ~r but true so not added to the formula etc. You need to and ( ^ ) the lines together if and only if the formula for the line is false. So above, you would get the CNF by and-ing together lines L1, L4, L6, L7, L8. Once you have that gigantic formula, you can work on making it smaller. It's been so long since I've done this I can't really remember the details as to why it is like this but I remember studying the proof at some point.
