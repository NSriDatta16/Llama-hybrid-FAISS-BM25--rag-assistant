No, you do not need to retrain. Because the trees are built independently, removing one tree is (on average) the same as training one fewer tree. See also Sycorax's link in comments and this datascience.SE question . If you're really wanting to compare different numbers of trees, it would probably be more robust to train more than one forest for each number of trees: you'd expecting to see decreasing variance in the ensemble as it grows, so examining some confidence intervals might be interesting.
