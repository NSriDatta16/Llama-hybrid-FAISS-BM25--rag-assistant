The hierarchical formulation of the model is a way of organizing it conceptually but, if you write out the whole model, they're all just treated as predictors. You could have cross-level collinearity that presents a problem. For example, if it were person-within-school, demographic segregation by school district could cause large cross-level correlations. So, 1) do not just check within level 2) In the situation you described, it sounds like collinearity is an issue. You might want to delete the predictor with the huge condition index.
