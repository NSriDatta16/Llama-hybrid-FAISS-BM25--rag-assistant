Beginner math books for Machine Learning

I'm a Computer Science engineer with no background in statistics or advanced math. I'm studying the book Python Machine Learning by Raschka and Mirjalili, but when I tried to understand the math of the Machine Learning, I wasn't able to understand the great book that a friend suggest me The Elements of Statistical Learning . Do you know any easier statistics and math books for Machine Learning? If you don't, how should I move?
