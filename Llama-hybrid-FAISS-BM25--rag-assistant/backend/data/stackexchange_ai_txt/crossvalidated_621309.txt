Propensity scores: Variable K:1 matching with caliper- some technical questions (MatchIt, cobalt)

I have a data set from a cohort comparing two treatmens which I want to balance via propensity score matching. I read some literature and decided to use a variable K:1 matching because this seems to have some advantages compared to a fixed 1:1 matching, particularly less reduction in the sample size. To ensure balance after matching I want to use a caliper. My first question is about the caliper: In matchIt the default setting is std.caliper = TRUE, so for my understanding this means, that if I use 0.2 there, I'm using actually 0.2 * SD of the PS. However, I found examples, where 0.2 * sd(logitPS) is used (and this option is still TRUE), which confuses me. Further, 0.2 * SD of the PS is not the same as 0.2*sd(logitPS), so I'm not entirely sure, which I should use. An additional question on that would be whether it makes sense to use the same caliper for all (9) variables, although some of them are binary and some are continuous. The next thing I'm not really sure is the performance of the logistic model estimating the propensity score. Regarding its diagnostics it seems to be a pretty poor model, e.g. Pseudo-RÂ² (Cragg-Uhler) = 0.11 and a lot of the varibles are not significant (I know, this schould be evaluated with caution and I won't perform any varible reduction here). However, I'm wondering whether this is okay (given that the matching itself works properly and produces balanced treatment groups) or whether I should try to put even more effort in a better fit. Finally, I use the package cobalt to check whether my sets are balanced and to produce corresponding plots. The default is that for binary variables raw differences are used and for continuous ones standardized differences. Which should I present in the tables and in the (love) plots? This can make a difference when having values very close to the margin of 0.1. Hopefully here are some experts on that topic. Thanks a lot in advance!!
