No, there's no standard way. I believe that the C/C++ standards don't even consider the existence of directories (or other file system organizations). On Windows the GetModuleFileName() will return the full path to the executable file of the current process when the hModule parameter is set to NULL . I can't help with Linux. Also you should clarify whether you want the current directory or the directory that the program image/executable resides. As it stands your question is a little ambiguous on this point.
