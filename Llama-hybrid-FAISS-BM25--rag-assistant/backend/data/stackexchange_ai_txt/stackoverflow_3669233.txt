Accessing datatable from different methods

I am creating a web application with back-end on ISeries. In the page load I am populating a datatable and using it as a datasource for my gridview. What is the best possible way to access the data in the datatable from other methods, on the same page? And in other pages? The way I do currently is to get data from the gridview and populate in another datatable and then use it... Is there a better (elegant) way to do that? Is storing it in session a good idea?? public partial class Main : System.Web.UI.Page { public DataTable dt; protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { loadData ld = new loadData(); dt = ld.loadTable(); GridView1.DataSource = dt; GridView1.DataBind(); } protected void btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { foreach (DataRow row in dt.Rows) { // do something } } }
