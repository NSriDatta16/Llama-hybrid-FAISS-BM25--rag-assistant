For in-memory computation wouldn't it be simpler to start with Python or R and one of their machine learning libraries? If the data does not fit into RAM, you can load only a part of it (for example, load only p fraction of vectors by loading each vector with probability p at random). Once you analyse your data, and understand which methods work best, you can scale up your system and rewrite your code in one of these distributed computation tools (or perhaps you find that you don't need this at all).
