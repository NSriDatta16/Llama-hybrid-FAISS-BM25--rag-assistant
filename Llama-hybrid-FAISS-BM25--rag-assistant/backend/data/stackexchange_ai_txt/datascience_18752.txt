time series prediction using LSTM

Hi I have fairly very short time series data. The data set has number of systems $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3},..s_{n}$. For each $s_{i}$ we have recorded number of failures on each day. As of now, we have recorded 30 days. I would like to know can I use LSTM for predicting number of system failures for next day. How about using Vector Auto Regression?. Any starting pointers and code references will be useful. Thank you.
