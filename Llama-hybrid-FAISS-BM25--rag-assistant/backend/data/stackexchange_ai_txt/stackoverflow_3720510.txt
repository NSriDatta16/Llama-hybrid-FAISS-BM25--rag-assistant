I have performed the following test. I've started a simple web server which is able to handle only two types of requests: return an image by number (8 images in total) return all images packed to one file Then I've written simple iPhone application which requested 8 images - one image per request and 8 images per request as one file. The results were quite unexpected for me because average time for one image when I requested all images as one file was 5-7 times faster than when requested separately.
