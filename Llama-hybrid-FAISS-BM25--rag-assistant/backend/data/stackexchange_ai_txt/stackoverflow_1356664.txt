DB Generator: Easy to make sure it's unique Needs an extra round-trip (you must read the generated ID back) Often pretty simple (sequence) When transactions are rolled back, gaps can appear in the sequence (thanks to Kristen for pointing this out). App ID Generator Can be as complex as you need (for example, you can encode the object type in the ID if you want) Hard to make unique (unless you use UUIDs) You can assign an ID even without talking to the DB [EDIT] Since UUIDs are pretty expensive (no native support in many DBs, index fragmentation, etc), most apps use a DB based generator.
