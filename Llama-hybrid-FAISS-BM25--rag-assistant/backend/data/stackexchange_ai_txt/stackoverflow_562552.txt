Skip lists are pretty neat. Wikipedia A skip list is a probabilistic data structure, based on multiple parallel, sorted linked lists, with efficiency comparable to a binary search tree (order log n average time for most operations). They can be used as an alternative to balanced trees (using probalistic balancing rather than strict enforcement of balancing). They are easy to implement and faster than say, a red-black tree. I think they should be in every good programmers toolchest. If you want to get an in-depth introduction to skip-lists here is a link to a video of MIT's Introduction to Algorithms lecture on them. Also, here is a Java applet demonstrating Skip Lists visually.
