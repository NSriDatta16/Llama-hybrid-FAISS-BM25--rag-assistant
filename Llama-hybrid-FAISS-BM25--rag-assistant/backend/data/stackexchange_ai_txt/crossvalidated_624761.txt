CNN regression: output mimic the input test data

I am working on convolutional neural network regression problem using U-Net architecture for computing poisson equations. The input data is particle distribution (rho) and the output is electrical potential (phi). After training, i try to predict using arbitrary rho. But why the resulting prediction is mimicking the test input data. What's actually happen? Whereas the MAE and MSE are pretty small (around 0.00xxx).
