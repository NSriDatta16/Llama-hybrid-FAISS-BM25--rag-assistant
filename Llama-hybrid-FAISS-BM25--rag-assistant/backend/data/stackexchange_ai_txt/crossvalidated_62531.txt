How to calculate weighted covariance?

I have two variables X and Y with weights a and b respectively. Pl. see the link for sample data. https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8GenCe8-hoFaGF2NlpTaGJGQWM/edit?usp=sharing I know how to calculate weighted mean and weighted variance for the variables X and Y . How to calculate weighted covariance values? What is the formula? I have gone through the following website: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean but my problem is I Have different weights for each observations under each variable.
