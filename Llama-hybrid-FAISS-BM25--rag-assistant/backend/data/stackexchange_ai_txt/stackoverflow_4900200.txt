What are alternatives to JDBC driver for access PostgreSQL database

I'm using official JDBC driver for PostgreSQL, but I'm stuck with the following issues: No support for PostgreSQL-ish data structures such as UUIDs. Common JDBC weirdness, such as: No function to escape values for consuming by PostgreSQL. Limited support for executing heterogeneous statements in batch. No rewriting of multiple insert statements into single insert statement when inserting many rows in one table. So, the question â€” is there any PostgreSQL database driver which can leverage full power of PostgreSQL without much boilerplate? I'm also use Scala language for development, so if driver is designed specifically for Scala it would be so much awesome awesome.
