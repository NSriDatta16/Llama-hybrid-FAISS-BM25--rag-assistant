Variance vs mean distance to centroid

I am confused, and I am about to ask a really dumb question. I am evaluating a (kind of) clustering model, and I want to analyse how "spread out" the samples in each cluster are. My intuition was to take the mean Euclidean distance to the assigned cluster centroid of all samples of the same cluser. My question now is, how is this different from variance? According to Wikipedia: Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value. However, when I compute the variance, it is not the same as the mean distance to the centroid. Why is that? Which one is the better metric here?
