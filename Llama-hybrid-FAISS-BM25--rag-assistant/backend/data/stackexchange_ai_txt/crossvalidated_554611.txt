The very next paragraph says: At first glance, the strong cycles in series (g) might appear to make it non-stationary. But these cycles are aperiodic â€” they are caused when the lynx population becomes too large for the available feed, so that they stop breeding and the population falls to low numbers, then the regeneration of their food sources allows the population to grow again, and so on. In the long-term, the timing of these cycles is not predictable. Hence the series is stationary.
