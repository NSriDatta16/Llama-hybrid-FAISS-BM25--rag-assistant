The exponential of the parameters in a logistic regression can be interpreted in terms of Odds Ratio (p/1-p)/(p'/1-p'). You can view this link: http://www.unm.edu/~schrader/biostat/bio2/Spr06/lec11.pdf As you can see, exp(b)=OR for a binary covariate, and exp(b)^Lambda=OR of augmenting the numerical covariate in Lambda units.
