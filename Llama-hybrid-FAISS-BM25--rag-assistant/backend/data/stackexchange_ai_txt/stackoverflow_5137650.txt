rcov outside rails

This may seem obvious but I don't find a way to run Rcov or coverMe outside a Rails project. I would like to use it with Rspec 2.5 I am using Ruby 1.9.2 so I guess this may be the problem. I also would like not to use rake tasks but a command on the command line. I have tried several things and the best result I got is Rcov report for : /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/rcov-0.9.9/lib/rcov/code_coverage_analyzer.rb and /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/rcov-0.9.9/lib/rcov/code_coverage_analyzer.rb No idea why
