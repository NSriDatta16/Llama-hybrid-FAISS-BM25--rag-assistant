It is my understanding that aliases are typically the result of a couple different things. For instance, when name-conventions change, or function-names themselves change. It would be disastrous to eliminate the old convention immediately. Additionally, they are helpful for users who come from a different language background, and would like to use many of the same familiar methods they're already used to. I don't think there's any additional overhead. But be sure to check the official documentation for which method/function name is encouraged as deprecation is always potentially looming in the uncertain future. "...there are functions which changed names because of an API cleanup or some other reason and the old names are only kept as aliases for backward compatibility . It is usually a bad idea to use these kind of aliases , as they may be bound to obsolescence or renaming, which will lead to unportable script..." http://php.net/manual/en/aliases.php
