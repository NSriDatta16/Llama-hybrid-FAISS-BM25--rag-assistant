Rendering error with a list on IE8, 7, 6

What is the trick to getting IE to display a ? I am working on a page with a php extension. I have a simple list. Stuff one Stuff two Stuff three Stuff four While on Safari and Firefox I get a list that renders properly, on IE it just displays a paragraph. I have not found one consistant answer on any websites about what could be the problem. What's happening? The template is from Matthew James Taylor's 3 column blog style layout. http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-3-column-blog-style.htm The css is right in the page. Even when I go back and strip the site to bare bones the lists do not display. Is there the possibility of screwing up the css because of a div style?
