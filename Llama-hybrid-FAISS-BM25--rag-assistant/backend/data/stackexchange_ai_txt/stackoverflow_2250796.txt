The SD C# Test Coverage Tool will show you what code is executed if you run your test cases separately. It will also compute the difference between the covered code for each case if you ask it to do so. This difference will be the code that one tests executes, that the other does not. Likely that's where your problem is. It won't help you obtain source for the .NET framework.
