How find controls limits for CUSUM chart

I am trying to re-do a simulation work in quality control. In this simulation they use bisection search algorithm to find the control limits h (the threshold) that gives the desire average run length ARL = 370. This is the information they give they simulate a random data with n=20 the desired shift .15 the desired ARL0= or close to 370 they calculate the CUSUM statistics c_i= min(0, x_i - mu_0+ k + c_(i-1)) the range for choosing h is between 0 and 5 and h1=0 and h2=5 use the bisection search algorithm (in this step they just give the number of steps which the algorithm should run =30 and the replication =15000 and the midpoint: h0=(h1+h2)/2 ). I never use the bisection algorithm and if there is another way to find h that give the desire ARL i guess it should be fine.
