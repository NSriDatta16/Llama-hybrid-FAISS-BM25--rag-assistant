Bayesian decision boundary for bivariate uniform distributions

I would like an analytical derivation of the Bayesian decision boundary between 2 bivariate uniform distributions. Let me explain with an example. Suppose the two distributions are $$U_1 = 0.25 \text{ if } 0 \le x_1, x_2 \le 2 \text{ else }0$$ and $$U_2 = 0.5 \text{ if } 1 \le x_1 \le 2, 1 \le x2 \le 3 \text{ else }0$$ My intuition is the following: the distributions overlap on the square $1 \le x_1,x_2 \le 2$ and $U_2$ is more probable there so it takes it. That is the boundary is $$\text{sample}(x_1,x_2) \in U_2 \text{ if } x1,x2 > 1 $$ So far I have silently assumed that the priors are equal. If that's not the cases then not many things change. The only difference is that if the prior of $U_1$ is greater than $2/3$ it takes the overlapping square. In other words, the boundary becomes $$\text{sample}(x_1,x_2) \in U_2 \text{ if } x1,x2 > 2 $$ How do I prove this though? PS: My question is kinda the 2d version of this one .
