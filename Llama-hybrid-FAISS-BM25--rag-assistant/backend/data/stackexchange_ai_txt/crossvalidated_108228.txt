How to approach time series regression with one continuous variable and one logistical variable?

I am working in R with daily time series data and have daily observations of two variables. The first is continuous. The second is zero for every day except one, in which it is a number ( I'm not sure what to call it, so I referred to it as “almost-Boolean” in my title ). Both variables are stationary. I have hundreds of observations to work with, but I have put together a month of sample data: d For a given vector y(t), what is the best approach/package to test whether variables x(t) and z(t) (and their lagged values) are predictive of y(t), either together or independently? Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
