Will auto-encoder works for already extracted features

Currently, I am try to use auto-encoders based deep learning to perform some classification task. (In particular, I am a newbie and just used Matlab build-in functions instead of other more powerful packages). Here are some Matlab examples. Auto-encoders Example . However, it seems to me that auto-encoders work quite well with 'images' input, and the auto-encoders can also extract very nice features for further classification. For my problem, I haven't got original images, but some calculated statistics attributions, for example, some already calculated mean, standard deviation, min, max and etc. My question is that can I still use auto-encoders for this type of classification? For example, my input is not images, but extracted statistics attributions (in other word, already extracted features). Or I need to use the actual data before the calculation of the statistics, and let auto-encoders extracting features?
