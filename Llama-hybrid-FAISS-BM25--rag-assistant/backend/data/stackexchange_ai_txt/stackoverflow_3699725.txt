How to split string into equal-length substrings?

Im looking for an elegant way in Scala to split a given string into substrings of fixed size (the last string in the sequence might be shorter). So split("Thequickbrownfoxjumps", 4) should yield ["Theq","uick","brow","nfox","jump","s"] Of course I could simply use a loop but there has to be a more elegant (functional style) solution.
