Why use the bootstrap for a skewed statistic when you can use a transform?

Let's say you are working with a statistic (say, the mean of the population) of a skewed distribution with a long, long tail such that confidence intervals must be very skewed to achieve reasonable coverage precision for reasonably high n ( OK, so you think you want to bootstrap. But why? Why not simply transform the sample using something like the Box-Cox transform (or similar)? When would you absolutely choose one over the other or vice-versa? It's not clear to me how to strategize between the two. In my case, I want to construct confidence intervals to make inferences about the population mean on a non-transformed scale. So I just assume I could transform, construct intervals, then reverse-transform and save myself the trouble with the bootstrap. This obviously is not a popular choice. But why isn't it?
