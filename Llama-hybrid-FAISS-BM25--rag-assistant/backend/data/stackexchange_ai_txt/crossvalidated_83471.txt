As you said correctly, the between estimator takes the individual effects model $$y_{it} = \alpha_i + x'_{it}\beta + \epsilon_{it}$$ and averages out the time component resulting in the regression $$\overline{y}_{i.} = \alpha + \overline{x}'_{i.} + (\alpha_i - \alpha + \overline{\epsilon}_{i.})$$ where bars indicate average variables and . signifies that time has been averaged out. You still need an intercept in this model to consistently estimate it. Note though that this estimator only uses the cross-sectional information and completely discards the time variation in your data. The estimator is only consistent if $\alpha_i$ are random effects (though in this case you may opt for the random effects estimator which is more efficient and also uses the time variation in the data). You can easily implement the between estimator in your statistical software by averaging the data for each panel unit to average out the time component and then regress the averaged variables on each other. For more information on this topic see for instance Cameron and Trivedi (2009) "Microeconometrics using Stata" or Wooldridge (2010) "Econometric Analysis of Cross-Section and Panel Data".
