From the WHATWG FAQ (which is one of the organizations that deals with HTML5: Different parts of the specification are at different maturity levels. Some sections are already relatively stable and there are implementations that are already quite close to completion, and those features can be used today (e.g. ). But other sections are still being actively worked on and changed regularly, or not even written yet. The WHATWG previously estimated HTML5 would become a Candidate Recommendation in 2012 and Recommendation is 2022 (or later ) Also, as seen in here , some expected in 2007 that HTML5 would become a Recommendation in 2010 Q3. I don't see it happening so soon, though.
