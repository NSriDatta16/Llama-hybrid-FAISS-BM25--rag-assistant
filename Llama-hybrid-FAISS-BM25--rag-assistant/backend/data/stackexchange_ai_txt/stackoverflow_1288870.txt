SQL is a good option. Database servers are designed to manage huge amounts of data, and are optimized to use every ressource available on the machine efficiently to gain performance. Notably, Oracle 10 is optimized for multi-processor machines, automatically splitting requests across processors if possible (with the correct configuration, search for "oracle request parallelization" on your favorite search engine). This solution is particularly efficient if you are in a big organization with good database servers already available.
