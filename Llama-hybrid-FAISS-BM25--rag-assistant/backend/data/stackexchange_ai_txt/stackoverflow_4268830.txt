Magento doesn't keep record of which items have been removed, you will have to do that yourself. Start by listening for an event; app/local/YOURMODULE/etc/config.xml ... YOURMODULE/observer removeQuoteItem ... app/local/YOURMODULE/Model/Observer.php getQuoteItem()->getProduct(); // Store `$product->getId()` in a session variable } } ?> Create a session class that extends Mage_Core_Model_Session_Abstract and use it to store the product IDs you collect in the above observer. You can then refer to that session object (called by Mage::getSingleton() ) to see what products used to be in the cart.
