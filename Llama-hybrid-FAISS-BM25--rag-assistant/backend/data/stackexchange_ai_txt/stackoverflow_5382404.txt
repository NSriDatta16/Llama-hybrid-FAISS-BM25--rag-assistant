Difference between pragma once inside and outside include guards?

Is there any difference between placing the #pragma once inside the include guards as opposed to outside? case 1: #ifndef SOME_HEADER_H #define SOME_HEADER_H #pragma once case 2: #pragma once #ifndef SOME_HEADER_H #define SOME_HEADER_H I'm just wondering out of curiosity if there's any special cases where I should prefer one or the other (case 1 or case 2) since I've decided to combine both (pragma and header guards) in my code. EDIT: I think you guys are misinterpreting my question... I am asking about the location of pragma once , not pragma once -vs- header guards.
