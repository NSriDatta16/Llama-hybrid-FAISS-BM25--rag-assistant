I think it's simply a matter of preferences, but from my experiences, I'd encourage you to use them as much as possible. In application we currently develop at work (using Zend Framework if it matters), we use one single try..catch block to catch all exceptions throughout the application which are shown to user as, for example, error 500s and exception is logged with more information to database. I, personally, love this approach in case of PHP application as exceptions are extendable and you can basically write whatever functionality you need.
