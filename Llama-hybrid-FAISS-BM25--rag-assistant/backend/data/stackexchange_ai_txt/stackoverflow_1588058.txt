Read two variables in a single line with Python

I am familiar with the input() function, to read a single variable from user input. Is there a similar easy way to read two variables? I'm looking for the equivalent of: scanf("%d%d", &i, &j); // accepts "10 20\n" One way I am able to achieve this is to use raw_input() and then split what was entered. Is there a more elegant way? This is not for live use. Just for learning..
