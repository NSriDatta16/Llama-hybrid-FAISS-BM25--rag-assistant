Linking FriendlyNames from the Registry to drive letters for USB storage devices

I am writing an application that allows Syncing to USB storage devices and I would like to display the FriendlyName for the devices that can be found in the registry at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR\ I am using GetLogicalDrives to get the list of available devices, GetDriveType to filter by DRIVE_REMOVABLE and GetVolumeInformation to retrieve the volume name and serial number. I would like to also get the FriendlyName out of the registry by linking the USBSTOR entries to a drive letter so I know which entry is which drive.
