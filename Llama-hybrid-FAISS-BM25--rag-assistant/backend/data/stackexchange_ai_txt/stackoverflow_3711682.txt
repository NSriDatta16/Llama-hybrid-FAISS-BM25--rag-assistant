If you have a good relationship to your client, you might want to ask her for her login details so you can do it yourself. There is one other possibility though: For a similar problem I was given the advice to build & archive my app and send the archive to the client. He could then resign the app using his certs, which would eliminate the need for him to do all the building stuff, not to mention it will spare you to surrender your source code. However, this will not eliminate the need for your client to enter all the meta information and so forth while uploading the app. For the necessary steps to resign an app, see this answer . To answer your original question: Each developer account has exactly one Team Agent. So you need some kind of workaround anyway.
