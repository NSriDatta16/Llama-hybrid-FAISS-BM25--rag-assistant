I have no info on another library, but thought I would add some information regarding PowerPDF and Unicode support for it: PowerPDF is essentially abandoned. Successor is the libharu library, which has import units for Delphi (pre 2009 version) as well, with the caveat that it needs a DLL to work. The real problem with it is that it doesn't support Unicode. This is nothing that can be fixed in a simple way by adding type casts and changing string types - the whole library works with single byte char arrays, so the only Unicode encoding that would be "simple" to add is UTF-8, and there is AFAIK no support for it yet. So unless you are prepared to invest significant work into updating PowerPDF I wouldn't even start on it. There's another problem with Unicode in PDFs - the 14 core fonts simply don't contain all the necessary glyphs. Proper support can only be achieved with embedded fonts or TrueType fonts that need to be available on the target systems or need to be embedded as well. Note that there are limitations on TTF embedding, each font will specify whether it allows to be embedded or not. Whatever library you choose, you should be aware of this as well.
