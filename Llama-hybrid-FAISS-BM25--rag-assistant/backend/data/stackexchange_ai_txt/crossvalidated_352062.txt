Handling cumulative sum of variable in time series modelling

I would like to build a prediction model, based on the time series data, but all the features are a cumulative sum over the period. For example, the value of feature x is 50 at t = 1 (original value 50), 120 at t = 2 (original value 70), 130 at t = 3 (original value 10), and so on. These data are taken every 5 minutes. Is there any way to handle this situation effectively by using some statistical techniques? And I think simply taking the differences between them would be cumbersome. I would like to know a general way to handle the cumulative sum of the variables in time series data.
