You should have separation of concerns, especially when grouping projects within a Visual Studio Solution. I recently ran into this problem at work where I had to create a bunch of unit tests and the original test created by the developer was included in the solution. At first, I thought O.K. I'll just put my tests in here b/c I know it will work and don't have to worry about getting the dependencies right. But then later on after I added like 20 test projects for each different unit I realized it was building so incredibly slow. I then decided to create a solution for EACH set of tests rather than putting them all in one spot. This also helps organize your code better so it's easier to find. For example, I created a folder 'Test > Unit > MyUnitTest' and 'Test > Integration > MyIntegrationTest.' Not only does it make it easy to find things later on, but it helps you make your builds faster. Also, if there a bunch of people working on the code at once each developer could potentially change the project settings and configurations and not mess up the others. The general rule is to have only 7 items or less grouped together in one certain area. If you have more than 7 items then chances are there is another sub-category you could create to make it more abstract and easier for the human brain to comprehend all the complicated details at a glance (especially for people new to the system or if you are coming back to the project months or even years later).
