SQL query for salary increase

I came up with following query which is not so challenging to resolve but still I think there might be better approach for this. Any suggessions? I have got following table: tb_Salary EmpID DeptID Salary --------------------- 1 1 20000 2 1 20000 3 2 30000 4 2 800 5 2 200 I want to increase the salary of employees by Rs. 1000 only when the average salary in the department is more than 35000. Is this possible using single update query? I did this in following way. But seems that it is not that smart solution. UPDATE tb_Salary t1 SET t1.Salary=t1.Salary+1000 WHERE 35000
