Comparing logistic regression models of winning percentage

I previously asked this question: link I've generated the two logistic regression models described in the link using all available data (8 seasons for all 30 teams), and now I want to decide which is a better predictor of win percentage in the coming season, winning percentage in the previous season or Pythagorean expectation from the previous season. I know that if you want to evaluate the predictive abilities of a model, it's often good to evaluate on data different from that which generated the model. I wonder how important that is here, given that the models are of the same type, created from the same data. It seems as though we could say that the model which was a better fit with respect to the data which created both models is better in this case. So, the question is: 1) do I need to see how the models compare on a different data set, and 2) what's the standard measure for model comparison in a situation like that I've described. Basically, how do I know which is better?
