Wordnet access using queries

Has anyone seen a library to access Wordnet using some sort of query language? My idea is that there should be a way to write something like: SELECT hypernyms(word, level) WHERE word = 'art' I've already consulted SharpNLP, but is not quite what I want. It's awesome, but not what I'm looking for. Should I use some query language, like SPARQL or some homemade dialect of SQL?
