I don't think it's possible without some scripting. You can add width and white-space:pre-wrap to your select tag, but that only wraps the visible part. You can't, as Madmargigan suggested, use a title to show the complete string (the title won't show). I have prepared a very basic script to demonstrate how you could do this with javascript. See this fiddle . It may give you ideas?
