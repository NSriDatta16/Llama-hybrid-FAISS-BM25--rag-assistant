The underlying statistical model is $X_1,\ldots,X_n\sim Bernoulli(p)$ iid ( $X_i=1$ iff friend $i$ gets a ticket; $n=7$ ), i.e. $Y_n=\sum X_i\sim Binomial(n,p)$ . You wish to estimate $p$ , having observed $Y_n=0$ Here are two approaches. Rule of three The maximum likelihood estimate is indeed 0. You could construct a confidence interval. A rule of thumb in this situation is the rule of three : a 95% confidence interval is $[0, \frac3n]$ . Bayesian approach You can perform inference in a Bayesian fashion. Your prior for $p$ might be a $Beta(a,b)$ , for example Jeffreys' prior is $Beta(\frac12,\frac12)$ . Your posterior distribution for $p$ is then $Beta(a+Y_n, b+n-Y_n)$ . With Jeffreys' prior and your observations, the posterior is therefore $p|Y_n\sim Beta(0.5, 7.5)$ . If you insist on a point estimate, you can choose between the MAP (posterior mode), which is at 0 like the maximum likelihood estimate, or the posterior mean, which is at $\frac{a+Y_n}{a+b+n}=0.0625$ . Of course, the estimate is different with a different prior. You might also want to read about the sunrise problem , which is related.
