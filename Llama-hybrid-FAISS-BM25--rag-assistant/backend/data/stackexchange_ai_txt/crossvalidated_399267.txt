Model with lower no of layers is getting better performance than standard models

Hi Everyone I am a beginner in deep learning. I am doing my research work in deep learning. The topic on which I am working is Skin cancer image classification. I have tried training various standard models like resnet,vgg16,InceptionV3 using my dataset which I got from ISIC 2017 skin lesion Challenge.But no of images are very less. There are only 2000 training images belonging to 3 classes. I have increased the images to a extent using augmentation. There are 8000 images now. The problem is whatever I was trying I was not able to increase the the accuracy for the above mentioned model. Accuracy always lied between 75-80% in all the three models mentioned above. Then I tried a model with only 4 layers and trained it using my dataset. My validation accuracy increased drastically (91%). This is my concern that why standard model are showing such less accuracy but this simple model is showing high accuracy. Am I doing something wrongs?? Can that happen?? Any Suggestions are warmly welcomed
