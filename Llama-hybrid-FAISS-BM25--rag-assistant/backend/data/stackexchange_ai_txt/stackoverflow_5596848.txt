Well, if the tendency is towards sharing information and data among different branches you're probably better off having one central database. Otherwise the hoops you'll have to go through to achieve the ability to share data will be far worse than the extra WHERE clauses needed for a shared DB. You could, of course, have a DB per branch and an extra database (a fourth database as of now) as a centralized storage for the information that needs sharing. Although you'd have to see if the over-complication makes this a best or worst of both worlds solution :)
