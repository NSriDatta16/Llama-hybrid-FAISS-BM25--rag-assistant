Predicting binary outcome when predictor variable increases

Suppose I have a simple dataset of numerous observations, each with a continuous numerical variable $x$ and a binary numerical variable $y$ (with values 0 for unsatisfactory, 1 for satisfactory). How can I predict how many of many of my observations would satisfy $y=1$ when the average $x$ in my dataset increases, say by 50%? I was thinking of starting with a logistic regression model, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Any guidance would be much appreciated.
