Simulate a fling gesture in Android ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2

I have an Android view that I am detecting a fling gesture on to perform an operation, and I want to write some tests to verify that the gesture is working correctly. I have tried TouchUtils.dragViewTo and TouchUtils.drag (with a very small number of steps) but neither of these seem to trigger the event. Is there a way to simulate the fling gesture?
