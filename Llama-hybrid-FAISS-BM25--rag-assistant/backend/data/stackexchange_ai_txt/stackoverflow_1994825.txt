What it sounds like you are describing is a Swiss System tournament or a very similar variation all described on the linked Wikipedia entry. Although rather than given an incomplete tournament to calculate ratings it is a way to organize a tournament to pair the best chess players with the best and the worst chess players with the worst to determine a ranking without the need for everyone to play everyone else.
