I can use unsigned short to store it. Yes you can use unsigned short (assuming (sizeof(unsigned short) * CHAR_BITS) >= 10) An upside to this is that it'll use less storage space to store the value. Less than what? Less than int? Depends what is the sizeof(int) on your system? Will performance suffer? Depends. The type int is supposed to be the most efficient integer type for your system so potentially using short may affect your performance. Whether it does will depend on the system. Time it and find out. If I decided to store data as short but all the calling functions use int, it's recognized that I need to convert between these datatypes when storing or extracting values. Yes. But the compiler will do the conversion automatically. One thing you need to watch though is conversion between signed and unsigned types. If the value does not fit the exact result may be implementation defined. Will performance suffer? Maybe. if sizeof(unsigned int) == sizeof(unsigned short) then probably not. Time it and see. Will the loss in performance be dramatic? Time it and see. If I decided to not use short but just 10 bits packed into an array of unsigned int. What will happen in this case comparing with previous ones? Time it and see.
