Normally, C unions are represented using StructLayout.Explicit in C#. This probably won't work in your case, however - while you can overlay IStream and IStorage references like that, the marshaller will try to marshal both. Your best bet is probably to just declare the field as IntPtr in your declaration of STGMEDIUM , and use Marshal.GetIUnknownForObject to initialize it.
