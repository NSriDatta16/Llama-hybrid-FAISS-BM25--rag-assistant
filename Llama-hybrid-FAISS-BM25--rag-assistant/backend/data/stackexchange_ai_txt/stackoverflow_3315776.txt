Store data in file system rather than SQL or Oracle database

As I am working on Employee Management system, I have two table (for example) in database as given below. EmployeeMaster (DB table structure) EmployeeID (PK) | EmployeeName | City MonthMaster (DB table structure) Month | Year | EmployeeID (FK) | PrenentDays | BasicSalary Now my question is, I want to store data in file system rather than storing data in SQL or ORACLE. I want my data in file system storage for Insert, Edit and Delete opration with keeping relation with objects too. I am a C# developer, Could anybody have thoughts or idea on it. (To store data in file system with keeping relations between them) Thanks in advance. Any ideas on it?
