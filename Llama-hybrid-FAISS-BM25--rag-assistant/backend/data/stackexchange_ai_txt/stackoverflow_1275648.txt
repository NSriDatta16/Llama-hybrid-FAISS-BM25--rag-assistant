I'm assuming you're not really allowing any other Sometimes you need to preserve single line-breaks (not all elements are bad), and you only want to turn double instances of into paragraph breaks. In doing so I would: Remove all line breaks Wrap the whole lot in a paragraph Replace with \n Lastly, remove any empty elements that might have been generated So the code could look something like: var ConvertToParagraphs = function(text) { var lineBreaksRemoved = text.replace(/\n/g, ""); var wrappedInParagraphs = " " + lineBreaksRemoved + " "; var brsRemoved = wrappedInParagraphs.replace(/ ]*>[\s]* ]*>/gi, " \n "); var emptyParagraphsRemoved = brsRemoved.replace(/ /g, ""); return emptyParagraphsRemoved; } Note: I've been exceedingly verbose to show the processes, you'd simplify it of course. This turns your sample: bla bla bla long paragraph here bla bla bla more paragraph text Into: bla bla bla long paragraph here bla bla bla more paragraph text But it does so without removing any elements that you may actually want.
