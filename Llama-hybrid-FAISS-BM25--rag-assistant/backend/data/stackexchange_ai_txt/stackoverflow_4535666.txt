How do I bind a key to "the function represented by the following key sequence"?

I'm just starting to learn emacs (woohoo!) and I've been mucking around in my .emacs quite happily. Unfortunately, I don't know Lisp yet, so I'm having issues with the basics. I've already remapped a few keys until I fix my muscle memory: (global-set-key (kbd " ") 'recompile) That's fine. But how can I tell a key to 'simulate pressing several keys'? For instance, I don't know, make do the same as C-u 2 C-x } (widen buffer by two chars). One way is to look up that C-x } calls shrink-window-horizontally , and do some sort of lambda thing. This is of course the neat and elegant way (how do you do this?). But surely there's a way to define to send the keystrokes C-u 2 C-x } ?
