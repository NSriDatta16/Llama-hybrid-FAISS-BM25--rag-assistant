I finally figured it out. For the sake of the next guy... shahkalpesh and serge_ bg are right about the "Verify Data" If you right click on a blank spot on your report, you will get a popup menu. Select Database -> Verify__Database. Crystal Reports should update the fields that have changed. You can drag-n-drop the new field onto your report. There should be a "Field Explorer" tree view (probably on the left). Select Database Fields -> View/Table Name -> Field Name and drag that onto your report. A worst case scenario of Crystal Reports updating report field to match up with the wrong field on the view, can be resolved by deleting the old field and re-adding the field using the drag and drop method.
