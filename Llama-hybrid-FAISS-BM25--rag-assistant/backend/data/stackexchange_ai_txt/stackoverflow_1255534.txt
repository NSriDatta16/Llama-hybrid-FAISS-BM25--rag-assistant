If the app runs well in Vista it can be expected to do the same in Windows 7. If your manifest file lacks a Compatibility section, then your application will run in Vista compatibility mode by default, as explained here .* I assume that by "systray" you are referring to the Notification Area. User control of the Notification Area has been enhanced in Windows 7, and your users may need to enable your application's icon to show there. The MSDN documentation suggests some considerations for use of the Notification Area - that it's really for short-term notifications, especially for apps that have no desktop presence. For example, it's not intended for quick-launch. There's no reason to expect Delphi-related issues in this context. *EDIT: From the MSDN article (link with asterisk above): Applications without a Compatibility section in their manifest will receive Windows Vista behavior by default on Windows 7 and future Windows versions. Note that Windows XP and Windows Vista ignore this manifest section and it has no impact on them. The following Windows components provide divergent behavior based on the Compatibility section in Windows 7: RPC Default Thread Pool DirectDraw Lock DirectDraw Bit Block Transfer (Blt) to Primary without Clipping Window GetOverlappedResult API Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) Details for each behavior (Vista vs. Win7) can be found in that article .
