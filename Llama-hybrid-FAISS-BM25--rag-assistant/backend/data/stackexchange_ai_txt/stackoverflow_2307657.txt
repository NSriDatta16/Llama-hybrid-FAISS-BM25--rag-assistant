while in your script tag, press CTRL-SHIFT-J. Watch the status bar for messages e.g. 'updateing js intellisense' Then look at your Errors List and make sure there were no errors. VS actually parses all the referenced javascript, effectively compiling it, to generate intellisense. If there are errors in the JS, intellisense is broken. That is just the way it is. It encourages clean code with tough love. jQuery is a notorious source of intellisense breakage. Get a baseline by closing all documents, create a new html, reference jquery, ensure the vsdoc file has the same name + -vsdoc and that it is in the same directory. Press CTRL-SHIFT-J and ensure no errors have borked intellisense. Then start adding your scripts. Good luck.
