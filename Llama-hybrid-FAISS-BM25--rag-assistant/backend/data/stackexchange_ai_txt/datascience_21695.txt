Based on the data seen in your graphs, according to me, this is a time series modelling problem and a model like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Model Average) would be a better fit. Since you mentioned that you're starting (you've probably done a lot by now) here's a tutorial by Dr Jason Brownlee on implementing ARIMA on Python: ARIMA for time series forecasting with Python . This is for in sample prediction, where you want to predict values for which you already have to test the model. For out of sample Prediction see: Time Series ARIMA model for forecasting with Python
