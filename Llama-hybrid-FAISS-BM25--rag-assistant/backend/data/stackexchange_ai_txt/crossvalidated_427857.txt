How to interpret linear regression coefficients from R summary?

We are trying to understand the impact of number of workdays on sales. Please find reprex below: library(tidyverse) # Work days for January from 2010 - 2018 data = data.frame(work_days = c(20,21,22,20,20,22,21,21), sale = c(1205,2111,2452,2054,2440,1212,1211,2111)) # Apply linear regression model = lm(sale ~ work_days, data) summary(model) Call: lm(formula = sale ~ work_days, data = data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -677.8 -604.5 218.7 339.0 645.3 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2643.82 5614.16 0.471 0.654 work_days -38.05 268.75 -0.142 0.892 Residual standard error: 593.4 on 6 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.00333, Adjusted R-squared: -0.1628 F-statistic: 0.02005 on 1 and 6 DF, p-value: 0.892 Could you please help me understand if the coefficients Every work day decreases the sale by 38.05 ? data = data.frame(work_days = c(20,21,22,20,20,22,21,21), sale = c(1212,1211,2111,1205,2111,2452,2054,2440)) model = lm(sale ~ work_days, data) summary(model) Call: lm(formula = sale ~ work_days, data = data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -686.8 -301.0 -8.6 261.3 599.7 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -6220.0 4555.9 -1.365 0.221 work_days 386.6 218.1 1.772 0.127 Residual standard error: 481.5 on 6 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.3437, Adjusted R-squared: 0.2343 F-statistic: 3.142 on 1 and 6 DF, p-value: 0.1267 Does this mean, Every workday increases the sales by 387 ? How about the negative intercept ?
