Has any "big name entity" published C++0x syntax best practices

Although this "conversation" could quickly degenerate into something like "this is how I think ..." the question is not. Has any "big name entity" (e.g., google or the likes, Scott Meyers or the likes, etc.) published anything freely available which dictates/suggests what they feel the syntax guides lines for their code base should be for some/any of the C++0x features? For example, I've seen all sort of example code for variadic templates written with different spacing with respect to the ellipses. Has anyone weighed anyone weighed in on what the believe is the most expressive/readable version of some/all the constructs? @jalf: Even if you don't believe anyone should tell you how to do such trivialities there are examples of big organizations that have formatting related standards in their coding standards (e.g., Google , Gnu ) but these don't have to do with C++0x features (which was what I was asking).
