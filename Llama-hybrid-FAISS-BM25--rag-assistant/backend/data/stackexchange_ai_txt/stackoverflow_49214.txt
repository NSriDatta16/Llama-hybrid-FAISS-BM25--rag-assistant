Populating a list of integers in .NET

I need a list of integers from 1 to x where x is set by the user. I could build it with a for loop eg assuming x is an integer set previously: List iList = new List (); for (int i = 1; i This seems dumb, surely there's a more elegant way to do this, something like the PHP range method
