I've had excellent luck with these Cocoa Dev Central tutorials, and they're short and well-organized enough that you should be able to skip over any parts that you feel you already know. http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000081.php (C) http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/ (Obj-C) http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_cocoa/ (Cocoa part 1) http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_cocoa_two/ (Cocoa part 2) http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000082.php (Style part 1) http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000083.php (Style part 2) It sounds to me like you can probably skip the first (C), but it couldn't hurt to skim it. The second (Obj-C, especially Part 5, Designing a Class Interface , and onward) is where the answers to your immediate questions lie. Good luck!
