I believe he's saying that he wants to write a plugin to be able to retrieve a sidebar from another website and display it (possibly as a widget?). If that is not the question then I apologize; otherwise, I'll take a shot at answering. The first thing I would recommend would be to view the code of just about any other widget plugin to make sure that a plugin (and not just some JavaScript) is really what you want. Assuming you want the plugin, check out this resource for some basics . Also, you'll need the retrieval code which will either be "screen-scraping" in PHP or AJAX partial page loading with JavaScript . I hope any or all of this helps you get where you're going.
