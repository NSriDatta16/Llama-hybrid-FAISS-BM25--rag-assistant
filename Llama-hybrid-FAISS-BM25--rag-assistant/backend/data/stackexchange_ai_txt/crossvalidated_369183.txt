Use of svyglm for a weighted regression in a bayesian framework

I am using the twang package in R to balance two groups by creating propensity scores, which are then used as weights in the svyglm for a weighted regression of the two groups. I would like however to use the weights in a bayesian glm, since this is the model employed also previously in the analysis. How could I implement this, or, is there even a package which allows for propensity-weighted regression in a bayesian context? Edit: I have read that the weights parameter in stan is not equal to the parameter in svyglm, however, it seems to be that bmrs is allowing for survey-weighted regression in the same manner as svyglm does. Is that correct?
