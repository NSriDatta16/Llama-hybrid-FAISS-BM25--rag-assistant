Assuming that the algebraic expression you have is correct, do the following: Suppose that you want the time $t_i$ simulation and you have data up to time $t_{i-1}$: Take a random draw for $\varepsilon_i \sim Exp(1)$ Plug in values to the expression you have to create $x_i = \log(t_i) - \beta t_i$ Use the Lambert W function to get $t_i$. $$t_i = -\frac{W(-e^{x_i} \beta)}{\beta}$$ Here's a link to how to use the Lambert W package in R: http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/LambertW/docs/W After you have a large number of simulations, take the average.
