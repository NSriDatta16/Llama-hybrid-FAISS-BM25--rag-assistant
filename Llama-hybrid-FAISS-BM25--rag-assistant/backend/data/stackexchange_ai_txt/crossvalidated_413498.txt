Does a CNN object detector always return the same results for the same image?

There're many object detectors which use convolutional neural networks to detect objects in images or point clouds, like YOLO, SSD, AVOD. My question is, if i feed the same image to an object detector many times, will the results of each time be the same? Is there any randomness in a CNN object detector that makes it produce different results for the same image? Thanks in advance.
