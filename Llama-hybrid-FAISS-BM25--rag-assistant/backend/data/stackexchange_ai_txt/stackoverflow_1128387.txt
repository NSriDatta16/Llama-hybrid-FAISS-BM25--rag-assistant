nullobject for File in Java

I have a class that occasionally gets passed null for File objects. During normal operation it uses a Scanner class to parse through the file. Instead of littering my code with null checks against the File objects, I thought I could replace the File s with nullobjects (Gang of Four style). However, it looks like File isn't really designed to be extended. Does any one have any pointers on how to do this?
