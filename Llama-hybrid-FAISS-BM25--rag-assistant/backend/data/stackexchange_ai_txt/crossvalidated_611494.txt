How to perform two-stage PCA?

I was reading this paper when I stumbled upon two-staged PCA; apparently it divides indicators into sub-indices because empirical evidence supports that PCA is biased towards the weights of indicators which are highly correlated with each. I was wondering how to make sense of the step by step process and how to perform it in Stata.
