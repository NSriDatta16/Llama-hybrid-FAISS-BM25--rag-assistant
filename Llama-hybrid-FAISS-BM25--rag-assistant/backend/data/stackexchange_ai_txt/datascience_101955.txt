This sounds as a supervised change point detection task. I believe your approach with the 0/1 dummy variable is fine. Alternatively to the neural network approach you could try out some classification algorithms. You might find helpful this review on change point detection ( A Survey of Methods for Time Series Change Point Detection ), where some alternative classifiers are suggested for the task (see "Supervised Methods" subsection).
