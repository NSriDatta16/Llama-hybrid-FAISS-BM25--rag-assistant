Based on your last paragraph, what you're trying to do is inject some 'extra methods' into unit testing since you're already testing a specific class. I do not know of a testing harness that allows you to attach tests based on the hierarchy of a class. However, with your own suggestion of using TestNG for building something similar, I think you might be very close. You could very well incorporate some base code that adds your class to a list of 'default test classes', which are in turn tested if they implement a specific interface. Still, regarding the general case, I think you're out of luck, since the Java type system is one-way, you can only (easily) find out what interfaces a class implements, not the other way around. Furthermore, the problem is 'where to stop looking': if you have a test that checks all your comparable implementers, do you want it to check the validity of String 's one too, since that is in your Java environment?
