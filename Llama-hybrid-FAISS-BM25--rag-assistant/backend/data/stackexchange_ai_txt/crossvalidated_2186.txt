Off the top of my head, I would say that the following general purpose books are rather interesting as a first start: Izenman, J. Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques: Regression, Classification, and Manifold Learning . Springer. companion website Tinsley, H. and Brown, S. (2000). Handbook of Applied Multivariate Statistics and Mathematical Modeling . Academic Press. There is also many applied textbook, like Everitt, B.S. (2005). An R and S-PlusÂ® Companion to Multivariate Analysis . Springer. companion website It is difficult to suggest you specific books as there are many ones that are domain-specific (e.g. social sciences, machine learning, categorical data, biomedical data).
