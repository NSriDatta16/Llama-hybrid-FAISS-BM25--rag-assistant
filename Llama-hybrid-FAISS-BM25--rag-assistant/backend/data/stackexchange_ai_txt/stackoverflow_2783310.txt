The OP is not converting to ascii nor utf-8. That's why the suggested encode methods won't work. Try this: v = u'Andr\xc3\xa9' s = ''.join(map(lambda x: chr(ord(x)),v)) The chr(ord(x)) business gets the numeric value of the unicode character (which better fit in one byte for your application), and the ''.join call is an idiom that converts a list of ints back to an ordinary string. No doubt there is a more elegant way.
