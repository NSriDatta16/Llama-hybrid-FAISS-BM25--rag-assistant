You can combine them - On the purely technical level by concatenating them all together and feeding them as features. (Assuming you did each transformation seperately). You could also do each transformation on the product of the previous one, though I don't know if this makes any sense or is better or even sound. (I.E - PCA on the original features, then LDA on the PCA..)
