Why does Lasso behave "erratically" when the number of features is greater than the number of training instances?

From the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow 2nd edition" chapter 4: In general, Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso since Lasso may behave erratically when the number of features is greater than the number of training instances or when several features are strongly correlated. How and why exactly does Lasso behave "erratically" when no. of features > no. of training instances or when features are strongly correlated? Does it have to do with redundant features?
