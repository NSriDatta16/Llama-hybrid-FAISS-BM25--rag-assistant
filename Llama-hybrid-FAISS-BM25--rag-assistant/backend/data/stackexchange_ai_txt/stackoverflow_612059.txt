How do you structure your entities you intend to reuse?

Lets say you have the following entities in your database: Image http://lh6.ggpht.com/_UpGtM3B8h1U/Sa7SqfWmgDI/AAAAAAAAAHE/epqtm7EnoFg/test.gif You want to be able to add a note to all three of the other entity tables (User, Client and Project). How would you set this up? Add a tableName and a FKId to the Note table? Create a separate table for each associated Note group (ie., ClientNote, UserNote) Create a separate field in Note for each Foreign key (UserId, ClientId, etc) I seem to be going back and forth between option 2 and 3, although I'd be up for 1 if there were an elegant implementation. Option 2 is attractive because there are no nulls. Option 3 is attractive because a note feels like a note no matter what it is associated with. Any thoughts?
