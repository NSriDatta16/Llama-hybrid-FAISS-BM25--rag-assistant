Repeated measures omnibus is applicable. If you don't care about time, then take the average over replications so you end up with just site x habitat. If you think that the time variable matters, things will get more complicated because 'time' isn't a fixed factor - the time ranges between replications aren't equivalent. If you had to do that, I suppose you could somehow add actual time as a covariate to somewhat detrend the data.
