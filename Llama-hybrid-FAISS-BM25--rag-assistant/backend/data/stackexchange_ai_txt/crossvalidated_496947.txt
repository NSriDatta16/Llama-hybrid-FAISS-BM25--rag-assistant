Is there any model that can handle time ordered multi classification?

I'm working on a little project and the task's the following: There are transactions for 16 products and ~75.000 clients on a 18-month time series, where each row is one transaction from one client-product combination on a given date. I've also got a list of 5 products for which I need to make predictions. My goal is to predict for each client, which of the 5 products will they use in the following 6 months (if any) and in which order will they use them. So, my final output would look something like: Client Ordered predicted products 1 A, C 2 B 3 - 4 E, B, C, A, D I don't know which model could help me with this specific task. I know LSTMs work well with time series data but I'm not sure if they work for this problem. Do you have any ideas? Please let me know if you need further explanation. Thanks.
