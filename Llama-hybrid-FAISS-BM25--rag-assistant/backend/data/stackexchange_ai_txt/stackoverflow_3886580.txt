JTable: grabbing data?

how can you parse all the data from table model, so that it can readily be loaded and displayed easily as JTable ? for example, with the loaded JTable, I drag and drop the columns to change the orders. How would I get all of the table information ? Is there a certain standard to store this data in so it can easily be read by the next JTable ?
