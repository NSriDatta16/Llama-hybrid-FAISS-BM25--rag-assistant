How about a bookmarklet which composes some html into a string, then uses a combination of window.location and document.write() to display it? var links = " Suggested links "; links += " Example Suggested Link "; links += " "; window.location = 'javascript:document.write("' + links + '");' ; You have to be careful with your quoting, to make sure that the right string gets displayed, but after a quick test it seems to respect the back-button... Here's a sample: http://jsbin.com/ebuko4 - it works for me in Firefox, but I haven't tested it elsewhere... code is: JS Bin Sample bookmarklet Does this bookmarklet work? "+ " Suggested link: Example.com " + " Suggested link: Example.net " + " "; window.location = "javascript:document.write(%27" + l + "%27);"; })()'>Sample Bookmarklet - drag me to your toolbar
