First, the acceptance rate for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and MALA should be lower than 50%. For instance, to quote from an answer to an earlier X validated question , I believe that Weak convergence and optimal scaling of random walk Metropolis algorithms by Roberts, Gelman and Gilks is the source for the 0.234 optimal acceptance rate. What the paper shows is that, under certain assumptions, you can scale the random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as the dimension of the space goes to infinity to get a limiting diffusion for each coordinate. In the limit, the diffusion can be seen as "most efficient" if the acceptance rate takes the value 0.234. Intuitively, it is a tradeoff between making to many small accepted steps and making to many large proposals that get rejected. Second, to keep tuning $\varepsilon$ according to earlier runs invalidates the Markov justification of MCMC algorithms unless the tuning is controlled, for instance under diminishing adaptation. Entries on X Validated with the keywords adaptive and metropolis provide some references on the topic.
