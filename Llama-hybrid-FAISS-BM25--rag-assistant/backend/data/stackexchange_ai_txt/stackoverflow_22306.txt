Where do I begin to learn about SQL Server alerts or notifications?

Just recently started having issues with an SQL Server Agent Job that contains an SSIS package to extract production data and summarize it into a separate reporting database. I think that some of the Alerts/Notifications settings I tried playing with caused the problem as the job had been running to completion unattended for the previous two weeks. So... Where's a good place to start reading up on SQL Agent Alerts and Notifications? I want to enable some sort of alert/notification so that I'm always informed: That the job completes successfully (as a check to ensure that it's always executed), or That the job ran into some sort of error, which should include enough info (such as error number) that I can diagnose the cause of the error As always, any help will be greatly appreciated!
