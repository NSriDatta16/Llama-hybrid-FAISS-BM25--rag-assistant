From reading the OpenID Authentication 2.0 Specification , I seem to have arrived at an answer: While nothing in the protocol requires JavaScript or modern browsers , the authentication scheme plays nicely with "AJAX"-style setups. This means an end user can prove their Identity to a Relying Party without having to leave their current Web page. OpenID Authentication uses only standard HTTP(S) requests and responses, so it does not require any special capabilities of the User-Agent or other client software . OpenID is not tied to the use of cookies or any other specific mechanism of Relying Party or OpenID Provider session management. Extensions to User-Agents can simplify the end user interaction, though are not required to utilize the protocol. Now I just need to figure out a clever way to get it to work with a WCF-based relying party...
