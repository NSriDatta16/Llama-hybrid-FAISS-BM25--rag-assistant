Image "frame/window" on iphone

I have numerous photos in portrait and landscape format. I want to be able to display a "crop" of the photo in a UIImageView on the iphone. If the picture is in landscape format I want it to resize to fit the frame, if it is in portrait format I need it to resize to fit the width, and then be cropped at the top and bottom. As if there is a "window" over the image - so it looks like a landscape picture. It would be even better if this could be a UIButton - although I am aware that I can use touchesBegan and such on images to make it behave like a button if needs be. Thanks for any help you can give me. Thanks Tom
