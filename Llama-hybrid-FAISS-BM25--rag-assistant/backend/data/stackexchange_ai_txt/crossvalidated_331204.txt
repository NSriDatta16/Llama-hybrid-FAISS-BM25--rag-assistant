Decision Trees Clasification Splitting Criteria in Algorithms, Metrics, and Category Types

I am trying to understand the decision tree. So I decided to construct a taxonomy to summarize it. So to start, there are univariate and multivariate splitting criteria. In this case, focusing on decision tree univariate classification splitting criteria. There is many, but I am not sure how to organize them in a hierarchal manner to see who descended from what. Any help is appreciated. A fundamental question to be asked Are all splitting criteria in the classification of decision tree impurity based ?
