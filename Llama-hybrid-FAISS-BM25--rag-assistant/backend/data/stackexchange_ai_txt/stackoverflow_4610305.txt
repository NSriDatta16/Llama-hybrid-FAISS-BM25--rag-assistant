Event RSVP payment supporting credit card refunds and pre-auths?

Our implementation language is PHP (using the CodeIgniter library). My requirements are this: Users need to be able to RSVP to events, at which point we put a pre-auth on their card. 24 hours before the event, we take the payment from their card. Up until 24 hours before the event's start time, the organiser can cancel it. In this case, the authorization on the card is released. Are there any SaaS services that can remove the hassle from all this logic for me? Even better - provide a secured, hosted form page on which the user can provide their CC details (removing the need for me to have anything to do with credit card info)? Competitive pricing model definitely a plus.
