Like others I'd firstly recommend JavaScript the good parts. Another option to consider is JavaScript the definitive guide by David Flanagan. This is also a good book that covers the language well- certainly enough depth for a programmer interested in particular features of javascript. The language part is seperate from the client side stuff- so you can just read the bits that interest you. Update- I've just checked the book on Amazon it has a whopping 286 customer reviews!
