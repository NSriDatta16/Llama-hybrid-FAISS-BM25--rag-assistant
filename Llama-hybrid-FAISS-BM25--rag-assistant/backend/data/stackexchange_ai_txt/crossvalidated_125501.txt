The skew normal distribution (SN) extends the normal distribution by allowing for non-zero skewness. Some familiar properties of the normal distribution are maintained: if $X$ is a multivariate skew normal variable then so is its image under linear transformation $AX$, and some quadratics forms have a $\chi^2$ distribution. Further generalisations include the skew-t and skew-Cauchy, which additionally allow for the heaviness of tails to be altered, as well as the log-skew-normal and log-skew-t. Definitions vary between authors. Software packages for dealing with the skew normal distribution include: fGarch for R, sn for R, Various packages for Python, VBA and Perl are available from the site of Adelchi Azzalini at the University of Padua, Stata .
