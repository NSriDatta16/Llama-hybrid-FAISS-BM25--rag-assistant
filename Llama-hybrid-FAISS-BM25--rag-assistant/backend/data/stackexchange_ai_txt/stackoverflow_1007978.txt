SNMP v1 - Agent IP

I'm sending SNMP traps using Net-SNMP utils (5.3). I'm setting the agent to a valid server IP but the NMS is receiving the trap as if it was a trap for the server generating it and not for the other server that I'm using in the agent field . I'm totally confused as to why this would be happening, other servers are using the same package and it works fine! Thanks, PJ
