The basic difference is this: if you insert a new row for each change, and e.g. "deactivate" the old row by setting a "ValidTo" date, then you have a history of what the changes where, over time - you're going into the area of a "temporal" database if you keep updating the same row over and over again, then you always have the current state - but not history. So I guess, this really is the big question: do you need temporal information, e.g. the ability to go "back in time" and now what the state of your data was three months ago?? If so, option 1 (including "soft deletes" - only mark rows as deleted, don't actually delete them) is your only option. The downside is increased complexity and more storage requirements, obviously.
