What is embedding? (in the context of dimensionality reduction)

In the context of dimensionality reduction one often uses word embedding , which seems to me a rather technical mathematical term , which rather stands out compared to the rest of the discussion, which in case of PCA, MDS and similar methods is just the basic linear algebra. Yet, I would rather avoid using/interpreting this term too loosely. So, what embedding really is: the low-dimensional subspace hidden within a bigger one? The projections of the data vectors onto this subspace? The projection operator mapping the higher-dimensional space onto the lower-dimensional one, as suggested here and here ? Something else? Thank you for clarifications and examples.
