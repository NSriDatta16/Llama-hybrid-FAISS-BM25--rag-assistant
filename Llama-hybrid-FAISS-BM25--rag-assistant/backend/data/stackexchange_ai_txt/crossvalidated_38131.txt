First, I think you need to have a clear definition of your dependent variable. How are you going to quantify the product mix? For example, if you only wanted to compare CDs and another product, your dependent variable could be defined as the ratio of one to the other. I don't see how you could discuss the mix of all of the products at once. Also, I think this is more of a time series problem, not a cross sectional logistic regression problem. You might want to look at vector autoregressive models (VAR) to model how the mix changes over time.
