Will the silhouette not approach 1 when increasing k to n?

My understanding of silhouette in the context of k-means clustering is that its equal to: $$\frac{\mbox{Av. distance to subjects in hearest neighboring cluster} - \mbox{Av. distance to subjects in my cluster}}{\mbox{max. of the two above}}$$ So, assume really good clustering, Av. distance to subjects in neighbouring cluster is really big and average distance to subjects in my cluster is really small (numerator becomes approx. the first term), divide by the max, so the silhouette becomes 1 --> Good clustering. But if I have as many clusters as I have items, then will not the average distance to subjects in neighbouring cluster always be greater than the distance to the current cluster (since the item is sitting on it)? Then I should always get silhouette = 1, no?
