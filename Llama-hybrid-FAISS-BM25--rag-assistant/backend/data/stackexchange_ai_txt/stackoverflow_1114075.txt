In your case don't use any of them. Either use a container and iterators or create a new data type (e.g. employee database) which offers iterator/range access. As for unsigned, Bjarne Stroustrup wrote in TCPL: The unsigned integer types are ideal for uses that treat storage as a bit array. Using an unsigned instead of an int to gain one more bit to represent positive integers is almost never a good idea. Attempts to ensure that some values are positive by declaring variables unsigned will typically be defeated by the implicit conversion rules.
