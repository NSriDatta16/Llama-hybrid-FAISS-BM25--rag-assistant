JPype compile problems

I'm having a right old nightmare with JPype. I have got my dev env on Windows and so tried installing it there with no luck. I then tried on Ubunto also with no luck. I'm getting a bit desperate now. I am using Mingw32 since I tried installing VS2008 but it told me I had to install XP SP2 but I am on Vista. I tried VS2010 but no luck, I got the 'error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat' error. Anyway, I am now on Mingw32 Ultimately I am trying to use Neo4j and Python hence my need to use JPype. I have found so many references to the problem on the net for MySQL etc but they don't help me with JPype. If I could fix unix or windows I could get going so help on either will be really appreciated. Here's the versions.. Windows: Vista 64 Python: 2.6 Compiler Mingw32: latest version Jpype: 0.5.4.1 Java info: java version "1.6.0_13" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_13-b03) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.3-b02, mixed mode) I run: python setup.py install --compiler=wingw32 and get the following output. Choosing the Windows profile running install running build running build_py running build_ext building '_jpype' extension C:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe -mno-cygwin -mdll -O -Wall -DWIN32=1 "-IC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_21/include" "-IC:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_21/include/win32" -Isrc/native/common/include -Isrc/native/python/include -Ic:\Python26\include -Ic:\Python26\PC -c src/native/common/jp_array.cpp -o build\temp.win32-2.6\Release\src\native\common\jp_array.o /EHsc src/native/common/jp_array.cpp: In member function 'void JPArray::setRange(int, int, std::vector&)': src/native/common/jp_array.cpp:56:13: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions src/native/common/jp_array.cpp:68:4: warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*' src/native/common/jp_array.cpp: In member function 'void JPArray::setItem(int, HostRef*)': src/native/common/jp_array.cpp:80:3: warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to 'char*' gcc: /EHsc: No such file or directory error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1 So on unix Ubunto the problem is as follows: Java version: 1.6.0_18 JPype: 0.5.4.1 Python: 2.6 Java is in the path and I did apt-get install build-essentials just now so have latest GCC etc. I won't paste all the output as it's massive. So many errors it's like I have missed the install of Java or similar but I haven't. typing java takes me into version above.
