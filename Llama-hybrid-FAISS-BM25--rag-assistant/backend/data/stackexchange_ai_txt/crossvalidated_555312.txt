Financial returns are usually approximately stationary, or at least they do not have unit roots. However, cointegration is only possible among nonstationary time series, specifically ones that have unit roots. Per definition, it cannot occur between a bunch of stationary time series. Therefore, you would normally do the cointegration analysis on prices (or log-prices), not returns (or log-returns).
