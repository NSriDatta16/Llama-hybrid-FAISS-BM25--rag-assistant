You could manually trace the centerline or the walls of the blood vessels (or use machine learning to fill those areas. Then you could build a buffer fence around that area. As a second step, you could identify the particles on the image (either manually or by machine learning). Then you could calculate the statistics related to then number of nanoparticles inside the filled area of the buffer fence vs outside of it. With fifty pairs of images, it might be faster and more accurate to draw the buffer fences and measure the number of particles in and out, manually.
