Deploying an SWT application on Java Webstart

Is it possible to deploy SWT applications using JNLP. Especially loading the swt native library (dll in Windows, so in Linux)? Any links? I found one at IBM Developer Works , however it just describes using swt.jar. In addition to that, is it possible to load the native dll files over JNLP?
