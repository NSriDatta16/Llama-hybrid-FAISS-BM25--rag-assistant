Pragmatic way of handling mouse in Core Animation layers

I'm starting working with Core Animation and I started wondering how to handle various kinds of mouse events like mouse entered a CALayer mouse exited a CALayer mouse click on a CALayer For now I'm concentrating just on mouseDown message sent to my custom view. According to the documentation I should use -hitTest:(CGPoint)point calling on my root layer (the one set with [customView setLayer:rootLayer] ). It should return the farthest layer in the tree that is in position specified by point. So I did: [rootLayer hitTest:[event locationInWindow]] but it doens't work. It seems to work if I just click on rootLayer , otherwise it returns just null . Of course sublayers are added to rootLayer (infact they are drawn) Am I missing some kind of coordinate conversion? Apart from that, is it the way to handle mouse clicks? To find whenever mouse enters a CALayer do I have to keep hit testing for every movement update of the mouse? Thanks in advance
