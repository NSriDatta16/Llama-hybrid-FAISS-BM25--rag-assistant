When would you use PCA rather than LDA in classification?

I'm reading this article on the difference between Principle Component Analysis and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (Linear Discriminant Analysis), and I'm trying to understand why you would ever use PCA rather than MDA/LDA. The explanation is summarized as follows: roughly speaking in PCA we are trying to find the axes with maximum variances where the data is most spread (within a class, since PCA treats the whole data set as one class), and in MDA we are additionally maximizing the spread between classes. Wouldn't you always want to both maximize the variance and maximize the spread between classes?
