The Java equivalent of PHP is JSP - engines like Tomcat, Jetty, and Resin can interpret Java web applications (which can contain JSP pages), and JSPs send dynamic content to a web client the same way a PHP engine does. But a JSP just compiles to a Java Servlet, which is a type of object that lets you directly manipulate the Request and Response objects constructed from the app container (Tomcat, Jetty, Resin). If you put HTML directly into a JSP, equivalent Java code is generated that sends the HTML to the Response. I think you should start by learning about Servlets and webapps - in particular, learn how a web application is organized and how it can be deployed into Tomcat. All of this info can be found in the Tomcat manual: here's a link to the documentation for version 5.5, I think they are up to 6 now but this is the first one google gave me and it's fine for learning on. http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/index.html Read the first four sections, as well as the sections on Servlets and JSPs. Also, here is a pretty good Servlets tutorial: http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/java/Servlet-Tutorial/
