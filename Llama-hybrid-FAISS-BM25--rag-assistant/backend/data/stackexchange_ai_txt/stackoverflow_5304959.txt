How do you use ActiveRecord3's associations feature outside of Rails?

I am working on a script to translate an old Rails 2 application database into a new Rails 3 application. The new application is a rewrite and simplification of the database schema. I have created a stand-alone ruby program independent of Rails to do the heavy lifting and am leveraging the adapter pattern with Ruby modules to manipulate two database connections and move the data from one system to the other. I have successfully implemented ActiveRecord (using include "active_record") in my translator models and all my find and validations are working as expected. However, the associations are resulting in method_missing calls. Do I need to do something special to allow the associations to work outside of the Rails environment? I'm hoping for a simple answer like "you forgot to require this key file".
