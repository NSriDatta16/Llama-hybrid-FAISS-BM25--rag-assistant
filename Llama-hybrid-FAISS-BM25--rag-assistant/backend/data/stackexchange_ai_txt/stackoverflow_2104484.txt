One of the primary functions of a database is to be able to perform operations on huge amounts of data efficiently. Being very specific about data types increases the number of things that the database engine can assume about the data it's storing. Therefore, it has to perform fewer calculations and runs faster, and it can avoid allocating storage that it won't need which makes the database smaller and therefore faster still. One of the other primary functions of a database is to ensure data integrity. The more exactly you specify what sort of data should be stored in a field, the less likely you are to accidentally store the wrong data there. It's analogous to why your C compiler is so picky about the code you write: you should much prefer to deal with compile-time errors than run-time errors.
