The ProtocolBinding attribute on AuthnRequest is used to specify the expected binding to be used by the IdP when sending their SAML Response XML. HTTP-Redirect isn't a valid option to use here, because of the possible length restriction on the URL querystring; a SAML Response, especially if it's signed, can be pretty lengthy. I'll quote from the SAML spec [SAMLProf]: ...the identity provider issues a message to be delivered by the user agent to the service provider. Either the HTTP POST or HTTP Artifact binding can be used to transfer the message to the service provider through the user agent. The message may indicate an error or will include (at least) an authentication assertion. The HTTP Redirect binding MUST NOT be used, as the response will typically exceed the URL length permitted by most user agents.
