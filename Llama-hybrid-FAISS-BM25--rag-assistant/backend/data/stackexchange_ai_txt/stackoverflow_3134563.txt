The problem is this option when declaring #aktiv as sortable items: 'div.block' With this you are saying that only divs with class block should be concidered sortable inside #aktiv, so when you do $("#aktiv").sortable("serialize") , jQuery doesn't evaluate the item you dropped into it, since it is a p element. If this is the case, then your newly dropped items will also not be sortable with the other elements (the div.block s), so you are fixing several problems) Possible solutions: Make #aktiv consider the p element a sortable ( items: 'div.block, p.doc_inhalt_popup ) Make the p elements you drag into divs with class block (You can skip giving the draggable class block in your HTML and instead add it with jQuery when you receive the item)
