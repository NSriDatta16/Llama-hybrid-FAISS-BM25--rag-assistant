What do some of the fields returned from ActiveMQ.Agent query mean?

I'm trying to do some kind of administration on our activemq process, and I'd like to know what some of the fields mean that I get back. Specifically, What is InFlightCount? Is that the number of messages that the producer has sent but not What is AverageEnqueueTime measured in? Seconds? What are EnqueueCount and DequeueCount? What is DispatchCount?
