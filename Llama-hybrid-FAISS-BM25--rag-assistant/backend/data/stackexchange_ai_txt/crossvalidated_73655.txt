I think you're confusing things with a manufactured example. Yes, you could have a specific case where the two CI's matched and you could have ones where the Dataset 1 CI was lower but on average the Dataset 1 CI will be higher. Furthermore, if these really are supposed to be multiple experiments tackling the same problem (within each Dataset) then there's something seriously wrong with Dataset 2. Lower within experiment variability should be leading to lower between experiment variability.
