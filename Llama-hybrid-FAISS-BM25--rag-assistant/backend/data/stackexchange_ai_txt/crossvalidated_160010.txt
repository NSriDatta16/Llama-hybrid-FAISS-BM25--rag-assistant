Proportion classified correctly is not only an improper scoring rule (one that is optimized by choosing the wrong features and giving them the wrong weights) but it is extremely information-losing and has high variance. Make sure you can get probabilities out of the random forest, and consider using the Brier score or other proper scoring rules in judging predictions. For more information see Section 17.4 and Chapter 18 of Biostatistics for Biomedical Research from http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/ClinStat as well as http://www.citeulike.org/user/harrelfe/tag/proper-scoring-rule .
