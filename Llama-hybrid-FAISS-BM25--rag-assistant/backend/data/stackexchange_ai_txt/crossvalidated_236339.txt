How to perform analysis of non-stationary and unevenly spaced time series?

It is very easy to apply ACF (autocorrelation function) to time series in order to investigate the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. However, ACF only works with stationary and evenly spaced time series. In my case, I need to analyze time series which lacks both these two properties. Even going to the frequency domain is not enough. The Lombâ€“Scargle Fourier transform is a partial solution: it does not require equale samples in the signal, but it does require stationarity. Do you know any approaches that could help?
