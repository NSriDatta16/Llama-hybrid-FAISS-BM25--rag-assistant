This happens because you use a relative path to load the file : ..\sounds\voice.wav . When you do this, your app is very fragile, because it must be launched from a specific directory to work correctly. I suspect that NetBeans launches your app from the root folder instead of launching it from the src or build folder. I would recommend to put the voice.wav in your sources, so that it's copied into the build directory, along with your class files. Then you may load the file using the classloader, thanks to a call to Class.getResourceAsStream() .
