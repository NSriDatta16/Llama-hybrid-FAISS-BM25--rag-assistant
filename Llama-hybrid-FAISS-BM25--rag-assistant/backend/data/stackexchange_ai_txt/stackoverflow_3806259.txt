You can use a combination of jQuery and jQueryUI . Let's say for example you have a paragraph like this: This is something to highlight So basically you want to animate the replace of class1 with class2. Since CSS allows you to override styles, you can simply add a new class and it will override the initial effect. $("#notice").addClass("class2", 50); Where 50 is obviously how long the animation takes. For this to work you need to reference both the jQuery and jQueryUI libraries. The alternative is to use the jQuery animate method. Basically you specify the css that drives the animation, the duration, and a callback. $('#clickme').click(function() { $('#notice').animate( {background-color: yellow}, 5000, function() { $("#notice").removeClass("class1"); }); });
