best way to secure a streaming flv being output to a player in php?

looking at embedding a flv player into a page but wish to read the flv file from a non www accessible location. I tried to write a controller action which takes a encrypted querystring, decrypt it, then output the contents to the page using readfile() but nothing seems to happen. I'm not sure if its becuase i'm sending the wrong content-type or that the readfile function is choking on the flv file sizes (40 MB+). I'm using something like the following Goint to the above page lets me download the flv fine, just not stream it from the player. thanks in advance!
