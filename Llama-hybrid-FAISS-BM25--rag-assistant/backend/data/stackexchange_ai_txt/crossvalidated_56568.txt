Can I use xreg with stl decomposition to handle moving holiday?

I am trying to decompose and forecast a weekly time series which is believed to be affected by moving holidays (e.g. Chinese New Year, which happens in different weeks of a year). I would like create a regressor variable to reflect the holiday effect on the series. Is it correct to use the regressor variable as xreg in forecasting stl object / stlf? Also, I would like to know the difference between the following methods, and whether they are doing the job I wanted. 1) decompose using stl, then forecast the decomposed object, i.e. model 2) use stlf directly, i.e. forecast Thanks in advance
