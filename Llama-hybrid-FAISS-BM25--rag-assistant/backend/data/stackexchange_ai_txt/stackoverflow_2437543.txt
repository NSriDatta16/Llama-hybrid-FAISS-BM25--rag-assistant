I agree about your "misunderstand" in the title; I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of isolated storage. As I understand it the "isolated" does not mean "private storage that other programs can't access". It means a "sandbox" to give your low-trust program a place where it can save data when it might not have permission to write to somewhere else.
