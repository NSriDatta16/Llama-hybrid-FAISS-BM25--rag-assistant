When you are assigning a path as source Flash Player is trying to load the images via HTTP requests. Therefore, embedding your images in the SWF has no effect. There are two possible solutions. Either deploy the folder containing your images to the server and use the corresponding path as your source or embed all your images into the SWF. A simple example for the second solution. The code assumes that value[dglistData.dataField] corresponds to one of the variables with the [Embed] metadata. [Embed(source='assets/images/flags/Image1.png')] private var image1:Class; [Embed(source='assets/images/flags/Image2.png')] private var image2:Class; [Embed(source='assets/images/flags/Image3.png')] private var image3:Class; // access the image like this... _img.source = this[value[dglistData.dataField]];
