As already discussed in the comments - this would be a nightmare for compiler writers and for the authors of the specification as well :-). (overload resolution in C# is already complicated enough) One possible solution when you need something like this in practice is to just give up and use a single params parameter of type object[] . This may not be very elegant, but it allows you to do what you need. The compiler will not check whether all uses are correct, but it may still be reasonable... For example, constructors of LINQ to XML types (e.g. XElement ) usually do this, so that you can create XElement containin other elements, attribtues, collections of elements, etc.. new XElement( new XElement("elem"), new XAttribute("attr", "value"), GetListOfElements() );
