When the user presses the Back button on his browser there's no request being performed to the web server but the page is served from the browser cache. This means that the only way to prevent this is to have all your authenticated pages set a no cache header so that the HTML is not stored in the browser cache: Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-1)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore();
