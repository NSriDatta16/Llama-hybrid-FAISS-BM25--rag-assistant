It's difficult to give figures for what companies use internally. There do exist figures for browser plugin installation, but Sun's figures are confidential. 1.3 support stopped some time ago (Solaris 8 vintage support dragged on for a bit). 1.4 has completed its End of Service Life, but is likely to be supported under Java for Business for yonks. IIRC, if you try to download 1.4 from the archives at sun.com then you are asked for some information such as an e-mail address. 1.5 is more than half way through its service life (but its still quite common on Macs). It's not that difficult to use 1.4 features optionally. You just need to load one class via reflection (or just package it differently) and then have a 1.4 and 1.3 implementation of a light abstraction over the new features.
