NSColorWell doesn't open when bound with ValueTransformer

I have an NSColorWell , which is bound to a property that contains an NSString instance, which get's transformed into an NSColor through my ColorTransformer ( NSValueTransformer ). It essentially transforms something like #FF0000 into an NSColor . This works as expected, but the ColorWell no longer opens it's Pane when clicked. When I disable the binding, it works again. Any clues to what I'm doing wrong here?
