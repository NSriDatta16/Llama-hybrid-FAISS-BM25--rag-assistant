Time series modelling

Here is my problem: I basically have 20 or so variables (I have 1000 of these values over an increasing time axis). I want to calculate the weights of these input variables. I am going to try Linear regression to estimate the weights. Is this the correct way to start thinking about it? If I have an output variable which depends on these input variables, I could run a linear regression. But I just have 20 variables with different values at different points in time, and I want to estimate weights to estimate what value a variable will have at a later date (no output variable) Any help will be appreciated. Note: My dataset is a 1000*20 set
