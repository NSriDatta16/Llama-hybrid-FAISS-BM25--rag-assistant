Cobertura doesn't currently provide such a feature, and neither does Emma (which we use) although it is listed as a forthcoming enhancement - although in the form of an extension to the exclusion rules I believe rather than as an annotation. Would be handy to cover off those few inaccessible corners cleanly so that you can strive for 100% without being ridiculous. I think annotations would probably be a friendlier way to do it, but they ought to be fairly explicitly named and based on a list of acceptable scenarios as I fear otherwise something like '@ExcludeFromCoverage' would get added over generously.
