All others have good answers, but I'll add this: Strongly encourage the use of IDs in selectors. ID-ing important elements generally pays off in the long run because it allows for better testability and less conflicts. CSS Example: #myid selector { ... } #myotherid selector { ... } General styles really should go in a top-level or general stylesheet that everyone manages, if possible.
