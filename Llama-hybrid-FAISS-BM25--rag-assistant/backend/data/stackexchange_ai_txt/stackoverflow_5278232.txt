Saving bytecode of a Class (to SharedObject or database)

NOTE: I want to save the actual bytecode for the AS3 class, NOT an instance of it! A class is being loaded in externally and extracted via a URLLoader and then Loader.loadBytes . A single Class is then extracted out of that Application Domain and used in the project. Now, rather than saving the entire Loader (either via SharedObject or other means of storage) is it possible to "extract out" the bytecode of the needed class and all dependencies, which can then be "injected" back into an empty shell or something to be reused when needed?
