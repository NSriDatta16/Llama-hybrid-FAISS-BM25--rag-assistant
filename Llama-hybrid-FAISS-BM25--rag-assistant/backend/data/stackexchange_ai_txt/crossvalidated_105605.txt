Forecasting a time series with weights

I'd like to forecast (or predict) a time series with weights. The following works using the regular l inear m odelling techniques of lm by applying a (sigmoidal) weight distribution to the input data, essentially weighing the latter data points more heavily than the former: library("stats") lm.weight.function Now I wish to do the same using the forecast package. However, I'm having difficulty specifying the weights : library("forecast") ts.weight.function The above prints an error: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : ..1 used in an incorrect context, no ... to look in How can I use tslm to forecast a time series with weights?
