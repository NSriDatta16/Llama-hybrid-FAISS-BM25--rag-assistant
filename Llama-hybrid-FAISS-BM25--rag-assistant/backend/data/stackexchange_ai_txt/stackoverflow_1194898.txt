How can I programmatically detect side effects (compile time or run time)?

I've got an idea for caching that I'm beginning to implement: Memoizing function s and storing the return along with a hash of the function signature in Velocity . Using PostSharp , I want to check the cache and return a rehydrated representation of the return value instead of calling the function again. I want to use attributes to control this behavior. Unfortunately, this could prove dangerous to other developers in my organization, if they fall in love with the performance gain and start decorating every method in sight with caching attributes, including some with side effects . I'd like to kick out a compiler warning when the memoization library suspects that a function may cause side effects. How can I tell that code may cause side effects using CodeDom or Reflection?
