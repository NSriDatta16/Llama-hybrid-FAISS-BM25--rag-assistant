About dimensional analysis : a fun calculus trick once given by one of my physics professors: given that it takes one hour to perfectly cook a one pound turkey in a given oven, how long would it take to cook a 2 pound turkey is the same oven ? Well, dimensional analysis shows (1) that the total amount of heat energy needed in order to cook the turkey is proportional to the mass of the turkey, which itself is proportional to its volume, which itself is proportional to the cube of it average "radius" i.e Cooking heat energy needed = k1 * (turkeyRadius" ^3) ==> unit : m^3 * k (where k1 unit is J / m^3) (2) That the total amount of heat energy provided by the oven is proportional to the surface of the turkey multiplied by the amount of time you cook it, i.e Heat provided by the oven = k2 * time * (turkeyRadius ^ 2) (where k2 unit is J / s / m^2 ) Then by using (1) = (2) , you obtain time = k1 / k2 * turkeyRadius ^ (3/2) i.e - the cooking time is proportionnal to the radius ^ 3/2 - given that turkeyRadius is proportionnal to the cubic root of the mass, we obtain cooking time = k3 * sqrt(mass) So, it will take sqrt(2) times longer to cook our 2 pounds turkey, and the result is obtained with no calculation at all - only dimensional analysis.
