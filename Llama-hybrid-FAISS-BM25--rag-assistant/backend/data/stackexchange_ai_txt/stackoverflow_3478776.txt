This is less a solution and more of a workaround but, for a linear list (rather than the tree Bill Karwin mentioned), it might be more efficient to use a sort column on your list. For example: TABLE `schema`.`my_table` ( `id` INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, `order` INT, data .., INDEX `ix_order` (`sort_order` ASC) ); Then: SELECT * FROM `schema`.`my_table` ORDER BY `order`; This has the disadvantage of slower inserts (you have to reposition all sorted elements past the insertion point) but should be fast for retrieval because the order column is indexed.
