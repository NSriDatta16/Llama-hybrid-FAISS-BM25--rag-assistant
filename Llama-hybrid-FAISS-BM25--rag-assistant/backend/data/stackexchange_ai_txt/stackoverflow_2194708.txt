Unmanaged Exports / Robert Giesecke

In the following answer Robert Giesecke describes a way to export managed code to native applications without the need of COM registration: Answer on stackoverflow from Robert Giesecke I downloaded the UnmanagedExportLibrary.zip from and built the samples using Visual C# 2008 Express Edition for the .net part and delphi 2010 for the win32 part as described on his page. When i start the delphi application which calls the dll, i get an exception "unable to start application...". Is someone able to post two working projects (.net / win32) using the "RGiesecke.DllExport.dll" to communicate with each other? Thanks in advance, Michael
