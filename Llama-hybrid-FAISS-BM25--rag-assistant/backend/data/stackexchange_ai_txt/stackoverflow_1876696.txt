When is the MVC Pattern appropriate?

Note: I'm not referring to any particular framework's interpretation of MVC If I'm designing a rich client Silverlight application for instance, that involves a relatively complex UI behavior such as dragging and dropping rows between two GridViews populated by a dynamic user-defined query, would this be an appropriate pattern to use? Certain UI behaviors (such as dropping a row on another valid row) would also lead to business rules being applied and the model being updated accordingly. If MVC isn't a good fit for this type of application; what would be a good way to structure this? EDIT: Re-reading my original question, it seems a bit general; i'll break it down into a more directed question: Is there an upper-limit on granularity of user interaction where the MVC pattern is not appropriate? ie. A UI that would involve a controller action having to handle something on mouse_move, mouse_button_up, etc...
