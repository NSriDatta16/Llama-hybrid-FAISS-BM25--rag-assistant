Although it's large (2000loc) I made a reflexive class system within c++ that is compiler independant and includes object marshalling and metadata but has no storage overhead or access time penalties. It's hardcore metaprogramming, and being used in a very big online game for mapping game objects for network transmission and database-mapping (ORM). Anyways it takes a while to compile, about 5 minutes, but has the benefit of being as fast as hand tuned code for each object. So it saves lots of money by reducing significant CPU time on our servers (CPU usage is 5% of what it used to be).
