Jquery-UI tabs : Double loading of the default tab

I use jqueryui-tabs to display a tabbed UI. here is how my markup looks in a MasterPage : If the content is loaded via ajax, I return a partial view with the content of the tab. If the content is loaded directly, I load a page that include the content in the ContentPlaceHolder. somewhat like this : //same goes for the other tabs. With this in place, if I access the url "/Forums" It loads the forum content in the Blog tab first, trigger the ajax load of the Blog tab and replace the content with the blog content. I tried putting a different placeholder for each tab , but that didn't fix everything either, since when loading "/Forums" it will sure load the forum tab, but the Blog tab will show up first. Furthermore, when using separate placeholders, If I load the "/Blogs" url, It will first load the content statically in the Blog contentplaceholder and then trigger an ajax call to load it a second time and replace it. If I just link the tab to the hashtag, then when loading the forum tabs, I won't get the blog content... How would you achieve the expected behaviour? I feel like I might have a deeper probelm in the organization of my views. Is putting the tabs in the masterpage the way to go? Maybe I should just hijax the links manually and not rely on jquery-ui tabs to do the work for me. I cannot load all tabs by default and display them using the hash tags, I need an ajax loading because it is a search process that can be long. So to sum up : /Forum should load the forum tab, and let the other tabs be loaded with an ajax call when clicking on it. /Twitter should load the twitter tab and let the other tabs.... the same goes for /Blogs and any tabs I would add later. Any idea to have this working properly?
