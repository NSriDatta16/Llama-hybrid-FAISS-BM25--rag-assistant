Specifically regarding the database corruption, I believe there are (at least) two fundamental problems with having the database on network-shared storage: (1) when Derby is attempting to allocate space by growing a file, the filesystem may report the allocation as successful even though in fact the disk is full; (2) when Derby is attempting to ensure that a disk write is in fact fully written to disk, the filesystem may report the data as being written to disk even though in fact it is still only written to memory. Either of the above problems, if they occur at just the right time, can cause a database corruption.
