Use both historical prices and fundamentals data for predicting portfolio profit?

Get highly accurate probability distribution for the future price of portfolio using all the data available. Each stock has two historical data - daily prices (scalar time series updated daily) and fundamentals (vector time series, updated quarterly). It's possible to predict probability distribution for future price for individual stock, using both stock price and fundamental data. The problem is we can't get portfolio distribution this way . As a sum (convolution) of individual stock distributions - because they are not independent (see last section about joint distributions). It's also possible to predict portfolio distribution directly from past portfolio prices. We can synthesise past prices for any portfolio, as a sum of past prices of individual stocks in portfolio. And use past portfolio prices to predict the future portfolio price distribution. The problem - we can't use fundamentals data this way . As you can't just sum up fundamentals of individual stock same as prices. So, we are stuck . We either can use both historical prices and fundamentals but can't have portfolio distribution. Or we can have portfolio distribution but can't utilise the fundamentals data. So, how can we utilise all the data and get the portfolio distribution? Or, if it's not possible to get the probability distributions, what kind of other estimates we can get? Why I need it. There are lots of references to different kinds of portfolios, like "Aggressive Portfolio", "Defensive Portfolio", "Asymmetric Risk Payoff", "Statistical vs Mechanical Hedging" etc. I want to model and see all those different distributions. Or maybe I'm chasing the wrong thing and there are other ways to see it without having the distribution? P.S. About joint probabilities . Summing up non-independent variables requires to know joint probabilities. I want to avoid dealing with joint probabilities or correlation explicitly by calculating joint probabilities , it's hard to calculate and estimate the errors, and it changes with time (in normal times correlation could be ~0, in crisis suddenly correlation could jump to ~1 as all stocks go down).
