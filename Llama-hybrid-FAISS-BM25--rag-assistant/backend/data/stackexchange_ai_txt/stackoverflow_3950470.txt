When divs don't resize with content?

I'm working on some complex design and have a silly question once again :) Well, let's say I have a div and some content inside, like: Blablabla :) Div's width is fixed, but I don't tell the browser what's the height (so there's no height property of div in css file). And then, when I add more and more text the first paragraph or bigger image, the text-child of first div is in the second div. How to prevent this from happening? Or what did I to make it happen? Thanks!
