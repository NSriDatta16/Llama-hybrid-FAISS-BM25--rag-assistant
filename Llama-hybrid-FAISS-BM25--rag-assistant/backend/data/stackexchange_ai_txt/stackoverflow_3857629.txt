All the "name mangling" answer address how the debugger finds the storage for each symbol and how the linker knows the difference, but the compiler knows because these entities occupy different entries in the symbol table . That's it. The executable doesn't need to know anything about names at all{*}. Just locations. The compiler knows about names, and that knowledge is coded in the symbol table (however it may be implemented). {*} Well, in the absence of RTTI, anyway.
