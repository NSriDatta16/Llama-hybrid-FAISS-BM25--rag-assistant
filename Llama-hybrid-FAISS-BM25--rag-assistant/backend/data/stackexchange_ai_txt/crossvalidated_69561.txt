Case-control study and Logistic regression

Suppose we have case-control data, where cases have some disease ($Y$) and controls don't and we are interested in the association of some other variable(s) ($X$). I know that in this scenario we cannot use the disease as the response variable because of the experimental design (the marginal distribution of disease is fixed by sampling). I also know that the odds ratio however can be calculated in such designs because it takes the same value when using the conditional distribution of $X|Y$ or $Y|X$. My question is: is it appropriate to use logistic regression in this case to model the odds of disease? i.e. $\text{logit}\left\{\dfrac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}\right\} = \mathbf{\beta} X $ context: GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) are typically case-control studies, where one wants to assess the association between disease and number of minor alleles of a particular SNP. $P$-values are typically obtained from a chi-squared test of independence. However, this doesn't allow you to add in other covariates. A lot of the packages that offer GWAS analysis also allow you to do logistic regression. I just wanted to verify that it was valid to do such an analysis.
