I had the exact same problem and I think that it is a much better idea to solve this problem using a JQuery addin method: //Add draggable feature: //Define a setup method for the draggable config so we can reuse it for dynamic elements $(function() { jQuery.fn.draggableSetup = function draggableSetup() { this.draggable( { // enter your custom draggable code here... }); return this; } }); //Apply the draggable config your dynamic elements after adding them $("#dynamic_element_id").draggableSetup(); Thanks to this post for the answer. This gives you a reusable solution and you don't have to repeat your implementation for each ajax method.
