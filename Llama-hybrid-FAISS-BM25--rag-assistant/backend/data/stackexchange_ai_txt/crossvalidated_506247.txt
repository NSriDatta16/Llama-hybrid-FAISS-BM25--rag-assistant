The phrase "survival analysis" is usually taken to involve time-to-event data, not just event outcomes at a certain time. Otherwise, you're just throwing away potentially important time-to-event data. Also, survival analysis is well equipped to handle censored event times, for example individuals who still haven't experienced the event by the end of data collection. Depending on the study design, that might not be handled well by logistic regression. If you have time-to-event data, use proper survival analysis. The CRAN survival task view points out some implementations of random-forest survival analysis.
