php array stack ordering

I am trying to sort this array in php: Array ( [Levi Self] => Array ( [0] => Portraits [1] => Abstract ) [Portraits] => Array ( [0] => Megan ) [Abstract] => Array ( [0] => Locks ) ) To look like this: Array ( [Levi Self] => Array ( [Portraits] => Array ( [0] => Megan ) [Abstract] => Array ( [0] => Locks ) ) ) Which, basically, removes the duplicate items "Portraits" and "Abstract", as they are already the keys for the array to begin with, along with being items under the first key, "Levi Self". Is there any way to do this? Thanks, Levi Self
