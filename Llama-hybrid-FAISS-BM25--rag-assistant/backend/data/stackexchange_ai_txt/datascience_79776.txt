Predicting products to be sold in a store - problem formulation

I have a data from a store for the products that sold since more than 5 years. Each sell process has a customer id, date, and the quantity of the product. I want to build a machine learning model to predict the products that will be sold in the next day/s for each of the customers, giving that I have N products (~2k) and M customers (~50). I am not able to formulate this problem. It's a regression task (probably), but I don't know how can I formulate it to predict the products that a given customer will buy. Since we have N products, this doesn't mean that a customer will buy all of them; x customer might buy only 5 products in the next day.
