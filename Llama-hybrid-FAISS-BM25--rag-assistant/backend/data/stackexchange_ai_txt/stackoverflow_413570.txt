Have you thought about looking at an existing shopping cart platform that allows you to purchase the source code? I've used www.aspdotnetstorefront.com They have lots of examples of major e-commerce stores running on this platform. I built www.ElegantAppliance.com on this platform. Several thousand products, over 100 categories/sub-categories.
