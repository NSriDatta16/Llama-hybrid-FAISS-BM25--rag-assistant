Echoing @JEquihua, Random Forest prediction accuracy won't improve. Also note, if you keep both the original predictor and the transformed predictor (as is often done in linear regression), you may cause problems. That's because RF randomly chooses a subset of the variables to grow each tree, and you've essentially put the transformed variable in twice. If it's a strong predictor, it will get used, and your random forests won't be as uncorrelated as they might have been, leading to higher variance.
