EDIT : I think the main problem is that you're putting the clone in front of the original. Why not try putting the clone behind and moving the original instead, since that is what the mousedown event first fires on? Since my other answer wasn't cross browser compatible, I thought I'd have another go. Instead of calling Draggable.start in the image onmousedown, use the document instead to capture an onmousedown that bubbles up from the image, checking the srcElement property of the event object to ensure the image was clicked. The following is an example of how it might work, setting a draggable image's class attribute to contain the word "Draggable": document.onmousedown = function () { if (/Draggable/.test(event.srcElement.className)) { Draggable.obj = event.srcElement; Draggable.start; } } Just make sure the event bubbling doesn't get cancelled by anything on its way up the document.
