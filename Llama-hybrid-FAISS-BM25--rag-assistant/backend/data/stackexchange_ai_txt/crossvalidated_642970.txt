Bayesian Analysis: Number of Samples Produced from the Posterior

I am learning about Bayesian analysis from some slides that were handed down to me (as opposed to a proper textbook on the subject). My knowledge on the subject is thus limited, but I was hoping to get some help in understanding what the following means. The slides have the following paragraph: Note that the original analysis produced 4,000 samples from the posterior distribution. For a given sample (which is a list of possible parameter values), a predicted value is simulated for each of the 3,000 policies and then they are summed. I don't understand where the $4000$ is coming from here. The quote above is referring to a dataset of $6000$ data points, which was divided into 2 training and testing datasets, each containing $3000$ data points. How did we end up with a $1000$ extra "samples from the posterior distribution"?
