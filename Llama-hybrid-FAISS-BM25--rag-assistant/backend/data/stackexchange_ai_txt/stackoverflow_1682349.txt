I myself have used active_scaffold quite a bit and like it for certain tasks but I believe its niche is for power users not for mortals per se. Streamlined was an interesting option but is officially unmaintained now which sucks. It really was a beautiful product but it never really seemed to get a lot of attention from the community so maybe they gave up on maintaining it publicly. I've also not used Typus and admin_data but I ran into some references to Typus last night so clearly some very smart people are looking at it very hard. On a last note, I think this blog post really summarizes an opinion I've come to recently after working with a Drupal firm for a bit. I believe that the reason admin interfaces haven't received the same amount of love is that Rails is built primarily for applications rather than content, which means that the people looking at backends are typically not mortals or can stand to look at an ugly backend.
