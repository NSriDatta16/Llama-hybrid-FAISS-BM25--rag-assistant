CMS page URLs in Magento

I am trying to figure out Magento's routing because I need it for mod_rewrite. I have made several CMS pages in Magento itself; now I am wondering how to pass on $_GET variables. For example: http://www.magento.nl/catpage?catid=3 How should this URL look the Magento way? I tried: http://www.magento.nl/cms/catpage/index/index/catid/3 Unfortunately this isn't working. Could someone help me out here, it's the missing link I am looking for. :-) Thanks in advance.
