PCA is not always unique. Implementations may be stable though in returning the same result. Consider a data set that is perfectly i.i.d. - this will yield a covariance matrix that is a multiple of the identity matrix. Any vector of unit length is an eigenvector there - thus, not unique. The orthogonal space of a vector is easy to describe. In 2d it is also easy to explain as line. I do not think it makes sense to reduce 2d to 1d for HAC.
