Significant p-value but odds ratio confidence interval crosses 1 in logistic regression using restricted cubic splines

I have previously posted about the data I am using in this logistic regression here - Skewed Distributions for Logistic Regression I have built a logistic regression model and tested using the rms package. The regression model included the following variables: Yeardecimal - Date of procedure (expressed as decimal of year) = 1994-2013 inctoCran - Time from head injury to craniotomy in minutes = 0-2880 (After 2880 minutes is defined as a separate diagnosis) Age - Age of patient = 16.0-101.5 rcteyemi - Pupil reactivity = NA / Both unreactive = O, 1 reactive = 1, both reactive = 2 GCS - Glasgow Coma Scale = 3-15 ISS - Injury Severity Score = 16-75 Other - dummy for presence (1) or absence (0) of other trauma SDH Severity - Score for severity of subdural haematoma (4 or 5) Mechanism - Mechanism of injury = Fall 2m, Shooting/stabbing, RTC (Road Traffic Collision), Other neuroFirst2 - Location of first admission (Neurosurgical Unit) = NSU vs. Non-NSU Sex - Gender of patient = Male or Female Weekday - Day of the week of injury Multiple imputation was performed due to missingness in the data ( GCS 14% missing, rcteyemi 46% missing). The results of the final model are as follows: fit.mult.impute(formula = Survive ~ rcs(Yeardecimal, 4) + rcs(inctoCran) + rcs(Age) + rcteyemi + rcs(GCS, 4) + rcs(ISS, 3) + Other + SDH.Severity * Other + rcs(ISS, 3) * SDH.Severity + Mechanism + neuroFirst2 + Sex + Weekday, fitter = lrm, xtrans = a, data = ASDH_Paper1.1) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

Yeardecimal - p-value = 0.0009, OR = 1.30 (95% CI 0.93-1.83) 2. ISS - p-value I understand that the OR is calculated for continuous variables by comparing the 75th to the 25th percentile. Non-linear restricted cubic spline modelling of Year and ISS may explain the discordance between OR and p-value but what about the binary variable Other ? How could I explain this when writing up the results? Many thanks for any help you could give with this. Update Below is a trajectory using plot(Predict(rcs.ASDH,Yeardecimal)) in rms : In preparing the manuscript for publication, I have converted the log odds to survival, and used ggplot(Predict(...)) to produce the following trend over time: Should I remove the OR data from the results table? I am just concerned that reviewers and readers may be confused by the (to a typical medical professional) conflicting statistical results. Update Please see below marginal effects plot using the following code: an
