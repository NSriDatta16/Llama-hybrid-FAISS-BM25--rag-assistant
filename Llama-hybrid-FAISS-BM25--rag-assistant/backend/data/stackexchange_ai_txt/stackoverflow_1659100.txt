There's an existing bug in Adobe's Jira for this issue: http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-8877 . Flex does support PNG transparency, but from what I've read, it decodes some pngs incorrectly when embedding them, causing the weird background issue you're seeing. Can you try creating the graphic again from photoshop?
