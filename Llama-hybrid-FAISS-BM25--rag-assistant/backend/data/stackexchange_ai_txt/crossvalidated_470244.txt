Pairs Trading is a market-neutral strategy (meaning market direction doesn’t matter) and involves pairing a long and short position on strongly correlated stocks. While it isn’t riskless, by understanding how pairs trading works, how you control risk, and how you manage profits, it’s a great tool to add to your trading arsenal. Also, from Wikipedia , it is defined as a market-neutral trading strategy enabling traders to profit from virtually any market conditions: uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement. This strategy is categorized as a statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategy.
