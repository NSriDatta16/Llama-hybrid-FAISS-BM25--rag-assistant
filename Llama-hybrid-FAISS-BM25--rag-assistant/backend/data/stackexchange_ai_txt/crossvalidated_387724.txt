Actually the Mcmc method is a good tool to find the posterior probability function. I suggest that you read the following site - - > http://dfm.io/emcee/current/ In cosmology and astrophysics this method is very useful. On the other hand, about your question of \exp(\chi^2) as likelihood, you must observe whether your error distribution is Gaussian, because there are other distribution functions for the errors.
