The wsgen tool generates JAX-WS portable artifacts used in JAX-WS web services. Note that you do not have to generate WSDL at the development time as JAXWS runtime will automatically generate a WSDL for you when you deploy your service. You might want to check the JAX-WS RI documentation and especially the samples (pay a special attention to the fromjava sample).
