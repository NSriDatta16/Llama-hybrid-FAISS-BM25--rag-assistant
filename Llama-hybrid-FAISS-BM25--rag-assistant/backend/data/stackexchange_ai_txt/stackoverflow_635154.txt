Multiple deployments in maven

We have a internal artifactory repository. At the moment all snapshots will be deployed there. We also want to have a different server with a web interface, and want to copy the to it the created artifacts. For our builds we use Hudson, but the post-build action "Deploy artifacts to Maven repository" together with scp doesn't work. So there is the question of doing it in some other elegant way. Why isn't maven able to have several distribution repositories? Any ideas? The nicest thing would be if artifactory would support an (automatic!) incremental export to a standard maven repository after each new deployment.
