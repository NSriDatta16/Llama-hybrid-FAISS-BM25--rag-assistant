@Karla, Have you ever mailed out bulk mail for a non-profit organization? Well, I have. I had to send out letters and post-cards, and the only way the post office would give my organization a discount was if I placed all the postcards in one box and all the letters in another box (presorted according to the recipient's zip code). Essentially, that's what resources are, pre-sorted and pre-organized stuff. Now this doesn't mean that you won't be able to send out more letters and postcards later on (after the preprocessing and the compiling has been done), it's just that once the resources container is already packaged, you won't be able to include more stuff in that namespace anymore, and whatever you generate and send out after that will come at a standard cost (not the discount they initially gave you).
