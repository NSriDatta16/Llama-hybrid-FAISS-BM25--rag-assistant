My solution is, I use a Label to contain a TextBlock, and when I need to modified the text, I change the content of Label into TextBox, set the TextBlock's text into TextBox, so I can modify the text, after Enter key, save the text, and change Label content to TextBlock again. Maybe not an elegant solution, but it works for me.
