Here is the post-build command that worked: copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).xml" "$(SolutionDir)MyWebProject1\bin\$(TargetName).xml" copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).xml" "$(SolutionDir)MyWebProject2\bin\$(TargetName).xml" A couple of problems inherent with this solution: The xml is always copied even if that website is not part of the current build... so the documentation can get out of sync with the the dll in the bin folder until the next time that web project is built. If we add a new web project that refers to this library, we need to add another post-build command, rather than having this all happen automatically. I'm accepting this as a kludgy but workable solution... if anyone has a more elegant suggestion, please let me know!
