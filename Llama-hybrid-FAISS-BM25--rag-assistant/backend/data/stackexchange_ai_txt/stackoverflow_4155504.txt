I've hit the same problem. I'm finding that the geocoding API often returns no results if I include the business/venue name, but by missing it off, the lat/long can be much less accurate. I've implemented a pragmatic solution: 1. Call the API with a string including the business/venue name 2. If it fails, call it a second time without the business/venue name, just the address I've yet to see a case where no location is returned, so it seems a decent compromise as it means I do at least get location data, if sometimes less accurate, and the cost of a second API call is mitigated with threaded calls.
