Possibly a Pointer Problem in C

I am not sure why the following code fragement is not doing what it is supposed to do. Returning the numbers 0 to 9 in the second loop would be idea. *scp is a pointer to a memory region allocated to the program. unsigned char* scp = (unsigned char*)(0x8e000000); scp_size = 10; for(i = 0; i The acual output is however completely different: [exec] Data read[0]: 3 [exec] [exec] Data read[1]: 3 [exec] [exec] Data read[2]: 3 [exec] [exec] Data read[3]: 3 [exec] [exec] Data read[4]: 128 [exec] [exec] Data read[5]: 35 [exec] [exec] Data read[6]: 32 [exec] [exec] Data read[7]: 1 [exec] [exec] Data read[8]: 18 [exec] [exec] Data read[9]: 146 Anybody an idea if I mixed here something up with the pointer or any other idea what might have gone wrong? Many thanks
