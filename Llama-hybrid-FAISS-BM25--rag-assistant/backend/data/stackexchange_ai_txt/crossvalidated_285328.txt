Least significance difference (LSD)

Hi all sorry if I am not very well prepared for this question. I just have a vague idea about what I am trying to achieve without knowing much statistics, but its of urgent nature that is why I am asking here. So I have around 78 data points that I want to plot in a line graph. Each data point is an average over 20 values. If I am plotting two of such lines next to each other I want to show some kind of error bars that would show the significance of mean/average values. To be exact I want to show that if error bars overlap between the two lines then there is no significant difference between the data points however if they do not overlap then those points are significantly different. For some reason I have this impression that it could be done using Least significance difference (LSD). Any other method would also work.
