Why/how would a domain URL show client's localhost address?

I was trying to go to http://lustiges-taschenbuch.de which is a valid comic book site. I mistyped the address as http://lustigestaschenbuch.de and was surprised to see my own apache localhost directory (!). This happens on two computers in Windows 7. I checked my c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file but it has nothing listed. I looked it up on http://www.whoishostingthis.com on this site but it cannot find an owner. I looked it up on denic, and it says the owner is: Domaininhaber: Tapon del Darien LLC Organisation: Tapon del Darien LLC Adresse: First Floor-Commercial Area Calle 53 , Marbella P.O. BOX 0832-0588 PLZ: 0832-0588 Ort: Panama City Land: PA Can anyone explain why and how this domain is showing the client computer's localhost directory?
