How to go from DOM node to viewModel object?

When the drop function is called back, this is set to the droppable DOM node (the target) and ui.draggable is the DOM node which was dragged. Is there an idiomatic way of getting the model object which has been rendered as a particular DOM node? (I'm using jQuery templates, if it matters. There may be more than one rendering of a single modelView object.)
