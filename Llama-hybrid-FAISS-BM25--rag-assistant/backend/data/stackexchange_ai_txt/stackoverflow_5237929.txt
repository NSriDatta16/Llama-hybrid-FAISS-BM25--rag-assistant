Different browsers will have different behaviors. For example, Internet Explorer doesn't try to fetch any header information before displaying the save file dialog when doing a Right Click > Save Image As (It automatically assumes you want to save the result of the request, regardless of what the result is). Neither does Firefox. Therefore, for IE & Firefox, it will be impossible to specify the filename by specifying it in the headers. A more elegant and UA-compatible way of doing this would be by using Apache's mod_rewrite to do URL rewriting. URL rewriting allows you to reroute a request made to a URL towards another. To set this up, you need to create a .htaccess file in the directory where image_generate.php is located containing the following: RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^generated/([a-z0-9-]+)\.jpg$ generated_image.php?file=$1 [L] Then, simply modify your HTML to point to your rewritten URL. This also have the advantage of making your image generation completely seamless to the user (URL wise, it looks simply like a static image).
