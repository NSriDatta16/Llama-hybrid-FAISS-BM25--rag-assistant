Magento - How to add custom block to Checkout success page

I want to add some information to the checkout success page by adding a block to the page (without duplicating the template page and changing it). I've looked at the downloadable module and tried to copy it but that didn't work. I have a custom module and I've tried to do this : 1) adding a block file to : ...\app\code\local\SHANI\MyModule\Block\checkout\Details.php class SHANI_MyModule_Block_Checkout_Details extends Mage_Checkout_Block_Onepage_Success { } 2) adding a template file to : ...\app\design\frontend\default\default\template\mymodule\checkout\details.phtml 3) adding the block to : ...\app\design\frontend\default\default\layout\mymodule.xml .... .... .... Does that the way to do it? What am I missing? ///////////////////////////////////////// update///////////////////////////////////////// I've tried to change the mymodule.xml like Lrrr wrote but still no luck... any other ideas what is the problem? I'm trying to do the same thing with the product view page and I was able to add a block to the "product.info.additional" but not to the "product.info". This is working: But this isn't I'm trying to move this block from "product.info.additional" to "product.info" because I want to show this block under the Quick Overview (in the default template) and not under the Details. Why doesn't it work under the "product.info"?
