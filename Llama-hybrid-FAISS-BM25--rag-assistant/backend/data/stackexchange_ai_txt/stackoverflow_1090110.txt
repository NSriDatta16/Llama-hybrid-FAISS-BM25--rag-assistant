If you have an FSFS Repository, there should be no perfromance degradation for common operations, even after 10000+ revisions and gigabytes of data. RELATED: SVN performance after many revisions More likely, you are seeing something else happening. Remember, Big working copies = Lots of disk space = Slower client-side operations Make sure you aren't checking out the whole repo when you only need a subset. Organize your stuff into subfolders, and only check out the necessary subfolders.
