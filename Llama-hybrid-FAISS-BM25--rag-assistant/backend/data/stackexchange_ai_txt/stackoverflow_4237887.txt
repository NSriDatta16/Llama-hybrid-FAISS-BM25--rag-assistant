There are many ways you can pass an object from page to page: serialize and deserialize like Dennis said, but this, although feasable, is not practical, unless you want to save the object in isolated storage and retrieve it later. Place an object in the App.cs class, which is accessible to all pages. Set your object in the master page, retrieve it from the Details page. Code to put in App.cs: MyObject selectedObject; Code to put in MasterPage.cs: application.selectedObject = MainListBox.selectedItem; Code to put in DetailsPage.cs: MyObject selectedObject = application.seletedObject; You can set the Object in the DataContext of your LayoutRoot, but i don't have the code for that on top of my head.
