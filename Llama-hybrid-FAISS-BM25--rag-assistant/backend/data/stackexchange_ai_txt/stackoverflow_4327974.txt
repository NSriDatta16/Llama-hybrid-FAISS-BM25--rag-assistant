Yes, you can have three different IP addresses. Each server would present itself to the network as a physically separate device. As far as hardware, that is highly dependent on what the storage, load, and other requirements of these virtual servers would be.

I believe it's open source and can be implemented for free in non-commercial settings (but you might not qualify, so be sure to check).
