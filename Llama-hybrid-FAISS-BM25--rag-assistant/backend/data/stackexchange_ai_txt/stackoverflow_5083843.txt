Couldn't come up with a more elegant solution but try this: results = Goal.connection.select_all('SELECT COUNT(*) as amount, event_id FROM goals GROUP BY event_id ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 0, xx') raise results.inspect If you just want the one most event_id with most entries you can also use: event_id = Goal.connection.select_one('SELECT COUNT(*) as amount, event_id FROM goals GROUP BY event_id ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1').first
