I've had exactly the same issue. My problem was to do with the paths to the image file. The chart control was getting it wrong when placed on a usercontrol. If I changed the chart to use Imagestoragemode of HttpHandler then it worked as intended. unfortunatly this stopped me being able to unit test my views. In the end I put the chart control on an aspx page & then used jQuery to load it when needed. (Luckily my dashboard page used javascript to load the contents of the portlets)
