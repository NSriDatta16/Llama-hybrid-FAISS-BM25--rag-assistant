Consuming RIA services without a silverlight project

We have a silverlight project that uses RIA services. There is some code that I want to share between that project and a web service. I have to leave the code where it is now, i.e. I cannot share the code. What I thought would be good is for the web service to call the RIA service. It will be sitting on the same server. I went to my web service project, and added a service reference to the ria service. I clicked advanced and ticked the option for it to 'generate asynchronous operations'. I thought it would be all good to go, but I got some warnings. The client code that it generated was missing any actual code relating to the asynchronous calls, and the app.config is also empty. Here are the warnings, Warning 2 Custom tool warning: Cannot import wsdl:binding Detail: There was an error importing a wsdl:portType that the wsdl:binding is dependent on.
