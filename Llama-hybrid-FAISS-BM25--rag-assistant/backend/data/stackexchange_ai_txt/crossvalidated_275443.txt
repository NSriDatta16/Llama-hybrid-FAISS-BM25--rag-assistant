An AR(n) process with Gaussian errors is Gaussian if and only if all the parameters are known. Otherwise, it depends upon whether you are using a Frequentist or Bayesian methodology. For a Frequentist methodology, with a random shock with a finite, positive second moment and a first moment centered on zero (including the Gaussian), then the sampling distribution of the estimator for a parameter will either be Gaussian, Cauchy or the mixture of the two. See Rao, M M., Consistency and Limit Distributions of Estimators of Parameters in Explosive Stochastic Difference Equations, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, volume 32, number 1, March 1961, pp 195-218. Mann, H B and Wald, A; On the Statistical Treatment of Linear Stochastic Difference Equations, Econometrica, volume 11, 1943, pp 173-200 For the Bayesian, the answer depends upon the form of the error term.
