Having to input a non-existing feature is a common problem in machine learning models. Entering 0 and 0 could mean the position { x: 0, y: 0 } . But if you'd input "nothing", that still would be 0 (because nothing * weight = 0 ). The best you can do is figure out what works best through trial and error. I could think of a few options: If your network supports negative activation values (range: -1, 1 ), you should try to input it as -1 . I don't think the learning model will have a hard time if you'd just input 0 as input, like you proposed. Add an extra input feature, 'bullet exists'. 0 if there is no bullet, 1 if there is a bullet. Then just input 0 for the x and y coordinates.
