You might try using vocabulary vector analysis. Covered some here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity Basically you build up a corpus of texts that you deem "well-written" or "poorly-written" and count the frequency of certain words. Make a normalized vector for each, and then compute the distance between those to the vectors of each incoming document. I am not a statistician, but I'm told it's similar to Bayesian filtering, but seems to deal with misspellings and outliers better. This is not perfect, by any means. Depending on how accurate you need it to be, you will probably still need humans to make the final judgement. But we've had good luck using it as a pre-filter to reduce number of reviewers.
