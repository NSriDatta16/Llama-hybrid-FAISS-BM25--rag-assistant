It is not an appropriate suggestion to use MVC and jQuery instead of WebForms and ASP.NET AJAX. One should understand all the pros and cons of the technologies and approaches to choose from. First, MVC is a design pattern and has nothing to do with the particular frameworks mentioned. You can easily implement an MVC pattern with WebFroms. There are many different implementations of MVC for ASP.NET and WebForms. Second, jQuery, being a great JavaScript library, does not allow any integration with and does not leverage server side ASP.NET functionality, as opposed to ASP.NET AJAX framework that comes standard with the ASP.NET 3.5+ and fully utilizes ASP.NET features, such as server side mark-up, ScriptManager control, server-side script combining, localization and globalization, etc. Third, jQuery can be easily used in conjunction with ASP.NET and ASP.NET AJAX frameworks thus enhancing client-side programming. Microsoft has announced that jQuery will be shipped with the next ASP.NET 4.0 and for now you can just add it to your project manually.
