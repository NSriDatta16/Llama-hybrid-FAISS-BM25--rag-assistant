Can this be achieved without using SQLite of file storage for the implementation of the mailbox? Not reliably. Either it's a file, or it might be nuked before A comes back again. Remember that your process -- where all your static data members and the Application object reside -- does not live forever. Once S shuts down (which is a good thing, thanks!), Android is welcome to terminate the process, taking your "mailbox" with you if it is solely in RAM. You could persist it to disk yet keep a singleton or something around as a cache, so if A returns quickly you can skip some of the I/O. Or, if it does not really matter much if the messages exist for A, you could keep them in RAM and simply shrug your shoulders if the process gets terminated first.
