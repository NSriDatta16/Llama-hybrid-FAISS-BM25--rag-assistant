set myFilenamesList to paragraphs of (do shell script "path/to/shell/script") set firstFileObject to POSIX File (item 1 of myFilenamesList) When you have a list, you use a repeat loop to iterate over the list and do something with the items in the list. For example if you wanted a list of the file objects you could do this. set fileObjectsList to {} repeat with i from 1 to count of myFilenamesList set end of fileObjectsList to POSIX File (item i of myFilenamesList) end return fileObjectsList Of course it doesn't make much sense to do this because once you have the file objects in a list then you'll need to repeat over that list to do something with those objects... thus you'll be repeating over a list 2 times when 1 time would probably suffice. So I would do something like this instead... repeat with i from 1 to count of myFilenamesList set thisFileObject to POSIX File (item i of myFilenamesList) -- do something with the file object "thisFileObject" end
