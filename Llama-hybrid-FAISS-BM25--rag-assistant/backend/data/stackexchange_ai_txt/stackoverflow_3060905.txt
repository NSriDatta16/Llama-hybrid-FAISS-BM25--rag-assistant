How to find out the drag source component in the drop target TransferHandler?

Question is regarding Java 5 and Drag n Drop. Is there a way to determine the drag source component in the drop target TransferHandler ? I need to know this in my canImport(..) or importData(..) method in order to take different actions for transfer data of the same type or DataFlavor . The way I have achieved this currently is to hijack the DataFlavor 'Human Readable Field' and set a string action, resulting something like this: DataFlavor localCopyFooFlavor = new DataFlavor(Foo.class, "COPY"); DataFlavor localEditFooFlavor = new DataFlavor(Foo.class, "EDIT"); Then use this field to decide what action to take. I pretty sure this is wrong. Thanks.
