Sphinx Storage Engine for MySQL reindex on record insert

Do I have to run the indexer each time I add new records unto my tables? Is there no other way around this? Whenever I add a new record I always have to do indexer test1 --rotate on my searchd service. I am using ha_sphinx.dll on windows version 1.11 r2616. MySQL version is 5.5.9
