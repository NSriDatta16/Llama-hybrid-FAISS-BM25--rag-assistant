If your database is in FULL Recovery mode you can switch to SIMPLE mode then do a shrink files to reclaim space. Normally it's due to the logs not being able to successfully shrink rather than data file. However ensure you leave enough space for growth as the resizing will cause a lot of extra work. I wouldn't recommend shrinking for no reason as there are plenty of posts out there indicating why you shouldn't as it can lead to fragmentation. Check books online for the DBCC SHRINKDATABASE statement as well.
