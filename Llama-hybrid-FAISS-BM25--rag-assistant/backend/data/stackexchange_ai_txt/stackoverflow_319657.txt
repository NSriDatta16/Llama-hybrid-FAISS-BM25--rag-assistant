Bayesian networks represent independence (and dependence) relationships between variables. Thus, the links represent conditional relationships in the probabilistic sense. Neural networks, generally speaking, have no such direct interpretation, and in fact the intermediate nodes of most neural networks are discovered features, instead of having any predicate associated with them in their own right.
