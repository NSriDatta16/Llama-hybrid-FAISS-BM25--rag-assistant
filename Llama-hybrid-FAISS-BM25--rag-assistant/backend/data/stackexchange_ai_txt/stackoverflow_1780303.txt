Tornado and Python 3.x

I really like Tornado and I would like to use it with Python 3, though it is written for Python versions 2.5 and 2.6. Unfortunately it seems like the project's source doesn't come with a test suite. If I understand correctly the WSGI part of it wouldn't be that easy to port as it's spec is not ready for Python 3 yet (?) , but I am rather interested in Tornado's async features so WSGI compatibility is not my main concern even if it would be nice. Basically I would like to know what to look into/pay attention for when trying to port or whether there are already ports/forks already (I could not find any using google or browsing github , though I might have missed something).
