What is the best data-structure for storing elements which will be retrieved only once and then deleted?

I want to design a data-structure for storing elements, which will be retrieved only once after insertion and will be deleted after that. I can't use a stack or queue as the order of retrieval is not guaranteed. [EDIT] - I would like to use contigous memory (I would prefer to avoid doing malloc every now and then) and also I would prefer searchability also.
