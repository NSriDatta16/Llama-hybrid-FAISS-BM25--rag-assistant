Curve fitting when data has a sharp initial slope and then tapers off

I have a dataset that I'm currently smoothing using a 6th order least-squares polynomial which models the initial sharp curve well but as the data tapers out some noise at the end causes a downwards curve at the end. It's probably easiest to show a plot of my current data followed by the results of fitting extrapolated by a few extra points: I'm expecting the data to taper out as it moves along so my initial thoughts were to maybe to break the data into thirds and apply lower order polynomials as it goes along. But I don't have a good background in statistics and I'm guessing this problem has some elegant solution I'm not aware of. Because the dataset is fairly short I thought I'd include a copy in case anyone was inspired to demonstrate some techniques: 0 0.632696209 1 0.954847196 2 1.211956632 3 1.282479631 4 1.348572899 5 1.36480867 6 1.411463353 7 1.413356854 8 1.443252208 9 1.5086791 10 1.519056572 11 1.515427082 12 1.545547955 13 1.567970692 14 1.554558155 15 1.539432376 16 1.662380739 17 1.630363821 18 1.627295705 19 1.574494008 20 1.651035552 21 1.59834609 22 1.612328401 23 1.634990079 24 1.668922299 25 1.622188079 26 1.759410212 27 1.849993968 28 1.78653232 29 1.7872419 30 1.639521297 31 1.70151144 32 1.868248296 33 1.707963085 34 1.703480801 35 1.811524105 36 1.790136202 37 1.79970863 38 1.944272907 39 1.818103305 40 1.750744767 43 1.77700684 44 1.80647612
