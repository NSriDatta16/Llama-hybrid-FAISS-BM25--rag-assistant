In general it is not considered a good practice to store big images or videos inside a database. It is much better to organize them in a structured folder in the disk, and store in the database the paths to the files. If you really need to store them in the database, your question depends on the files format and the API's you use. If you need to read them from disk, your approach is correct: File.WriteAllBytes (strng path, byte[] bytes) then you can access the file to load it with the API's you're using. Still I recommend to store the big files outside the database. EDIT: I think I went too far saying it's not a good practice to store them on database :). But I still think is useful to have them outside the database. SECOND EDIT: From your comment of converting any media to one file type... this is not possible. You can convert between different audio types, or between different image types, but not any media type into a single file type. I thought your question was more focused on storing and retrieving blobs to/from database, hence my answer. Images can be viewed in XAML, but audios and videos are another thing... I would start by taking a look into embedding Windows Media Player into your application: Windows Media Player SDK so you can reproduce anything that WMP can play :)
