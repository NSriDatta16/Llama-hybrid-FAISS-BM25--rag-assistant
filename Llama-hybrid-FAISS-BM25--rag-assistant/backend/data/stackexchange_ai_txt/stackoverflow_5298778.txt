There's a javascript function that helps identify most browsers here . Its worth keeping up to date on, as it is updating regularly. By way of explanation the following is copied from the linked page: Browser detection The dataBrowser array is filled with objects that contain the properties that help the script detect your users' browser. Note its general syntax: dataBrowser: [ { prop: window.opera, identity: "Opera", versionSearch: "Version" // note: no comma }, { string: navigator.userAgent, subString: "MSIE", identity: "Explorer", versionSearch: "MSIE" // note: no comma } // note: no comma ]; The [] define an array literal, and all of its elements are object literals. Each object literal is enclosed in curly braces {} and contains a few properties (name: value,). Note that a comma between the objects and between the properties is required, but that the last comma is always forbidden. Properties Every object in the dataBrowser array can contain the following properties: string and subString properties. These say: "search for subString in string". If the subString is found, the browser is identified. a prop property. It says "see if prop is supported". If it is, the browser is identified. an identity string. This string becomes the value of BrowserDetect.browser. a versionSearch string. This is for searching for the version number (see below). If this property is absent, the identity string is used instead. Every object must contain either 1 or 2 (never both!), must contain 3 and may contain 4.
