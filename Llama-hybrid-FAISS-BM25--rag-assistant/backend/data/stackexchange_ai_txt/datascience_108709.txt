How to plot a PCA table

I'm studying PCA method with the package PCAmixdata because I have a dataset with numerical and categorical variable. This is my example code in R: library(dplyr) library(PCAmixdata) data I know that the function ggplot can be used only with data.frame and at the moment I have a list . Is there a way to convert pca_table into a data.frame to use the function ggplot ? I want to do this because in my original dataset I have many classes and with the function plot I have a limited set of colors, so a color could correspond to more than one class.
