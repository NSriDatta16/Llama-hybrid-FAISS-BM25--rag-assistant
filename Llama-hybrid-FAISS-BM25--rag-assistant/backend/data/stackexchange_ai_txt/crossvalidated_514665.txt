Would this work (posting as an answer because it's not really a comment)? I have 100 samples in each of the four sampling groups (A1, A2, B1, and B2). The samples collected within A1 are not independent from each other, but they are independent from the samples collected in A2, B1 and B2. Therefore, could I take a random sample in sampling group A1, another random sample in sampling group A2, B1 and B2 and perform a Chi-square test on these 4 numbers. Obtain the Chi-square test statistic and then repeat this procedure 10,000 times to obtain an average Chi-square value with a standard error, and then get a p Value from that?
