Renaming is perhaps the most common refactoring . It is rather encouraged to refactor your code as you go, as this gives you the flexibility of not having to make permanent decisions about names, code placement, etc. as you are first writing your application. If you are not familiar with the idea, I would suggest you start with the Wikipedia page and then dive into Martin Fowler's site . However, if you need to write your own regex to rename things, then imho you could use some better tools. Don't waste your time reinventing the wheel -- and then fixing whatever your new wheel broke by accident. If you have the option, use an existing tool (IDE or whatever) to do the dirty work. Even if you have "dozens" of things to rename, I think you're better off finding them one by one manually, and then using an automatic Rename to fix all instances throughout your code.
