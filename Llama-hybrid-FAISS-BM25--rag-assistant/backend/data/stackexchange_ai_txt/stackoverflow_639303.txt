How to serialize collections in .net

I want to serialize a collection of objects for storage/retrieval from my app.config file. (I'm using the code from an example from Jeff Attwood's blog entry The Last Configuration Section Handler.. Revisited ). What I want to know, is why collections of objects of type public class MyClass { ... } get serialized to an xml element called ... In this example I'm using a generic list of MyClass objects. I've also tried creating a new class which inherits from List and the resultant xml is exactly the same. Is there a way to override the xml element name used when serializing/deserializing?
