How to implement constraints in a neural network for a regression problem?

Let's say I have different sensors in an engine, and I make a neural net which predicts the engine's temperature given different operating conditions measured by the sensors. I happen to know the engine temperature stays in a 195 to 220 F range. How can I impose this constraint on my network? Will imposing it make the predictions any more accurate than simply setting values below/above this range to 195/220 F?
