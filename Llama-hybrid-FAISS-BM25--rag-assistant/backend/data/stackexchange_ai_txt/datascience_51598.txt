I do not completely understand the background of the task that you are doing with logistic regression for some language. But I will give you a general picture. Anything that is related to language has to consider two main things - Syntactics and Semantics. These two things vary completely with different languages. For example, if you try to do a word to word translation of English to say, French, it may look syntactically fine but semantic wise (grammatical meaning) it may look completely meaningless. Language is a "sequence" and the ordering in the sequence matters a lot. So whatever the model is trying to learn in the multidimensional dataspace with one language will not map properly to the other language even if the preprocessing is correct.
