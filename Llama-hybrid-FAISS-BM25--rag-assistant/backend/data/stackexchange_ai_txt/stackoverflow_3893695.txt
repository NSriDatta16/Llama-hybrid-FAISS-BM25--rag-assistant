You indeed need to instruct the webbrowser to not cache the response by setting the appropriate response headers. The correct set of response headers are those: response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"); // HTTP 1.1. response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); // HTTP 1.0. response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); // Proxies. You'd like to do this in a Filter class which is mapped on an url-pattern of interest, e.g. *.jsp rather than copypasting the same over all JSP pages.
