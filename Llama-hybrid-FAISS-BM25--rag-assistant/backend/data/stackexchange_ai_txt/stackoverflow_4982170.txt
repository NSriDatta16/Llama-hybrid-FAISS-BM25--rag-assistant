In terms of the mutable array, what you put into it is just a pointer to some other object. It is those other objects you have to worry about and, yes, you have too many of them (more likely than not). ERROR: ImageIO 'ImageProviderCopyImageBlockSetCallback' header is not a CFDictionary... Would it help if I broke my images up into separate arrays? Am I just putting too much into the array? What am I missing here, trust me, I am all ears. That sounds more like you have an over-release problem and are passing something bogus to the ImageIO APIs. And, in fact, that is exactly what you have: UIImage * img = [arr objectAtIndex:position]; [imageView setImage:img]; [img release]; That release is spurious; it does not balance a retain anywhere in your code. objectAtIndex: does not return a retained object and the UIView will take care of retaining/releasing the image internally. Remove that release (and the other one, too)! You still need to worry about memory consumption. At a size of 42K each (not an unreasonable size, but entirely made up), 130 images will weigh in at ~6MB or so, prior to any decompression or other expansion that occurs as a part of storage. The devices are quite memory constrained.
