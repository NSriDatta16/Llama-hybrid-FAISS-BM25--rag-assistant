How to group objects in different sized groups by their similarity score

Complete noob at this topic, so bear with me. I have a collection of objects and I can calculate similarity scores between each pair of objects. I've gone ahead and created a "similarity matrix" that contains all similarity scores between all pairs of objects. What I'd like to do now is to find how I could organize these objects in groups. I need to be able to specify how big/small these groups should be and then the objects should be grouped accordingly. I'm a software engineer not a data scientist, so I'd appreciate it if someone would give me some pointers on how to approach this problem.
