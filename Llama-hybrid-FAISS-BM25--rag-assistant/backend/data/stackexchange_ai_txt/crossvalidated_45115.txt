This is a multivariate problem, and there's not a single criterion you can you that will tell you which one is "best" in general without you putting weights on which subjects you think are more/less important. For example, consider a simplification with just two cities and two subjects: Shanghai scores 40 in Math, 50 in Physics; Beijing scores 50 in Math, 40 in Physics. Which is better? It depends on whether you think Math or Physics is more important. Suppose you decided Shanghai was better, and I give you updated scores: the next years Shanghai scores exactly the same, but Beijing scores 50 in math and 40.01 in Physics. Is Shanghai still better, or is Beijing better now? What if Beijing's Physics score had gone up to 41? 42? How high would it have to go before you would decide Beijing were better? This tells you how you weight math vs. physics. The problem is that you are trying to rank the cities along a single dimension--"goodness"--but you have multivariate data. In order to rank along a single dimension, you have to reduce your data to one dimension, and how you do that depends on how important you think each subject is. Your ranking will end up being according to a weighted average of each city's scores in each subject. If you want to assume that each subject is of the same importance, then you just take the regular average where all subjects are weighted equally. If you're interested in reading more about the problem, the general topic is multivariate optimization.
