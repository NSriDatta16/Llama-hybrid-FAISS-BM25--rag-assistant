If you really want to use random values then simply place the value in use in the textual part of the assert methods. Then if an assert is blown the input value will be present and you can investigate why it had a problem. This is Fuzz Testing and is a powerful technique but is most useful when you don't have the available source code or when testing a system with complex internal state and multiple interactions. A more useful type of testing for you may be white box testing where test inputs are deliberately selected to cover the various classes of input you might get. JTest appears to be an automated tool for this in java. MS Research supplies PEX for c#). Simply using a coverage tool and validating that you cover the relevant paths is normally sufficient if doing it by hand, though the boundary cases supplied by the automated tools are often instructive.
