IMO, one should not pay attention to gaps in identity columns. The whole point of such a surrogate key (as opposed to a natural key) is to not have to worry about any sort of "correctness". Now, like Robin said, you may have statements that are rolling back or erroring out which causes gaps in the identity. The other thing that can cause gaps is the definition of the identity itself. Run this statement and see what I mean Declare @MyTable table ( MyColumn1 Int Identity (1, 5)) INSERT INTO @MyTable Default Values INSERT INTO @MyTable Default Values INSERT INTO @MyTable Default Values INSERT INTO @MyTable Default Values INSERT INTO @MyTable Default Values INSERT INTO @MyTable Default Values SELECT * FROM @MyTable
