I'm not an expert on payment processing and developing ecommerce applications, but some of my (commonsense) guidelines are: Force HTTPS for the submission of CC information from users (pretty much all payment processing gateways force the use of SSL when communicating with their gateway); Do not store Credit Card information in the database after processing;* Follow general security guidelines (e.g. don't save plain-text passwords or e-mail passwords); *Note: PCI does allow for the storage of credit card details after processing, but you need PCI-compliant hosting, which is usually quite expensive. And even then you're running a huge risk. So if you decide to give your customers that option (and I know it's very tempting since big sites like Amazon all offer "one-click" checkout ), you better make sure your application and server are locked down tight. I don't know much about scalability issues with payment processing as I have no experience in that area. All of my applications only process about 5-25 orders a day.
