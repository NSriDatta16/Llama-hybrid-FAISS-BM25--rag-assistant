If you need to render graphical maps of anywhere on the globe, you're gonna need a lot of geographical data and a lot of storage (unless you're keeping the resolution low). For geographical data of the U.S., you can purchase bulk data sets (or obtain smaller free data sets) from certain commercial organizations, or try GeoData.gov . Once you've obtained your GIS data set, you can use Image_GIS to visualize the data. I haven't used the library, so I don't know how the results look, but that's one solution.
