How to structure image directories for SEO?

We are currently reorganizing some files on our site, and I am trying to figure out the best way to organize files to be SEO friendly. Here is the wrong way to do it: yamaha-bikes\yamaha-bikes.php The right way: bikes\yamaha-bikes.php My question is how do I go about organizing images for those products? Obviously if I throw a million bike images in my folder, it will be very disorganized, but would it be SEO friendly? In other words, should I do: images\yamaha-bikes\yamaha-bike.jpg images\yamaha-bikes\yamaha-bike2.jpg or bikes\yamaha-bike2.jpg Obviously the first option is easier to organize, but is it as SEO friendly?
