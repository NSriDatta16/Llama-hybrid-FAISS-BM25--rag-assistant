Which Python client library should I use for CouchdB?

I'm starting to experiment with CouchDB because it looks like the perfect solution for certain problems we have. Given that all work will be on a brand new project with no legacy dependencies, which client library would you suggest that I use, and why? This would be easier if there was any overlap on the OSes we use. FreeBSD only has py-simplecouchdb already available in its ports collection, but that library's project website says to use CouchDBKit instead. Neither of those come with Ubuntu, which only ships with CouchDB . Since those two OSes don't have an libraries in common, I'll probably be installing something from source (and hopefully submitting packages to the Ubuntu and FreeBSD folks if I have time). For those interested, I'd like to use CouchDB as a convenient intermediate storage place for data passed between various services - think of a message bus system but with less formality. For example, we have daemons that download and parse web pages, then send interesting bits to other daemons for further processing. A lot of those objects are ill-defined until runtime ("here's some HTML, plus a set of metadata, and some actions to run on it"). Rather than serialize it to an ad-hoc local network protocol or stick it in PostgreSQL, I'd much rather use something designed for the purpose. We're currently using NetWorkSpaces in this role, but it doesn't have nearly the breadth of support or the user community of CouchDB.
