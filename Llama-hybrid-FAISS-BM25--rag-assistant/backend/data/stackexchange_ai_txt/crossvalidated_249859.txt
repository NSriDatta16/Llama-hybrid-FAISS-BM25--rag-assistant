We would probably need more information to give you a reliable answer. As a general rule, though, binning leads to lower power rather than higher power. In general small sample sizes won't lead to rejection of goodness-of-fit by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test - the opposite if anything. If Hosmer-Lemeshow is failing, the best thing to do is to look at your data - plot the data (y= parasite isolation=1 vs no parasites isolated=0 vs. x=titer) and superimpose the fitted logistic regression line and try to figure out what's going on. You might be able to use a tool such as binnedplot from the arm package in R to visualize the pattern of the residuals. It's possible that your signal is actually too strong - e.g. if you have complete separation (e.g., all individuals above a certain level of titer have parasites isolated, and none below that level do), in which case you would probably want to use bias-reduced/penalized/Firth regression. How many responses do you have in each category (no isolation vs. isolation)? If your responses are too unbalanced (e.g. if you only isolated parasites in 5 animals out of 45), you might not be able to do anything sensible on a formal statistical level - in that case I would probably just report the range of titers and the min, median, and max titers of the less common outcome and let readers draw their own conclusions.
