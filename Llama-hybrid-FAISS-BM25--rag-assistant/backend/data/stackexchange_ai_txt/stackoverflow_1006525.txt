G'day, The only thing you could say that is similar about memory management in various languages is the objectives. Namely: provide a fixed chunk of memory for a process to play in, protect memory outside of this chunk from being accessed by the process, provide a dynamic mechanism of allocation for variables/objects/functions/etc. within the process, ensure that the memory allocations for these items is done on sensible boundaries, sensible being from a point of view of the processor, provide a mechanism to free memory as required, clean up (garbage collect) unused objects, coalesce fragmented memory into contiguous pools of occupied memory, etc. Various languages and runtime environments provide mechanisms to implement at least some of these features. HTH cheers,
