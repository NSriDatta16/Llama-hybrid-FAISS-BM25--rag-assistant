Though the code might be correct, I personally find that working with something like a char **** can get pretty confusing pretty fast. This is just my personal preference, but I always try to organize things in the most clear and unambiguous way I can, so what I would do in your situation would be something like struct Ability { char extraData[NUM_OF_EXTRA_DATA][50]; }; struct HeroData { Ability abilities[NUM_OF_ABILITIES]; }; class Foo { // here you can choose a HeroData *heroArray; // and then you would alloc it with "heroArray = new HeroData[m_iNumOfHeroes];" // or you can more simply go with a std::vector heroVector; }; I think this makes things more clear, making it easier for you and other programmers working on that code to keep track of what is what inside your arrays.
