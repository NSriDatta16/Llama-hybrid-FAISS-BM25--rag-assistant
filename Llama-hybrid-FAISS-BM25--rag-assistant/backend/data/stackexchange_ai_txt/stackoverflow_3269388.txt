Cannot pass UITouch behind scrollview without disabling scrollview user interaction

I subclassed uiscrollview and overrode the touch began method to pass touch events to a button object behind the scroll view(the scroll view is transparent). For some reason, only if user interaction of the scrollview is disabled does the event get passed through. Does anyone know how to pass events up the responder chain with scroll view without disabling the user interaction? Thanks, David
