Control the way nhibernate does querying

I've experienced a couple of days ago, that a problem with the name of the fields in the final query. It was a bug from a version before the 2.0.GA. To not drag too long on this, it was a problem when the query is too big, and you use SetMaxResults altogether. It got me a though: Would there any way to control how NHibernate is going to name your fields in the SQL query? Because as I have seen for a while, and in this case more than ever, the relathionship between tables and the naming convention for the fields that will be rendered whit a not so pretty as I exaustly set on my criteria.
