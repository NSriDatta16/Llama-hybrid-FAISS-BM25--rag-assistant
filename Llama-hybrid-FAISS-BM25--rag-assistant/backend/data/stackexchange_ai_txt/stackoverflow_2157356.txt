Why doesn't STDifference between a LINESTRING and a POINT on the line string yield a MULTILINESTRING of the two pieces?

DECLARE @Route geography SET @Route = geography::STLineFromText('LINESTRING(-0.175 51.0, -0.175 59.0)',4326) DECLARE @Route2 geography SET @Route2 = @Route.STDifference(geography::STPointFromText('POINT(-0.175 52)', 4326)) SELECT @Route2 Why does @Route2 evaluate to LINESTRING (-0.175 59, -0.175 51) instead of a MULTILINESTRING consisting of the line segments on either side of the point? The only way I have been able to do this is by creating a second LINESTRING with very small length (0.0001) and use this to subtract. It works, but it isn't very elegant.
