This is exactly how I do it, instead of calling a Controller in the View ( WHAT?!? ) I just compute all the necessary data for the view in the Controller that calls the View in the first place. A View should never call a Controller / Model! BUT, if you must you can do something like this: function Controller($pathToControler) // instantiates and returns the Controller function Model($pathToModel) // instantiates and returns the Model That way, inside your view you can do something like this: $this->Controller('path/to/blog/tags.php')->List(); Again, you shouldn't use this pattern, I'm just giving you solutions, not encouraging them. Similarly, you can also call another view from within a view, like this: $this->View('path/to/views/header.php', array('title' => 'Hello World!'));
