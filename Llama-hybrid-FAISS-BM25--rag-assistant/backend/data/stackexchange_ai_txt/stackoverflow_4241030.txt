"Won't work" - Is not an accurate description. First you should fix your CSS and HTML, Opera 11 doesn't render the site at all , Dragonfly complains: dispaly is an unknown property Line 10: #inner_site_header_right{float:right;dispaly:inline;text-align:right;padding-rig ---------------------------------------------^ and: Syntax error before comment end ("-->") Line 15: //--> -----^ Next time do at least some basic debugging before coming here. Safari I cannot test, but Chrome 8 seems to work, but then again, we don't even know what's not working.
