Short answer is no. it's a low level language for describing where to put ink on a page, no concepts of organizing it besides lines, arcs and beziers connecting x,y points put on the stack. That said - i have written postscript by hand, and it would be smart to create variables, or arrays of x and of y values to use for aligning points. The arrays would be especially useful inside a for loop which renders the contents and draws border lines. Beware of fencepost bugs!
