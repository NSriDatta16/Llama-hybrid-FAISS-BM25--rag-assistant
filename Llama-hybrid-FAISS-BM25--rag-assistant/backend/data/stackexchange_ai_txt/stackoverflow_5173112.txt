If having a separate directory for flash messages and such seems reasonable to you, then go for it. The examples given in the guides are just as it says, examples. Organise them in whatever way makes sense to you. Same goes for keeping it all in one file. It'll work just the same and the only reason it's suggested to consider breaking it up is because it can become hard to manage. But if you want to do it that way, then do! :) You can always split it up later if you change your mind.
