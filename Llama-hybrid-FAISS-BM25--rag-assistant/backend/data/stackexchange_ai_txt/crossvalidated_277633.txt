Yes, that would be sensible depending upon the kind of classification problem you trained your network to solve. Convolutional neural networks designed for image classification essentially modify an input space so as to make the data within it linearly classifiable. After passing through the network, every input image is mapped into this space using a set of class scores. The final interpretation of that score depends on the loss function but they all generally work on the assumption that higher the score for a class, greater the likelihood of belonging to that class. However, if the two classes used for training were say, human faces and cars, and you test it against faces of monkeys, it would likely predict those as human faces with high probability.
