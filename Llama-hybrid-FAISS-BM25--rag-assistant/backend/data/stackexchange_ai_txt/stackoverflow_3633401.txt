For code coverage ratio check you can use NDepend. You can declare an attribute, like YourNamespace.FullCoveredAttribute and tag your classes 100% covered by tests. using YourNamespace; ... [FullCoveredAttribute] class MyClassFullCovered { ... } Then the single following CQL query will check for all classes 100% covered and warn if it finds any flaw: WARN IF Count > 0 IN SELECT TYPES WHERE HasAttribute "YourNamespace.FullCoveredAttribute" AND PercentageCoverage The magic comes from the fact that NDepend can gather code coverage metric from both NCover and VSTS Coverage .
