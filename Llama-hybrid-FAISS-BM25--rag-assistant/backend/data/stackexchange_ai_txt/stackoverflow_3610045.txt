dump xml string verbatim to mysql db

I need to dump an xml string (coming into a web service as a POST param), directly into a Mysql DB. The column into which I am writing is currently of type 'text', though I have tried blob as well. Right now, when I save the string and retrieve it later on using sql, it comes back in a serialized like format, like this: a:1:{s:14:" ";} Whereas, I need to parse that xml as a simplexml object, and hence need it to be better formed. This is what I am doing codewise: Accept Post Param in web service Serialize and store it in DB using doctrine ORM, kind of like $record->xml_rec = serialize($_POST) Retrieve it and echo it. Oddly enough, if I unserialize and echo is upon retrial, I get an array. The array looks like this upon print_f Array ( [ UTF-8?> ) Still not parse-able by simplexml. Is this a mysql storage problem or am I doing something wrong with the POST params? I've tried htmlspecialchars to save the string in the db, but similar problems remain. any help is appreciated, thanks
