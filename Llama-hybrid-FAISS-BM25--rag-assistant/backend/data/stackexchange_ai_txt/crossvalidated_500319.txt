Multicollinearity and case:predictor ratio problems

I have 444 cases and 60ish predictors that suffer from collinearity. The predictors fall into three categories (vol, thickness and demographics). I would prefer to subdivide my cases into 4 (age) groups for the analysis to make more sense theoretically, but I am also controlling for age using linear + quadratic terms for vol and linear + cubic terms for thickness (based on a prior paper). I have no specific rationale for the order of entry except (I think) they need to be in blocks to properly include age terms for the IV categories, and I could run a whole group analysis if I absolutely had to, but would really prefer grouping if I can improve the power. So far I have tried running a standard linear regression with forced entry but the collinearity is bad. When I subgroup by age my case:predictor ratio is terrible as well. I tried doing a PCA to help reduce my IVs but I’m not sure it’s correct to do subgroup regression using components derived from a whole group PCA. If if I do PCA by subgroups, I don’t have a minimum 5:1 ratio so I’m not sure this is valid either. Either way I ran a regression on the whole group using the components from the PCA and nothing came out. I tried to do a penalized regression using elastic net but no models are returned. I’m not sure I’m doing it right in the first place (SPSS) and I don’t know the proper parameters I should be using. Is my next step a partial least squares regression? I downloaded smartPLS3. What am I missing or doing incorrectly? ETA Sure, I was just trying to keep my question on the shorter side. It’s a linear regression model. I’m looking at how MRI and demographic measures of various brain regions can be used to predict reading performance in kids age 3-18. I’d like to do subgroup analysis if possible because I’m not convinced that any model would be able to adequately control for age based on the extent of brain changes that happen across the developmental trajectory. The number of predictors is 69, across three categories (cortical volume, cortical thickness, demographic measures like household income and parental education). Age needs to be corrected for using a linear + quadratic term for cortical volume, and a linear + cubic term for cortical thickness. I could shrink them a bit by excluding some brain regions or demographic variables if needed. I ran an elastic net regression in SPSS using the CATREG function and no model was returned. I’m not sure I did it correctly, and my textbook has no info, and I couldn’t find anything helpful online. For the linear regression I ran using the PCA components, the overall model was not significant and neither were any of the coefficients.
