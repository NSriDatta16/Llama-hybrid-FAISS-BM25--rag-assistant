Extracting values from R output of bugs command

I asked this question on https://stackoverflow.com/ , but I couldn't get what I want. So, I am asking it here. I am running winbugs from R and I need to use some variables in R output. When I type schools.sim\$mean\$theta[1] in R, I get 10.2. However, when I type schools.sim\$2.5%\$theta[1] an error message come up. Any one what I am doing wrong or any other way to get the bayesian intervals? here is an example: This is the R code library(R2WinBUGS) data(schools) J and this is the winbugs code which must be stored as model.txt in D. model { for (j in 1:J) { y[j] ~ dnorm (theta[j], tau.y[j]) theta[j] ~ dnorm (mu.theta, tau.theta) tau.y[j]
