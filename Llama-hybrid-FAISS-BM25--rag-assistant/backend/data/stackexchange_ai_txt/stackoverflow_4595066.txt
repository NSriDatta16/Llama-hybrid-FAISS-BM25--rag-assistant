cupcake to FroYo marketplace problems (app not shown to some people - or listed on appbrain)

After reading another question, explaing to allow apps2sd I should change my android target to 2.2, keep minsdk at 4 and add installpref to manifest - this works great. However I noticed after uploading this update that my sales dropped, and free downloads. My brother in japan can no longer see my app! My question is - how can I keep my app on the international market, and use froyos SDK? working link: http://www.androidblip.com/android-games/wheelz-2d-physics-platformer-90018.html broken on appbrain: http://www.appbrain.com/app/wheel-2d-physics-platformer/com.chozabu.android.BikeGame Extra information! I uploaded copy of my game - where the only change is to return SDK to 1.6 http://www.appbrain.com/app/wheelz-international-trials/com.chozabu.android.BikeGameBeta it shows up on appbrainz! Thanks
