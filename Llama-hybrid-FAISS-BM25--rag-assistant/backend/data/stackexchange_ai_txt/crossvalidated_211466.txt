cross validating time series model

I'm evaluating a model predicting clickrate. I have series of clicks and impressions. At the moment I'm evaluating a particular feature X . It's a categorical variable, and it has 11 different values. I have 8 months of data, and I compute clickrate for each month for each value of X . Here is corresponding heatmap: each column corresponds to a particular X . It's prominent that the clickrate is consistently higher for some X , so I'm going to use this feature in my predictor. Now, I have several several questions: is it a good idea to evaluate this model this way? I know there is also a correlation between adjacent values in time series, so should I consider only using each second month? Or split the data in some other way (e.g. by user's id last digit)? How to quantify this "consistency"? I have a hypothesis that some X values are better predictors than others, which values should I compare? I considered standard deviation (of clickrate values for a given X value among all the months), would that be a reasonable choice? Then I could only include a subset of X values in my model (i.e. the ones with std ) Related to the previous point: I have two ways of inferring X feature itself. Would it be reasonable to compare this "consistency" among X values, inferred different ways? Then I would be able to say that one is better and use it.
