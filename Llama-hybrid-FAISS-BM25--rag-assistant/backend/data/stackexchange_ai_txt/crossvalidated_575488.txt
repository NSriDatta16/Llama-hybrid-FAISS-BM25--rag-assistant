The Poisson distribution is one integer-valued distribution among many alternatives. You can experiment with alternative losses. The model's predictions for the Poisson model is the conditional expectation , so there's no reason for it to be restricted to integers in general. To simplify, consider that the average of $(1,2,3,4)$ is not an integer, even though each of the elements is an integer. Naturally, you can do stuff like rounding to obtain integers -- whether or not it's the best choice depends on your goals and how you define "best." The metric isn't the reason that you have poor fit, it's just a thing that measures how good the fit is. A better model will improve the fit (tautologically).
