Do yourself a huge favor. Download the source for ASP.NET MVC. (Actually, you should do this anytime you have the luxury accessing the source code.) Set it up to debug and step through the part you are having trouble with. I cannot tell you how many times this has cleared up a problem like this for me. You will get a much better understanding of what is actually going on that you would otherwise have, and it can be really surprising what you find in some cases. I have in the past asked questions here, gotten 'workable' solutions, only to discover that there was a much easier, more elegant way of resolving the problem.
