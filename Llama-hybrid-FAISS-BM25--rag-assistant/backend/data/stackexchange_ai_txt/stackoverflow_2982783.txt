Nexus only proxies what the build has requested, that's why it doesn't have a full copy in the local storage of every repo. Trust me you wouldn't want that anyway. You typcially only need a very small subset of for example the 100gb Central repo. You can read the details about the various Expire/Reindex etc operations here: Nexus Scheduled Tasks
