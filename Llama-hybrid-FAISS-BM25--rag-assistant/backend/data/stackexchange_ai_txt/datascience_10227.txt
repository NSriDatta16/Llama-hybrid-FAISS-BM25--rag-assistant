doc2vec model gets its algorithm from word2vec . In word2vec there is no need to label the words, because every word has their own semantic meaning in the vocabulary. But in case of doc2vec , there is a need to specify that how many number of words or sentences convey a semantic meaning, so that the algorithm could identify it as a single entity. For this reason, we are specifying labels or tags to sentence or paragraph depending on the level of semantic meaning conveyed. If we specify a single label to multiple sentences in a paragraph, it means that all the sentences in the paragraph are required to convey the meaning. On the other hand, if we specify variable labels to all the sentences in a paragraph, it means that each conveys a semantic meaning and they may or may not have similarity among them. In simple terms, a label means semantic meaning of something.
