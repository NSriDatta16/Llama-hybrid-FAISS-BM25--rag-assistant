jQuery - CSS - Rotate Div by drag mouse event

I'm searching since a few day without real result, maybe someone can help me here. I've a div on my page (can containt an image, a text area, other), it's draggable and resizable (thanks to jQuery UI), and i want to make it "rotatable", with a handle in a corner to drag and rotate it using css transform (-wekbit-transform, moz-transform) Is it possible ? with jQuery or other Javascript ? Actually i don't care of compatibility with IE. Thanks in advance, Regards
