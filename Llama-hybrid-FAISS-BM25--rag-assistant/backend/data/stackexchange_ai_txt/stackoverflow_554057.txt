htons does not convert a string, it converts a short (16 bit) from host-byte-order to network-byte-order. It may (probably is) implemented as a macro. On my system (Debian Etch), it lives in the file /usr/include/netinet/in.h. This is owned by the package libc6-dev, which is the development part of the standard C library. Not sure how this is organized on OSX, but you should verify that you have C development libraries installed.
