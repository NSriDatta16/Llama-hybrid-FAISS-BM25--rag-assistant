Problem while loading the application on iPad?

I developed a simple application for iPad. I want to test the app how it works on the device. I have paid developer licence, and i have added the device id and created the app id and i have downloaded the provisioning profile using both. The same way how we will build the app for iphone i have done for ipad. i have sent the provisioning profile and .ipa file to my friend to load on to the ipad device(same device which i have added in the developer.apple.com). when he tried to drag n drop the provisioning file on to the device from iTunes it is giving below error. "abc.mobileprovision" was not copied on to the iPad, because it cannot be palyed on this iPad I am not able to understand what the exact error is. Can anyone please let me know how to dump the applicatio on to the ipad device?
