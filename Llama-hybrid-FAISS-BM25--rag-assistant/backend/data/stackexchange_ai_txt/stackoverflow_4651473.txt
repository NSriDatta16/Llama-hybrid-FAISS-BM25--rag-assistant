SWIG C++ structure to java

I'm trying to get a simple SWIG example to work that uses a struct as a return type, but my generated file is incorrect. My files look like this. SwigTest.h #pragma once #include "MyHeader.h" class SwigTest { public: MyHeader testMe(); }; MyHeader.h struct MyHeader { int x; } and my swig interface file is: %module MyModule %{ #include "SwigTest.h" #include "MyHeader.h" %} extern MyHeader testMe(); The resulting JNI file has the following method declaration public class MyModuleJNI { public final static native long testMe(); } If my method returns a primitive, it works fine, but not with the struct. I'm running on windows with swig.exe -java -c++ MyModule.i EDIT: I think I need to declare a struct in the .i file as well. Could someone confirm (or dispute) that? Thanks. thanks, Jeff
