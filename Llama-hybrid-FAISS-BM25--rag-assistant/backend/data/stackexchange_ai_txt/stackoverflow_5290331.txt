I had the same exception when running the 0.9.0.beta.4 version of Rake. It looks like the new Rake::DSL is not loaded properly. So I added following code to my Rakefile: require 'rake' # Rake Fix Code start # NOTE: change 'Anelis' to your app's module name (see config/application.rb) module ::Anelis class Application include Rake::DSL end end module ::RakeFileUtils extend Rake::FileUtilsExt end # Rake Fix Code end MyApp::Application.load_tasks That way I was able to run my Rake tasks again. I know that this is not a elegant solution. But if you have to use the --pre version of Rake it might be all right to use this quick hack.
