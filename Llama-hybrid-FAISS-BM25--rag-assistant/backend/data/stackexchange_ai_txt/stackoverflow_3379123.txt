My site has been tagged as Malware by Chrome! What now?

I'm completing the development of a site I didn't build (I designed it, but another has built it so far) and recently when I visit the site in Chrome I get a "Malware Detected!" Warning box. The site is http://kenbrook.org/ It's for a summer camp, and it's a basic brochure type site with your average marketing content. It was built on the ModX content management framework, and uses a few plugins. I have no clue how or what this is from, or how to deal with it. In troubleshooting another isssue with this site (CSS related) a user in another stackoverflow question mentioned an insight about that malware problem: When using the firefox webdeveloper toolbar to edit CSS, why do some image disappear when the toolbar is open? I'm not even sure what that script is on the site for?! Can anyone give me any insight about this issue and how I should begin to resolve it? I'm responsible for it now, so "Go back to the original developer and get him to work it out" is not an option. In case you'd rather not visit the site, here's the warning text that Chrome is giving me: Warning: Visiting this site may harm your computer!
