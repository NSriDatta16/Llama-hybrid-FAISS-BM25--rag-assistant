Well, given that your series is using dates, i.e. measuring data between the start date and todayâ€™s date, then it is a time series analysis. Regarding autocorrelation, this is a characteristic of time series models. However, if you were using OLS, then autocorrelation is a violation of the assumption that OLS is BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator). One possible way to remedy this is by using the Cochrane-Orcutt method and see what your results generate: install.packages('orcutt') library(orcutt) resModel2 However, given that you seem to have one variable in your model, average speed , then it is likely preferable to use a strictly time-series based model such as ARIMA or Holt-Winters to conduct forecasts on the basis of current data. I am not sure what type of results your ACF/PACF plots are generating, but one possibility could be to use the auto.arima() function to determine the best (p,d,q) order automatically, i.e. where p is the number of time lags of the autoregressive model, d is the level of differencing, and q is the moving average term.
