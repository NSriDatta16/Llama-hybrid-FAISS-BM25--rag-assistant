You should use a parser for HTML. Regex and HTML tends to make a volatile mix, that leads to insanity in large doses. Using Nokogiri : require 'nokogiri' html = some text some text some text some text some text some text some text some text some text some text EOT doc = Nokogiri::HTML::DocumentFragment.parse(html) puts doc.search('p').map { |n| n.inner_text } >> some text some text some text some text some text This is searching through the HTML fragment, looking for tags. For each one it finds it'll extract the inner text. I'm using Nokogiri's CSS mode, by using "p" . I could use XPath instead, but CSS is understood by more people.
