The tableview should call scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation when the scrolling ends. Try putting the push in that method: - (void)scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation:(UIScrollView *)scrollView { if (weShouldPushSecondView) { weShouldPushSecondView = NO; [[self navigationController] pushViewController:secondView animated:YES]; } } You might need to use a bool ivar that you set to YES right after the selectRowAtIndexPath because the scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation may be called at other times for other scrolls.
