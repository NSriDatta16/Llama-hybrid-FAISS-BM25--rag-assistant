The obvious mistake you have made is that you have placed the buttons outside the tags, which makes them do nothing. First fix that. On the javascript part, I don't really understand what you are trying to achieve. I see 'onClick="cart()"' in the submit button, but this function seems to be non-existant? Either you should put the input buttons inside the form field, then it will load data.php (as I suggested in the frist paragraph), or you could use the cart() function to read the values and use AJAX to send the values without loading a new page (which you seem to want if I understand correctly). Please explain better what you want, before this can be properly answered.
