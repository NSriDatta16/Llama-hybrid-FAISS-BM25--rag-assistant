Facebook in iPad: UIWebView - renders as touch instead of standard web

Up until a few days ago it worked fine: opening facebook.com in iPad/UIWebView rendered as standard web. Now Facebook is force-rendered as touch - as if the URL was http://touch.facebook.com . This happens regardless of the UIWebView frame size. Here is a simple code for the main view controller to see the problem: UIWebView *wv = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame]; NSURLRequest *req = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.facebook.com"]]; [wv loadRequest: req]; [self.view addSubview: wv]; I tried changing the user agent as suggested here - no good.
