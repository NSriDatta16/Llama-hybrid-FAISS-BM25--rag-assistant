You don't need encryption for security per se. Consider this 'packet': The MD5HASH is generated from the USER_ID + COMMAND + some other value both the server and client know, but is not transmitted over the wire (user email or some token supplied securely during login). The server can reconstruct the string used for hashing and verify the authenticity of the command. If some man-in-the-middle changes the COMMAND , the hash won't match. Besides validating authenticity this method also allows you to check you received the entire instruction. (It's possible that your 'game packet' is spread across multiple TCP/IP packets, some might get lost, etc.) This does not prevent snooping around in messages, but is does prevent tampering. It's a game, who cares about what players say? I mean, emails are unencrypted and nobody cares about those, while their contents is more valuable than the average in-game chat.
