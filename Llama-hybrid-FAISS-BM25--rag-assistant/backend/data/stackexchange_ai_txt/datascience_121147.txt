Clarifying some unclear Areas of model training, python, Machine Learning

The Problem I'm learning ML these days. I'm training a dataset with 10,000+ samples with 20+ features, the model I picked to train was "Logistic Regression", I have some problems in my mind, "Unclear areas", which are making my brain boil. So I'm trying to clear those and keep on learning what I can, but yet couldn't find where to really start solving it. So I decided to get a little community support by at least a two or one reference that will solve where I'm stuck. Explanation of what I tried and what is this "Problem" So, before start explaining, I will tell you what my setting so far; Logistic Regression Using as a classification Problem - Binary Classification(1,0) 30% of testing data all 100% of the data are balanced well with equal number of labels-> Binary Classification Number of features selected: 14 Current workaround that I did: I trained the above mentioned model with above setting + getting the support of sci kit learn as well, however in the accuracy_score() function with normalization=true set, I got a performance value of 1.(The best performance as to the function standards as doc says). Back to the problem explanation I have these problems in my head right now; Am I doing this correct? I mean, for logistic regression with 14 features(X[0..13]), and 2(y[0..1]) class labels. Most Importantly I want to interpret this in a plot, where can I learn to do that, I have 14 features, I mean lets say that I had 6 features, where am I doing wrong? I want to check this on decision boundaries, how can I do that? (Testing, and trained decision boundaries), I cannot do that as well since I'm having more than 2 features. How can I further more verify this test is an under fit or an over fit? Thank you for reading, hope you will provide your answer with care.
