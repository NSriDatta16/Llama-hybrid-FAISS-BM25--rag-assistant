Can I hybridize between ARIMA model and exponential smoothing?

I have a time series that stabilized at the first difference (d=1) and the model was ARIMA(0.1.0), as I know it is a model that does not really predict. In this case I relied on hybridization as follows: $Z_t$ : original data $Y_t$ : smoothing data $X_t$ : output After applying the method I obtained a good model ARIMA(4.1.0). Do I consider this method correct and good to adopt?
