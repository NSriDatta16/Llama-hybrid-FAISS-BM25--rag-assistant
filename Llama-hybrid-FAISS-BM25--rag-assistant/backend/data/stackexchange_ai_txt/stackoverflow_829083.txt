Refactoring is done to help make code easier to understand/document. To give a method a better name - perhaps the previous wasnt clear or incorrect. To give variables more descriptive / better names. Break up a really long method into many smaller methods representing the steps involved in solving the problem. Move classes to a new package(namespace) to assist organisation. Reduce duplicate code.
