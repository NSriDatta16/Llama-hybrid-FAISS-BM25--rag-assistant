TCPDF + pChart wont show images

I'm triying to insert a image on the pdf generated by the script. I have put a image that is on the folder and it shows correctly, but the generated one no. In other section of the site, I use the same function to generate and show the image and it shows correctly, only when I put on the pdf gets a blank gap. $html1 = ' 3.3.- Comparativa Evaluación Tu Total – Evaluación media Total getId().'&tipo=3" border="0" width="700" height="230"/> 4.- Detalle por competencias getId().'&tipo=4" border="0" width="700" height="230"/> This is the code that makes a little paragraph that is shown on the PDF, the text works nice, it's only the image not shown. Thanks for all.
