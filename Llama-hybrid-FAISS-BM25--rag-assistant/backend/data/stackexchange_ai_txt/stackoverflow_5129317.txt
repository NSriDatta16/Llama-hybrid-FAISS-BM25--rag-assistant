You probably come from a Java background... so you'll have to learn to live without new for a while :) In C++ there are 2 ways to create objects: objects with automatic storage duration (created on the stack) objects with dynamic storage duration (created on the heap) new creates objects of the second kind, for which YOU must ensure proper disposal (by calling delete according to text books, but... we'll stay away from this for now). Here, you don't need new : std::vector students; // create an empty `vector` of `Student` objects students.push_back(Student("bob")); // push a new Student in the vector As for the function, you have several possibilities: make it return the object pass the object by reference void addStudent(std::vector & students); pass by pointer, but then use the address of operator to get to it addStudent(&students); You don't have to use pointers everywhere in C++... in fact, it's probably better you don't, to begin with. Oh, and you definitely need a good tutorial, that's basic stuff, and you can't get into C++ without the boring basics... sorry :/
