How to Access a Text File from IBM DSX Scala-Spark Notebook

I have recently faced problem in accessing text files that I have uploaded from my local computer to the IBM DSX Cloud Object Storage so that I can use it in my Spark-Scala notebooks. It appeared to me that the general configuration of the platform is focused on CSV format; so is most of the help material. In fact, I figured a way around when I changed the extension of my .txt file to .csv. Through this post and the answer followed, I am trying to share my experience with others. This post is useful, if: You have created a IBM DSX notebook with “Language=Scala” and “Spark version=2.1 OR 2.0″[did not try with other versions] AND You are trying to access a text file [did not try other formats] that you have uploaded from your personal computer to the IBM Cloud Object Storage
