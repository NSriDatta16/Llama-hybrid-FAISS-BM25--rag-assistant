Try setting an NSTextField as the view of an NSMenuItem. You can do this in IB by dragging the text field into the nib as a top-level object and setting the menu item's view outlet to point to the field. Tricky thing you may need to solve in your app: In the IB simulator, at least, pressing return/enter did not dismiss the menu.
