In addition to the suggestions, you could also try the logit transformation: $$\log \frac{p}{1-p}$$ where $p$ is a Beta random variable. You can now fit a linear regression model. The estimates would be ok, the only thing that might be a problem are inferences regarding the regression coefficients. In order to avoid this problem, I would choose Bayesian approaches that impose a diffuse t-prior on the regression coefficients. If you don't have a huge data set, you could try either the bayesglm function in the arm package or fit a hierarchical model using JAGS and rjags package in R. Otherwise if you have a huge data set, normal Gaussian regression should work fine. However, I must remark that the choice depends on the specific data that you have and the interpretation of the parameter estimates.
