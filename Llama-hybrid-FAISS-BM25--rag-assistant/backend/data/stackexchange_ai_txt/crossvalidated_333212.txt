Random forests have many many degrees of freedom, so it is relatively easy for them to get to the point that they have near 100% accuracy in-sample. This is merely an overfitting problem. Likely you want to use some tuning parameters to reduce the model complexity some (reduce tree depth, raise minimal node size, etc). Some degree of cross-validation would help you here. Alternatively, it still has the best oob performance, so you can just use it anyhow.
