There is not any one answer to this question. The cost will depend on your transaction mix, as some are free to setup and per year but are expensive per transaction (e.g. PayPal or Google Checkout). Others have an upfront fee but are cheaper for large volumes of transactions. Some charge a flat fee per transaction, others a percentage. So, get some comparative costs, assess your likely transaction volume and order values, and work out the most likely. Most major payment gateways have Magento modules already written these days.
