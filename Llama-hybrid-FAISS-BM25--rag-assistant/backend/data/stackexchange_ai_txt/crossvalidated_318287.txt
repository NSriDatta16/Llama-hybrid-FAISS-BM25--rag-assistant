Different BIC value from strucchange plot and reconstructed model

I'm analysing a time series with the aim of assessing the presence of significant break points, using R package strucchange (v. 1.5-1). The number of break points considered for interpretation should be based on the BIC. bi The resulting plot shows a BIC around ~739 for the 3-breakpoints model (black line, left scale). However, when I then use breakfactor to reconstruct the model (for further plotting) : bp3 The resulting BIC is smaller (727). Which value should I consider ? Why is there a difference ? More precisely, I'd like to compare with the BIC from other models obtained previously with lm and nls .
