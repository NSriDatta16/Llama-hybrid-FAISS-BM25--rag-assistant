In Python small floats tending to zero

I have a Bayesian Classifier programmed in Python, the problem is that when I multiply the features probabilities I get VERY small float values like 2.5e-320 or something like that, and suddenly it turns into 0.0. The 0.0 is obviously of no use to me since I must find the "best" class based on which class returns the MAX value (greater value). What would be the best way to deal with this? I thought about finding the exponential portion of the number (-320) and, if it goes too low, multiplying the value by 1e20 or some value like that. But maybe there is a better way?
