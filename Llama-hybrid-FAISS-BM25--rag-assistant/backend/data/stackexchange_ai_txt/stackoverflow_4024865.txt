The property does not exist in XML namespace

I'm currently working on enabling drag-and-drop support for our company app. The error I keep getting seems weird to me. What this says is that The property 'DragDropHelper.IsDragSource' does not exist in XML namespace 'clr-namespace:DragAndDrop;assembly=DragAndDrop'. Line 61 Position 83 The property is an attached property in the class I found in the Internet in the samples and modified it a bit. Here is property declaration: namespace DragAndDrop { public class DragDropHelper { public static readonly DependencyProperty IsDragSourceProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached("IsDragSource", typeof (bool), typeof (DragDropHelper), new UIPropertyMetadata(false, IsDragSourceChanged)); public static bool GetIsDragSource(DependencyObject obj) { return (bool) obj.GetValue(IsDragSourceProperty); } public static void SetIsDragSource(DependencyObject obj, bool value) { obj.SetValue(IsDragSourceProperty, value); } It seems to me that attached property is completely valid, isn't it? This DragDropHelper is included into a class library, that I reference from the main client app. When I try to set the value of the property in a client app: VS2010 says that property doesn't exist in XML namespace. The XAML document is a resource dictionary which is merged into main client app resources, because it contains styles for our control. It's even more weird because I created a class within main app that has attached property, then set property value in XAML markup - app compiled OK
