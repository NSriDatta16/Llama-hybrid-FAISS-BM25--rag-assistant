It's definitely possible. But whether or not it's a good idea is an entirely different question. The problem with the approach you have taken is that nothing is preventing your model from making predictions outside the valid range (0-100). You should probably use logistic regression, which constrains your predictions to be from 0 to 1. Also, the situation you describe will probably benefit from causal inference methods such as propensity score matching as I can imagine you'll have a lot of problems with confounding in this study, and you'll want to be sure you are comparing apples to apples.
