Welcome to CV. For your first question: I want to identify if there are any trends in the gender composition of co-authors in relation to the gender of the first author. As an aside, it's sex, not gender. "Male" and "female" are sexes, "masculine" and "feminine" are genders. You could first turn the other authors field into a "proportion male" variable. Then you could do a beta regression with that proportion as the dependent variable and the sex of the 1st author as the independent variable (if you're interested in year, add that as a covariate). For your second question, another logistic regression should work.
