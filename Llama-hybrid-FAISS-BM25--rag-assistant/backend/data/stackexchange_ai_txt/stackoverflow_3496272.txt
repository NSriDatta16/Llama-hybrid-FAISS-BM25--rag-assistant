Neural Network size for Animation system

I decided to go with a Neural Network in order to create behaviors for an animation engine that I have. The neural network takes in 3 vector3s and 1 Euler angle for every body part that I have. The first vector3 is the position, the second is its velocity, and the third is its angular velocity. The Euler angle is what rotation the body part is at. and I have 7 body parts. Each one of those data types has 3 floats. 7*4*3 = 84, so I have 84 inputs for my neural network. The outputs are mapped to the muscles of the character. They provide the amount of strength to apply to each muscle, and there are 15 of them. I am running 15 networks simultaneously for 10 seconds, rating their fitness by calculating the lowest energy use, having the least amount of z and x movement, and if the body parts are in the correct y position compared to the rest (hips.y > upperleg.y, upperleg.y > lowerleg.y etc.), and then running them through a genetic algorithm. I was running a neural network of 168 neurons per hidden layer, with 8 hidden layers. I'm trying to get the character to stand up straight and not move around too much. I ran this for 3000 generations and I didn't even come close. The neural network and genetic algorithm are C# versions of this tutorial . I changed the crossover method from one point to blending. I have 84 inputs and 15 outputs. How large should my Neural Network be?
