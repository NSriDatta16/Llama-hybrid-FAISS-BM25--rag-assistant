How much correlation is significant enough to build a regression model?

I am trying to build a regression model using two time series data in R. There is not much correlation between the two time series, so I am using trend part of both time series(using STL decomposition) for the model. The maximum correlation between these two is about 0.6 at a fixed lag. Is this sufficient to establish that one time series affects the other and build a regression model upon them.
