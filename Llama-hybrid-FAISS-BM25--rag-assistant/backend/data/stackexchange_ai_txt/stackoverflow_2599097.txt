String Matching

I have a string String mainString="///BUY/SELL///ORDERTIME///RT///QTY///BROKERAGE///NETRATE///AMOUNTRS///RATE///SCNM///"; Now I have another strings String str1= "RT"; which should be matched only with RT which is substring of string mainString but not with ORDERTIME which is also substring of string mainString . String str2= "RATE" ; And RATE (str2) should be matched with RATE which is substring of string mainString but not with NETRATE which is also substring of string mainString . How can we do that ?
