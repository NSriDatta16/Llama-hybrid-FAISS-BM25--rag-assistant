Combining Posterior Distributions of Separate Models

I am running Bayesian models to estimate the number of fruits on a plant, given the presence/absence of herbivores. I get a posterior distribution on each mean. I then run a separate model to estimate the number of seeds per fruit given the presence/absence of herbivores, again with posterior distributions on each mean. Is there a way to combine these posterior distributions to get an estimate of total seed production? Could this be as simple as multiplying the posteriors? Similar to calculating the average number of fruits per plant and the average number of seeds per fruit and multiplying those together to get a coarse estimate of seed production? Or, is it OK to run both models simultaneously in one sampler and then work with the generated quantities. For example, using JAGS (or STAN): for(n in 1:N){ fruitNumber[n] ~ dnorm(fruitHat[n], sd_fruit) seedMass[n] ~ dnorm(seedHat[n], sd_seed) fruitHat[n]
