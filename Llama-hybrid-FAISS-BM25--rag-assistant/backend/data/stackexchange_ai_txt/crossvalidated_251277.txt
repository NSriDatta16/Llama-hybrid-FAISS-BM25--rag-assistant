Strange Behavior of Random Forest in Binary Classification

I'm testing the randomForest package in R and observing something really strange. Let's first look at the R code below: n I use one single binary covariate/feature $X$ to predict $W$. As we can see, $W$ is Bernoulli distributed with probability $e$, which has value of either $0.2689414$ or $0.7310586$. I use randomForest function in R with $1000$ trees (well, since we have only one binary covariate $1$ tree should give the same result). Anyway, the predicted probability for $W = 1$ ($e.prob$) returned by randomForest is very strange: it is either $0$ or $1$ instead of some value in between. The first $10$ values of $e.prob$ look like: [1] 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 I'm trying multiple ways to resolve this problem but still getting the same result. As a side note, running a simple logistic regression would give a very good predicted probability for $W = 1$. If Random Forest can overfit, then why cannot it give good predicted probability in this simple setting? Any ideas/suggestions/insights would be very much appreciated.
