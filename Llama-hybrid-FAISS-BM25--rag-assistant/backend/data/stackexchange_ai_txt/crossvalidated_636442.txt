p values are partly an effect of sample size. With a large sample size (and 2000 is pretty big) small effects can be significant. For measures of fit for logistic regression see Allison, Measures of fit for Logistic Regression, presented and published at SUGI (SAS Users group) and available on the web. While Allison uses SAS a bit here, that's really not important. You should read the whole paper, but, briefly, he recommends Standardized Pearson Test Unweighted sum of squares Information matrix test Stukel's test. He shows how to implement these in SAS, this might be used by someone to implement them in R or Python. Someone may have already done this.
