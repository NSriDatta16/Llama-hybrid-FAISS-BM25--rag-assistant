Can I get a jQuery object from an existing element

I have a function function toggleSelectCancels(e) { var checkBox = e.target; var cancelThis = checkBox.checked; var tableRow = checkBox.parentNode.parentNode; } how can I get a jQuery object that contains tableRow Normally I would go $("#" + tableRow.id) , the problem here is the id for tableRow is something like this "x:1280880471.17:adr:2:key:[95]:tag:" . It is autogenerated by an infragistics control. jQuery doesn't seem to getElementById when the id is like this. the standard dom document.getElementById("x:1280880471.17:adr:2:key:[95]:tag:") does however return the correct row element. Anyways, is there a way to get a jQuery object from a dom element? Thanks, ~ck in San Diego
