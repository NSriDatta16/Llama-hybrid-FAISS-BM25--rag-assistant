I've been in your situation before, and I ended up having about five different background images for the resolution variations. If it was their first time to the site (no cookie present), I'd present them with a landing page where I set a cookie (using Javascript) with the value of the client resolution (see my getViewportDimensions function in this blog post ). On the server-side, I evaluated the resolution on the next request and chose which image to inject in my CSS. It works well. Be sure to have a default resolution set on the server-side in case the user agent has Javascript or cookies is disabled.
