It seems you want a HTML fragment rather than XML. In this special case I'd go for string concatenation. Something like: SELECT ' ' + device_id + ' [' + terminal_id + '] &nbsp;|&nbsp;' FROM DEALERS_SIMPAYMENTS WHERE invoice_id=1 should do the trick. This just works for your simple example of course and does no XML/HTML-escaping for funny characters in your data and such nice things. It also returns the entries in seperate rows. I don't know if that is a problem or not.
