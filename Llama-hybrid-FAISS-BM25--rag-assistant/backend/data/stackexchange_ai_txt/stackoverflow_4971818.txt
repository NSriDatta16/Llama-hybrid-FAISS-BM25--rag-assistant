Possible to route to multiple subversion repositories without the need of individual virtual hosts?

I'm just wondering if it's possible, and if so could someone lead me into the right direction please? Basically here's what my current Linux box is doing: ServerName co.svnr.net ServerAdmin admin@svnr.net ServerAlias co DAV svn SVNPath /home/svn/public/shauny/test AuthName "Test repository" #a million other Locations later.... SSLEngine on SSLCertificateFile /home/certs/svnr/server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/certs/svnr/server.key SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown This is great and working, but it's just not feasible for say 50+ svn repositories. The ideal solution would to to point at say a Handler in PHP5 (whilst hosted on Linux machine) which accepts the username/repository in the superglobal $_GET and then redirects them to the repository (if it exists, otherwise redirect to 404). But... is that even possible? Can PHP5 read Subversion repositories and authentication? Having PHP5 handle them would be more feasible in my opinion as I can generate some logs based on usage etc... Much thanks guys, if you're unclear on anything let me know.
