I looked at a version of this problem back in April, to see what we could say about Covid elimination based on reasonable numbers of tests (spoiler: not a lot). As @keith's answer shows, if you want to be sure there isn't even one failure in the population, you need sample a large fraction of the population. That's obviously not sensible in most cases. As @BruceET says in his comment, a Bayesian solution makes sense. However, because there's very little information in the data about very small numbers of failures in the population it will matter what prior you put on very small numbers of failures if you think small numbers are plausible a priori , and don't sample a big fraction of the population, you will inevitably still think that a posteriori , so you won't end up with high posterior probability on zero Suppose you take a $Beta(a,b)$ prior for the probability of failure. The posterior after no failures out of $n$ is $Beta(a+0,b+n)$ . So you can look up the quantiles of that distribution and see when it's concentrated close enough to zero for what you want to use it for.
