How to get the status of a JBoss Application Server

I am working on writing a Highly Available agent for JBoss Application Server to run on Solaris Open HA Cluster. As I don't know much of the JBoss AS, can someone please tell me how can I probe the status of the application server? I want to know the health of the application server, for example whether it is currently running or not.
