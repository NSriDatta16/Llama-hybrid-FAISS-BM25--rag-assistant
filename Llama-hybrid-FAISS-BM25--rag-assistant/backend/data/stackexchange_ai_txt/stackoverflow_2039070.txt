How about: #pragma once #include "global.h" //#include "CharcoalApp.h" struct CharcoalApp; GtkListStore *WebsitesListStore; // that error is reported for this line void charcoal_websites_list_initialize(CharcoalApp *app); Its not exactly pretty, but removing header includes inside other headers and replacing them with forward declarations is something I was taught once and always try to do. It reduces the amount of time I spend swearing at the compiler over cyclic dependancy significantly, and it also keeps build times down when changing a commonly included header file. : D
