Aggregating error metrics like RMSE for multiple time series

With metrics like MAE, taking a mean is the last operation in calculating error values. So given a data set of values and forecasts for multiple series for many steps into the future, taking the mean twice is equivalent to just aggregating over the whole data set. However, the last operation of RMSE is a square root, which does not distribute over the inner mean. My question is simple: is it proper, in the case I've described, to consider the RMSE of each set of predictions as a whole, or to average the RMSEs of individual forecasts? Or are they both valid for, say, comparing two models? For example: Errors 0: 0, 1, 0, 0, -1 1: 1, 1, -1, -1, -1 2: 0, 0, 0, 8, 0 RMSE for whole data set ~= 2.1756 RMSE for each series: 0: 0.63 1: 1.00 2: 3.58 mean ~= 1.74
