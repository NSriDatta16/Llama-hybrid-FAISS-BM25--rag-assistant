I guess you'd have to move towards data augmentation techniques. Introductions are given in this rather old article by Van Dyk and Meng and more generally, but also from some time ago in Pigott's article on missing data . These could be good starting points for your literature research. The machine learning field is quite extensively covered on Wikipedia and reading up on expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm could also be a good starting point for you. This literature is quite varied, and some methods are well developed and incorporated in standard statistical software packages, while others are rather basic. Generally, the ideal method depends on the finer peculiarities of your data and the desired type of inference. So if you could provide more information on that part, people here will be more likely to provide specific help.
