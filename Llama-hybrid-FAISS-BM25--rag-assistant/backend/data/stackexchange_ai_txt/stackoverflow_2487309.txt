Build and test on 2.2.1 iPod Touch with Xcode 3.2.2?

I've just installed Xcode 3.2.2 with iPhone SDK 3.2 Beta 5 (Snow Leopard) This version of Xcode didn't come with any iPhone SDKs older than 3.0. But I want to create an app that runs on all devices from iPhone OS 2.2.1 -> 3.1.3. I managed to add older SDKs into Xcode by downloading iPhone 3.1.3 with Xcode 3.1.4 and installing each 2.x SDK from the 'Packages' folder in the .dmg. So now I can select 2.2.1 as 'iPhone OS Deployment Target' and the 'Base SDK' as 3.1.3, and the app will build (thus letting me use 3.1.3 APIs with conditional coding whilst still running on 2.2.1 devices). But the problem is the app will not install and run on my 2.2.1 iPod Touch. Instead, Xcode tells me 'No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected'. If I bring up the Organizer, in the left column, the iPod Touch has an orange sphere next to it, instead of green, and clicking on this reveals: 'The version of iPhone OS on “iPod touch” is too old for use with this version of the iPhone SDK. Please restore the device to a version of the OS listed below' I'm not sure how to get this version of the SDK to support 2.2.1. (It needs to be this download of Xcode/iPhone SDK because I also want it to be a universal binary so it runs on the iPad with a minimum of fuss).
