You definitely don't want to store data inside the gem directory. The expected behaviour is that users can uninstall and reinstall gems without any problems. If you have data in your gem's installed directory, uninstalling the gem will destroy that data and piss off your users. johannes has the right ideas for use on Linux. For a Mac the specific directories would be a little different. The same goes for Windows. You'll need to research what the right places are for each platform you want to target and have your code conditionally switch storage locations depending on what kind of host it runs on. Don't forget to let users override your defaults. A way to do that will make them very happy :)
