Is there a "File IO in Postscript for Dummies"?

Much of the code-golf played on Stack Overflow involved ASCII figures, and codegolf.SE is shaping up the same way. That's all well and good, but I'd like to inject a little variety into the output, and have written my recent question Output a playable crossword grid explicitly to encourage graphical format entries. To show willing, I've started trying to hack together a reference implementation in postscript. Alas, I'm completely new to the language, and am having trouble doing basic file IO. Does anyone know of a basic resource that covers the topic? I am aware of file (%stdin) token readstring readline but I am pretty unclear on exactly what the last three return and how one manipulates it after you've got it. I have figured out that several return a pair, and that I can use if to test the boolean. Then what?
