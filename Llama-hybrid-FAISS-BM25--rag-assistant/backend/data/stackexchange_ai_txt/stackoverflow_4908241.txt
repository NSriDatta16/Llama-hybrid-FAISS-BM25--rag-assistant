It sounds like you're attempting to create a polygonal representation of the boundary of the high land. If you're working with raster data (sampled on a rectangular grid), try this. Think of your grid as an assembly of right triangles. Let's say you have a 3x3 grid of points a b c d e f g h k Your triangles are: abd part of the rectangle abed bde the other part of the rectangle abed bef part of the rectangle bcfe cef the other part of the rectangle bcfe dge ... and so on Your algorithm has these steps. Build a list of triangles that are above the elevation threshold. Take the union of these triangles to make a polygonal area. Determine the boundary of the polygon. If necessary, smooth the polygon boundary to make your layer look ok when displayed. If you're trying to generate good looking contour lines, step 4 is very hard to to right. Step 1 is the key to this problem. For each triangle, if all three vertices are above the threshold, include the whole triangle in your list. If all are below, forget about the triangle. If some vertices are above and others below, split your triangle into three by adding new vertices that lie precisely on the elevation line (by interpolating elevation). Include the one or two of those new triangles in your highland list. For the rest of the steps you'll need a decent 2d geometry processing library. If your points are not on a regular grid, start by using the Delaunay algorithm (which you can look up) to organize your pointss in into triangles. Then follow the same algorith I mentioned above. Warning. This is going to look kind of sketchy if you don't have many points.
