DISCLAIMER: I strongly suggest reading @BalusC's answer. After reading the following caching tutorial: http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ (I recommend you read it, too), I believe it to be correct. However, for historical reasons (and because I have tested it myself), I will include my original answer below: I tried the 'accepted' answer for PHP, which did not work for me. Then I did a little research, found a slight variant, tested it, and it worked. Here it is: header('Cache-Control: no-store, private, no-cache, must-revalidate'); // HTTP/1.1 header('Cache-Control: pre-check=0, post-check=0, max-age=0, max-stale = 0', false); // HTTP/1.1 header('Pragma: public'); header('Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT'); // Date in the past header('Expires: 0', false); header('Last-Modified: '.gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s') . ' GMT'); header ('Pragma: no-cache'); That should work. The problem was that when setting the same part of the header twice, if the false is not sent as the second argument to the header function, header function will simply overwrite the previous header() call. So, when setting the Cache-Control , for example if one does not want to put all the arguments in one header() function call, he must do something like this: header('Cache-Control: this'); header('Cache-Control: and, this', false); See more complete documentation here .
