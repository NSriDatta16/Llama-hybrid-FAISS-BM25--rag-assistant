My company is using OpenCL for scientific calculations. While I'm not part of the development team which is using it I can tell you a few things they're using it to do: large scale data processing of images, imagine reconstruction, and massively parallelization of previously written scientific code. Basically, OpenCL is rather cutting edge. Unless you want to/have to deal with it, it's best left for those that need it. I'm not trying to discourage you but it is a niche product designed for a niche market. You'd be better served studying other areas of programming for potential employment purposes.
