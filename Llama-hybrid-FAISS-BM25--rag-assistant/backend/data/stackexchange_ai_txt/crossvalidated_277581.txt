Alas, there is nothing new under the sun! In this case I'd look up 'streaming Dirichlet process' or 'streaming nonparametric Bayes'. A streaming Dirichlet process model looks at a new data point and measures its fit to existing clusters. If it is too dissimilar to all the existing clusters then we may spawn a new cluster with the new data point as its first member. The average number of clusters is logarithmic in the number of datapoints.
