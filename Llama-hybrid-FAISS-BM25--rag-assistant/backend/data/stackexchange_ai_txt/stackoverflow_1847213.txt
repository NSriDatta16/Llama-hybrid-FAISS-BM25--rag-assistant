The Euclidean distance difference = sqrt(sqr(red1 - red2) + sqr(green1 - green2) + sqr(blue1 - blue2)) is the standard way to determine the similarity of two colours. However, if you have your colours in a simple list, then to find the nearest colour requires computing the distance from the new colour with every colour in the list. This is an O(n) operation. The sqrt() is an expensive operation, and if you're just comparing two distances then you can simply omit the sqrt() . If you have a very large palette of colours, it is potentially quicker to organise the colours into a kd tree (or one of the alternatives ) so as to reduce the number of diffreences that require computing.
