Covariance Matrix

Please excuse my ignorance here. It has been awhile since I have studied linear algebra. As far as I know, a covariance matrix is often written as COV = $\frac{1}{n-1}$ A $\cdot$ A$^T$. Is this the same thing as COV = $\frac{1}{n-1}$ A$^T$ $\cdot$ A ? The reason I ask, is this can be the difference between a massive matrix or a very small matrix (for Casorati style matrices). Ultimately, I am studying PCA, which uses the covariance matrix.
