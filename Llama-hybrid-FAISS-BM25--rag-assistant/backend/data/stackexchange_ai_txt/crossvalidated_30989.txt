Machine Learning and training time: is it really relevant?

I have a question regarding the time needed for training a classifier. I am facing the specific problem of Sentiment Analysis (classification of text as pos/neg/neu). (Excepting online learning algorithms) Since the training stage of a classifier is usually conducted only once and offline, in the end does it really matter how much time would it take for training ? If the classifier is to be trained over a mobile or a resource-constrained platform, reducing such training time would still make more sense, though... Thanks in advance.
