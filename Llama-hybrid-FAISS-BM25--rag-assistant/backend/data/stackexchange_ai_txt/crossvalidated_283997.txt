In addition, note that $$ \sigma(x)\{1-\sigma(x)\} = \frac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2} = \left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\right)' $$ Thus, integrating by part, $$ \int \sigma(x)\{1-\sigma(x)\}N(0,1)dx = \left[\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} N(0,1)(x)\right] - \int \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} N(0,1)' dx $$ The $[...]$ term equals 0. Then $$ N(0,1)' = - x N(0,1) $$ Finally, if my calculations are correct, your integral is $$ \int \frac{x}{1+e^{-x}}N(0,1)dx $$ Applying the Monte Carlo technique, generate $x_1,\ldots,x_n \sim N(0,1)$ and compute then average $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{x_i}{1+e^{-x_i}} $$ It might be more stable [not even sure], though pretty much equivalent to JohnK and GreenPaker's suggestions.
