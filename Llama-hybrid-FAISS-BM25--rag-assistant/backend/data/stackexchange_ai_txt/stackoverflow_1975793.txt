Modern client/server authentication techniques

I'm building a non-browser client-server (XULRunner-CherryPy) application using HTTP for communication. The area I'm pondering now is user authentication. Since I don't have substantial knowledge in security I would much prefer using tried-and-tested approaches and ready-made libraries over trying to invent and/or build something myself. I've been reading a lot of articles lately and I can say all I have been left with is a lot of frustration, most of which contributed by this and this blog posts. What I think I need is: Secure storage of passwords in the database (adaptive hashing?) Secure wire transmission of user credentials (digest authentication? SSL?) Secure token authentication for subsequent requests (not sure about this) So the question is: what are the modern (headache-free preferrably) techniques and/or libraries that implement this? (No sensitive information, like credit card numbers, will be stored). I've been looking at OAuth and they have a new revision which they strongly recommend to use. The problem is the docs are still in development and there are no libraries implementing the new revision (?).
