XML is often uses as a transport format between systems. In CSE I would guess that google is transferring a lot of data from them to you in a format that many systems can use. If they used MySQL it would be no use to me as I don't know anything about it. However, pretty much most modern software frameworks can work with XML. ADDITIONAL Also, CSE (Customised Search Engine) probably expects that you don't need to do a lot of manipulation to the XML, just transform if for rendering to a web page. You can very easily perform an XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) to an XML file to transform it in to an HTML fragment to use on your website.
