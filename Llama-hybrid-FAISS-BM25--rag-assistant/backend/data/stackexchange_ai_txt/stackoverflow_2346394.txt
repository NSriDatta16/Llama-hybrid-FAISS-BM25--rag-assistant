Should I use byte or int?

I recall having read somewhere that it is better (in terms of performance) to use Int32, even if you only require Byte. It applies (supposedly) only to cases where you do not care about the storage. Is this valid? For example, I need a variable that will hold a day of week. Do I int dayOfWeek; or byte dayOfWeek; EDIT : Guys, I am aware of DayOfWeek enum. The question is about something else.
