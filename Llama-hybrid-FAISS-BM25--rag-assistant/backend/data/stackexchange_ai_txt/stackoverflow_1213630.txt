You need to set the SMTP host to point to an actual SMTP server. One option is to run the SMTP service on your own machine, but you could also point to your ISP's server. edit As pcampbell and Skeolan mentioned, the actual value should go into app.config. I'm not sure if localhost would be an exception: it would depend on whether you want the option of not running a local server.
