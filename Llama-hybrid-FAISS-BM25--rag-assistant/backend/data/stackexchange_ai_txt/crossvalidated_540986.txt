How can you combine control variates with antithetic variates

Is there a benefit of combining control variates with antithetic variates and if so how should it be done ? In my specific case I would like to add control variates to the formulation in this paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02395 , section 2.1 . Briefly, the idea there is to use the antithetic variates to reduce the variance on the expected gradient of the return. At the same time, control variates is widely used for policy gradient algorithms. How can I benefit from both approaches ? My initial thought was to add a baseline to each of the antithetic variables.
