load balancing in php

I have a web service running written in PHP-MYSQL. The script involves fetching data from other websites like wikipedia,google etc. The average execution time for a script is 5 secs(Currently running on 1 server). Now I have been asked to scale the system to handle 60requests/second. Which of the approach should I follow. -Split functionality between servers (I create 1 server to fetch data from wikipedia, another to fetch from google etc and a main server.) -Split load between servers (I create one main server which round robin the request entirely to its child servers with each child processing one complete request. What about MYSQL database sharing between child servers here?)
