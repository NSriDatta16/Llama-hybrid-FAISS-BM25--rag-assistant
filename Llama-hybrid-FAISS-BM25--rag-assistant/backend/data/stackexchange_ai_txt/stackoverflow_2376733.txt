The other answers seem to be more elegant than this and they make me feel like more of a noob, however if you understand how to sort like this, you can sort any kind of list in any way without knowing much of anything. And there's no need to write a whole new class (though writing a comparer class can be useful if you sort other similar lists in other parts of your code). peopleList.Sort((x, y) => { int compare = x.FirstName.CompareTo(y.FirstName); if (compare != 0) return compare; compare = x.Rank.CompareTo(y.Rank); if (compare != 0) return compare; return x.LastName.CompareTo(y.LastName); });
