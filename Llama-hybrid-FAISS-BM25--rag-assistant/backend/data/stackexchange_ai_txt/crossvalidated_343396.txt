The prior probability $p(z)$ is defined to be a standard normal distribution, so sampling from that would be sufficient. The distribution of the latent space over images in your dataset as estimated by the network , $q(z) = q(z|x)f(x)$, is a different matter, but in a well-trained VAE, it should approach $p(z)$ -- because it is encouraged to by the KL-divergence loss. (where $f(x)$ is the density of your training data). However, unless you have some specific reason for wanting the latter, $p(z)$ is probably what you are looking for.
