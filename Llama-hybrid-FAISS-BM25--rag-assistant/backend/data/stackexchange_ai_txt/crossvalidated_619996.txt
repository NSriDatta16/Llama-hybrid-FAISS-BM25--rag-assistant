Estimation of Propensity Score using Random Forests

Suppose that one has a binary treatment $Z$ , and assume that $Z=1|X=x \sim Bern\left(e(x)\right)$ . Furthermore, suppose I want to estimate the propensity score by a random forest. Are there consistency and asymptotic results in this case and if so, what are the regularity conditions that are needed to achieve them?
