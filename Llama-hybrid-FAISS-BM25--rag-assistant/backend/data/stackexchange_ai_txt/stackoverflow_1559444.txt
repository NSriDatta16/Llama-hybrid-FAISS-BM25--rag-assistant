I would prefer using @Configuration annotation. @Override and super are more fragile. You can forget to call super.setup() , or call it in wrong place. Meanwhile, using separate method with @Configuration lets you to choose more appropriate naming for child setup method if necessary, and you get setup order guaranteed by TestNG (parent then child). Two more points: I'd make parent setup final in order to forbid accidental overriding. I'd use @BeforeMethod annotations. They are available since TestNG 5.0. Of course, for older versions you forced to using @Configuration .
