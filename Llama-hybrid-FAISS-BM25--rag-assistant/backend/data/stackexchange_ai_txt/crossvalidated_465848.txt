Should I use a ARDL if I have more than one cointegrating relationship?

I have a four time series variables. They are a mix of I(0) and I(1) variables. There is also more than one cointegrating relationship among the variables. If there is more than one cointegrating relationship among the variables, then should I use VECM rather than ARDL? Or, is there an alternative model that might better suit my purposes?
