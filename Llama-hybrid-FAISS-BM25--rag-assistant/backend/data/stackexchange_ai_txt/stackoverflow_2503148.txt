Performance logging tips

I am developing large data collecting ASP.Net/Windows service application-pair that uses Microsoft SQL Server 2005 through LINQ2Sql. Performance is always the issue. Currently the application is divided into multiple larger processing parts, each logging the duration of their work. This is not detailed and does not help us with anything. It would be nice to have some database tables that contain statistics that the application itself collected from its own behavior. What logging tips and data structures do you recommend to spot the parts that cause performance problems? Edit: Mostly I am looking for parts of the application that can cripple the whole system when excessively used. There are peaks during the day when some parts of the application are under heavy load. Some advanced logging would help me isolate the parts that need more attention and optimizing.
