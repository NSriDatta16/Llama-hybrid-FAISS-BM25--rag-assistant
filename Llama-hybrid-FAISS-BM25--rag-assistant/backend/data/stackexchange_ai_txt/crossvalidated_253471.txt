Let me explain you in steps on removing seasonality: Detect the trend: first find if the time series is additive or multiplicative Detrend the time series: this will expose seasonality. Average seasonality: from the detrend time series, itâ€™s easy to compute the average seasonality. We add the seasonality together and divide by the number of seasonality. If you are using R, there are two functions, decompose and stl , which help you do the above said. Often, the decomposition is used to removes the seasonal effect from a time series. It provided a cleaner way to understand the trend. Note 1: you can use the autocorrelation function to identify the seasonality (weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or yearly) Note 2: SARMA handles seasonality, read on it too.
