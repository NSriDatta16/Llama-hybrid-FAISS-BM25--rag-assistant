Enumeration with all elements of given Enumeration and intermitted other elements in LINQ

I have a function f() and an IEnumerable from which I want to create another IEnumerable so that for each string s in the original enumeration the new one has s and f(s) . The order of elements is important. Example: IEnumerable given = { "A", "B", "C" }; IEnumerable wanted = { "A", f("A"), "B", f("B"), "C", f("C") }; Is there a way to do this elegantly using LINQ? (And if not, what's the most elegant way to do this?)
