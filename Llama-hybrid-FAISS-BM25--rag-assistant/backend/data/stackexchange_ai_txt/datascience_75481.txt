Which loss function is the best loss function when using XGB regression with highly skewed dataset?

Which loss function is the best loss function when using XGB regression with a highly skewed dataset? The skewness of the data is very high. I used XGBoost with objective function of linear regression (but the data was transformed into the log space). It performed better than using gamma objective function. Any other suggestions?
