Best Practices - WPF Custom Control Library - Organizing files, folders and namespaces

So I have a WPF custom control library with a few controls. Some of the controls are quite complex and need multiple files stuffed into their own folders. Namespaces also imitate the folder structure, so I have namespaces like SomeControl.SomeControl etc. Some controls are trivial with just one file in the top level folder. I think its all really ugly but I don't know whats not! Any rule of thumbs when organizing a custom control library both folders and namespaces?
