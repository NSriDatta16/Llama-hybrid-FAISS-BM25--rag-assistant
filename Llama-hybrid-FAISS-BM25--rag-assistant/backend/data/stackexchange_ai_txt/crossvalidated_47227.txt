Drawing conclusion from fixed significance level or p-value in a two-sample test

This was an example done in class, However I was sick An experiment was performed to determine whether the average nicotine content of brand A cigarette exceeds that of brand B cigarette by 0.20 milligram. If 50 cigarettes of brand A had a sample mean of 2.61 milligrams whereas 40 brand B cigarettes had an average nicotine of 2.38 milligrams. The population standard deviations of the nicotine content for the two brands of cigarettes are known to be 0.12 and 0.14 for brand A and B, respectively. (a) Based on a significance level of 5%, what can you conclude about the difference between the two brands of cigarettes? (b) Base on a pâˆ’value, what can you conclude about the difference between the two brands of cigarettes? My Attempt: (a) $H_{0} :\mu_{A}-\mu_{B} =0.2$ $H_{1} :\mu_{A}-\mu_{B} \ne 0.2$ Significance Level : $\alpha = 0.05$ Rejection Region : $|z| >1.96$ Test Statistic : $ z = \frac{2.61-2.38 -0.2}{\sqrt{\frac{0.12^2}{50}+\frac{0.14^2}{40}}} =1.08$ Conclusion : Since $ 1.08 I really need Help with B
