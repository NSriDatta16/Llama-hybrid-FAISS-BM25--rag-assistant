Is using samples from the same person in both trainset and testset considers being a data leakage?

Suppose a neural network is built for a binary classification problem such as recognize the face as a smiley face or not, by using a dataset of 1000 persons and each person has ten images of his face. If the dataset randomly spilt into trainset and testset by a ratio of 70:30, in this case, there is a big chance face image of same persons will be used in both the trainset and testset, so is this considered to be data leakage (train-test contamination)?
