What is bucketization?

I've been going around to find a clear explanation of "bucketization" in machine learning with no luck. What I understand so far is that bucketization is similar to quantization in digital signal processing where a range of continous values is replaced with one discrete value. Is this correct? What are the pros and cons (besides the obvious impact of losing information) of applying bucketization? Are there any rules of thumb on how to apply bucketization? Are there any guidelines/algorithms for applying bucketization ahead of applying machine learning?
