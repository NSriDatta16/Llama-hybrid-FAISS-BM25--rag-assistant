What makes a good options/settings dialog box?

I was browsing the Worst UI Youâ€™ve Ever Used question, when I realized that many of them involved the options dialog of some application. This is obviously an area where a developer could get "lost" easily, since there are often a large number of options available which can be hard to organize. (Especially to the stereotypical programmer) So since I'm getting ready to design an options dialog for my own application, I was wondering: what makes a good options dialog? Tabs? A hierarchical treeview like Visual Studio that sort of acts like tabs? (I'm currently leaning toward this) What do you think?
