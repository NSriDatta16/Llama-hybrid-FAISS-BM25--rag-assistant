In my opinion yes, this is a bad practice. Unit testing is meant to test implementation of your code, not really to influence it. In some cases I've found it practical to organize my code/methods in a manner to make it more easily/thoroughly tested, but writing code in a class being tested for specific use in testing is a different story.
