Why are there .sln, .suo and .csproj files?

I began to use Visual Studio 2010. After I'm done with the C# program, I see that there are .sln , and .suo files in the project root directory, and a .csproj file in the subdirectory. What are those files for? I need to identify the files to put into a Git repository. Together with the source code/documents that I create, I guess those three files are the only one that I have to take care of. However, I'm not sure if I'm tracking the correct files. ADDED How about the personal macro files? I have the Emacs key switch macro , does the .sln file or .csproj file have this macro?
