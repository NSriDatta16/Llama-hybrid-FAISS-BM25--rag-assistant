Beware of adding difficult-to-compare indicators Treating your variable as an ordinal assumes both that each decision has equal weight (local apple is equivalent to local grape even if the latter is 4 times the price and the former has 2 times the reduction in environmental impact by purchasing locally) and yet that the difference between 3 local choices and 2 is not comparable to the difference between 2 local choices and 1. This is a strange combination. Use metrics and weight your data I would suggest determining variables that matches what you really want to study - some function of (differences in) price or environmental impact for instance - and making use of those variables. This will give the decisions made by your participants the appropriate weight and scale appropriately to future tasks. If you have very few items and they are offered to all participants then modelling them separately as suggested by Bj√∂rn will make the most of your data. Alternative approach which may be more informative to your research question - pivot to decision-level rather than participant-level modelling I guess your research question is about whether people choose to purchase greener versions of products. You're looking at this from a 'person' perspective - would you be better served by analysing from a 'decision' perspective? I suggest a more informative model here might be price of local item, environmental impact of local item, price of remote item, environmental impact of remote item (other item characteristics as you present to the participant) and participant characteristics predicting whether the choice is made to take a local item or not. That gives you a binary variable for which you could use logistic regression. The resulting model has much higher generalisability to other items, which you could test through offering other people other shopping tasks.
