You can also access resources by name, which may be a viable approach to solving your problem if you know the names of the resources or can derive them according to some pre-defined naming scheme. You have to map the name to the identifier using the getIdentifier method of the Resources class. String name = "resource" + rng.nextInt(count); int resource = getResources().getIdentifier(name, "drawable", "com.package"); The documentation for this method says: Note: use of this function is discouraged. It is much more efficient to retrieve resources by identifier than by name. This is true but need not be a problem if you are doing it in code that isn't performance sensitive. Alternatively, if you don't mind listing the resources in XML, you could create a typed array that you can then randomly select from.
