When training the model on 2 million and 3 million samples respectively, using n_estimators=3 ... Tim's answer hits the nail on the head. See Do we have to tune the number of trees in a random forest? for some discussion. Three trees will produce an ensemble with a very large variance, which is to say that there will be large variations in the model quality between alternative runs. You can verify this with a simple experiment: construct a holdout partition and fit several random forests with n_estimators=3 and then several random forests with n_estimators=1000 . You'll find that the distribution of model statistics as measured by the holdout set will have a higher variance when n_estimators=3 than n_estimators=1000 . I further inspected my dataset and found out that about 2% of the samples had very large outliers which were created in the process of generating the dataset. After removing those outliers not only did the MAE go way down, the above described behavior also did not reoccur. If anybody is willing to explain why and how big outliers result in such behavior, I am happy to except their answer. The prediction of a single leaf of a random forest regression model is the average of the training samples in that node. If one of those samples is orders of magnitude larger in absolute value than the others, then the mean will obviously be sensitive to that single observation. Moreover, the fewer samples in the terminal nodes, the larger this effect will be. For a fixed amount of training data, increasing the number of nodes in the tree will tend to decrease the number of samples in each leaf, so the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a leaf will tend to have a larger variance. Another way to ameliorate this phenomenon is to set a minimum leaf size. This will force each leaf to have at least $k$ samples in it. Whenever this $k$ is larger than a leaf size when you are not setting this parameter, the sample mean of a leaf will be less sensitive to any single observation. It's important to note that whether or not deleting outliers is a good strategy depends on what problem you're trying to solve. We have several threads on this topic such as Is it OK to remove outliers from data?
