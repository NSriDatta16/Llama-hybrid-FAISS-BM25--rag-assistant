From some of the same authors, there is another book focused more on the intuition and practicalities than the the math: Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2009).

Springer Verlag. https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/ Efron and Hastie also have a great book that is doable even if you skip over the math: Efron, B., & Hastie, T. (2016). Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science. Cambridge University Press.
