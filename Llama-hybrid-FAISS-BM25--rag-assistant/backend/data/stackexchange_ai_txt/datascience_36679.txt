Let's take the total Turing test as an example. A computer is often said to be intelligent if it can pass the total Turing test. A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. The total Turing Test also includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass physical objects "through the hatch." To pass the total Turing Test, the computer would need to possess the following capabilities: natural language processing to enable it to communicate successfully in English; knowledge representation to store what it knows or hears; automated reasoning to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions; robotics to manipulate objects and move about; computer vision to perceive objects, and machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns. As you may already see, Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that concerns with the ability of an intelligent agent to learn .
