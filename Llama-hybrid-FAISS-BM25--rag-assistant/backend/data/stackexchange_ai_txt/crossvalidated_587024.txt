You can use emmeans() directly with bootstrap results by inputting them into emmobj() as posterior samples. Here is a simple example with three independent samples of somewhat unequal size generated from Cauchy distributions. library(emmeans) set.seed(08.28) # Cauchy samples with medians 12, 15, 14 resp. dat = list(rt(50, 1) + 12, rt(60, 1) + 15, rt(50, 1) + 14) boot = replicate (200, sapply(dat, function(x) { y = sample(x, length(x), replace = TRUE) median(y) })) # each column is a set of 3 medians. Need them to be the rows boot = t(boot) # frequentist estimates -- won't actually be used means = apply(boot, 2, mean) V = cov(boot) # marginal means EMM = emmobj(means, V, levels = LETTERS[1:3], post.beta = boot) summary(EMM) ## level estimate lower.HPD upper.HPD ## A 12.1 11.6 12.5 ## B 15.0 14.7 15.3 ## C 13.9 13.7 14.6 ## ## Point estimate displayed: median ## HPD interval probability: 0.95 summary(pairs(EMM)) ## contrast estimate lower.HPD upper.HPD ## A - B -2.96 -3.445 -2.38 ## A - C -1.92 -2.730 -1.35 ## B - C 1.05 0.369 1.54 ## ## Point estimate displayed: median ## HPD interval probability: 0.95 Created on 2022-08-28 by the reprex package (v2.0.1) Note the medians of the medians do come close to the true values used in the simulation; and of course so do the differences. Note I used the median as the estimator in the bootstrap. I strongly encourage you to not use the mean there, which is a poor estimator when you have heavy tails.
