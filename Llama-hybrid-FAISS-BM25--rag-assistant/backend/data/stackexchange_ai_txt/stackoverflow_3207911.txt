First you need to register your scene to receive touch events. So set self.isTouchEnabled = YES in the scene's -(id)init method. Then add a method to the scene to register the touch dispatcher. - (void)registerWithTouchDispatcher { [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES]; } The get the location from the UITouch when the the scene gets a ccTouchBegan:withEvent: message. - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:[touch view]]; location = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL:location]; } Finally, you can test the touched location against the label's position by looking at the label's bounding box. if (CGRectContainsPoint([label boundingBox], location)) { // The label is being touched. }
