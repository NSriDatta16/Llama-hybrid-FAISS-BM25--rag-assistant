The best approach is to use a model that respects the non-negativity of your outcome variable. For example, if you are modeling probabilities, use logistic regression, not a linear regression with the probability as the outcome. If you are modeling counts, use a Poisson or negative binomial regression. If your values are all strictly positive, try modeling the logarithm of the values or using a generalized linear model with a logarithmic link.
