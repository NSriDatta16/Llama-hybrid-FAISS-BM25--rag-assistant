Learning from distance matrices

I have a task to build multi-task classification model based on distance (similarity) matrix only . They are already precalculated and no changes here can be applied. Can you, please, recommend me where to look for more? articles, packages? any approach that start from distance matrix and set of classes? I tried to do that with kNN via approach mentioned in this question , but results are not very satisfactory. I would be glad to use SVM-like and/or ANN-like algorithm. They are mostly better than kNN.
