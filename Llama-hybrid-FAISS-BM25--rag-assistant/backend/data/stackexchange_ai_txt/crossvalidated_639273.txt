Can I use an autoregressive (AR1) model to determine if longitudinal data can be treated as individual single time points?

I am currently in a position where I have two datasets, one consisting of longitudinal data collected at 4 different time points, and another consisting of only single time points (e.g. data collected at the first time point only, and data collected at the second time point only etc.). It has come to my attention that I may not have enough statistical power using only the single time point data, but if I were to combine the single time point dataset with the longitudinal dataset, I may have enough power. The concern I have is that this is a ill-advised procedure given that one is repeated measurements over time, and the other is not. The classic concerns regarding the repeated measurements is that the repeated exposure to the experimental condition would have skewed the measured responses not observed in the single time point dataset. From a statistical standpoint, the repeated measures means that the data is not independent as one subject could have multiple observations at different time points, and so their individual subject variability plays a larger role in the model being made on the longutuidnal dataset. This feature would not be observed in the single time point dataset. However, I have read about Autoregressive models (AR1) and I was wondering if AR1 models can be used to determine whether the repeated measures dataset (longitudinal dataset) can be treated as individual single time points since my understanding of AR1 models is that it can determine how well a past timepoint can predict the current one (given a t-1 observation, how well it predicts the t-th observation). If the AR1 model shows that there is no dependency (or low predictive ability), does that mean I can interpret that the longitudinal dataset can be essentially treated as single time point dataset (with regards to how the repeated exposure per subject has no effect)?
