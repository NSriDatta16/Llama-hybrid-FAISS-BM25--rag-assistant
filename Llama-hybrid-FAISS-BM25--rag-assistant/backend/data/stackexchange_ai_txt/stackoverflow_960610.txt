There is also an asp.net silverlight control... Details here... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc838274(VS.95).aspx so depending on your code you could display asp.net stuff or the silverlight control which itself takes care of the silverlight stuff... you can also pass values (parameters) into the silverlight control as well as use the bridge to talk from silverlight to the html... http://jesseliberty.com/2008/12/26/passing-parameters-into-silverlight-applications/ http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/SilverlightHtmlBlend.aspx
