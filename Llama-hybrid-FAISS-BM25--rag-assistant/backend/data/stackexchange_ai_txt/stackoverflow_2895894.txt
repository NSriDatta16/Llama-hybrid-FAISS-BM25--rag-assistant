jQuery UI - Draggable is not a function?

I've trying to use the draggable effect on some divs on a page, but whenever I load the page, I get the error message: Error: $(".draggable").draggable is not a function I've had a look around it seemed other people were having this problem as they had not included the jQuery UI javascript file, but I definitely have. The following is within the head tag of my page: Can anyone suggest a solution? Any advice appreciated. Thanks. Quick edit, I also have the jquery tools js included in the head of the page, if I remove this it works OK. Has anyone managed to get these two working together?
