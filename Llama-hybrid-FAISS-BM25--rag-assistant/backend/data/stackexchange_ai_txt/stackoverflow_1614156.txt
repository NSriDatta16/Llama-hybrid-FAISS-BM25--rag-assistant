MenuKey functionality in OSX 10.5 and 10.6?

I have an OLD mac C/C++ program that I'm maintaining. It's still based on rsrc files and OS 9 system calls. (Yes, yes, I know. I'm TRYING to drag my company into the 21st century, but the other engineer is still using OSX10.3.9! please pity me) I'm trying to get modifier shortcut functionality. Cmd-S works, for example. However, Opt-Cmd-S blinks the "File" menu, but doesn't do anything, UNLESS the file menu is already open. I've looked through my code, and found that I'm taking the event message and passing it to MenuKey to tell me what menu option the key combo represents. However, MenuKey is always returning 0 if there are more than one modifier pressed. I see from the apple documentation that this has been deprecated, but I'd rather not have to re-write the entire program just yet to move to nibs and so forth. So, does anyone have a quick and dirty work around? thanks.
