A common misconception of t-test is that the distribution of the variable you are looking at should be normal; however, the assumption actually is that the mean of that distribution should be normally distributed. This is the case for any situation in which the central limit theorem can be applied, and the central limit theorem gives you a normal distribution under the assumption you are averaging iid. random variables, and that you have a defined variance. From what I understand, this should be your real concern, to check if your distribution of option prices is heavy-tailed. If so, and the exponent is below 2, then you don't have a well-defined variance, and the mean will be Levy-stable distributed, so you couldn't use the t-test.
