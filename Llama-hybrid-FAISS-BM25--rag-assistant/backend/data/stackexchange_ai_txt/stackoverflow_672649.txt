Infragistics UltraGrid: LoadOnDemand feature not working properly

I'm using the Infragistics Windows Ultragrid, version 7.3. I'm trying to use an UltraDataSource along with the LoadOnDemand mode. I have three bands defined: root, child and grandchild. When I click on the first row, it requests the data for the child band but also requests the grandchildren rows under the first child. Why does it happen? I believed those items shouldn't be requested unless I click on the child band.
