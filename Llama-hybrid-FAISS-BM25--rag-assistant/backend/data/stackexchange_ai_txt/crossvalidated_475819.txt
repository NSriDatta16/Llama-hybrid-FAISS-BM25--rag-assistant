Weights define the model. They are not the only element that defines the model, but for models like neural networks, linear, or logistic regression, they are the basic building blocks. So if hyperparameter tuning didn’t affect the weights, it would not impact the model, so it’d do nothing. You want your model to change after tuning, so you expect the weights to change. Same about the other question, hyperparameters affect parameters, and the other way around. That is the reason why you need the train set for learning the parameters, validation set for tuning hyperparameters, and test set for testing the final model. If hyperparameters were independent of weights, we wouldn’t need to bother, and could just use train set for learning both.
