Forecasting after bayesian Estimation

As a beginner in Bayesian estimation I believe I have made progress on the understanding of the estimation process. However, after the estimation and evaluation/comparison of the models I find myself stuck in the understanding of the forecasting issue. For example, I estimate a simple linear regression model ,like this one: $Y_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_t + \epsilon$, by various methods: OLS regression,median regression and Bayesian Methods. Now comes my question: In the Bayesian literature IÂ´ve have seen several interesting ways to do the forecasting, for example, i could put in a framework of dynamic linear models. However, I wonder how can I do a simple exercise of forecasting without resorting to dynamic linear models. In fact, I would like to understand the passage from the Bayesian estimation to forecasting exercises. In my mind, i would have to "forecast" the posteriors distribution for each time, t, t=1,2,3,4.., 10. But then others doubts comes to my mind. Could you help me? Thanks a lot.
