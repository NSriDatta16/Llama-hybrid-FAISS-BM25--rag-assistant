No, you are not right to include those again, and it doesn't have anything to do with sample size. Often, it is easy to fit bad data well. But then you are taking advantage of particular qualities of your data that will (probably) not work in the population you are inferring to (and if you aren't inferring, why do inferential statistics?) You do not want to include points that influence the model unduly. See Anscombe's Quartet for examples with correlation; the point is the same with regression (including logistic regression). It seems like there are problems with your model, but it's impossible to say what they are without a lot more info. It might just be that your theory is wrong.
