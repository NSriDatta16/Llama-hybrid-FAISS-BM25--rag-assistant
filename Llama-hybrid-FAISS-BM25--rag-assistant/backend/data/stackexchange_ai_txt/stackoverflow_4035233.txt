Rather than re-invent the wheel, I'd suggest you have a long look at DokuWiki. Not only does it provide a very simple method for embedding PHP within Wiki apges (I've built several applications relying on just this) its easy to extend and the rendering engine is easy to embed into your own code. An easy way to use the rendering engine is to just write your app as a DokuWiki template .
