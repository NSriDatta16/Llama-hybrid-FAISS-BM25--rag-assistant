Although the previous answers cover a lot to get you started in Reinforcement Learning (RL) field, I give you here an illustrative simple example to understand the concept and also what is the relationship between Supervised Learning (SL) and Unsupervised Learning (UL). Imagine that you have a robot and you want to teach it to drive a car. Every let's say image of the road that the robot receives is going to be an input. One option that you have, in order to teach the robot, is that you can instruct it EVERY time that it receives the image of the road how much to steer the wheel. This is SL as you will have for every input state of the road a mapping to the proper angle of rotating the wheel. The main point here is that you know what is the optimal thing for your robot to do and you teach it by examples. In a RL setting, you just let the robot try whatever it wants and you give it a reward/punishment regarding the action(s) it takes. The magnitude of the reward/punishment might be dependent on e.g. damage to the car, staying long time on the same lane etc. the reward/punishment might be given delayed and not at every single action that the robot takes. In the first example (SL) the robot tries to minimize the error between your recommendation and its choices. In the second example the robot tries to maximize its reward by finding on its own what is the best to do. The SL approach at its best will lead you to a robot that "mimimcs" what you taught it. In the RL approach at its best, the robot will have a behavior that will be optimal in terms of driving the car and also might be better than yours. In other words it will create its own strategy. To sum up,in SL you have a teacher that tells you at every single timestep exactly whats the correct response. In RL you try and find it on your own and the teacher gives you a reward/punishment. In UL you dont have any external feedback. So RL falls between SL and RL. I simplified lots of the terms just to conceptualize the learning techniques with the example. Hope it helps!
