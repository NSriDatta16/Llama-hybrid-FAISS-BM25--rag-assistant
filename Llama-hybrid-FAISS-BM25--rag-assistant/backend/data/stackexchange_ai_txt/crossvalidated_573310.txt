I am not sure what the notion of "jumps" refers to and how irregular they can be. For what follows, I simply presume that each of your $m$ price time series $x_t^{(i)}, i=1,\ldots, m$ is sufficiently well behaved such that time series predictions are possible. So my suggestion is to learn a time series model for each of your prices (e.g. ARIMA) and to obtain a prediction distribution $p_t^{(i)}(x)$ for each of them. Thus, you get a time-varying family of $m$ prediction distributions. Next, for each price $x^{(i)}(t)$ , you check the ratio $\chi_t(i)$ between the largest value $p_t^{(k)}(x_t^{(i)})$ for $k=1,\ldots,m$ and the value $p_t^{(i)}(x_t^{(i)})$ : $$ \begin{align} k^\ast_t(i) &:= argmax_k\{p_t^{(k)}(x_t^{(i)})\}\\ \chi_t(i) &:= \frac{p_t^{(k^\ast_t(i))}(x_t^{(i)})}{p_t^{(i)}(x_t^{(i)})}. \end{align} $$ The ratio $\chi_t(i)$ is then your outlier score. If $k_t^\ast(i) = i$ , then $\chi_t(i) = 1$ , otherwise it is larger than $1$ . You now have to choose a threshold for this score above which an outlier alarm should be triggered.
