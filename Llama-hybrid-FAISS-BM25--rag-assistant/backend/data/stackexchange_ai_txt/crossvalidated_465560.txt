Visualize data in a 2D or 3D space is a good application of dimension reduction algorithms, but the algorithms can have other advantages. Intuitively, many real world data contain "redundant" information, and people want to remove them and have a cleaner view on data, and build a simpler model. For example, some real world data may record one people's highlight in different unit, but they are the same thing. Using feature selection algorithms can greatly reduce the computation and system complexity in later stage. Simpler system will be easier/cheaper to build and maintain. In general, many people like simple system and explanations that can do similar work. For example, if I have two systems, one is a simpler linear model, another is a complicated neural network that uses GPU for computation, both of them have ~80% "accuracy". Most people will chose the linear model.
