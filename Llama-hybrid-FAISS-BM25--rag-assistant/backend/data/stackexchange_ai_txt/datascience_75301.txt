No. The deep learning community is overwhelmingly using Python as a language. PyTorch (maintained by Facebook) and Tensorflow (maintained by Google) are the main two frameworks. Since both frameworks are ultimately bindings on top of C++ code, it is pretty difficult to beat the performance that they give you. R has some neural network packages, and so does Java and Julia, and I am sure other languages do too. But there is simply no reasonable evidence why you shouldn't use Python for deep learning. I can only see two valid reasons to not use Python for deep learning: You don't have a choice and have to use another language You are capable of writing a numerically stable, hardware accelerated, deep learning framework from scratch in the language of your choice. Also, you don't really need to "code" neural networks anymore. Frameworks do the heavy lifting for you. They have optimized implementations of pretty much everything you'd want to create the neural network you want.
