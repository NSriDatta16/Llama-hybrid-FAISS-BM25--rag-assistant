How can I delete picture programmatically in Android?

I wrote some code that lets me save pictures in my data/data in Android internal storage. Now I would like to know if there is a way to delete those pictures from internal storage. Here is what I have for saving: public boolean saveImg( String showId ) { try { URL url = new URL(getImgUrl( showId )); File file = new File(showId + ".jpg"); /* Open a connection to that URL. */ URLConnection ucon = url.openConnection(); //Define InputStreams to read from the URLConnection. InputStream is = ucon.getInputStream(); BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(is); //Read bytes to the Buffer until there is nothing more to read(-1). ByteArrayBuffer baf = new ByteArrayBuffer(50); int current = 0; while ((current = bis.read()) != -1) { baf.append((byte) current); } //Convert the Bytes read to a String. FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(PATH+file); fos.write(baf.toByteArray()); fos.close(); return true; } catch (IOException e) { return false; } } I tried this but it doesn't delete from data/data. Any suggestions as to what I'm doing wrong? public void DeleteImg(String showId) { File file = new File( PATH + showId +".jpg" ); file.delete(); }
