I run a vendor's app like this at work. They didn't design for it, but it works without an issue. I have all the shortucts pointing to the UNC path. This particular app doesn't use files in the exe directory, so file locking isn't an issue. Its also hooked up to SQL Server for the data, so the data store isn't an issue either. (Would be a major problem if the app used a local SQLite, Access, or some other file based DB.) If your app is a .Net app, this WILL NOT work without some major modifications to each machine's security settings, which is probably bad idea anyway. If you're talking about a .Net app, you should use ClickOnce. I use it for a few apps at work, as well, and it's great, and easy to use. The problem is there isn't a definitive answer to your question, just a bunch of "it depends" qualifications. The big issues, AFAIK, are using local files for data storage, be they text files or databases. It is awesome for updates, though, which is why the app mentioned above is run like this.
