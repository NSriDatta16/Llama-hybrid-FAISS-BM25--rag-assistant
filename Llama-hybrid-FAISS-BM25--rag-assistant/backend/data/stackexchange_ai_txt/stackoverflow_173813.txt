Should exceptions be in a different project

When structuring a visual studio solution I tend to structure it so that various components are in different project (As I would assume most people do) I tend to have a bunch of User defined exceptions. The Question is should these exceptions be in a separate project to the (for example) Model classes? I tend to put them in a sub-namespace of the model, and organise them in a directory within the Model project. but should they be in a separate project all together?
