You're confusing the concept with the implementation. A domain-specific language is any representation of an idea that is considered "close" to the problem domain, rather than being a general language for the description of solving problems in general. Yes, a DSL might be implemented as an API, which provided functions that referred to particular concepts in the problem domain, but a DSL is equally valid when represented as a text file. The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master contains a good description of DSLs and the circumstances in which they're useful, with examples. Highly recommended.
