In this case it'd be helpful to know more about i) the nature of the consumption data, what are included and how were they collected? ii) if any states change their taxation status across the 6 years, or do all of them show either all six years of 1, or all six years of 0? If you do have some switching over, then perhaps interrupted time series regression could be one of the options. It uses each state as its own control, and examines if the regression slope changes before and after the implementation. (You may need to center the year at implementation for each state, so that year 0 is the year of implementation.) The main concern I'm seeing is that right now: there are only about 20 states that have legalized marijuana. And in the last 6 years, even if you have some states switching over, the sample size is likely very low. It may be better to first identify which states, and then download the corresponding years of BRFSS data from CDC, and create a bigger individual level data.
