Hey ,everybody(just only two people) I have found the problem is my library path is not right The compile classpath is right but the runtime classpath is wrong in eclipse Although I do not know how the case My solution is add .jar file under the project directly instead of creating an user library(which includes .jar file) and add it to project So,the youtubesample can run on android but you need to pay attention to classpath settings
