Which GUI framework to learn when you know scripting and HCI

I have some knowledge about Human computer interaction and some basic knowledge programming scripts (Python) that run from start to finish and automate some tasks I want to do or calculations. In the past I built interfaces in HTML with PHP behind it. I would like my python scripts to evolve from the command line and build some applications with GUIs that would allow the user to drag files and push buttons to initiate operations and check progress graphically. Since I write my scripts in Python I looked at some of the options (Tkinter, wxPython, PyQt) but I can't make a decision between them to invest my time learn one and not the other. My criteria: Has a introduction for programmers for GUI (what are the differences from a script, examples of some simple interfaces) A framework that would allow me to run my programs on the platforms I use most (Windows) but that can also run on Mac and maybe Linux, without too much modification. Very shallow learning curve (easy to make first interfaces) but flexibility later on to customize the interface beyond what the typical OS allows (different colors, size and shapes of buttons, for example) If not the same, similar to how you program GUI for Android and/or Nokia smartphones. I'm planning to write some programs for these platforms in the near future so I would like to carry over some of the lessons here onto those platforms, if possible. I did find this previous question but none of the answers are satisfactory. Does any of the frameworks fit these requirements better than the others or are they essentially similar and I would be happy with any of them? Note: If you think I should consider other language rather than Python to achieve this, which one? I really like Python whitespace syntax and have grown used to it so I would prefer to stick with it.
