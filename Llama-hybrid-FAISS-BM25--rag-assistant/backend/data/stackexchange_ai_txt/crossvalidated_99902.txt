Which distribution to use to model web page read time?

I have a function that returns an average wait time for a web user. That is, it gives an average time that an average user may stay on a web page, given the web resource length in words. I want to use this function (and the resulting average) in conjunction with a distribution to model an 'average web user' browsing the web. Which distribution(s) might be appropriate for this, and why? Edit: I would also like to particularly know the viability of using an exponential distribution for this purpose. Thank you
