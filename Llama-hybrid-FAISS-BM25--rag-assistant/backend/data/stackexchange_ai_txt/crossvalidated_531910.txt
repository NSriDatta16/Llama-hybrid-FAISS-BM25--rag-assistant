Most methods, if they make a normality assumption; (1) Do it for inference, not prediction (machine learning) (2) Make the assumption about the error term, not the pooled distribution of the y-values (3) Definitely do not make the assumption about a predictor variable, which your histogram's x-axis suggests. If you do want to examine a normality assumption (it probably matters little for your task), you would plot the residuals of a model.
