The Pragmatic Programmers discuss tell, don't ask . You don't want to know about the entity, you want it to be drawn. Tell it to draw itself on the given Graphics. You could refactor the code above so that the entity does the drawing, which is useful if the entity isn't a rectangle but actually a circle. void Entity::draw(Graphics g) { g.drawRect(x,y, width, height); } You'd then check that g had the correct methods called on it in your tests.
