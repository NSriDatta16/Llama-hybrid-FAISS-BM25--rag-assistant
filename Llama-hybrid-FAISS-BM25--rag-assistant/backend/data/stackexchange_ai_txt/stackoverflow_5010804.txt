Incremental update of millions of records

I have a table that contains approx 10 million rows. This table is periodically updated (few times a day) by an external process. The table contains information that, if not in the update, should be deleted. Of course, you don't know if its in the update until the update has finished. Right now, we take the timestamp of when the update began. When the update finishes, anything that has an "updated" value less than the start timestammp is wiped. This works for now, but is problematic when the updater process crashes for whatever value - we have to start again with a new timestamp value. It seems to be that there must be something more robust as this is a common problem. Any advice?
