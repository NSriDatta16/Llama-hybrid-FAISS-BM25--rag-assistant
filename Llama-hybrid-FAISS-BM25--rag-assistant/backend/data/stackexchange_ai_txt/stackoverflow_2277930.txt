Pretty sure that I've figured it out so I'll post the process here for others to look at: Step 1) Start with your empty View like this: (source: jamespwright.com ) Step 2) Add a UILabel Control to your View: (source: jamespwright.com ) Step 3) Select "File's Owner": (source: jamespwright.com ) Step 4) Select the Identity Inspector (CMD + 4) and add a new Class Outlet: (source: jamespwright.com ) Step 5) Select the Connections Inspector (CMD + 2) and you should see your new Class Outlet there: (source: jamespwright.com ) Step 6) Drag the connection to your Label on your View. Step 7) Inside your code you populate it by typing myLabel.Text = "My Label!" Hopefully that will help someone else out in the future.
