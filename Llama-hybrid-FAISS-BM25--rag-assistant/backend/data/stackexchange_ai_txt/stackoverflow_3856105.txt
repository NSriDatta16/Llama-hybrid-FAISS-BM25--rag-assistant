Adopting the fix by Apple in iPhoneCoreDataRecipes in version 1.2, the proper thing to do is to replace // Reloading the section inserts a new row and ensures that titles are updated appropriately. [tableView reloadSections:[NSIndexSet indexSetWithIndex:newIndexPath.section] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade]; with [tableView insertRowsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObject:newIndexPath] withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationFade]; (FileMerge is your friend!) Note, there's another fix in version 1.2 that prevents erratic crashing when creating new entries. I had reported this and it was fixed within two weeks. I encourage you to file bug reports with Apple. They're far more responsive than you think, and you can expect to get the best possible fix.
