I got round the problem by removing the dll reference from the C++ project references and using #using "my_managed.dll" in a single cpp file (the only one that refers to the dll). Then the compiler warned me that it was unable to import some ADOX symbols from the dll because they had already been defined (by the #import ... ) but because they were only warnings I could use a #pragma to turn them off and ignore them. Now everything works!
