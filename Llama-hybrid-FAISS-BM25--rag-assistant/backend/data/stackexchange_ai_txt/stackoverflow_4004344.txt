This kind of indentation is useful when someone reads the code, but it is quite up to you to decide. My answer is don't use it, you will save some time, and you really want to use it, make some text editor that does it, or maybe do yourself some compiler that interpret printed html code, because it's worthless to do it on a text file, which I'll remind you, is a plain long line of bytes reorganized with tabs, space and return carriages.
