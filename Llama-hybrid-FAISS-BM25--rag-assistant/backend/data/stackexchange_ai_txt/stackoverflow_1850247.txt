Adding Link Column to ASP.NET GridView

I want to output a list of news headlines that are clickable. So far I can get it to print out a list of headlines because I dragged and dropped the NewsHeadline table in designer view in VS 2010. How do you think I should the make the list elements clickable? I looked for a URL attribute but I did not see it. Do I need to wrap in a " ProviderName=" " SelectCommand="SELECT [NewsHeadline] FROM [NewsTable]">
