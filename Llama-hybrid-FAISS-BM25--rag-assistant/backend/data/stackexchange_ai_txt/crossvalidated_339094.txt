I found this answer by Anil-Sharma on Quora helpful. We can divide the whole network (for classification) into two parts: Feature extraction : In the conventional classification algorithms, like SVMs, we used to extract features from the data to make the classification work. The convolutional layers are serving the same purpose of feature extraction. CNNs capture better representation of data and hence we donâ€™t need to do feature engineering. Classification : After feature extraction we need to classify the data into various classes, this can be done using a fully connected (FC) neural network. In place of fully connected layers, we can also use a conventional classifier like SVM. But we generally end up adding FC layers to make the model end-to-end trainable.
