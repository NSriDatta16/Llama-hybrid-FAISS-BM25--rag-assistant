The most reliable solution is to simply let another application, possibly connected to your plugin via some IPC mechanism, do that Apple : Avoid creating windows. The intent is for plug-ins to operate within the browser window. Although some plug-ins have historically done so, creating windows in your plug-in is not recommended. If you need to maintain separate windows, you should consider starting a separate application. Bringing up windows from a plugin might work in some circumstances and completely break in different ones. By recommending against doing so Apple is at liberty to break your previously working behaviour whenever it wishes to.
