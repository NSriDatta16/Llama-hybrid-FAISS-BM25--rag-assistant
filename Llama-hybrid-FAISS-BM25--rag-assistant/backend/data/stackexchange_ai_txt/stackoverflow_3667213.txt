Java, using another java program in jar format

i want to embed an open source editor to my java desktop application. But i am not sure yet how to do it. I got jnlp web start and jar file to import library. The program which will be imported is like below. In fact i just need internal frames but if it is too completed i can embed whole program too. I think about 3 options but don't know which one really works and which one is better. Run jnlp webstart in java code Run jar file in java code(non-executable jar) Import jar and use its api (This is really what i need but i m not sure how to do this. I debugged the code to understand which frame works how but i have no experience about it and i found it very complicated) Any advices how to solve this problem ? Thanks, Bilal
