I'm thinking about this problem, and the solution I came up is having a decimal number as order and change the number of the item change for a number between the next and the previous item Order Item ----- ---- 1 Original Item 1 2 Original Item 2 3 Original Item 3 4 Original Item 4 5 Original Item 5 If you change the item 4 to the 2nd position, you get: Order Item ----- ---- 1 Original Item 1 1.5 Original Item 4 2 Original Item 2 3 Original Item 3 5 Original Item 5 If you change the item 3 to the 3rd position, you get: Order Item ----- ---- 1 Original Item 1 1.5 Original Item 4 1.75 Original Item 3 2 Original Item 2 5 Original Item 5 Theoretically there is always a decimal between two decimals, but you could face some storage limits. This way you only have to update the row being re-ordered.
