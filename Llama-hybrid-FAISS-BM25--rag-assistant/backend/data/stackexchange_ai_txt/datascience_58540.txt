How to compare a sentence with a paragraph and get its probability in terms of correctness?

This is my first post on stackoverflow network and I am dealing with a machine learning. Lets say I have a paragraph describing a rabbit and tortoise story. The story concludes that tortoise is a winner. Now I want to train ML engine based on this paragraph. If I provide a statement as "Rabbit won the race", how can it show me the correctness of my statement in terms of probability of correctness? Need help.
