Logistic Regression using dummy variables in MATLAB

I have a model where categorical (mutually exclusive) variables predict bankruptcy. Chi-square is significant. How can I code a logistic regression model in MATLAB that proves that some of these variables explain the bankruptcies better. There are 4 variables: which implies 3 dummy variables. X = [ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 ......... ] ; Y = [1 0 0 1 1 0 0 .....]; % 1 means bankruptcy I think I should use glmfit (from http://matlabdatamining.blogspot.com/2009/03/logistic-regression.html ) but I wasn't sure if using dummy indicators would require any additional interpretation/inputs. I use latest version and have Statistics and Optimization Toolbox.
