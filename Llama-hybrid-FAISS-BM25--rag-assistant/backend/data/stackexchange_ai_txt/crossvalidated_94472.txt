Which machine learning method to use for geographic systems prediction?

I am trying to do experiments on geographic systems prediction. We're working on classifying the location where we sell product most. So, we need to analyze the hestorical data and predict the success of our product in specific areas, specific time. I don't have a lot of experience in statistics and modeling data beyond a high school statistics course so I'm kinda confused. lat long city_block .. event date 41.98302392, -87.71849159, 23 1 17/04/2014 41.77351707, -87.59144826, 44 0 17/04/2014 41.77508317, -87.58899995, 24 0 17/04/2014 41.77511247, -87.58646695, 33 1 17/04/2014 41.77514645, -87.58515301, 21 0 17/04/2014 41.77538531, -87.58611272, 22 3 17/04/2014 41.71339537, -87.56963306, 39 0 16/04/2014 41.81685612, -87.59757281, 12 0 16/04/2014 41.81697313, -87.59910809, 02 3 16/04/2014 41.81695808, -87.60049861, 3 0 16/04/2014 41.75894604, -87.55560586, 4 0 16/04/2014 Event: represent number of items sold in location (lat/long) on (date). Can anyone give an example how to classify geographic systems, and predict values based on data we have. as far as I know, I can't use linear modeling (as I have two variables lat/long). Someone recommended to use density estimation Instead of using clustering. Using one-class SVM, is given points only from one class, and expected to learn a separation between members of that class and anything else. I read in another post that I have to use poisson, as it's counting model. Meanwhile, as I have a lot of negative points (90%), I will have problems finding good results. What do you suggest as an approach to tackle this problem ?
