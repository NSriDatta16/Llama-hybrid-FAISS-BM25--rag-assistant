Cannot add table to context - LINQ-To-SQL

I'd be happy to give you more info if you need, just ask for it. I have in my database a table of articles, a table of tags and a link table. The article table has values like Id, Subject etc etc, the tags only have Id and Tag. The link has TagId and ArticleId. The problem is that when I drag drop the link-table nothing happens! This all worked before I decided to rename my column in the tables from "ID" to "Id" to correct spelling. Thanks in advance!
