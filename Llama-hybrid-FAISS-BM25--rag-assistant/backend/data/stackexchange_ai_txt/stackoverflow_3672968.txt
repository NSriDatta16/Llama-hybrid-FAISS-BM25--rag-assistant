Magento - Aheadworks blog extension WYSIWYG editor

i've installed the blog extension from Aheadworks, which is supposed to use the native WYSIWYG editor that comes with Magento 1.4.* but the editor does not show up. The editor shows up on CMS pages and Static Blocks but not with this extension. Any ideas? Thanks
