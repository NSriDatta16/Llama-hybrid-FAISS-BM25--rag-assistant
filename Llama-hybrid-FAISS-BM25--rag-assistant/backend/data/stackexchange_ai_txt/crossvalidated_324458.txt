To test for small-world property, does the random graph generated has to be completely connected?

For a small world property, the ratio of the average path length and the mean path length of random networks has to be close to one. My question is: When generating a random graph using the Erdős-Rényi algorithm, there is a chance that some nodes are not connected. Should I consider such graphs when calculating the mean shortest path length and clustering, or should I discard them and generate a new one?
