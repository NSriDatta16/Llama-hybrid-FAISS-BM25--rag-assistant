jQuery removeClass duration not working?

I have a paragraph set with the following style: .design_info_box p.design_info_desc { height:30px; text-overflow: ellipsis; overflow:hidden; } With this, you can see the first 2 lines of text with a button to "read more" which expands the paragraph to show the rest of the text. Here is the code for the button: $(".read-more div").click(function(){ $(this).parent().parent().children("p").removeClass("design_info_desc", "slow"); $(this).hide(); }); This does remove the class and the entire paragraph is revealed. However, it does not animate. According to the docs removeClass should have a duration for animation. I also tried substituting "slow" with a number like 10000. Is there a reason why it is not animating?
