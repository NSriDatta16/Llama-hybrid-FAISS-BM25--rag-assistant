I'd not heard the 'Halloween problem' tag before, but Robert may be correct. The nodelist returned from getElementsByTagName is dynamic i.e. adding or removing, in this case selects, will change the nodelist after it has been created. try //hoping for magic here $('select').multiSelect(); or $('select').each( function() { $(this).multiSelect(); });
