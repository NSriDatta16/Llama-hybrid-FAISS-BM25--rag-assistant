Is it possible to train a Support Vector Machine to a specific accuracy?

From my understanding, support vector machines run on the premise of minimizing some error function, usually with the goal of maximizing accuracy overall. However, there are a lot of contexts, particularly in the social sciences, where people don't aim for 99%+ accuracy, but instead aim for 95% accuracy (e.g., 95% CI, p-values, etc). I'm wondering if there is a way to train SVMs with the goal of developing the best model that achieves 95% accuracy. Obviously, depending on the context, 95% accuracy might be out of reach and researchers are just aiming for the best predictive models they can get; but when an SVM can train on some dataset and repeatedly get above 95% accuracy, I'm wondering if there is a way to trade off some of that accuracy for generalizability, namely by say reducing the complexity of the decision boundary (e.g., fewer folds) or by maximizing another function, say achieving 95% accuracy on a medical test while also trying to maximize the number of true positives.
