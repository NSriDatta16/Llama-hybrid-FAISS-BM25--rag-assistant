There are at least two issues here: 1) The distribution of the dependent variable and 2) The number of categories in one of the independent variables Regarding 1) Since the variable is the average number of errors, it is essentially continuous, albeit very skewed. OLS regression makes no assumptions about the shape of the dependent variable, only about the residuals. But it is likely that they will be non-normal and you may need to transform the DV. Regarding 2) There is no special reason you cannot have a variable with so many categories, provided that you have enough data. You will want to have enough cases in every region. You may need to combine regions.
