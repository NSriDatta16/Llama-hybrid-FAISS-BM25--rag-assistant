I assume you're simply putting UIViews in a nib for use by a UIViewController that's purely in code. Apple calls this a detached nib file . Follow the guide I linked to for details and example of how to get this to work. Regarding embedding a view inside another in Interface Builder, you need to add a UIView element from the Library into the parent view, and set its class in the Inspector . Once the class of the embedded view is set, your IBOutlets should be visible.
