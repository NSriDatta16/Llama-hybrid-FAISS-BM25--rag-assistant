Loss vs. Classification Accuracy in applied problems

In practical problems, where we want to for instance predict if a subject has a certain disease or not, we usually take classification accuracy as a measure which has the straightforward interpretation of the ratio of subjects diagnosed correctly. My question: Would the loss function give us any additional, useful information with this regards? E.g. has hinge-loss a useful interpretation when we base our predictions on Support Vector Machines (SVM)? Edit: What I also do not yet fully understand: Is accuracy based on loss? For instance back to binary SVM, is predicting a new sample to belong to either group based on which loss would be minimal? And is this the so called "score" when for instance using fitcsvm in Matlab?
