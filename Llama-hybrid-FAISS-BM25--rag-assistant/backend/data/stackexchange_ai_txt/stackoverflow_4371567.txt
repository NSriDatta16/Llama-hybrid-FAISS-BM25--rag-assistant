in sql can i group sets of results to find out the percentage of each set

I would like to know if I do a query like this Select pass_fail, timestamp from test_execution where site = 'test' and timestamp between '1234567890' and '1234567890' Let's say this query returns 96 results because the timestamp are a 24 hour period and there's 4 results per hour. With this how can I find out the percentage of pass_fail for each hour in that 24 hour period.( there's 4 results per hour in those 24 hours so 96 total how can I find how many pass for each hour ) would I need to group results? Would I need to Limit 4 offset 0 then increase the offset by 4 each run and average each set like that? It just seems wrong that way...any suggestions? Thanks
