A path segment (the parts in a path separated by / ) in an absolute URI path can contain zero or more of pchar that is defined as follows: pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@" pct-encoded = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "=" So it’s basically A – Z , a – z , 0 – 9 , - , . , _ , ~ , ! , $ , & , ' , ( , ) , * , + , , , ; , = , : , @ , as well as % that must be followed by two hexadecimal digits. Any other character/byte needs to be encoded using the percent-encoding . Although these are 79 characters in total that can be used in a path segment literally, some user agents do encode some of these characters as well (e.g. %7E instead of ~ ). That’s why many use just the 62 alphanumeric characters (i.e. A – Z , a – z , 0 – 9 ) or the Base 64 Encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet (i.e. A – Z , a – z , 0 – 9 , - , _ ).
