Rails page caching with Apache and capistrano

The following post explains about the page caching in rails with Nginx. http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/1/30/segregated-page-cache-storage I like to implement this solution with my app but on Apache. So, the main block/route is if (-f $request_filename) { break; } if (-f /cache$request_filename) { rewrite (.*) /cache$1 break; break; } if (-f /cache$request_filename.html) { rewrite (.*) /cache$1.html break; break; } What could be the Apache equivalent for the above Nginx related code??
