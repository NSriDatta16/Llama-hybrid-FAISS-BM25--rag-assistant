SQL Best Practices - Ok to rely on auto increment field to sort rows chronologically?

I'm working with a client who wants to add timestamps to a bunch of tables so that they may sort the records in those tables chronologically. All of the tables also have an auto incrementing integer field as their primary key (id). The (simple) idea - save the overhead/storage and rely on the primary key to sort fields chronologically. Sure this works, but I'm uncertain whether or not this approach is acceptable in sound database design. Pros: less storage required per record, simpler VO classes, etc. etc. Con: it implies a characteristic of that field, an otherwise simple identifer, whose definition does not in any way define or guarantee that it should/will function as such. Assume for the sake of my question that the DB table definitions are set in stone. Still - is this acceptable in terms of best practices? Thanks
