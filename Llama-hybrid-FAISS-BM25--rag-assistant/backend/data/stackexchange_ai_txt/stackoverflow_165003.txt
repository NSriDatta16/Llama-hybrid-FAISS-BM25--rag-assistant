I use Crystal. I will outline my method briefly, but be aware that I'm a one man shop and it may not translate to your environment. First, create a form with a CR Viewer. Then: 1) Figure out what data you need, and create a view that retrieves the desired columns. 2) Create a new Crystal report using the wizard giving your view as the source of the data. 3) Drag, drop, insert, delete, and whatever to rough your report into shape. Yes, it's tedious. 4) Create the necessary button click or whatever, and create the function in which to generate the report. 5) Retrieve the data to a DataTable (probably in a DataSet). You do not have to use the view. 6) Create the report object. Set the DataTable to be the DataSource. Assign the report object to the CR Viewer. This is one part for which there are examples. Comments: If you lose the window with the database fields, etc (Field Explorer), go to View/Document Outline. (It's my fantasy to have Bill Gates on a stage and ask him to find it.) The reason for setting up the view is that if you want to add a column, you revise the view, and the Field Explorer will update automatically. I've had all sorts of trouble doing it other ways. This method also is a work-around for a bug that requires scanning through all the tables resetting which table they point to. You want to hand Crystal a single table. You do not want to try to get Crystal to join tables, etc. I don't say it doesn't work; I say it's harder. There is (or was) documentation for the VS implementation of Crystal on the Business Objects web site, but I believe that it has disappeared behind a register/login screen. (I could stand more info on that myself.) I've had trouble getting Crystal to page break when I want, and not page break when I don't want, etc. It's far from the best report writer I've ever used and I do not understand why it seems to have put so many others out of business. In addition, their licensing policies are very difficult to deal with in a small, fluid organization. Edited to add example: AcctStatement oRpt = new AcctStatement() ; oRpt.Database.Tables[0].SetDataSource(dsRpt.Tables[0]); oRpt.SetParameterValue("plan_title",sPlanName) ; crViewer.ReportSource = oRpt ;
