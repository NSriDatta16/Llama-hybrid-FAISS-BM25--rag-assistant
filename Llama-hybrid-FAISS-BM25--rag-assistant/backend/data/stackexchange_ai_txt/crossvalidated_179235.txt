As far as I understand you right you have 16 hours of each day and since you have always exactly the same number of hours you can pretend that a day has only 16 hours instead of 24. In that way there is no need for an irregular time series. In case you are talking about irregular time series because you have more than just a few days of data and you want to capture different months (29days, 30days, 31day...) I would suggest you use dummies for that. tslm is not more than a regular linear regression lm . You can start with that: y I will expand my answer and show you how to use dummy variables when you upload some sample dataset that I can use as example.
