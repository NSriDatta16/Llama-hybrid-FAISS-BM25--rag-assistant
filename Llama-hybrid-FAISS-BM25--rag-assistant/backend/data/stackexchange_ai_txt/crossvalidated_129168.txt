How can i do time series forecasting with missing data

I am relatively new to time series forecasting, I have worked previously with continuous data at regular intervals successfully, Now I have a data set with missing values, for example look at the below sample : 2012-01-13 4804 2012-01-14 58 2012-01-16 6031 Here we see that 15th is missing out, I have many such missing values. Can I apply Holt Winters, Artificial Neural Networks or ARIMA on such data? If not how do I work with such data. Please advise
