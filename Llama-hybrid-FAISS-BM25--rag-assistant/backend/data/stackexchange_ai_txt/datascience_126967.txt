Time Series forecasting feature creation/engineering

I'm new to time-series-forecasting and was wondering, whether in a single variable forecast e.g.: X -> Y the creation of additional features of X leads to an improvement when training. So if adding features like month, day-of-week, rolling mean or lagged series from X does improve Statistical models (Arima, Exponential Smoothing), Tree based models (XGB, Random Forest) or neural networks. These features would be fully correlated with X, so does it help, make predictions worse or have no effect? Thank you in advance
