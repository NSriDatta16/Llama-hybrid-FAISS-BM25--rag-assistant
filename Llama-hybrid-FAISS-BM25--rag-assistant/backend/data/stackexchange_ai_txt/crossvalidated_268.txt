You could of for a supervised self-organizing map (e.g. with kohonen package for R), and use the login frequency as dependent variable. That way, the clustering will focus on separating the frequent visitors from the rare visitors. By plotting the number of users on each map unit, you may get an idea in clusters present in your data. Because SOMs are non-linear mapping methods, this approach is particularly interesting for tailed data.
