How do I implement the Post/Redirect/Get pattern in asp.net WebForms?

So I understand the basics of the prg pattern. But I haven't come across a technique for making arbitrary data available to the "get" instance of a page. For example, I might want to display different feedback messages to the user depending on their action which initiated the PostBack. What I've been doing is sending an identifier as a query string parameter. This works fine but it introduces bookmarking issues and doesn't seem like it would scale very well. What if I needed to send all of the ViewState? Unfortunately, I'm tied to WebForms at the moment and haven't been able to convince my organization to migrate to mvc.
