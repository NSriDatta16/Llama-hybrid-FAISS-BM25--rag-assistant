Given that TensorFlow is a more low-level library than Keras in general you would see this offers extra flexibility and improved performance (albeit relatively minor, depends mostly on how you write your code). I would say, if you are in research or developing new types of neural networks, knowledge of TensorFlow would be very useful. Outside of that, you should be fine with Keras although understanding how TensorFlow works could still be helpful if you're using it as a backend. However, a while ago I read that Keras and TensorFlow will become more integrated which would make life a lot easier for you. Obviously this is only my personal view, therefore I'd like to point you to some extra articles so you can do some reading of your own. This discussion on Kaggle gives a great overview of arguments and when to use which. Medium post on this topic.
