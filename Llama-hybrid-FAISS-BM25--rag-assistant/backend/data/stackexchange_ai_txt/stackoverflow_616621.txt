Looking for interesting topic from neural networks area

I'm preparing to give a talk about some topic I choose from artificial intelligence area (neural networks). I'm looking for something interesting, used in a real life and preferably not too complicated (the simpler it is, the easier it is for students to understand and the more interested they will be). I thought that it's a good place to look for advice ;)
