I think I've figured out the possible solution. It all depends on the nature of eigen values. Lets say we have 3 time series in our system. Correspondingly there are different possibilites for eigen values 1) Case 1 : All the eigen values are less than 1 in modulus => VAR model is stationary and can be built and used for forecasting after other diagnostic checks. 2) Case 2 : All the eigen values are > 1 in modulus => VAR is non-stationary, We have to go for a co integration check. If none of them are co-integrated , then differencing or log transformation is the suggested way 3) Case 3: Eigen Value =1 i.e a unit root => We will have to go the VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) approach 4) Case 4 : Now this is interesting, some of the eigen values are 1, none of them being equal to 1 , => System is exploding i.e one of the series is stationary around a mean/variance, while other one is not. In this case either transforming the series via differencing or log transformation , is the logical way or rather dealing only with the non stationary series with univariate methods gives better forecasts. I sounds logical to me that, if one of the series is non stationary and other is stationary, Then the stationary one might not be impacting the non stationary series at all. But I don't have any rigorous mathematical proof for that
