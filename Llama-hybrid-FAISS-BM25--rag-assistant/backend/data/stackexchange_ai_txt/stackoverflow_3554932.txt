Tracking Microsoft SQL Server Activity

I have a very strange and complicated situation. I have data being erased from one of my SQL Server tables, and I am not sure by what application. I would like to be able to track this. As I am sure you are wondering how I could find myself in this situation, here is some background. We have 2 servers, Web and Database running IIS6 and SQL Server 2005 respectively. They were setup by the previous developer who left the company without giving me any sort of introduction to the system so I am left "hunting" for everything.. I have been able to figure out most of the system on my own except for this, which remains a mystery. All I know for sure is this: Data is being erased at a set time every day (I have setup a TRIGGER to capture this) It is not a SQL Server Agent Job It is not a Windows Scheduled Task It is not a Windows Service All database logins are done with the sa user so login history cannot help me... (again, I didn't set this up) How the heck do I debug something like this? If anything, I want to know if this is coming from something running on the database server, or from a request from an outside source. Please help :-)
