You do have to change the z-index of the jQuery UI Datepicker to appear in front of qTip. To solve your problem of "clicking on the datepicker and qTip closing" you need to configure qTip to close on "mouseout". The datepicker is inside of qTip so once you are over the qTip bubble you can interact (click on dates, in this case) with the content inside once you don't "mouseout" of the qTip content. Anyhow, here is my qTip configuration JS I used, the "hide" section is the part that you want to pay attention too. $(document).ready(function() { $("img.calendarIcon-calendarView").qtip({ content: { url: 'ajaxContent/caledarInclude.html' }, style: { name: 'dark', tip: 'topMiddle', width: { max: 1000 }, border: {radius: 6, width: 4} }, show: { effect: { type: 'slide', length: 300 } }, hide: { when: 'mouseout', fixed: true, delay: 750, effect: { type: 'slide', length: 300 } }, position: { corner: { target: 'bottomMiddle', tooltip: 'topMiddle' }} }); });
