I would not consider plists for anything other than saving simple preferences and really basic data structure. Plus performance wise, retrieving and saving data to plists can be quite slow. After struggling with Coredata for a long time, now that I finally get it I would choose it over anything any day. Yes it does have a bit of a steep learning curve but there is so much you get "for free" with it, I'd definitely invest the time to learn and explore it. Coredata will give you flexibility to expand your object models as needed, easily fetch objects from the persistant storage based on certain parameters, create relationships between models, memory management and the list goes on. Coredata is really well documented by Apple so you will find everything you need to get started plus more. There are examples, sample projects, videos, you name it - so I'd definitly recommend you have a look IF you are interested in performance, scalability and having a bit of fun too :)
