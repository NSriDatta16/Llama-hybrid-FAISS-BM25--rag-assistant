The script asks for a partner, which is specific to Payflow. What do you want to use? Express Checkout or Payflow? See the paragraphs below for more information on the two. Are you sure the script is for Express Checkout? Is the script connecting to the sandbox or live API? The Express Checkout sandbox API is located at https://api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp . Express Checkout is primarily used for payments using a PayPal account. You can set up a sandbox environment at developer.paypal.com .
