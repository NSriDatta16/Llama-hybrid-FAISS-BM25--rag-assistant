First off, you have already implemented a lot of precisely those models one would recommend in this situation, congratulations! One possibility for daily data would indeed be Prophet, as dimitry suggests . Another would be the models proposed by Hyndman et al. for multiple and complex seasonalities, like forecast::tbats() or forecast::mstl() , see the tag wiki . However, particularly the TBATS model is already very close to your own model with Fourier terms, so the results may not be very much better. When I look at your residual plots, they indeed look rather similar. But they are not identical, and the similarity is probably a consequence of your models giving very similar fits, because I would suspect that both models extract about the same signal from the series. If that is so, then the other models suggested in the previous paragraph may not give very different fits (and residuals, and forecasts), either. One possible way forward would be to dig into what happened around the large residuals, e.g., the ones that seem to occur quite regularly around the end of the year. If you can understand these and model and forecast them, that might improve matters. However, since these seem to pertain to single days each, this may not be a systematic effect and just be a symptom of higher variance during "special times" - if so, there is probably little you can do in terms of an expectation forecast. Indeed, there is probably a lot of residual variation in your data. At some point, forecasting algorithm will not be able to improve any further, simply because of this residual variation. See How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless?
