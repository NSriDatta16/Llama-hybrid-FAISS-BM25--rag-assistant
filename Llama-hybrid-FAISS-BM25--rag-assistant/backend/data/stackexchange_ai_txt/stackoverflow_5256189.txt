Is Image.Clip or Path.Fill faster when applying transforms (translate/rotate) on an image cutout?

I'm having the user drag and rotate a clipped image using RotateTransform and TranslateTransform. I want to lessen any image "flicker"/"jitter" during redraw as much as possible. To create the clipped image, I can either use Image.Clip (to pathgeometry) or Path.Fill (with image). Which would provide the smoothest experience for the user?
