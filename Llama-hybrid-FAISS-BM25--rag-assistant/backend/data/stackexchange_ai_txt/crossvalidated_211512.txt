Are evolutionary algorithms such as PSO, used in Deep learning for finding optimal weights?

All I have seen so far, e.g in convnets is that every one is using Xavier for initialization or random Gaussian distribution. I could not have found any article that like in Artificial neural networks, use algorithms such as GA,PSO, etc to find optimal weights for layers. Are they not applicable in this field due to the number of parameters? Thanks in advance
