In general, I think best practice for presenting measures of effect size depends on the question of interest and the usual practice in your field. There's little point reporting an effect measure that readers will be unfamiliar with. Having said that, in this particular case if you want a single effect measure I think the (conditional) odds ratio b / c is the obvious choice. Giving both proportions b / ( b + c ) and c / ( b + c ) gives more information and clearly the odds ratio can be derived from these two. I wouldn't call two proportions an 'effect size' though. I'd strongly encourage you to report all four cells of the 2Ã—2 table concordancy table, however. That way nothing is hidden and anyone can calculate whatever statistics they wish. It's only four numbers, after all.
