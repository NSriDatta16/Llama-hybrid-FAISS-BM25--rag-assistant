Why does the correlation between decision trees have to be positive?

In the book "Elements of statistical learning" we have that the variance of a the random forest is given by $V(\frac{1}{n} \sum X_i)= \rho \sigma^2+ \frac{1-\rho}{n}\sigma^2$ where $\rho$ is the pairwise correlation between all $n$ trees which all have variance $\sigma^2$ . It is stated that $\rho\geq 0$ otherwise the proof fails. I know that $\rho\geq -1/(n-1)$ but that does not imply that $\rho>0$ ? Say we have $n=3$ we have that $\rho$ can take the values $-0.5$ without violating anything. How come the proof is only for $\rho\geq 0$ ?
