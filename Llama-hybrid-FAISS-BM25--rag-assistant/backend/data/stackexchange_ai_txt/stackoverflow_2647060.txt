Windows 2000 and later use Kerberos as their default authentication method. Some Microsoft additions to the Kerberos suite of protocols are documented in RFC 3244 "Microsoft Windows 2000 Kerberos Change Password and Set Password Protocols". RFC 4757 documents Microsoft's use of the RC4 cipher. While Microsoft uses the Kerberos protocol, it does not use the MIT software. Many UNIX-like operating systems, including FreeBSD, Apple's Mac OS X, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Sun's Solaris, IBM's AIX, HP's OpenVMS, and others, include software for Kerberos authentication of users or services. from wikipedia, also if you visit http://www.kerberos.org/ , the Kerberos Consortium, they have a pdf document which has as sponsors: Apple Carnegie Mellon Columbia Cornell Centrify Corporation The United States DOD Duke University The Financial Services Technology Consortium Google Iowa State University MIT Michigan State Microsoft NASA Pennsylvania State Stanford University Sun Microsystems Team F1, inc. The University of Michigan Which shows that if implemented correctly, there are uses for it. visit http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Main_Page for more information on this consortium.
