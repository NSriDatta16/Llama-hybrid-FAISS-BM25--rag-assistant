Java swing applets change frame icon

How do I change the icon of a frame when loading the applet from JNLP? I'm also using substance to change the appearance of the applet, and in a stand alone application the title changes with the skin I choose, but if I run the applet from webstart it always puts the default title bar (windows look). How can I change that? Thanks.
