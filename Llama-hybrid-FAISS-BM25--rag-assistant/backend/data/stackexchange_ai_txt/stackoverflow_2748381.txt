How to get the parameters from a plotted linear model smoother?

I have a data.frame with 3 time series in it, shown below. When I plot them with a smoother time series, I want to be able to get the parameters of the linear model that I plot, but I can't see how to do that? > data day od series_id 1 1 0.10 A1 2 3 1.00 A1 3 5 0.50 A1 4 7 0.70 A1 5 1 1.70 B1 6 3 1.60 B1 7 5 1.75 B1 8 7 1.70 B1 9 1 2.10 C1 10 3 2.30 C1 11 5 2.50 C1 12 7 2.70 C1 data = data.frame (day = c(1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7), od = c(0.1,1.0,0.5,0.7 ,1.7,1.6,1.75,1.7 ,2.1,2.3,2.5,2.7), series_id = c("A1", "A1", "A1","A1", "B1", "B1","B1", "B1", "C1","C1", "C1", "C1")) r
