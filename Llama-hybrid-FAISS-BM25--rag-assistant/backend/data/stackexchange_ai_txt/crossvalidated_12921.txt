Fixed-effects ANOVA (or its linear regression equivalent) provides a powerful family of methods to analyze these data. To illustrate, here is a dataset consistent with the plots of mean HC per evening (one plot per color): | Color Day | B G R | Total -------+---------------------------------+---------- 1 | 117 176 91 | 384 2 | 208 193 156 | 557 3 | 287 218 257 | 762 4 | 256 267 271 | 794 5 | 169 143 163 | 475 6 | 166 163 163 | 492 7 | 237 214 279 | 730 8 | 588 455 457 | 1,500 9 | 443 428 397 | 1,268 10 | 464 408 441 | 1,313 11 | 470 473 464 | 1,407 12 | 171 185 196 | 552 -------+---------------------------------+---------- Total | 3,576 3,323 3,335 | 10,234 ANOVA of count against day and color produces this table: Number of obs = 36 R-squared = 0.9656 Root MSE = 31.301 Adj R-squared = 0.9454 Source | Partial SS df MS F Prob > F -----------+---------------------------------------------------- Model | 605936.611 13 46610.5085 47.57 0.0000 | day | 602541.222 11 54776.4747 55.91 0.0000 colorcode | 3395.38889 2 1697.69444 1.73 0.2001 | Residual | 21554.6111 22 979.755051 -----------+---------------------------------------------------- Total | 627491.222 35 17928.3206 The model p-value of 0.0000 shows the fit is highly significant. The day p-value of 0.0000 is also highly significant: you can detect day to day changes. However, the color (semester) p-value of 0.2001 should not be considered significant: you cannot detect a systematic difference among the three semesters, even after controlling for day to day variation. Tukey's HSD ("honest significant difference") test identifies the following significant changes (among others) in day-to-day means (regardless of semester) at the 0.05 level: 1 increases to 2, 3 3 and 4 decrease to 5 5, 6, and 7 increase to 8,9,10,11 8, 9, 10, and 11 decrease to 12. This confirms what the eye can see in the graphs. Because the graphs jump around quite a bit, there's no way to detect day-to-day correlations (serial correlation), which is the whole point of time series analysis. In other words, don't bother with time series techniques: there's not enough data here for them to provide any greater insight. One should always wonder how much to believe the results of any statistical analysis. Various diagnostics for heteroscedasticity (such as the Breusch-Pagan test ) don't show anything untoward. The residuals don't look very normal--they clump into some groups--so all the p-values have to be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, they appear to provide reasonable guidance and help quantify the sense of the data we can get from looking at the graphs. You can carry out a parallel analysis on the daily minima or on the daily maxima. Make sure to start with a similar plot as a guide and to check the statistical output.
