To me, a more elegant approach to your click handling for the td's is to put one click handler on the table itself, and let it catch the click events that bubble up from the td's. That way you don't need to worry about adding handlers to each td in the table. It's also better for performance, though in this situation, I doubt it matters much in that regard. Here's what you would do (you could add this right after you declare the $table variable): $table.click(function(e) { var target = $(e.target); if (target.is('td')) { var input = $('input[name=search]'); input.val( input.val() + target.text() ); e.stopPropagation(); } });
