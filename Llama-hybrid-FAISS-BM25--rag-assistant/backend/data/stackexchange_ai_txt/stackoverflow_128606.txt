If you want a document instead of a fragment, you'll probably need a two-part solution. However, both parts could be done in SQL Server. It looks from the comments on Tom's entry like you found the ELEMENTS argument, so you're getting the fields as child elements rather than attributes. You'll still end up with a fragment, though, because you won't get a root node. There are different ways you could handle this. SQL Server provides a method for using XSLT to transform XML documents, so you could create an XSL stylesheet to wrap the result of your query in a root element. You could also add anything else the customer's schema requires (assuming they have one). If you wanted to leave some fields as attributes and make others elements, you could also use XSLT to move those fields, so you might end up with something like this: John Public
