Unfortunately, terminology varies quite a bit and in confusing ways, especially between disciplines. There will be many people who will use different terms for the same thing, and/or the same terms for different things (this is a pet peeve of mine). I gather the book in question is this . This is design of experiments from the perspective of engineering (as opposed to the biomedical or the social science perspectives). The Wikipedia entry seems to be coming from the biomedical / social science perspective. In engineering , an experimental run is typically thought of as having set up your equipment and run it. This produces, in a sense, one data point. Running your experiment again is a replication ; it gets you a second data point. In a biomedical context, you run an experiment and get $N$ data. Someone else replicates your experiment on a new sample with another $N'$ data. These constitute different ways of thinking about what you call an "experimental run". Tragically, they are very confusing. Montgomery is referring to multiple data from the same run as "repeated measurements". Again, this is common in engineering. A way to think about this from outside the engineering context is to think about a hierarchical analysis, where you are interested in estimating and drawing inferences about the level 2 units . That is, treatments are randomly assigned to doctors and every patient (on whom you take a measurement) is a repeated measurement with respect to the doctor . Within the same doctor, those measurements "reflect differences among the wafers [patients] and other sources of variability within that particular furnace run [doctor's care]".
