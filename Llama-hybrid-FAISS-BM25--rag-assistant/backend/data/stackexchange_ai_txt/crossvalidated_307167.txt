What is the distribution of the Wilcoxon signed-ranked test statistic?

Wikipedia notes, "$W$ follows a specific distribution with no simple expression". Unencouraging as that sounds, its mean and variance are respectively $0$ and $\sum_{k=1}^{N_r}k^2$. I'm thus guessing $W\sim\sum_{k=1}^{N_r}kY_k$ for iids $Y_k$ of mean 0, variance 1. However, if I'm right the $Y_k$ aren't Gaussian, as then $W$ would be too. Despite the title, my question is really what distribution these $Y_k$ have. I realise $W$ won't have a "neat" pdf, though its characteristic function would be nicer; if each $Y_k$ has cf $\phi(t)=\exp(-\frac{t^2}{2}+o(t^2))$, $W$'s cf will be $\prod_{k=1}^{N_r}\phi(kt)$.
