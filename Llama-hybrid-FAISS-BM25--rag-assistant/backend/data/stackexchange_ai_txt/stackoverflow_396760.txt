In my mind, the most visible example of "developers are not the user" is the common Confirmation Dialog . In most any document based application, from the most complex (MS Word, Excel, Visual Studio) through the simplest (Notepad, Crimson Editor, UltraEdit), when you close the appliction with unsaved changes you get a dialog like this: The text in the Untitled file has changed. Do you want to save the changes? [Yes] [No] [Cancel] Assumption : Users will read the dialog Reality : With an average reading speed of 2 words per second, this would take 9 seconds. Many users won't read the dialog at all. Observation : Many developers read much much faster than typical users Assumption : The available options are all equally likely. Reality : Most (>99%) of the time users will want their changes saved. Assumption : Users will consider the consequences before clicking a choice Reality : The true impact of the choice will occur to users a split second after pressing the button. Assumption : Users will care about the message being displayed. Reality : Users are focussed on the next task they need to complete, not on the "care and feeding" of their computer. Assumption : Users will understand that the dialog contains critical information they need to know. Reality : Users see the dialog as a speedbump in their way and just want to get rid of it in the fastest way possible.
