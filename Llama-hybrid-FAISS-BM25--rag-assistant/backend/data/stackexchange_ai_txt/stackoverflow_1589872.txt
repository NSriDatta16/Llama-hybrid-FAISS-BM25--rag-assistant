One thing to add to the other answers: While a centralized workflow (with one "central" Git repository) is off course possible, you need to keep in mind Git organizes its data differently (as a all, looking into the data content to infer various property, like file rename). See this answer for more differences between Svn and Git . One consequence is that you should not necessarily consider having just one Git central repository, but several, especially if you have many group of files with different and independent history (they evolve each at their own pace). SVN can store all those different group in one repository and can branch or tag whatever part it wants (it is just a matter of copying what you need in a "directory" representing a branch or a tag). Git branch and tag at the repository level. If your set of files is quite coherent, you can have one Git central repo, but if you have several components, may be several "central" Git repos are better.
