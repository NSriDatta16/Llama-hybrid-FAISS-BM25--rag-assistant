Perhaps you are suffering from this problem that the execSQL docs talk about: When using enableWriteAheadLogging(), journal_mode is automatically managed by this class. So, do not set journal_mode using "PRAGMA journal_mode'" statement if your app is using enableWriteAheadLogging() Check that you are not using write ahead logging and then it might work. Update: As Ranjit said in the comments, this should work: Cursor c1 = db.rawQuery("PRAGMA journal_mode=OFF", null); c1.close();
