Random forest does random selection of a subset of features for each tree. From wikipedia ( Random subspace method ): (...) feature bagging, is an ensemble learning method that attempts to reduce the correlation between estimators in an ensemble by training them on random samples of features instead of the entire feature set. The idea is to enforce that weak classifiers that get combined forming an ensemble should be different, because if they're too similar combining them wouldn't improve accuracy.
