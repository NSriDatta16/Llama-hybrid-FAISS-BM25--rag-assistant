How is the solver parameter and MLE related in Logistic regression for scikit-learn

I'm trying to understand the implementation of scikit-learn's Logistic Regression. I am new to the framework, and have only a basic understanding of logistic regression. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html Specifically, I wish to understand the Solver parameter. I was following another tutorial that uses logistic regression and suggests that fitting the model was done by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Now the API from scikit-learn does not mention using the MLE, but does mention a Solver parameter with the following types: solver : {‘newton-cg’, ‘lbfgs’, ‘liblinear’, ‘sag’}, default: ‘liblinear’ 1) Is MLE and the Solver parameter the same thing or anyway related? 2) If different, can I get a good description of what each does in regards to Logistic Regression. It is my understanding that MLE finds the coefficients (makes sense). The only documentation for the Solver parameter is: Algorithm to use in the optimization problem. 3) The default liblinear is what is used in the already mentioned tutorial. Is this an MLE implementation?
