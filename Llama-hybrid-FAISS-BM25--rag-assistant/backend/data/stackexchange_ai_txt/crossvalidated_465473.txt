How can I predict a continuous outcome variable with 1 binary and 1 ordinal predictor variable nonparametrically?

I have a binary predictor variable (situation1, situation2) and another one that's ordinally scaled (levels in an n-back task, they're called no-back,0-back,1-back & 2-back with 2-back being the highest level). I have a continuous outcome variable (illusion rate). I wanted to run an ANOVA, but my data is not normally distributed, so I'd like to use a nonparametric test. I thought about using a logistic regression, but I think my outcome variable would have to be binary to be able to do so. Does anyone have an idea of which test I could use for that? Thanks so much in advance! P.S.: I'm an undergrad trying to do my best statistics-wise, so please be nice! ;-)
