The answer is always do whatever the teacher wants and pass the class then on your own question everything and find out if their reasons were valid and form your own opinions. You cant win against the school, not worth it. In this case it is easy to compile to assembler or disassemble to see the difference if any between the enum and define. I would recommend the define over enum, have had compiler discomfort with enums. I highly discourage using pointers the way you are using them, I have seen every compiler fail to accurately generate the desired instructions, it is rare but when it happens you will wonder how your last decades of coding ever worked. Pointing structs or anything else is considerably worse. I often get flamed for this, and expect to this time around. Too many miles around the block, fixed too much broken code with these problems to ignore the root cause.
