Selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm?

I do not think that this is a difficult question, but I guess someone needs experience to answer it. It is a question that is asked a lot here, but I did not found any answer that explains the reasons of choosing an appropriate ML algorithm. So, let's suppose we have a set of data. And let's suppose I want to do clustering (This could be classification or regression if I also had labels or values or my training set data). What should I consider before choosing an appropriate algorithm ? Or I just choose algorithms in random? In addition how I choose any data preprocessing that can be applied at my data? I mean are there any rules of the format " IF feature X has property Z THEN do Y "? In addition are there any other things except preprocessing and choosing my data that I miss and you want to advice me about them? For example, lets suppose that I want to do clustering. Is saying " I will apply k means at that problem " the best approach? What can improve my performance? I will chose as best answer the answer that is much more justified and explains everything that someone should consider.
