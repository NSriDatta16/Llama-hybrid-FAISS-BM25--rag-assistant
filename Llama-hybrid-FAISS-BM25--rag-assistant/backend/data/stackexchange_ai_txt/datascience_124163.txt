Is openAI text generation models an extension of embedding models?

we can creating embeddings using below code import openai response = openai.Embedding.create( input="porcine pals say", model="text-embedding-ada-002" ) And we can generate text using below code def get_completion(prompt, model="text-davinci-003"): messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}] response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=model, messages=messages, temperature=0, ) return response.choices[0].message["content"] are text completions models extension of embeddings generation models, I mean is it like the embeddings generation models are further finetuned for chat/text generation? or is it like both models are completely different in terms of their training and architecture?
