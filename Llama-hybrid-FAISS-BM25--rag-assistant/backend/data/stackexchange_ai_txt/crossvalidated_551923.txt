Two ways to approach the problem: Geometric order statistics For each member of the population, define (independent) random variables $T_i$ , which is the day that member exits to the pool. $T_i$ has geometric distributions, $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \P(T_i=k)=(1-p)^k \cdot p, \quad k=1,2,3,\dotsc $$ Then define the order statistics $$ T_{(1)} \le T_{(2)} \le \dotsm \le T_{(N)} $$ and the interest is in the order statistic $T_{(k)}$ , which is the day the pool reaches size $k$ . So you need to find the expected value of geometric order statistics ... Markov chains Let the chain be $X_t$ , the number of members in the pool on day $t$ , starting with $X_0=0$ . The transition probabilities wil be binomial, $$ \P(X_{t+1}=u+k \mid X_t=u)= \binom{N-u}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-u-k} $$ But my Markov chains are too rusty to try to develop this any more now. Maybe the first approach is more hopeful ... but this points to an interesting relation between (discret) order statistics and Markov chains!
