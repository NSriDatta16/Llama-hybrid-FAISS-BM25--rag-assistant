You could give the tablecells a solid black background, and then make it slightly transparent. td { /* Fallback for web browsers that doesn't support RGBa */ background: rgb(0, 0, 0); /* RGBa with 0.6 opacity */ background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); } (css is from http://robertnyman.com/2010/01/11/css-background-transparency-without-affecting-child-elements-through-rgba-and-filters/ , look there if you want to make it compatible with MSIE)
