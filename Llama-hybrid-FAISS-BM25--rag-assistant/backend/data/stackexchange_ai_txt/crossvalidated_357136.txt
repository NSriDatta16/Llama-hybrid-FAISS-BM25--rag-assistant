I think the variables that in this case explicate the most variance could be Length, since ideally you should be able to represent all your features in relationship to this one. Furthermore PCA just describes the data as a new set of variables,or axes, (that may not be your initial one) that maximize the variance in your dataset. So I think in this case you could just keep the variable "Length" since the variance of the others it is just a derivation of the variance on the variable "Length".
