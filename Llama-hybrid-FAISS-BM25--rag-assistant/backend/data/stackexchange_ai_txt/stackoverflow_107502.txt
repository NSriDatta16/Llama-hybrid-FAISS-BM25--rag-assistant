Obviously Google are major users of Grid Computing; all their search service relies on it, and many others. Engines such as BigTable are based on using lots of nodes for storage and computation. These are commercially very useful because they're a good alternative to a small number of big servers, providing better redundancy and cost effective scaling. The downside is that the software is fiendishly difficult to write, but Google seem to manage that one ok :) So anything which requires big storage and/or lots of computation.
