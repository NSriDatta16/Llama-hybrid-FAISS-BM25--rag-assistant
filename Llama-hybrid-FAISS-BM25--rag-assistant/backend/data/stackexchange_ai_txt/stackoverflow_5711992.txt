ExtJS - null safe retrieval of complex objects using JsonReader

I am using a JsonReader to map Json data to variables to be used in a grid/form. The back end is in Java and there are complex objects which I Jsonify and pass to the ExtJS front end. This is a part of my JsonReader which tries to retrieve a nested object - {name:'status', type: 'string', mapping: 'status.name'} This works fine when status has a value (not null in the server), but the grid load fails when status is null. Currently the work around I have is to send an empty object from the server in case of null, but I assume there should be a way to handle this in ExtJS. Please suggest a better solution on the ExtJS side.
