I don't come from a mathematical background, so forgive my ignorance, but what does "to prove a program" mean? What are you proving? The correctness? The correctness is a specification that the program must verify to be "correct". But this specification is decided by a human, and how do you verify that this specification is correct? To my mind, there are bugs in program because humans have difficulties expressing what they really want. alt text http://www.processdevelopers.com/images/PM_Build_Swing.gif So what are you proving? Bugs caused by lack of attention?
