I personally wouldn't include the retrieval of the articles as part of the view template. I don't think that is a clean separation of the collection and processing of data (controllers and models) and the presentation of data (views). You may want to try and retrieve that list of articles in the controller or even the model depending how you are handling service style dependencies (I'm leaning more on the controller for this). Then have your view just able to handle passing the list of articles to the partial if it has one or display any exceptions that occur during the collection of the data.
