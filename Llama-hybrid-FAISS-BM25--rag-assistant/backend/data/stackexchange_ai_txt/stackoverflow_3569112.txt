Most Efficient Way To Write This Loop VB.Net

Good afternoon all, I am beginning my first forays into programming and have decided to begin with VB.net as I can get VS2010 professional free through MS Dreamspark program. I have been following some basic tutorials online and am now writing a small program that runs a loop to add all the numbers together between two numbers input by the user. Below is the code I have written: Public Class Form1 Private Sub cmdAddNumbers_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles cmdAddNumbers.Click Dim NumberOne As Integer Dim NumberTwo As Integer Dim Result As Integer Dim i As Integer If Not IsNumeric(txtNumberOne.Text) Then MsgBox("Please Enter A Valid Number For Number One") txtNumberOne.Clear() Exit Sub ElseIf txtNumberOne.Text = 0 Then MsgBox("Please Enter A Valid Number For Number One") txtNumberOne.Clear() Exit Sub ElseIf txtNumberOne.Text > 0 And IsNumeric(txtNumberOne.Text) Then NumberOne = txtNumberOne.Text End If If Not IsNumeric(txtNumberTwo.Text) Then MsgBox("Please Enter A Valid Number For Number Two") txtNumberTwo.Clear() Exit Sub ElseIf txtNumberTwo.Text NumberOne And IsNumeric(txtNumberTwo.Text) Then NumberTwo = txtNumberTwo.Text End If For i = NumberOne To NumberTwo Result = Result + i Next i txtResult.Text = Result txtNumberOne.Clear() txtNumberTwo.Clear() End Sub End Class Now, I am wondering if I have written the most efficent If statements to execute this code or if they can be written any simpler with AND / OR statements to possibly remove some of the ElseIf 's. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Alex
