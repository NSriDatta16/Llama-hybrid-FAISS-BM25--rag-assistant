You could write yourself an extension method that will do the job for you more conveniently than using TryParse every time, if you just want to avoid that. Something like: public static bool IsValidDateFormat(this string s) { DateTime dt; return DateTime.TryParse(s, out dt); } (There may be a slightly more elegant way to do it, I just threw this together to be compilable.)
