Note that the NSString stringWithContentsOfURL will report a totally different user-agent string than the UIWebView making the same request. So if your server is user-agent aware, and sending back different html depending on who is asking for it, you may not get correct results this way. Also note that the @"document.body.innerHTML" mentioned above will only display what is in the body tag. If you use @"document.all[0].innerHTML" you will get both head and body. Which is still not the complete contents of the UIWebView, since it will not get back the !doctype or html tags, but it is a lot closer.
