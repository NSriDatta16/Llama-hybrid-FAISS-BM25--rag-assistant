Magento admin panel is completely blank. Nicht gut

Morning, So we've got a Magento installation that's been working fine for two months, processing orders, managing inventory and being amazing as a good website should. The problem is, today the Magento admin panel has completely stopped working. Nightmare. You can browse to /admin and see the login panel, but once you've logged in the admin panel stares back in a pool of white. This is the URL it gets to and fails on: http://www.[domainname].com/index.php/admin/dashboard/index/key/2448826287818da25840ae673d1198f6/ There's literally NO html being created. The HTACCESS hasn't been changed, and there aren't any errors being generated in /var. I've tried removing the caches to no avail. What would you do to solve this awful situation? Thanks guys.
