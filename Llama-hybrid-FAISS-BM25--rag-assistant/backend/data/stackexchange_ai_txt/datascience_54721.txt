Reinforcement Learning control with known dynamic equation

I know there is model-based reinforcement learning . But all the approaches assume an MDP . If I want to do a feedback control of a system (i. e. control an inverted pendulum) it's quite easy to find the nonlinear differential equation . Can I somehow feed this knowledge into RL-algorithms or are there ways to transform a dynamic system to an MDP ?
