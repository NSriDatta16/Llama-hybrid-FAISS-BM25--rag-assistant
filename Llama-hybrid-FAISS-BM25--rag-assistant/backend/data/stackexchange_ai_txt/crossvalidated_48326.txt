State Space formulation of Hodrick-Prescott ﬁlter

I would like to apply the Kalman filter in order to get a causal Hodrick-Prescott ﬁlter. The Hodrick-Prescott ﬁlter models a time series $(y_t)_{t=0}^T$ as $$ y_t = \tau_t + c_t $$ where $\tau_t$ is a trend component and $c_t$ is a cyclical component. This reference defines a state space formulation of the form $$ y_t = \tau_t + c_t $$ as the measurement equation and $$ \tau_t = 2 \tau_{t−1} − \tau_{t−2} + \epsilon_t $$ for the unobservable trend. I have three questions on this: A) $c_t$ is assumed to be a random error here, right? Normally distributed with constant variance. This seems a difficult assumption to me. B) What's the logic behind the equation for the trend? C) Does anybody know a different state space formulation for this problem? Or a nother reference? Thanks!
