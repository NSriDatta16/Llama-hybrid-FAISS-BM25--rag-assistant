Yup. Using WCF tracing, fiddler and debugging on the router, and manually posting messages over HTTP, I have finally figured out what's going on. Turns out the WSMA agent on the router expects the SOAP message payload in the HTTP request to include an XML declaration. And WCF isn't sending one. I have posted a new question about how to make the WCF client send an XML declaration with its SOAP requests.
