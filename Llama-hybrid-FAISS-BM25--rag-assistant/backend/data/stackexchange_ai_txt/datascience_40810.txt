In which cases should Genetic Programming be preferred over Artificial Neural Network trained with Genetic Algorithm

I am trying to understand Genetic Programming (GP) but I cannot think of any context where GP can be chosen over training Artificial Neural Networks with genetic algorithms. What problems each of them is suitable for? In what context we choose one over the other (if it is not personal preference)?
