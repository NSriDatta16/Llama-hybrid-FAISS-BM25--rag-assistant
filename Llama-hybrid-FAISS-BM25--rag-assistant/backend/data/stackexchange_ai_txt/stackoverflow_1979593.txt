There is no final and general answer to this question. auto incrementing columns are easy to use when you add new records. To use them as foreign keys within the same transaction, they are not so straight forward. You need database specific commands to get the newly created key. This technology is common for certain databases, for instance sql server. Sequences seem to be harder to use, because you need to get a key before you insert a row, but at the end its easier to use them as foreign keys. This technology is common for certain databases, for instance oracle. When you use Hibernate or NHibernate , it is discouraged to use auto incrementing keys, because some optimizations are not possible anymore. Using a hi-lo algorithm which uses an additional table is recommended. Guids are strong, for instance when sharing data between different databases, systems, disconnected scenarios, import / export etc. In many databases, most of the tables contain only a few hundred records, so memory and performance are not such an issue. When using NHibernate, you get an guid generator which produces sequential guids , because some databases perform better when keys are sequential.
