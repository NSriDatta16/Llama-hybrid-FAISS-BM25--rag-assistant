problem regarding crystal reports

Actually when I drag fields from a database onto a report and when I run the report, only the first row data is shown i.e. if CourseID field is dragged onto a report and when I run it should show CourseID1 and below it CourseID2. But, it shows only CourseID1. I know it is a silly thing, but as I'm new to crystal reports, I'm unable to solve it. So, please help me out...thanks in advance...
