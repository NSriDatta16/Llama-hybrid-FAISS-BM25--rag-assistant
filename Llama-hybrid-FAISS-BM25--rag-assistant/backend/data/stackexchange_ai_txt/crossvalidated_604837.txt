Testing hypothesis that mean of grouped quantitative data is increasing in one direction

My predictor variable is quantitative, but falls into nine discrete groups (i.e., values are either 60, 125, 200 etc.). I have a responder variable that is quantitative and continuous. I have made a boxplot, and want to test the hypothesis that the average for each box & Whisker (responder variable) increases along the x-axis (predictor variable). An Anova test isn't appropriate as it only tells me whether the means are different, not whether they are changing progressively in one direction. A regression doesn't seem appropriate as the x axis isn't continuous. Any suggestions?
