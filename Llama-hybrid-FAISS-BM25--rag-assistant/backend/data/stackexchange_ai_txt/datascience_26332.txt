What is the role of logistic function in logistic regression?

After training Logistic regression on training data, getting each test sample to algorithm computes weighted sum of sample features. If this is greater than zero, we know the sample is from negative class and otherwise, sample is positive. I want to know why we need to calculate the logistic function that map our weighted sum to range zero and one. One reason can be that we want to interpret the results as probability. are there any other reasons?
