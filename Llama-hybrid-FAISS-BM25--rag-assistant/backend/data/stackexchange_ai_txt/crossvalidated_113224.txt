How to format multi-row time series data for LIBSVM regression

I would have expected this to be covered in detail by the LIBSVM tutorial but after hours of wasting time googling for answers I've had to throw in the towel. What I am trying to do is rather trivial really. Right now I have a financial data set in CSV format: time,indicator1,indicator2,indicator3,roc 20140508190000,0,-2,-1,-0.00361310835712725 20140508200000,1,-2,0,0.0216786501427154 20140508210000,-1,-2,1,-0.0252917584998426 20140508220000,0,-2,0,-0.0108397167220604 20140508230000,-1,-2,0,-0.0505725535527163 201405090,0,-2,0,0.0144560896277541 2014050910000,0,-2,0,-0.00361363061468619 2014050920000,1,-2,0,0.0542122953485871 2014050930000,-1,-2,1,-0.0975645009756423 2014050940000,0,-2,1,-0.0144550448106373 2014050950000,-1,-2,1,-0.198670712324811 ... So we have the date/time column and then four attributes per row. Later on I am going to want to predict the last column (roc). This data is obviously not normalized and I intend to use phraug to convert my data into a LIBSVM friendly format. But not so fast... Here's the problem. I have not been able to find any examples that explain how to format multi-row input data. In other words, since I plan to use SVR I somehow need to feed my SVM a sliding window of data sets. For instance, let's say I want to give the engine five rows in order to have it predict the output value of the sixth: 20140508190000,0,-2,-1,-0.00361310835712725 20140508200000,1,-2,0,0.0216786501427154 20140508210000,-1,-2,1,-0.0252917584998426 20140508220000,0,-2,0,-0.0108397167220604 20140508230000,-1,-2,0,-0.0505725535527163 The ideal here would be the roc value of the next row: 0.0144560896277541 Then we slide the window down by one row: 20140508200000,1,-2,0,0.0216786501427154 20140508210000,-1,-2,1,-0.0252917584998426 20140508220000,0,-2,0,-0.0108397167220604 20140508230000,-1,-2,0,-0.0505725535527163 201405090,0,-2,0,0.0144560896277541 And the ideal here is: -0.00361363061468619 Etc. - in essence I need to feed LIBSVM sets of data , not just atomic rows of data. Either I can just keep my original format (normalized) and configure LIBSVM's training/prediction routine to do that somehow, OR I need to convert my five rows into one row , and I have no clue how to do that. Actually I really hope that this is done via some kernel hyperparam and not via the CSV. Otherwise it would require a different CSV input file for differing ranges of data sets. And that would be very complicated and error prone. I hope all this made sense. Can someone PLEASE point me in the right direction? Any input would be much appreciated. UPDATE: I think I'm starting to see the light! Just to clarify - I have no problem with HOW to format my data once I fully understand the needed format. Let's assume I use regression and a window of 3 days of data with three input values per day. Per my understanding this involves creating a multi-dimensional vector, thus this would be the proper input matrix for a 3x3 vector: response_variable 1:day1-1 2:day1-2 3:day1-3 4:day2-1 5:day2-2 6:day2-3 7:day3-1 8:day3-2 9:day3-3 For SVC my response variable would most likely be an int representing a category, e.g. up/down (-1/1) and for SVR something like a normalized ROC (e.g. 0.014). Can someone please confirm this? Thanks in advance! :-)
