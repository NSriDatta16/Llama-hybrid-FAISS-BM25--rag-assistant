LSTM for time series forcasting

I manipulate the time series using the different structures of the neural networks in order to make a prediction, and I wonder if there is a way to choose the parameters of the networks intelligently? from the characteristics of the signal, namely (trend, seasonality ...) can we choose these parameters that will make learning better?
