Another technique is to stores you static images, css and js on another server (such as a CDN ) which has the Expires header set properly. The advantage of this is two-fold: The expires header will encourage browsers and proxies to cache these static files The CDN will offload from your server serving up static files. By using another domain name for your static content, browsers will download faster. This is because serving resources from four or five different hostnames increases parallelization of downloads . If the CDN is configured properly and uses cookieless domain then you don't have unnecessary cookies going back and forth.
