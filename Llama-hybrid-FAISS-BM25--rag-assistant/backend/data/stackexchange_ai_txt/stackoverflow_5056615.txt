comparing two sets of text

I have two paragraphs of text, one is saved in a file while the other is the piece entered by a user willing to write the same actual paragraph. Now I want to compare the two and tell the user how efficient was he to copy the same paragraph. Any techniques on how to do it ? I was thinking of these issues which make it complex. What if the user spelled a word wrong What if the user skipped a word in between What if the user skipped two words and the rest of the text is same.
