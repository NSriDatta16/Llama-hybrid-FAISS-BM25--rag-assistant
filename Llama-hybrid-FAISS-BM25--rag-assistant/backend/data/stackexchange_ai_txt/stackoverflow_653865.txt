As an alternative to function order list, just group the code that will be called within the same sections: #pragma code_seg(".startUp") //... #pragma code_seg #pragma data_seg(".startUp") //... #pragma data_seg It should be easy to maintain as your code changes, but has the same benefit as the function order list. I am not sure whether function order list can specify global variables as well, but use this #pragma data_seg would simply work.
