The only thing you can do is to try to put as much data as possible in the cookie (browser user-agent,os, screen resolution,...). you have to scramble/encrypt the data. if you read the cookie again sometime you can check if the values still match. but of course this is no 100% safe solution since all these data can be faked by a malicious user (if he knows what exactly he needs to change)
