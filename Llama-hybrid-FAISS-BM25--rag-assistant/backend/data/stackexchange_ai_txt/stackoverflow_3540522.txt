Use user scripts. There are scripts to move and delete lines yet. You have to define key binds for those scripts (menu Scripts -> Edit User Scripts... , under xCode 3.2). To duplicate line, you have to make your own script. But it's very simple ! Duplicate the "Move Line Down" script and remove the line which delete selected text : delete (paragraphs startLine through endLine)
