Adding OutputCache to an ASP.NET WebForm crashes my site :(

When I add either one of these ... or (.. and this into the web.config file...) my page/site crashes with the following error:- Source: System.Web ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- TargetSite: System.Web.DirectoryMonitor FindDirectoryMonitor(System.String, Boolean, Boolean) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Message:System.Web.HttpException: Directory 'C:\Web Sites\My Site Foo - Main Site\Controls\InfoAdvice' does not exist. Failed to start monitoring file changes. at System.Web.FileChangesMonitor.FindDirectoryMonitor(String dir, Boolean addIfNotFound, Boolean throwOnError) at System.Web.FileChangesMonitor.StartMonitoringPath(String alias, FileChangeEventHandler callback, FileAttributesData& fad) at System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency.Init(Boolean isPublic, String[] filenamesArg, String[] cachekeysArg, CacheDependency dependency, DateTime utcStart) at System.Web.Caching.CacheDependency..ctor(Int32 dummy, String[] filenames, DateTime utcStart) at System.Web.Hosting.MapPathBasedVirtualPathProvider.GetCacheDependency(String virtualPath, IEnumerable virtualPathDependencies, DateTime utcStart) at System.Web.ResponseDependencyList.CreateCacheDependency(CacheDependencyType dependencyType, CacheDependency dependency) at System.Web.HttpResponse.CreateCacheDependencyForResponse(CacheDependency dependencyVary) at System.Web.Caching.OutputCacheModule.InsertResponse(HttpResponse response, HttpContext context, String keyRawResponse, HttpCachePolicySettings settings, CachedVary cachedVary, CachedRawResponse memoryRawResponse) at System.Web.Caching.OutputCacheModule.OnLeave(Object source, EventArgs eventArgs) at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute() at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously) Ok .. so for some reason, the OutputCache wants a folder/file to be there? ? ? ? Well, i've had this site live for around 3 years and i'm pretty sure that the folders \Controls and \Controls\InfoAdvice doesn't exist on my production server. On my localhost, it sure does .. and contains a large list of ascx controls. But they don't exist on my live server. So ... what is going on here? Can anyone please help? Oh :) Before someone suggests I create those two folders and even stick a random file in those folders .. and have some random text in those random files .. i've done that and it doesn't seem to work, still :( Please Help ! Update When i tried to do a FAILED REQUEST TRACE with IIS, I noticed this.... alt text http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/1351/notsure.png
