The input, as you suggested, should be the sequence you're trying to predict concatenated with the day of year. The output should just be the predicted value of the sequence at the next time-step, there's no need to predict the next day of year as well, since you already know what it will be. One hot should be ok with just 365 categories. It only starts to get problematic with language models when you have tens of thousands of words in your vocabulary. Another thing which may be important is to apply some sort of transformation to your sequence (maybe log) which will make predicting huge values much easier without having huge gradients and associated issues.
