See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-sequence.html , near the bottom of the page. Specifically, at least in Postgresql 9.0, you can find and set the value of a sequence. You can use the three-argument form of setval() to set either the current value of the sequence or the next value of the sequence (which would allow you to set the sequence to 1 on the next value retrieval).
