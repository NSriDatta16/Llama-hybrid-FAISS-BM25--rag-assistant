The use of feature scaling in scikit learn

I'm studing machine learning from here and the course uses 'Scikit Learn' for regression - https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/ I can see that for some training regression algorithms, the author uses feature scaling and for some he doesn't because some 'Scikit Learn' regression algorithms take care of feature scaling by themselves. If I apply feature scaling to an algorithm which already has feature scaling internally, will it affect in any way ? Can I always apply feature scaling, no matter whether the algorithm I'm using has a system of feature scaling internally or not ?
