Rating system for zero-sum games that has good theoretical properties compared to Elo rating?

The Elo rating system is widely used in two-player zero-sum games/sports like Chess. It is not obvious to me that the Elo rating system is has the "nicest" theoretical properties out of all conceivable rating systems. As an example, Microsoft's TrueSKill takes into account uncertainty about the players' skill level (side-note: it is a bit bizarre to me that an algorithm as simple as TrueSkill, essentially just an approximation of bayesian inference, has been patented). Nevertheless TrueSkill still seems somewhat ad-hoc to me. Is there a (set of) rating system(s) for zero-sum games that have provably good theoretical properties? I am not interested in practical constraints. For example, we can assume that we have access to the entire set of games ever played (containing the identifier of each player, the time it was played, the score achieved), and that computation-cost is not an issue.
