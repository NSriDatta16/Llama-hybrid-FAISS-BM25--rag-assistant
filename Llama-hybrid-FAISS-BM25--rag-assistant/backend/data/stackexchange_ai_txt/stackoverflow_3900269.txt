ExtJS: add button to htmleditor

I am using ExtJS and I have a htmleditor in my form. I would like to add a custom button to that element (for example after all other buttons like alignments, font weights, ...). This button should basically insert a standard template in the htmlfield. Being this template html, the behaviour of the button should be like this Switch to HTML mode (like when pressing Source button) Insert something Switch back to WYSIWYG mode (like when pressing the Source button again) Thanks for your attention
