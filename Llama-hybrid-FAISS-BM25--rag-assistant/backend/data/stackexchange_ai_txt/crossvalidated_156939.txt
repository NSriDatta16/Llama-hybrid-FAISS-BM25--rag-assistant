There are perhaps too many questions here. Some comments: you might consider using glmer from the lme4 package ( glmer(Y~X*Z+(1|cluster),family=binomial,data=sim_data) ); it uses Laplace approximation or Gauss-Hermite quadrature, which are generally more accurate than PQL (although the answers are very similar in this case). The niter argument specifies the maximum number of iterations; only one iteration was actually necessary I'm not sure what your question is about the interaction term. Whether you should drop non-significant interaction terms or not is a bit of a can of worms, and depends both on your statistical philosophy and on the goals of your analysis (e.g. see this question ) the denominator degrees of freedom are being calculated according to a simple 'inner-outer' heuristic a simple 'inner-outer' rule described on page 91 of Pinheiro and Bates (2000), which is available on Google Books ... it is generally a reasonable approximation but the computation of degrees of freedom is complex, especially for GLMMs if you're trying to replicate "A simulation study of sample size for multilevel logistic regression models" by Moineddin et al. (DOI: 10.1186/1471-2288-7-34), you need to run a large number of simulations and compute averages, not just compare a single run. Furthermore, you should probably try to get closer to their methods (coming back to my first point, they state that they use SAS PROC NLMIXED with adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature, so you'd be better off with e.g. glmer(...,nAGQ=10) ; it still won't match exactly, but it'll probably be closer than glmmPQL .
