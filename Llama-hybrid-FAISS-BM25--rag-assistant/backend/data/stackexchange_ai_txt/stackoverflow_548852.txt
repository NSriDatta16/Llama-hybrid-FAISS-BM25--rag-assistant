ASP.Net Time Localization

I'm working on a site that lets users add calendar entries, on the main page all users can then see these entries with some text saying how long until those entries are current for example Entry 1 : 5 Minutes Entry 2 : 7 Hours Entry 3 : 4 Days The problem I'm having is that everyone could be in different timezones. I've decided I want to store all times/dates in GMT. What I'm sturggling with is when a user submits a calendar entry say for 1/1/2009 10:30AM I then need to work out what this date time is in GMT for storage. Is there a way of knowing what the users local timezone/time is so I can compare it to server time (GMT) to make the conversion? I really hope this makes sense. I'm hoping I can do this without having to ask the user what timezone they are in, or forcing the user to enter all datetimes in GMT.
