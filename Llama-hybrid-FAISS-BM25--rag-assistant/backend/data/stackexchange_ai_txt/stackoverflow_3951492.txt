Your aim would be to encourage repeated content. So bar ... bof might indeed be easier to compress than bar ... bof , and both would typically compress easier than bar ... bof . But really, the difference is going to be minuscule. You'd be much better off just writing your markup in the most readable fashion for your own benefit and letting mod_deflate get on with its job. You're going to have to go a long way to save even a single TCP packet with this kind of micro-optimisation, and second-guessing the compressor at a micro level can often generate unexpected, possibly negative results. For some elements readability might well also mean putting the ‘common’ attributes first, eg is usually the first listed attribute; typically you'll work out your own attribute order style and if it's consistent I suppose that'll save you a few bytes here and there. I wouldn't choose raw alphabetical as the consistent order. All that has going for it is that it's what Canonical XML will produce. Even google.com's front page, infamous for its dedication to shaving off bytes at the expense of readability, basic validation and every kind of good practice, doesn't bother use one consistent order for attributes.
