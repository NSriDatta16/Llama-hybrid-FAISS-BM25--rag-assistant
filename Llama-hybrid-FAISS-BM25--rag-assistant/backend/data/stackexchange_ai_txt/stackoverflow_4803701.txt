fortran and James covered it pretty well already, but one other thing I'd like to mention, which fortran kind of hinted at when talking about inertia, is the gigantic pool of libraries available in C++. Having multiple C++ libraries for almost anything you can possibly think of is a huge reason not to switch to Java. That's not to say that there aren't libraries out there for Java right now, but the C++ ones are already mature and have large communities of experienced devs. Not having to rewrite the same thing you've done 1000x before is a big time-saver.
