First off, How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? may be enlightening. The drivers of TV viewership that you are modeling are not very strong. Weather may have been a useful predictor forty years ago or more, when there were only two TV channels, so when people were driven inside by bad weather, they only had a choice between these two channels (and reading books, or talking to their family). So the weather effect was concentrated on just two or four different possible outcomes. Today, we have hundreds of different TV channels. (Since you are including "program category before/after" as a predictor, it sounds like you are modeling per channel.) Plus people can watch their favorite shows on demand. So if the weather drives them inside, the effect will be distributed across hundreds of possible outcomes, plus people just deciding not to watch TV at all, but catch up on their favorite shows on Netflix, YouTube or other sites. "Program category before/after" is also likely not very strong. Yes, of course there is some inertia. But again, with hundreds of channels, the temptation is strong to just flip through the other channels to see what is there, instead of waiting through the inevitable commercial break to see what will come on the channel I have been watching next. Again, sixty years ago, TV sets had to be changed by getting up from your couch - but today, remote controls mean we don't even have to get up any more. Bottom line: you are modeling very weak predictors. This will only work if you have * a lot* of data. (I gave an illustration in Kolassa, 2016, Foresight .) And you don't have that here. Even if your history goes back multiple years, the data generating process has changed, simply because alternatives like YouTube and Netflix were vastly less important a few years ago. In a situation like this, simple time series algorithms are very hard to beat. The best way forward, per the link at the very top, is to identify drivers you have not thought of yet. Not being a TV person, I can't help you there, with one exception: you almost certainly have multiple-seasonalities , namely diurnal patterns that are different on the weekend than during the week. So my recommendation would be to look at methods that were designed to model such multiple seasonalities, as an alternative to ARIMA. The tag wiki contains more information and pointers.
