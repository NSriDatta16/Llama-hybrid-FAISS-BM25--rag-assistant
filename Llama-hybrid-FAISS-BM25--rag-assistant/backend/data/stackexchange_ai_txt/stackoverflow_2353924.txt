Core Data Fetched Results Controller and Custom Section Header

I am familiar with the common and basic use of a NSFetchedResultsController managing the rows of a table, but I have an interesting problem. My data is organized as such: Schedule > Day > Route. I currently have a table view that has Schedules with a fetch controller managing the creation and deletion of Schedules. I now want to create a table view for Routes/Days. I would like to list a Route on every row, and create custom section headers that correspond to information within the relevant Day. I could probably hack something together by fetching all the routes, and then sectioning them by the inverse relationship to there respective Day, but I am worried that then I will not be able to take advantage of the fetch controller delegate methods for updating the table when managed objects change. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any ideas on how to move forward? Thanks.
