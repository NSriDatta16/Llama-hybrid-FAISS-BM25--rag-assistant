Frequentist statistics tell you the probability of obtaining a given data set for a given model. If the data are unlikely given a model, people interpret that as the model being incorrect. If the data are likely given a model, people interpret that as the model being satisfactory. Bayesian statistics formalize this using a prior, allowing one to say how probable a model is given data.
