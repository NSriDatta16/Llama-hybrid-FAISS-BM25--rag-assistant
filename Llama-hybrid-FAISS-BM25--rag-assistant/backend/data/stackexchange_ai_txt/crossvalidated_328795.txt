Why by decreasing the depth of the random forest, the overall accuracy decreases?

If you decrease the maximum depth that the random forest can reach instead of letting the RF to fully grow, what happens to the performance and Overall Accuracy (OA) of the RF? As I have tested the OA decreases. What is the reason?
