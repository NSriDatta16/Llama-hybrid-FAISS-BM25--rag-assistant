This depends on how you deploy application for each client, If each client gets their own Tomcat installation (they have different CATALINA_HOME), there is no chance for it to cross. If they all use the same installation but run as different host in Tomcat, you need to make sure you don't define the datasource in conf/context.xml, which is shared by all hosts. If all clients share the same Tomcat instances and they are simply different web apps, more attention is required. You need to define the datasource either in META-INF/context.xml or WEB-INF/web.xml. For further isolation, you should copy dbcp.jar to WEB-INF/lib of each application so they use their own DBCP instance.
