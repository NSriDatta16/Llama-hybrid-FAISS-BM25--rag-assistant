Passing parameter to next JSP page by a 3rd-party-Servlet-generated form

I'm trying to fix a bug in a legacy application in my organization. I need to pass an extra parameter in a dynamically generated form. page1.jsp ... The Servlet1 is calling another Servlet2 , which in turn calls Servlet3 to print some code to page1.jsp . The generated HTML output looks like this: ... ... I need to be able to pass "param" value from page1.jsp to page2.jsp . The request.setAttribute() is not working. The Servlet class Servlet3 is vendor provided, so I cannot set a hidden form variable inside form "yy" to pass it to page2.jsp . How can I achieve this in other way?
