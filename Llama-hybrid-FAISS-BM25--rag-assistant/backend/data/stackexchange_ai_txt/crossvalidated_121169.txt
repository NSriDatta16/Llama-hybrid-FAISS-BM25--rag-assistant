As @ttnphns and @nick-cox said, SVD is a numerical method and PCA is an analysis approach (like least squares). You can do PCA using SVD, or you can do PCA doing the eigen-decomposition of $X^T X$ (or $X X^T$), or you can do PCA using many other methods, just like you can solve least squares with a dozen different algorithms like Newton's method or gradient descent or SVD etc. So there is no "advantage" to SVD over PCA because it's like asking whether Newton's method is better than least squares: the two aren't comparable.
