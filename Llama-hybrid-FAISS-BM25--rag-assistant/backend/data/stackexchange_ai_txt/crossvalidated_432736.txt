It seems that your data have panel form. There are two dimensions: Country and Time. It has been my experience when running machine learning methods (like neural networks , random forests , boosted trees or SVM ) on data with the time dimension that it helps to compress time into many summary features. Almost always. For example, you could calculate running minima, maxima, mean, volatility, strength of trend, strength of reversion and whatever else makes sense from the domain point of view. As much as I like random forests and such, they are not capable of figuring out such high-dimensional (spread in time) transformations on their own. Domain knowledge helps, typically. You have much data. Sure, logistic regression can be tried. But I would not be surprised if a more complex and flexible machine learning method would work better in this situation. To avoid overfitting you can always employ something like cross-validaton and/or early stopping. Hope I have partially answered your question. If I have misunderstood your problem, please let me know.
