How can I check if a package is installed and install it if not?

I'm working on a Ubuntu system and currently this is what I'm doing: if ! which command > /dev/null; then echo -e "Command not found! Install? (y/n) \c" read if "$REPLY" = "y"; then sudo apt-get install command fi fi Is this what most people would do? Or is there a more elegant solution?
