What is the most common KIC? How does it work?

Information Criterions are methods of assessing model fit penalized for the number of estimated parameters. Another question on the site asked for a comparison between the KIC and two other common information criterions, AIC and BIC. The AIC and BIC seem to be commonly agreed to refer to the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion respectively. If it isn't specified, which Information Criterion is most likely to be referred to if someone asks about the KIC? A quick Google Scholar search shows a "Kullback Information Criterion" and a "Kashyap Information Criterion". Are there any other likely candidates? AIC has been associated with LOO whereas BIC has been associated with K-fold cross validation. Is there a similar metaphor for the type of information being captured by KIC? If so, what is it? If not, what characteristics of the KIC are notable for causing one to use KIC in favor of other information criteria?
