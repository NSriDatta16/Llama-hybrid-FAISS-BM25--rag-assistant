Since you do not provide the likelihood, let us assume that $Z|\theta$ is a Binomial $\mathcal{B}(20,\theta)$ variate and its realisation is $z=14$ . The posterior distribution on $\theta$ is then a Beta $\mathcal{B}e(15,7)$ [for which MCMC is not required]. If running a Normal random walk proposal for simulating this target, the moves are accepted with probability $$\min\left\{ \dfrac{\pi(\theta')}{\pi(\theta_t)},1\right\}$$ where $\pi(\cdot)$ is the density of the Beta $\mathcal{B}e(15,7)$ . This means running a code like T=1e4 p=rep(runif(1),T) for (t in 2:T){ p[t]=prop=p[t-1]+rnorm(1,sd=.2) if ((prop 1)|(runif(1)>dbeta(prop,15,7)/dbeta(p[t-1],15,7))) p[t]=p[t-1]} length(unique(p))/T which returns 0.4862 in my case
