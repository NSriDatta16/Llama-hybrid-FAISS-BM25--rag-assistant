Assuming that the two populations have roughly the same and pretty much uniform characteristics (demographics basically) and you want to test the difference of a numerical variable (revenue gained or ROI or whatever) what I would do if I were you is: Split the dataset to train and test sets at random 1.4M baseline and 70K exposed to advertising training set and the rest 0.6M and 30K test set Split the training set into many smaller datasets (with replacement) consisting of a balanced 50-50 sample from both exposed and non exposed to advertising. Use cross validation to tune the model's parameters (you can try many different kinds of models here) to predicting the difference between your response variable in the two groups. To assess how accurate your model is split the testing set dataset again into equal advertised and non advertised people but this time without replacement in the non-advertised population and the same people every time in the advertised population (i'm open to different approaches here) and see how well your model predicts the difference between the two populations in these (unseen) data. Re iterate the above process from step 1, changing the seed every time, and report the average error (difference between predicted and actual value)
