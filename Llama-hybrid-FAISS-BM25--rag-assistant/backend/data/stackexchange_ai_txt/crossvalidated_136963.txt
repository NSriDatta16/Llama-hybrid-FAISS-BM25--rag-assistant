How do I model the probability of a win in a particular matchup, given historical win/loss data for the players

Let's say I have two numbers: the historical probability player A wins when playing a particular game (found by counting the number of times A has won, and dividing by the total number of times she has played), $P(win_A|A_{vs}anyone)$ the historical probability player B loses when playing the same game (found by counting the number of times B has lost, and dividing by the total number of times she has played), $P(lose_B|anyone_{vs}B)$ Let's assume it's a game with no ties, i.e. win and lose are the only outcomes. How do I use these two numbers to calculate the probability of A winning when she plays B, $P(win_A|A_{vs}B)$? I've cast this question as a sports question. For example, you could imagine $P(win_A|A_{vs}anyone)$ being the historical batting average of hitter, and $P(lose_B|anyone_{vs}B)$ being the fraction of opponents a pitcher has faced who made a hit. Or these probabilities could by the historical probability of striker A scoring a penalty in football/soccer, and the probability of goalkeeper B conceding a penalty. But it's a description of so many situations, and it seems so generic a problem that I assume I am missing something totally obvious! It feels somehow Bayesian to me, but I got in a mess trying to cast it in those terms. Bonus points : how do you estimate $P(win_A|A_{vs}B)$ if $P(win_A|A_{vs}anyone)$ is expressed as a distribution , the probability of A winning as a function of the historical probability of their opponent losing, and $P(lose_B|anyone_{vs}B)$ is also a distribution as a function on the historical probability of their opponent winning. Notation : feel free to adopt different notation if you find mine confusing, or there are better conventions!
