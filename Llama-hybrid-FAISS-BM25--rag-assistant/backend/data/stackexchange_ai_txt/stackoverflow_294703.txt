If bandwidth/download speed is not a concern, I recommend you use an uncompressed tar file. TAR is a very simple format, so it will be easy to write code to update sections of it when a few of the files have changed. Also, leaving it uncompressed will be a huge win on server CPU time. Of course, leaving it uncompressed will take a lot of storage space on your server. But since it is uncompressed, it might remove the need for you to keep a cache copy of the file at all, if you can build it fast enough you can just build it on the fly as needed. Then you don't have to worry about storing CRCs and updating the TAR, either.
