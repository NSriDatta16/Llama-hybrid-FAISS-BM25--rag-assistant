MySql Query:: How to solve the problem of 's in data, when query is fired

I am facing such problem in which 's is present in data. while searching it does not shows data. I wanna remove SQL injection issue Code :: @search_condition = "" if !search_text.nil? search_field = search_text.split("-") @search_condition = "( address_books.organization_name like '#{search_text}%' or address_books.business_name like '#{search_text}%' or address_books.federal_tax_id like '#{search_text}%' or address_books.city like '#{search_text}%' or address_books.zip like '#{search_text}%' ) " if search_field.length == 1 if search_text.include? "-" if search_field.length
