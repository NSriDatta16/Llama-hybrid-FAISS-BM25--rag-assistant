You can try to avoid the eval function if you use a switch statement and go throguh the values. check this: switch statement in Jquery and List Also the solution that Meder proposed was good. @Gaby - your solution will not perform the addition properly. it will just concatenate both numbers unless you use the parseInt(). @Anurag - It is in the interest of everyone to keep place positive. If you don not wish to contribute to a question then keep going. don't just stop and hurl comments that do not contribute to the question. That does not do any good to the community.
