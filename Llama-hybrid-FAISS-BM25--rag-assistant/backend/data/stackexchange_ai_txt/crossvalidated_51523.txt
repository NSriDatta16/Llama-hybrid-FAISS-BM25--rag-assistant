Log transformation in CART analysis

I'm working as a liaison between a researcher and a stats team at a university. I'm a database admin who is working on using business intelligence tools to offer the option of (as of right now) offer CART analyses in .PDF form over the internet. I'm using Microsoft Business Intelligence Development Studio to do this. Recently I received an email saying that the measure (or independent variable I guess it should be called here) was highly skewed and the original CART analysis didn't make sense. Fair enough, I know that sometimes these things don't work out like you had hoped. Then, another analysis was done with a log transformation. Can someone point me to a good quick and dirty resource so I can read up on this? I'm not a complete stats novice, but ANOVAs and logistic regressions are about as far as my knowledge extends.
