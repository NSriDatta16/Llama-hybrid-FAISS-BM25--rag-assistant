Bootstrap diagnostics and remedies by Canto, Davison, Hinkley & Ventura (2006) seems to be a logical point of departure. They discuss multiple ways the bootstrap can break down and - more importantly here - offer diagnostics and possible remedies: Outliers Incorrect resampling model Nonpivotality Inconsistency of the bootstrap method I don't see a problem with 1, 2 and 4 in this situation. Let's look at 3. As @Ben Ogorek notes (although I agree with @Glen_b that the normality discussion may be a red herring), the validity of the bootstrap depends on the pivotality of the statistic we are interested in. Section 4 in Canty et al. suggests resampling-within-resamples to get a measure of bias and variance for the parameter estimate within each bootstrap resample . Here is code to replicate the formulas from p. 15 of the article: library(boot) m Note the log scales - without logs, this is even more blatant. We see nicely how the variance of the bootstrap mean estimate goes up with the mean of the bootstrap sample. This to me looks like enough of a smoking gun to attach blame to nonpivotality as a culprit for the low confidence interval coverage. However, I'll happily admit that one could follow up in lots of ways. For instance, we could look at how whether the confidence interval from a specific bootstrap replicate includes the true mean depends on the mean of the particular replicate. As for remedies, Canty et al. discuss transformations, and logarithms come to mind here (e.g., bootstrap and build confidence intervals not for the mean, but for the mean of the logged data), but I couldn't really make it work. Canty et al. continue to discuss how one can reduce both the number of inner bootstraps and the remaining noise by importance sampling and smoothing as well as add confidence bands to the pivot plots. This might be a fun thesis project for a smart student. I'd appreciate any pointers to where I went wrong, as well as to any other literature. And I'll take the liberty of adding the diagnostic tag to this question.
