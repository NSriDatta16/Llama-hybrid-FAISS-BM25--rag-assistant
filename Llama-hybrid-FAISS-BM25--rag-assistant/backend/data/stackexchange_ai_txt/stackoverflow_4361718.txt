What is your experience from real-life, who should be responsible for a choice of agile planning tools to be used by the agile/scrum team? Well my experience from real life is that, certain "Agile Planning Tools" tools were handed to the Scrum Teams before they even started their Sprints, fortunately the Teams liked it, but we were free to inspect and adapt to using something else if it did not work out for us. I think it should be in the Teams power to use, accept or reject a tool in a completely transparent way. They could very well take suggestions from the Scrum Master or an Agile Coach because (s)he may have more knowledge in the Agile Tools area. Secondly, the Team should be courageous enough to have a collective discussion and decide on using a tool based on the Agile Coach's suggestions, and see how it works for them, and adapt and adjust from using it if it does not work for them (productivity-wise) The bigger question which you did not ask is, how do you manage the differing tool set chaos when the company scales into having multiple Scrum Teams who use their own Agile Planning tools?. Well, I think realistically, in a scaling agile software company, a little bit of uniformity in tool usage across Scrum Teams can be beneficial and productive but that may be directed by the self organised enterprise project Team instead of each Team having their own tools. Off course there can be exceptions, where certain teams are working on completely different features and they need a totally different tool set, but the benefit of using common Agile tools will help scaling projects view their Teams progress without much of change in gear. The above can be done by having a Technical, Infrastructure and Process Tools Story which not many companies use or create. This EPIC story can be the starting point for discussion of what Agile tools and other tools can be used, to have a little uniformity within the project. While deriving the EPIC story the whole project team could be involved around project kick off, if it is too big then 1 - 2 members can represent each of the Teams. The story could be broken down exactly like business user stories, and modified accordingly and calibrated, estimated and prioritized through out the project from an infrastructure and tools stand point. Let me know if you want me to go in more detail about this.
