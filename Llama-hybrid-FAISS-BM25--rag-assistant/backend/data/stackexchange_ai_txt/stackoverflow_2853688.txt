Consider the engines used. Since cross-platform differences in browsers using the same engine (e.g.: Chrome, Safari) should be neglible you could get away with virtualizing 3 (IE6, IE7, IE8) and adding Safari, Chrome, FF and Opera versions to one of those virtal machines. At one point Microsoft also distributed VM images specifically targeted at testing cross IE compatibility. If you're aiming for ultimate coverage you should also be prepared to add Firefox 2.x, 3.0, etc...
