How to install OpenCV 2.0 on win32

I need to install OpenCV on Win32. I do not have it installed currently. I downloaded OpenCV-2.0.0a-win32.exe and ran it. What the heck do I do now? There are no .lib's and whatnot. I found some instructions for building the release using cmake at http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide . I downloaded the latest and greatest cmake, and tried to follow the instructions, but I was guessing. No joy. I specified VC++9 when I did the "configure," but cmake built a VC++ 6 dsw file. No vcproj. I converted the dsw into a vc++9 vcproj anyway, just to see if it would work. Nope. It compiled lots of files, but many failed because it could not find omp.h. Sure enough, it's not there, anywhere. The build log said, 'A tool returned an error code from "Performing Custom Build Step".' I am lost. Ideally, I would like to find a full installation with all the files pre-built for Win32 vc++ 2008. Failing that, I need instructions that even I can follow. Short sentences and small words, but lots of them. Please help! UPDATE: I tried to build just CXCORE. It complained, "cannot open file 'VCOMPD.lib'" There's that OMP again.
