Version-controlling version-specific files

Imagine an application with several released versions: V1.0, V1.1, and V1.2. Now imagine one or more associated files that are version-specific, for example a user manual, a functional test suite, or some technical documentation. Ideally these files would be checked into version together with the application itself, so that it's easy to view and/or check out all the files relating to a specific version (e.g. to run the functional tests as part of a continuous build). The problem is that any of these files might need to be updated even when the code is not. For example, we might discover errors in the V1.0 user manual that we want to fix for the benefit of customers still using that version. Or we might want to improve the coverage of the functional tests for V1.2 in order to discover bugs in that version before our customers do. Having changed those files accordingly, how do we commit them to version control? We're not releasing new versions of the software, just new versions of the files that go with them. FWIW, we're using SVN.
