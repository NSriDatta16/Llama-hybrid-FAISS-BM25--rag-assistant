Reading the help file for fa: complexity Hoffman's index of complexity for each item. This is just $\{(\sum_i a_i^2)^2\}/\{\sum_i a_i^4\}$ where $a_i$ is the factor loading on the $i$ th factor. From Hofmann (1978), MBR. See also Pettersson and Turkheimer (2010). Complexity (com) is reported for every item. The mean complexity is the average across items.
