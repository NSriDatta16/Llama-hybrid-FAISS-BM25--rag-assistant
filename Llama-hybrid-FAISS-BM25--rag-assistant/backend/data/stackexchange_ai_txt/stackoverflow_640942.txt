Why are you passing $filecount? The [passed-in] value is not being used; the only usage is at "$total += $filecount" and you're overriding $filecount just before that. You're missing the case when the function encounters a regular (non-dir) file. Edit: I just noticed the call to glob(). It's not necessary. Your function is recursively touching every file in the whole directory tree, anyway. See @Paolo Bergantino's answer.
