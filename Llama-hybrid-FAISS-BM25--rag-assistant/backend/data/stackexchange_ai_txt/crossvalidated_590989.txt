"Random" effects from "fixed" variables (in logistic regression)?

I've been getting a bit lost in translation when it comes to the term "random" in "random effects" and "random sampling". I found a lot of useful posts on how to define a fixed or random effect, but I can't seem to bridge the gap between these definitions and how I should analyze my data. I'm attempting to fit a logistic regression model to my observations that come from fixed sites/locations of interest over time (there are non-dependence issues given the repeated measures nature of the data). I've heard that modelling the site/location variable as a "random effect" fixes this non-independence problem, but I don't understand how to interpret this advice back to the real world situation. As in, where is the random effect coming from in a fixed variable? Understandably, these locations are underwater so conditions can vary a little with time, but I thought the definition of a "fixed" effect was that: All values of location of interest are present for all observations and not randomly selected I'm only making inferences about the site/location values I've collected from For example, the presence/absence of sharks can be modeled with the variables "location", "changes in temperature" and "time" (1 value (present or absent) with 1 temperature reading and 1 time stamp, per site, for many sites, twice per year). As I understand it, logistic regression requires independent observations and since I have fixed/repeated observations over time, I don't understand how making this variable a random effect will help... Unfortunately I have to work with the data I'm given and can't resample. I'm open to different ideas as well, thank you!
