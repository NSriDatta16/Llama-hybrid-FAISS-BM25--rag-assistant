What does it mean by "approach the performance of the Bayesian gold standard"?

It is a sentence in Dropout paper(Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting). "This can sometimes be approximated quite well for simple or small models, but we would like to approach the performance of the Bayesian gold standard using considerably less computation" What does it mean by "approach the performance of the Bayesian gold standard" ? Plus, I don't understand the next sentence too. "We propose to do this by approximating an equally weighted geometric mean of the predictions of an exponential number of learned models that share parameters"
