I'm really not sure I understand your question, but I will take a stab at it. Why not create a servlet and have it call your jsp file using the following: RequestDispatcher d = getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher(jspName); d.forward(request, response); Have the jsp show the front end with the form / user inputted values. When the form is completed, submit the form. At which point the jsp will return context to the servlet where you can parse the values, determine which files to create and return to the user. Once you have determined what you want to display to the user, throw it into another jsp and pass the context to that jsp. You can do this in 2 ways. You can create a different jsp for the different filetypes you wish to return and simply call the proper one. Or You can pass whatever structures / values you want into your jsp by embedding them in the request and then getting them within your jsp. You can use this fact to create a single jsp that based on passed in parameters(embedded within the request) will display the proper information. If I completely missed the point of your question, feel free to delete this response. Edit: Either way you will have to embed your values within the request.
