How can I know that what is the problem Easy. Refer to the error log of the webserver. how can I get the actual problem to display to the user ? NEVER do it. An average user will unerstand nothing of this error. A malicious user should get no feedback, especially in a form of very informative error message. Just show a page with excuses. If you don't have access to the server's error log, your task become more complicated. There are several ways to get in touch with error messages. To display error messages on screen you can add these lines to the code ini_set('display_errors',1); error_reporting(E_ALL); or to make custom error logfile ini_set('log_errors',1); ini_set('error_log','/absolute/path/tp/log_file'); and there are some other ways. but you must understand that without actual error message you can't move. It's hard to be blind in the dark
