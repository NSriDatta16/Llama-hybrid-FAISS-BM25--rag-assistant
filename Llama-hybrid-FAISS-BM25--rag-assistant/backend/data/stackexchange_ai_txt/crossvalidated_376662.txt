WISARD stamds for WILKIE STONHAM AND ALEXANDER. A Neural network based on hardware RAMs hardwired to be a perceptron system. This is described in one of ALEXANDERS own books. The difference that it made was to bring back the industry's attention to Neural Networks after the disastrous paper issued by Prof. Marvin and Minsky on the linearity of Neural Networks in other words that any problem that they could solve would be linear and non linear. The WISARD system proved that NN work and it strated a new silemt revolution at the time.
