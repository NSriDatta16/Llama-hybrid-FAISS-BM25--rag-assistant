How is slope calculated in a calibration plot?

I am using logistic regression with white cell count and temperature as predictors and hospital admission>3 days as the outcome of interest. I'm using the rms package in R to assess calibration (curve generated by val.prob ) and having some difficulty interpreting the output. My specific questions are, how is slope calculated and how is the intercept calculated? The smooth line logistic calibration I believe is generated by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess). And qualitatively I believe this is a poorly calibrated model. However, I don't understand how to interpret the slope or intercept given that the slope differs along the curve. Any help would be appreciated.
