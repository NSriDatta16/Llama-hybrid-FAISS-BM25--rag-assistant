Similarity measure between training and testing loss to identify overfitting

I am new to machine learning and I would like to know whether my trained CNN is overfitting. So I have drawn the curves training and testing losses versus the training epochs. I have trained my CNN for about $50$ epochs with a learning rate equal to $10^{-3}$ that decreases every $3$ epochs by a factor $0.5$. I found an answer to this question How to Identify Overfitting in Convolutional Neural network? but I couldn't find an exact similarity measure between the testing and training error/loss to make a decision. I have attached the figure of these curves below and I would appreciate any comment.
