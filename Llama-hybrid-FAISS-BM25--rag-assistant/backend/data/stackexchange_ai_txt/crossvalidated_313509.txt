Clusters of variables interpretation

I am doing clustering of variables using hclustvar() function from ClustOfVar package in R. The example given in R for the decathlon data is: data(decathlon) tree The function does the PCA and then analyze projections of variables on main components to detect those variables that have similar coordinates. However I still don't know how to interprete the Y-axis on the plot which is called Height . Could anybody help me with the interpretation? Thanks!
