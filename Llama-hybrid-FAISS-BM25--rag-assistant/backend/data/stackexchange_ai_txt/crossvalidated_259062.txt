A simple regression will be a good place to start. You can use the previous month's attendance % as a predictor for the current month. You want to check the p-value to see if it is significant (i.e. if your choice of using the previous month was a good one) There might be seasonality by month of the year (e.g. attendance may be low in months with holidays), so you can check to see if the month is a good predictor. Alternately you can check to see if the season in which the month falls (i.e. Fall, Winter,Spring, Summer) is a good predictor. Number of school days in a month is another one If you decide to try something more involved, Forecasting Principles and Practices by Rob Hyndman & George Athana­sopou­los , is a good online reference for modeling time series data. ARIMA or seasonal-ARIMA may be worth exploring
