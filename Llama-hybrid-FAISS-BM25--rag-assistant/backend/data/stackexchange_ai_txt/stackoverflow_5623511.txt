asp.net webservice object manipulation

Possibly not specific to webservices, but... I have a webmethod that returns: List myList = getList(); return new { data = myList , count = 5 }; It returns this as JSON. my code checks myList[x].fishsticks which isn't actually part of the Tadpole class (so it errors). I am wondering, can I add a fishsticks attribute to myList somehow to avoid the error, so it gets included when I return the data? Is there perhaps another elegant solution for doing this?
