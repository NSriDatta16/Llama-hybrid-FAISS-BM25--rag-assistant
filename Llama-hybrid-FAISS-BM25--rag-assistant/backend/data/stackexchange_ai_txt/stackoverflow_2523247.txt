Why should I use an N-Tier Approach When using an SqlDatasource is A LOT EASIER?

When it comes to web development I have always tried to work SMART not HARD. So for along time My Aproach to interacting with databases in my AspNet projects has been this : 1) Create my stored procedures 2) Drag an SQLDatasource control on my aspx page 3) Bind a DataList Control to my SQLDatasource 4) Insert, Update & Delete by using my Datalist or programmatically using built in SQLDatasource methods e.g MySqlDataSource.InsertParameters["author"].DefaultValue = TextBox1.Text; MySqlDataSource.Insert(); Recently however I got a relatively easy web project. So I decided to employ a 3-tier Model...But I got exhausted halfway and just didnt seem worth it ! It seemed like I was working too HARD for a project that could have been easily accomplished by a couple of SqlDataSource Controls. So Why Is the N-Tier Model better than my Approach? Has it anything to do with performance? What are the advantages of the ObjectDataSource control over the SqlDataSource Control?
