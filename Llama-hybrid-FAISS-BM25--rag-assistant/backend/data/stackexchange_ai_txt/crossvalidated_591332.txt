Probability of deviation from average

I would like to know how likely it is that a randomly sampled result is 14 percentage points above the actual average. I have 658 households, of which 6% are supposed to be rich. A random sample of 60 households returned 20% rich households. How likely is it that this was just a freak of probability or rather that either the sampling was not truly random or the initial supposition of 6% simply wrong? I would very much appreciate some help on this. Thanks.
