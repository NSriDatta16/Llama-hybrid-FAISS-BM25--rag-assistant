SQL data type question

I'm having some trouble choosing an appropriate data type for an attribute in a simple Oracle SQL database. Here's my situation, I have two tables - Customer and Agent. One of the attributes in my Agent table is called Signed Customers, I need it to hold a set of integers (customer numbers) as a sort of array. The primary key in Customer is Customer_ID and is INT. It has a relationship to "Signed Customers" type ??? in table Agent. So what should the type of "Signed Customers" be? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
