Covid-19 and life expectancy

A public figure in my home country said the following: "The life expectancy in our country is 82 years. The average age of those who die of covid-19 is also about 82 years. Hence, on average, people do not die from covid-19 disease at all. I am trying to construct a more formal explanation for why it is statistically wrong. The first thought is - The life expectancy is 82 at age 0, but at age 82 the life expectancy is probably larger, but again, not sure what is the formal jargon for this conditional life expectancy and how to prove / refute the statement. Any ideas? some knowledge about life expectancy and covid-19 ? what is the accepted jargon of conditional life expectancy or life expectancy at age X ?
