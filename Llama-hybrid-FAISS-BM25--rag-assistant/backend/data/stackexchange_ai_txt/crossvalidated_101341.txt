Interpolating time series wind data using correlation

Is there a way to use correlation to interpolate missing data? I know the wind speed in 6 locations every hour. This shows the correlation between the separate locations. Hourly Data I know the wind speed in one of the locations every 5 minutes. 5 Min Data Is there a way to use this information to create 5 minute wind speed information for all locations? I have been using Python to analyze my data so far but can use R as well, just less familiar with R.
