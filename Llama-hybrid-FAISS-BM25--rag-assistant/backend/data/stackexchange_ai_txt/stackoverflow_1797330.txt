ASP.NET MVC - Dynamic action and parameter for a form

I'm working on a bit of MVC where I'm needing to dynamically route a form to a certain action and parameter combination. So far, I've got this: PageViewModel { public string Action {get;set;} public string Parameter {get;set;} /*... other properties for the form */ } PageController { public ViewResult MyAction(string myParamterName) { return View("CommonView", new PageViewModel{Action="MyAction", Parameter="myParameterName")); } public ViewResult YourAction(string yourParamterName) { return View("CommonView", new PageViewModel{Action="YourAction", Parameter="yourParameterName")); } /* ... and about 15 more of these */ } CommonView.aspx: This works, but it's got a lot of strings floating around to tell it where to go. What I'd like to have is a type-safe way of defining the form parameters inside the view, but I'm a bit lost on how to accomplish this. Perhaps something that looks like this - (Model.??ExpressionToGetAction??)) {%> Or, is there a way to get the action and parameter used to generate this view, perhaps from route data? Or should there be a custom routing scheme that can handle all of this automagically? So, what I'm really wanting is the most elegant and type-safe way to accomplish this. Thanks! EDIT As Josh points out, the form will submit back to the action. This trims the code somewhat : PageViewModel { public string ParameterName {get;set;} /*... other properties for the form */ } PageController { public ViewResult MyAction(string myParamterName) { return View("CommonView", new PageViewModel{ParameterName ="myParameterName")); } public ViewResult YourAction(string yourParamterName) { return View("CommonView", new PageViewModel{ParameterName ="yourParameterName")); } /* ... and about 15 more of these */ } CommonView.aspx: It is still unclear how to have the textbox bind a parameter by name back to the action from which the view was created without explicitly specifying it.
