I just tested that in IE7 and can confirm that it happens there too. It looks like the unstyled paragraph does not actually have a red background, it's just that IE7 is drawing the red box for the empty paragraph and then drawing the following paragraph over the top. You can see this for yourself by trying this code: Green content Unstyled background broken because previous red element is empty You should see that the red paragraph is 50px in from the left. Why it's doing this is anyone's guess. Adding some code to check if the paragraph is going to be empty isn't too hard, plus it removes useless markup from your output and avoids this problem altogether. Give that a go?
