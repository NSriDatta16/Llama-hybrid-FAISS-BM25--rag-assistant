Which is much faster, XMLParser or SimpleXML

What do you think guys? I currently using SimpleXML for my entire project, which have average of 250KB in memory usage w/ 500micro seconds processing per execution. I just plan to switch to XMLParser, your advice is much appreciated. Edit : The actual microtime is 0.000578 micro seconds. Im just confused in milli and micro, lol.
