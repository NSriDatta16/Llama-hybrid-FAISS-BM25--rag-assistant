Any method that uses pairwise distances will need too much memory for large data. That is why there exist database-oriented methods such as DBSCAN and OPTICS that can -in good implementations- be used without computing all pairwise distances. Just your average implementation may not be good enough out-of-the-box. You'll have to spend effort to accelerate this for your distance. Before spending time on making this fast, I would strongly suggest to first make it work . So do not begin with the entire data set . Begin with a sample and learn to get working results. Then decide whether they are good enough, and if you really need to scale this to the entire data. Most of the time, when you think you need to cluster "big data", then you are doing something wrong.
