Prove (or disprove) that this function is a kernel

I devised a distance function similar to this form $d(x,y) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} b(x_i, y_i,x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) $ with $b(x_i, y_i,x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) = 0 \mbox{ if } x_i \leq 0 \vee y_i \leq 0 \vee x_{i+1} \leq 0 \vee y_{i+1} \leq 0$ $b(x_i, y_i,x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) = \alpha \cdot \frac{x_{i+1}}{y_{i+1}} + (x_i - y_i)^2 \mbox{ else } $ where $\alpha$ is a real number > 0. And now I want to prove (or disprove) that $e^{-d(x,y)}$ is a kernel which I for example could use in SVMs. I have read about Mercer's condition, positive semi definiteness and about constructing kernels from existing kernels, but I can't transfer it to this kind of function. Especially, how do I deal with the if-cases in my definition of b? Any help would be greatly appreciated :)
