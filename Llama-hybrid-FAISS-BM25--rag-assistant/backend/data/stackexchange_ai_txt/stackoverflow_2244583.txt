The only way I ever got out of this spot was to convert the decimal to a string, replace the dot with nothing (aka empty string) and then the comma with a dot. As in Replace(Replace(Cast( as varchar(14)), '.', ''), ',', '.') Not elegant but helps to convert from Excel to SQL server where I encountered the problem so far.
