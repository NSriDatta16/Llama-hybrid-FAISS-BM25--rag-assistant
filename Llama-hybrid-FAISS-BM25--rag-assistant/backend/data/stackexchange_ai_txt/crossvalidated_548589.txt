non-time related features not contributing in ML forecasting

I made some ML models for a demand forecasting problem. My predictors were the time-related features derived from the DateTime column (as in 'week of the year', 'day of the month', 'day of the week', 'month', 'quarter' etc) and an extra regressor( a categorical column with 10 levels which I hot encoded). In every single feature importance I checked, only the time-related features were the 'contributing' and not my other features. Is it something common in Time Series Forecasting, the time-related being the only contributing features and the extra-regressors 'pushed out'? And if yes, why is this happening?
