Recommended way to organize JSF big application on daily builds

We are working in a big team, building a web application in JSF, where each developer develops new task. For example: User Management, Security, System Parameters etc. We need to create a daily task to build the WAR from the SVN. We know how to use daily builder, SVN etc. Our question is how to save it per module? What is the recommended way to build by packages web application as JSF where it's build on MVC module and the pages are part of the bean? Should we use many WARs/Packages? I need to save it per module, since some days there could errors in one module that shouldn't be uploaded with the rest of the modules. (I know how to compile and find decide if to upload it or not).
