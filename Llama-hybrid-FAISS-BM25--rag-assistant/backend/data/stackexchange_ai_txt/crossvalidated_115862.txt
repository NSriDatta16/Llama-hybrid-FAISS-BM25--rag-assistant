Is Hurlbert 1984 the best introductory overview to pseudoreplication?

I often find myself explaining (or wanting to explain but not wanting to be boorish) the basics of random sampling and the consequences of pseudoreplication, specifically the limitations and assumptions of the standard statistical methods that are often misapplied to such data. As a student, I found a particular reference (Hurlbert 1984) to be clear and informative. I am considering sharing it with my colleagues. This paper has been persistently cited over the last 30 years, so many in the field still consider it relevant. For reference, here are a few figures that provide a flavor of the manuscript's contents. I suspect (project?) that these two figures represent a substantial fraction of information many readers take away. I have two questions: Are any of the ideas in the paper 'out of date' to the extent that this is not a good introduction to the topic of pseudoreplication (and if so, which ones)? Are there any references that provide a similar information in a way that is more easily digestible (and requires less motivation) than this 25 page monograph. Is there a better overview of modern concepts or alternatives that allow valid interpretation of results but that don't require fundamentally different analyses? References: Hurlbert, Stuart H.
