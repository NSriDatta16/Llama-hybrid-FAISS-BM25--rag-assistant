Write a test app that tries connection to each, records the times to setup, connect, send a byte and disconnect. Your app then repeats this several times, probably with a wait, then gives you an average. This is also going to depend on the network type (GSM/UMTS/Wi-Fi), load on the cell, internet traffic between your handset and the destination etc. What are you attempting to do?
