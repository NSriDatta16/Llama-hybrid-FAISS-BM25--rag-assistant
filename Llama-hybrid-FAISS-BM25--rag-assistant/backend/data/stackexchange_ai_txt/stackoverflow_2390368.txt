It is possible to change the dataset directly in vba as I have managed to do it. However the performance is not so good so I went back to filling the results to a temp table and basing the graph on that ( see my only asked stackoverflow question) however if the dataset is quite small then you can certainly make it work. I'm not in the office but if you want code I can post on Monday EDIT: here is the old code module I used. This is the full thing but the key part you are going to be looking at is the part about opening the datasheet of the graph and then changing the value of it like this .cells(1,0)="badger". I enevtly dumped this method and went with a temp table as in my app the graph is redraw quite a lot and I needed to go for the fastest possible method to give a "real time" feel to it but it might be just fine for your needs Public Sub Draw_graph(strGraph_type As String) Dim objGraph As Object Dim objDS As Object Dim i As Byte On Error GoTo Error_trap Dim lRT_actual As Long Dim lRT_forecast As Long Dim Start_time As Long Dim aCell_buffer(49, 4) As Variant Me.acxProgress_bar.Visible = True Me.acxProgress_bar.Value = 0 Set objGraph = Me.oleCall_graph.Object Set objDS = objGraph.Application.datasheet Start_time = GetTime() With objDS .cells.Clear Select Case strGraph_type Case Is = "Agents" '************************** '** Draw the agent graph ** '************************** .cells(1, 1) = "Start Time" .cells(1, 2) = "Provided" .cells(1, 3) = "Required" .cells(1, 4) = "Actual Required" For i = 1 To 48 .cells(i + 1, 1) = Format(DateAdd("n", (i - 1) * 15, "08:00:00"), "HHMM") If Me.Controls("txtAgents_pro_" & i) > 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 2) = Me.Controls("txtAgents_pro_" & i) + Me.Controls("txtAgents_add_" & i) Else .cells(i + 1, 2) = 0 End If If Me.Controls("txtAgents_req_" & i) > 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 3) = Me.Controls("txtAgents_req_" & i) End If If Me.Controls("txtActual_" & i) > 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 4) = Erlang_Agents(Me.txtServiceLevel, Me.txtServiceTime, Me.Controls("txtActual_" & i) * 4, Me.txtAVHT + CLng(Nz(Me.txtDaily_AVHT_DV, 0))) End If 'update the progress bar If Me.acxProgress_bar.Value + 2 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 2) = Me.Controls("txtForecast_" & i) Else .cells(i + 1, 2) = 0 End If If Me.Controls("txtActual_" & i) > 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 3) = Me.Controls("txtActual_" & i) End If If Me.acxProgress_bar.Value + 2 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 2) = (lRT_actual - lRT_forecast) / lRT_forecast End If If Me.acxProgress_bar.Value + 2 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 2) = Me.Controls("txtSLA_" & i) / 100 Else .cells(i + 1, 2) = 0 End If If Me.Controls("txtActual_SLA_" & i) > 0 Then .cells(i + 1, 3) = Me.Controls("txtActual_SLA_" & i) End If If Me.acxProgress_bar.Value + 2
