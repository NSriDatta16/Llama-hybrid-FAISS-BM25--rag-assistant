Neural network to tag multiple textual topics in a single document

I want to use a neural network to do some topic analysis in a textual corpus. I have used neural networks before where there is a clear decision boundary between the category to which some observation belongs. However, in topic modeling, a single document can have multiple topics present simultaneously. So I want to know if I can train a neural network model to associate multiple topics to each document in the corpus. I suppose this could be some sort of vector that just indicates the probability of some topic existing in that document> I was looking around for any papers on this topic, so if there are any citations that you want to pass along, that would help too.
