jpa/hibernate drag-n-drop/orm/graphical relations

Hey all, I'm reviewing the IntelliJ ability related to JPA ER Diagrams (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/jpa_hibernate.html), and is something I've been looking for a while. Does anyone know of other tools that have similar abilities, whether as standalone, eclipse plugin, or other alternatives with the intent that the Graphical Tool does bidirectional updates to the persistence.xml/orm.xml? thanks!
