Model design with repeated equivalent measurements

I have a population of n individuals. For each of them, I have measured an outcome once: $Outcome_{ i} \,\,\,\ i=1..n $ I have also some measurements: for each subject I have a variable number of measurements $ m_i $ , which are acquired over time but they can be considered completely interchangeable or equivalent for our study (e.g. as they were acquired in the same moment). $Meas_{i,j} \,\,\,\ i=1 .. n \,\,\,\ j=1 .. m_i $ I would like to test if there is association between $Outcome$ and $Meas$ . I have around n=20 and m If I aggregate the data e.g. average $Meas$ over $j$ , I am under-powered for my effect size. If I just pool the individual measurements treating them as independent, I clearly violate model assumptions. I am considering to use linear mixed models adding subject as random effect. Most example I see would also model a subject-specific slope for the measurements. This works well for longitudinal data where repeated measurements are over time, one can conclude that there is a population-trend combined with individual trends over time, with regression coefficient measuring the strength of the individual trends. However, in my case measurements are not longitudinal so I have tried to model individual-specific intercept. In python/statsmodels : model= smf.mixedlm("OUTCOME~1+MEAS",data=df,groups=df.loc[:,'IndividualID'],re_formula="~1") In this case, my model collapses to: -------------------------------------------------------------- Coef. Std.Err. z P>|z| [0.025 0.975] -------------------------------------------------------------- Intercept 21.050 0.259 81.407 0.000 20.543 21.557 Meas -0.000 0.000 -0.000 1.000 -0.000 0.000 Group Var 1.337 13217.344 ============================================================== Basically, my model is giving just a constant value per individual. What can I conclude from this? Can I just blame sample size being too small? How can I check if mixed GLM is more appropriate then mixed LM in this context?Residuals are basically measurement values minus their individual-specific average.
