The micro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score are all the same, and are all equal to the overall accuracy (!) when including all the classes. That fact is hinted at in the documentation for classification_report , in the "Return" field ("it is only shown for multi-label or multi-class with a subset of classes because it is accuracy otherwise"). It's explained in a little more detail at https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-ii-the-f1-score-ebe8b2c2ca1 (near the end).
