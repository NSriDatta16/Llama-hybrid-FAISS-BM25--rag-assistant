Actually I find that builds spend most of their time doing IO of some sort. So increasing the number of CPUs doesn't help as much as you would think. However, additional machines will have additional disks and network bandwidth. So they may help more. However, you can improve the configuration of a single box and possibly get the same performance. How many builds you you typically have running at once? If you typically have 2 builds queued now (and 2 running) then having four builds running at once is an improvement. But more than that isn't going to make much difference. Eight core machines with 64 GB of memory are surprisingly standard for a new server these days. In this configuration, I would suggest getting an SSD drive to improve disk access times and running four to eight builders/agents and that could be enough for if you typically have eight builds waiting at any time or less.
