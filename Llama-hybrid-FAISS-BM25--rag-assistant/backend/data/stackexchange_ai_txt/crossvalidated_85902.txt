Can nonstationarity be told from the autocorrelation function?

Here "stationarity" means the first and second moments don't change over time. From a page of Time Series: Theory and Methods, by Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis In this chapter we shall examine the problem of selecting an appropriate model for a given set of observations $\{X_t t = 1, ..., n > \}$. If the data (a) exhibits no apparent deviations from stationarity and (b) has a rapidly decreasing autocorrelation function , we shall seek a suitable ARMA process to represent the mean-corrected data. If not, then we shall first look fo r a transformation of the data which generates a new series with the properties (a) and (b). From a page of Time Series: Theory and Methods, by Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis Trend and seasonality are usually detected by inspecting the graph of the (possibly transformed) series. However they are also characterized by sample autocorrelation functions which are slowly decaying and nearly periodic respectively . From wikipedia non-stationarity is often indicated by an autocorrelation plot with very slow decay. My questions: Why should a stationary ARMA process have a rapidly decreasing autocovariance function? Should a stationary AR process also have a rapidly decreasing autocovariance function? Why is non-stationarity often indicated by an autocorrelation plot with very slow decay and values near 1 at small lags? Why are trend and seasonality characterized by autocorrelation functions that are slowly decaying and nearly periodic, respectively?
