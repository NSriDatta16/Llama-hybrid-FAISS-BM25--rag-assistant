Likert Scaled Item Response Rate: What if only 2% of my ppts chose "1"?

Background : I am examining the psychometric properties of a 6-item unidimensional measure in psychology. The items are rated on a 1-5 scale with strongly disagree strong agree anchors. A scale score is computed by averaging across the items. Specifically, I am using confirmatory factor analysis to test the theorized factor structure (I will also be examining validity, reliability, etc.). Question : given the above situation and that you believe ordinal data can be assumed to be continuous in some situations, is there a minimum percent of my cases that need to select a given answer option (e.g., "1: Strongly Disagree) in order to assume that my data is continuous? I.e., say only 2% of my cases indicate "1: Strongly Disagree" for item 1. Is this a problem? What about if only 2% of my cases indicate "1: Strongly Disagree" for the measure as a whole? I have heard that there is a rough rule around 5%, but I have yet to find a citation for it. I.e., I have heard that if less than 5% of my cases indicate a response (e.g., "1: Strongly Disagree"), that A) I can no longer assume my data is continuous, and B) that I should combine that response with another (e.g., combine 1 with 2 to create a "Disagree" category). What are you thoughts on this? Is there a common citation that I have been missing? Thank you
