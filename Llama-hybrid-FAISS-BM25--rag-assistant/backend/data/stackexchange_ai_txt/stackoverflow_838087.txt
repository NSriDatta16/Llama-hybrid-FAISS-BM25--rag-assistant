If your data is strictly hierarchical, and it looks like it is, I would recommend the Modified Preorder Tree Traversal method for storing your data. There is a superb article at Sitepoint that discusses this exact problem. You appear to be using the Adjacency List model, which is discussed on page one, but the MPTT is much more efficient for a read-heavy storage of this type of data. Check out page 2 to see the examples. It's really quite an excellent piece of architecture.
