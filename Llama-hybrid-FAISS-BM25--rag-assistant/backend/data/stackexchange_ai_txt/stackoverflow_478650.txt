As soon as you update the bound DataTable, a "RowsAdded" event is fired by the DataGridView control, with the DataGridViewRowsAddedEventArgs.RowIndex property containing the index of the added row. //local member private int addedRowIndex; private void AddMyRow() { //add the DataRow MyDataSet.MyDataTable.Rows.Add(...); //RowsAdded event is fired here.... //select the row MyDataGrid.Rows[addedRowIndex].Selected = true; } private void MyDataGrid_RowsAdded(object sender, DataGridViewRowsAddedEventArgs e) { addedRowIndex = e.RowIndex; } Not the most elegant solution, perhaps, but it works for me
