JQuery Resizable Draggable Position Absolute

Take a look at this -> http://jsfiddle.net/Zj23S/1/ I am using resizable and draggable. The problem I am facing is with draggable. I cannot seem to drag outside of the div, probably because I set div.position = absolute. If I take this away my resizing moves the other elements, which I do not want. How can I drag the element anywhere on the screen while maintaining position absolute? Thanks!
