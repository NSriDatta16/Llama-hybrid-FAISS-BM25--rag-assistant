accumulating 'flightTime' in this manner does not lend itself to velocity changes. Each frame it is assuming the speed for the whole flight has been what it is this particular frame, which isn't the case. Here is a way I would recommend coding up the projectile flight. Establish 'velocity' as a vector2 whose direction represent the direction the projectile is traveling and whose magnitude represents the speed in units per second that it is traveling. float elapsed = (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds; // time since last frame only // the velocity vector will have a magnitude equiv to units traveled per second. float speed = velocity.Length(); Vector2 windDrag = (Vector2.Negate(velocity) / speed) * (speed * speed * dragCOef); Vector2 gravity = Vector2.UnitY * gravCOef;// gravity can be a constant per unit time. Vector2 velocityChange = windDrag + gravity; velocity += velocityChange * elapsed;// adds just the change of velocity this frame to the overall velocity Position += velocity * elapsed;// 'velocity' is distance traveled per second. 'velocity * elapsed' is just distance traveled per frame o
