What does that line of code do?

I'm reading the book Agile web developement with Rails 4Th editon, when he present this method inside a model: def add_line_items_from_cart(cart) cart.line_items.each do |item| item.cart_id = nil line_items and this is the explanation: *For each item that we transfer from the cart to the order we need to do two things. First we set the cart_id to nil in order to prevent the item from going poof when we destroy the cart. Then we add the item itself to the line_items collection for the order. Notice that we didnâ€™t have to do anything special with the various foreign key fields, such as setting the order_id column in the line item rows to reference the newly created order row. Rails does that knitting for us using the has_many and belongs_to declarations we added to the Order and LineItem models. Append- ing each new line item to the line_items collection hands the responsibility for key management over to Rails.* Can someone explain how this simple line of code line_items Thanks for your attention Simone
