What are the internal limits to WCF

WCF has lots of limits imposed on it to protect against DoS attacks and other developer brainlessness. What are these limits? And how can they be overriden? Specifically, if I was to try to send a large number of messages in a short period of time to a variety of different clients, what are the internal WCF limits they may cause messages to be sent slowly. PS: this question is a much shorter version of my previous question that did not get much attention. EDIT I have answered the original question . The issue being my async calls were being turned into synchronous ones.
