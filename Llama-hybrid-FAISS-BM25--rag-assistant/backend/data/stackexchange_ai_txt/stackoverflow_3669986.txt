going through a dictionary and printing its values in sequence

def display_hand(hand): for letter in hand.keys(): for j in range(hand[letter]): print letter, Will return something like: b e h q u w x . This is the desired output. How can I modify this code to get the output only when the function has finished its loops? Something like below code causes me problems as I can't get rid of dictionary elements like commas and single quotes when printing the output: def display_hand(hand): dispHand = [] for letter in hand.keys(): for j in range(hand[letter]): ##code## print dispHand UPDATE John's answer is very elegant i find. Allow me however to expand o Kugel's response: Kugel's approach answered my question. However i kept running into an additional issue: the function would always return None as well as the output. Reason: Whenever you don't explicitly return a value from a function in Python, None is implicitly returned. I couldn't find a way to explicitly return the hand. In Kugel's approach i got closer but the hand is still buried in a FOR loop.
