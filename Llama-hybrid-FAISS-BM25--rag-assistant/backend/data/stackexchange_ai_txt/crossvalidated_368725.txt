To do an equivalence test, you need some equivalence margins on some appropriate scale. Then you use some method that gives you a valid confidence interval at the desired level (i.e. to perform a test at level $\alpha$ you need a two-sided level $1-\alpha$ confidence interval) and see whether it lies completely within the equivalence boundaries. E.g. you might want to work with odds-ratios and might think that anything within a factor of 0.8 to 1.25 (equal delta in both directions on the log-odds-ratio scale) is not a meaningful difference. You could then use logistic regression to get and estimated odds ratio (0.809 for group 1 vs. 2) and to get 95% asymptotic Wald confidence intervals (0.542 to 1.206). Since the confidence interval is not completely within 0.8 to 1.25 (i.e. the lower end falls out of it), you would not have shown equivalence (i.e. you cannot reject the null hypothesis of non-equivalence). With other equivalence margins, you might have equivalence. Often we can also derive a p-value for the decision, but if all you want is "reject null hypothesis" vs. "null hypothesis not rejected", then all you need is confidence interval. When asymptotics apply, you can use the normal approximation to get such a p-value (essentially looking at what level confidence interval would just overlap with the margin, which is easy to do, if the CI is formed via estimated log-odds ratio +- SE * appropriate percentile of the normal distribution such as 1.96), while with more sparse data this can be a bit difficult. You could of course also decide that you are not interested in an odds ratio and want a risk difference or a risk ratio. example $coefficients[2,1] se coefficients[2,2] # Wald confidence interval on the odds-ratio scale, you get a test decision simply # by comparing your NI margin to the CI limits (if the CI limits extend # beyond it, you cannot reject the null hypothesis of non-equivalence). # Here we are assuming that you want 95% CIs corresponding to a 5% level test wald_ci The example code above gives you a p-value for equivalence of 0.0183, if your NI margin is log(2) on the logit-scale. So for that NI margin you could reject the null hypothesis of non-equivalence and conclude that within those limits the groups are equivalent. On the other hand for a NI margin of 1.25, you would get a p-value from the equivalence test of 0.9579, so you could not reject that null hypothesis.
