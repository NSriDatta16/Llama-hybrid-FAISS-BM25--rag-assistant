The key to understanding lies in the word "conditional" in the phrase "conditional odds ratio". Basically, the statement means that the model assumes that $\beta$ doesn't vary across different levels of $Z$. If conditional independence of $Y$ and $X$ given $Z$ holds, then $\beta = 0$, so testing for $\beta = 0$ tests one of the implications of conditional independence. However, one could construct a situation where $\beta$ varies with $Z$ in such a way that, on average, $\beta = 0$, but for any given $Z$, $\beta \ne 0$. In that case, the assumption of conditional independence would be false, yet the test would have a hard time rejecting it, because of the model misspecification due to assuming that $\beta$ doesn't vary with $Z$. Hence the importance of pointing out the assumption.
