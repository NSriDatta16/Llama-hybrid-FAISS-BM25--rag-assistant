Suppose $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, how can I find $P(T(X)>200)$?

Suppose $X_1,...,X_n$ are iid from $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ with $\mu$ unknown and $\sigma = 2$ known. Letting $T(X) = \sum{(X_i-\mu)^2}$ from i = 1 to 40, how can I use the central limit theorem to approximate $P(T(X)>200)$? I found that $E(T(X))=40$ and $Var(T(X))=160$ and $T(X)$ ~ Chi square with n=40 df. The below is the correct answer, but I do not know how this makes sense since my understanding of the central limit theorem is that the average of iid random variables is normal, but how am I utilizing the central limit below? Thanks!!!!
