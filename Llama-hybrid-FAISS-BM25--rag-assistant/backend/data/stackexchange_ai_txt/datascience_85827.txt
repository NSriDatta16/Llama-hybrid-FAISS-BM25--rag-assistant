How can I fixed the filter and Kernel Size of a CNN?

I have created 4 x 4 2d images from a signal. Now, I want to feed this data to a Convolutional neural Network. How I can choose the nubmber of filter, Kernel Size for this small, shape and size of dataset ( 4 x 4, 320 images ). Should I use maxpooling layer ? Note: I have already implemented a model for this dataset and accuracy is 78.125% . The model is,
