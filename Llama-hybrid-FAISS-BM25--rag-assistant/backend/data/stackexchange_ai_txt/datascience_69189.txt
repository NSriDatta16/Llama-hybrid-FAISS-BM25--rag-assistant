How does inverse of logistic function produces "linear relationship", (so we can use least-squares)

I am reading about time-series analysis in "A First Course on Time Series Analysis" . The book reviews the logistic function ( $f_{log}(t)$ ) (more on the special logistic function here and here ). Part 1.6 (PDF page 16; book page 8; screenshot below) explains how the inverse of the logistic function ( $1/f_{log}(t)$ ) produces a linear relationship; so that "it can serve as a basis for estimating the parameters $β_1$ , $β_2$ , $β_3$ by an appropriate linear least squares approach" I don't understand the last sentence: This means that there is a linear relationship among $1/f_{log}(t)$ . I specifically don't understand how the inverse of a logistic function, can produce a "linear relationship"; it doesn't look like a "straight line" when I graph it: import math import numpy as np from matplotlib import pyplot as plt get_logistic = lambda b1, b2, b3: lambda x: (b3/(1+b2*np.exp(-b1*x))) x = np.linspace(-10,10) y = get_logistic(1,1,1)(x) plt.plot(x,y) plt.show() plt.plot(x,1/y) plt.show()
