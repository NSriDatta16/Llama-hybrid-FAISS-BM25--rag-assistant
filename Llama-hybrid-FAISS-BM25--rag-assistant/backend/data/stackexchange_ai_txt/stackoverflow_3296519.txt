remove SPAN and BR in DIV

I have filled data enclosed in a SPAN tag and BR tag for line break, in a DIV control. From the DIV, I wanted to remove a patricular text, ie removing the whole SPAN and BR associated with the text too using jquery or javascript. I tried .remove() in jquery. It seems not working. I dont know what is the correct way. The script I used for removing the SPAN related to the ID and BR is as follows : $("# ").find("SPAN[id=" + draggedNodeID + "]").each(function() { $(draggedNodeID).remove(); });
