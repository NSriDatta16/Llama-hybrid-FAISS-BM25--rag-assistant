The concept of order of integration is not uniquely defined, and there exist multiple definitions that to a large degree overlap. Some of the more hand-wavy definitions rather imprecisely define it as "the number of differences needed to achieve stationarity". Engle and Granger (1987) and Johansen (1995) define the concept more precisely: A series with no deterministic component which has a stationary, invertible ARMA representation after differencing $d$ times is said to be integrated of order $d$ (Engle and Granger, 1987) A stochastic process $Y_t$ which satisfies $Y_t-E(Y_t)=\sum_{i=0}^\infty C_i\epsilon_{t-i}$ is called $I(0)$ if $\sum_{i=0}^\infty C_iz^i$ converges for $|z_i| and $\sum_{i=0}^\infty C_i\neq 0$ . (Johansen, 1995) One important implication stemming from these definitions is that an MA(1) process with $\theta=1$ is not $I(1)$ (because it is not invertible, and because $\sum_{i=0}^\infty C_i=1-1=0$ ). So according to these definitions, not all weakly stationary processes are stationary. The definition on Wikipedia is therefore neither correct nor incorrect; it is merely one definition.
