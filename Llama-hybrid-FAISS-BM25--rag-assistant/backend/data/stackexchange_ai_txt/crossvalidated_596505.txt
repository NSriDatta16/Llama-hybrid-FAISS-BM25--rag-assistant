Negative $R^2$ may indicate poor relative calibration of the model. This strictly applies to Efron's $R^2$ in the context of logistic regression. I think that this can be extrapolated (at least as an intuition) to standard $R^2$ for linear probability model. This follows from the equivalence of Efron's $R^2$ and Brier Skill Score (BSS): $$\text{Efron's } R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N ({y_i} - \hat \pi_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N ({y_i} - \bar y)^2}$$ Whereas: $$BSS = 1 - \frac{BS}{BS_{\text{ref}}} = 1 - \frac{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N (f_t - o_t)^2}{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^N (\bar o - o_t)^2} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{t=1}^N (o_t - f_t)^2}{\sum_{t=1}^N (o_t - \bar o)^2}$$ where $y_i$ - event, $o_t$ - actual outcome $\hat \pi_i$ - model predicted probability, $f_t$ - forecast probability $i$ - observation, $t$ - forecast Notation taken from UCLA for Efron's $R^2$ and from Wiki for BSS. Some guidelines recommend that all clinical prediction models should have a BSS>0.
