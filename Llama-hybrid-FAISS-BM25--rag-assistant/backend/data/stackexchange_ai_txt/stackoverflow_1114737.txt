Is the IE 7 in Windows Media Center a full featured IE?

I'm getting reports from my website of weird Javascript errors in a piece of code that normally works well, all with the following user agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; Trident/4.0; GTB6; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.30618) Should I assumed that the IE7 in Windows Media Center is a full-blown IE and really investigate this? (in case it may also happen for other users of IE 7) Or can I assume this is some kind of Windows Media Center quirk and brush it off? (yes, I am willing to lose this percentage of users in exchange for not having to actually get a Media Center just to test IE7 in it) Thanks!
