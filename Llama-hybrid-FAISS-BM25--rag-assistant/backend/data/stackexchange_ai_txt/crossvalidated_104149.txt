This paper explains the design stages of a Bayesian Network based on a real-life data-set and for a real-life application. It touches on pre-processing data, how to learn the probability space (MLE - which is simple), how to learn the DAG's (which I refer to as causal discovery), what to take into account while learning the DAGs, etc. I am happy to provide more information if you have questions.
