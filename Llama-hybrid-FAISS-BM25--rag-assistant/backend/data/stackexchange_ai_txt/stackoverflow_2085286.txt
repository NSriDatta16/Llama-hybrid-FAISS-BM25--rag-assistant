TrustFailure: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel

I'm using .netCHARGE ( http://www.dotnetcharge.com/ ) to process credit cards and I'm getting the error: " TrustFailure: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. " everytime I try to process a payment. I read through previous SO posts that match this error and have tried the SSL Diganostics Tool, but now I'm unsure what the problem could be. .netCHARGE is just a dll in the /Bin directory, do I need to do something particular to this to allow it to use the site's SSL certificate? Help appreciated. :)
