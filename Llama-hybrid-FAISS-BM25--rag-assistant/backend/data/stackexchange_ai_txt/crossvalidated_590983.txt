How to specify a VAR model in R with non-stationary, stationary, and trend-stationary variables?

I have a multivariate time series and I want to estimate a VAR model. I tested for unit roots with the ADF and KPSS test and concluded that some variables are non-stationary, while others are stationary around a non-zero mean, and again others are stationary around a deterministic trend (i.e., trend-stationary). After that I tested for cointegration of the non-stationary variables with the Johansen test and as I failed to reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration, I took the first difference of those variables. That is, the variables now have different lenghts. I am not quite sure how I can specify the VAR model correctly in such a case as I have differenced variables without a constant, variables with a constant and variables with a trend. library(vars) VAR(y, p = 1, type = c("const", "trend", "both", "none"), season = NULL, exogen = NULL, lag.max = NULL, ic = c("AIC", "HQ", "SC", "FPE")) My guess would be either to set type="both" when specifying the VAR model to account for the trend and constant, or to detrend the trend-stationary variables and set type="const" , or leave the trend-stationary variables as they are, set type="const" , and include the trend as an exogenous variable in the VAR model with help of the exogen argument. However, I am not aware how I can achieve this in R. Do I have to decompose the trend-stationary variables, take their trends and include them seperately as exogenous variables? Thank you!
