If you want to avoid using a database engine (which would have a lot of overhead for a multiple-read, multiple-write app like a chat room anyway), you might look at a simple object store like memcache, couch, or mongo. Files are also a valid option, provided you store them outside of the Web root with proper permissions. Bottom line is, you'll have to use some sort of storage engine on the back end in order to make the data shareable across multiple user sessions. If this is simply a tech demo or a proof of concept, I wouldn't worry too much about overhead right away.
