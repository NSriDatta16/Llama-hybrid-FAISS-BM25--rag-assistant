An elegant and fast way to consecutively iterate over two or more containers in Python?

I have three collection.deques and what I need to do is to iterate over each of them and perform the same action: for obj in deque1: some_action(obj) for obj in deque2: some_action(obj) for obj in deque3: some_action(obj) I'm looking for some function XXX which would ideally allow me to write: for obj in XXX(deque1, deque2, deque3): some_action(obj) The important thing here is that XXX have to be efficient enough - without making copy or silently using range(), etc. I was expecting to find it in built-in functions, but I found nothing similar to it so far. Is there such thing already in Python or I have to write a function for that by myself?
