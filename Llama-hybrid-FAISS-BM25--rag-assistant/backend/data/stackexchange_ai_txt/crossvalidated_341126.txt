How to build a engine for profitability based on inputs that are both discrete and continuous?

Background: I am building a tool which alerts online advertisers based on the performance of their advertising campaigns. I know very little about machine learning. Right now, my tool stores (Clicks, Profit) for my users: Click = how many people coming to your site Profit is the total value of item purchased I am looking into building a prediction engine which will be able to answer question such as: Based the fact that it's Wednesday at 5pm, is the ratio of Profit/Click above or below expectation? What models should I use that can take parameters such as Hour of the day (Discrete) Weekday/Weekend (boolean) is_holiday (boolean) to output an expected ratio of Profit/Click?
