What is the best way to divide two TimeSpan objects?

I want to get the ratio of one TimeSpan against another TimeSpan (Basically the progress of a playing video from it's total time). My current methods is to get the milliseconds of the two TimeSpan objects and divide one against the other. Something like: int durationInMilliseconds = totalTimeSpan.Milliseconds; int progressInMilliseconds = progressTimeSpan.Milliseconds; Double progressRatio = progressInMilliseconds / durationInMilliseconds; Is there a more direct route? It's a simple problem and i'm just curious if there is a super elegant way to solve it. Cheers all James
