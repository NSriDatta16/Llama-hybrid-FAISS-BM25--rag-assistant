For the col_value, you'll want to use GREATEST() . As for the col_name, you could do it like this, but it's hardly elegant: SELECT id, IF(score1 = col_value, 'score1', IF(score2 = col_value, 'score2', IF(score3 = col_value, 'score3', 'score4'))) AS col_name, col_value FROM ( SELECT *, GREATEST(score1, score2, score3, score4) AS col_value FROM test_scores ) AS helper
