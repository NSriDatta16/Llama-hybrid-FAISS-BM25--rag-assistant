You have 2 options how to store the votes. a) separately as you do now (user1: 5; user2: 3; user3: 4;...) b) or you can aggregate the votes You most probably implemented option a), but let me show you what option b) is about. When you aggregate votes, for each post/article/news you store only 2 values - number of votes and average rating . This helps you to retrieve the average rating faster and easier every time you render a page. However when a user casts his/her vote, you need to do a little math to update the average rating . Suppose the stored values are as follows average rating = 3.3 number of votes = 5 If user votes 3 , you need to update both average rating and number of votes like this: new number of votes = [old number of votes] + 1 (5 + 1 = 6 ) new average rating = ([old average rating] * [old number of votes] + [current vote]) / [new number of votes] ((3.3 * 5 + 3) / 6 = 3.25 ) However there is also a drawback to storing the votes this way - you don't get to see how individual users voted. If the requirement states you need to see how individual users voted, combine approach a) and b) and you're good to go.
