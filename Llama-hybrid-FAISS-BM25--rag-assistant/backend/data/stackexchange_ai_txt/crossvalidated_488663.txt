It is obvious that the optimum number of bookings yielding maximum profit must be greater than the number of available rooms (i.e. 100). Thus, we only need to search for the optimum booking number with $n > 100$ . $Average Profit(n)$ $= 50n - 60\sum_{k=101}^n (k-100){n \choose k}p^k\times(1-p)^{n-k}$ . This gives the optimum booking number 108 for $p=0.95$ , same as provided above by PedroSebe .
