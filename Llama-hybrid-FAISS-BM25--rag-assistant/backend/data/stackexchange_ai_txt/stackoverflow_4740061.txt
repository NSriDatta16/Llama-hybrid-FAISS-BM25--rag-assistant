Where can I find a single summary coverage number in Cobertura?

I run Cobertura on my codebase and get coverage numbers by the class, line, and branch. Besides this, I am looking for a single summary number which tells me the coverage for my whole codebase. That's not enough of course; the detailed reports are essential. But having a single number gives us a metric which we can continually improve. I don't see such a number in the reports. Where can I find it?
