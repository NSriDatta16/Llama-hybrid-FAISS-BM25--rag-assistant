Cluster size in .NET Compact Framework

I'm trying to programatically determine the cluster size of a storage card, using C# / .NET Compact Framework, on Widows Mobile. For desktop Windows there's the GetDiskFreeSpace() function, but it doesn't exist in coredll.dll/Windows Mobile. Is there any other way I could find out the size of the cluster for a storage card?
