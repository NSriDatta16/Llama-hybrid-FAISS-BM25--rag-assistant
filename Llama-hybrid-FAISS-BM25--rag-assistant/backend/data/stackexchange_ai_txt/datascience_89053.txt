Machine Learning and stability of correlations

I need some help improving my understanding. As far as I know many (if not all) ML algorithms assume time stationarity, that means that the sampled distribution should not change over time. On a bigger dataset that includes multiple days I see the correlatios to change significantly. For example during first hour Feature A and B have a correlation of 0.8. On second hour their correlations drops to 0.2 or also goes to negative values. Is not this also a problem? Is not assumed that the correlation of features should not change (at least not drastically) as more data comes into play? If I am correct on that can you please provide me some more references to polish a bit my understanding but also go much deeper? Thanks a lot your great help. Regards Alex
