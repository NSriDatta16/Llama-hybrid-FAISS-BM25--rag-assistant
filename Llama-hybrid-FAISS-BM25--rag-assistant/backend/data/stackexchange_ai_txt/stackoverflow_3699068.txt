Neural networks by function examples -- how to get feeling of it?

I am looking for recommended books (or other materials, like web pages) which demonstrate such examples -- structure of neural network (artificial) for given function. I.e. what is the best (in sense, of being minimalistic, yet correct) network structure for function min with N arguments. Or for function abs . And so on. The reason for my question ( what books do you recommend? ) is I would like to get proper "feeling" how to shape the network to get the desired effect without overkill having dense network which computes correctly, but very inefficiently.
