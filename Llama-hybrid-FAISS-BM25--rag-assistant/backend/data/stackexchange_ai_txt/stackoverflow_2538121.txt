I think you will want to set an image for a specific column of your grid. I would do this in InitializeRow event of the grid. Here is a sample: Private Sub ugGrid_InitializeRow(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.InitializeRowEventArgs) Handles ugGrid.InitializeRow 'pull the image from a resource' Dim exclamationIcon As Bitmap = My.Resources.Exclamation_Icon_15x15 exclamationIcon.Tag = EXCLAMATION_ICON_TAG 'get the data source of the row, I only want this image to appear under certain' 'conditions ' Dim actualHist As ActualHistory = DirectCast(e.Row.ListObject, HistoryRow).ActualHistory If Not IsNothing(actualHist) AndAlso actualHist.IsEligible(actualProdHist) Then 'here the condition is met, set the image on the correct column, the one' ' with key of "Descriptor"' e.Row.Cells("Descriptor").Appearance.Image = exclamationIcon e.Row.Cells("Descriptor").Appearance.ImageHAlign = HAlign.Right Else e.Row.Cells("Descriptor").Appearance.Image = Nothing End If End Sub
