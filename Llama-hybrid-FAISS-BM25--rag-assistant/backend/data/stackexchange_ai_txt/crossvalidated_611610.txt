Using LIME to interpret model predictions in R

I am running models, and I am learning how to use LIME to explain the models. I trained a random forest, on data that has 988 rows and 5000 columns. However, I am getting an error which says Error: All permutations have no similarity to the original observation. Try setting bin_continuous to TRUE and/or increase kernel_size . I don't understand this, and I would appreciate edits to my code below. (Discalimer, this is a homework question). This is my attempt below. library(lime) explainer_caret To try to fix this I tried one of the suggestions using https://goodekat.github.io/LIME-research-journals/journals/02-understanding_lime/02-understanding_lime.html as the guide: explainer_caret I still get this Error: All permutations have no similarity to the original observation. Try setting bin_continuous to TRUE and/or increase kernel_size
