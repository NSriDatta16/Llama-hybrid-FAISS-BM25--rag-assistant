How to generate plot of reward and its variance?

I am new to reinforcement learning and I would like know how to generate a learning curve plot such as that shown below (taken from this blog post ), that illustrates the reward (return) and its variance (shaded region). I would like to use Matplotlib or any other Python plotting framework.
