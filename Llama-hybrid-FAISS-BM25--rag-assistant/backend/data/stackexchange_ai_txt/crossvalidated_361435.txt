Are folds changed between epochs in K-Fold Cross Validation?

2 Related question about Cross-Validation (In the scope of Neural Networks): 1) Let's say we train our neural network for 100 epochs and apply 5-fold cross validation. In that case, should I use the same folds over 100 epochs or at each epoch should epochs need to be re-created ? In other words which one of the following 2 pseudo code is correct ? for i=1:EPOCH folds = create_folds(training_data) for j=1:length(folds) for k in range(length(folds)) if j != k model Or folds = create_folds(training_data) # Look at the change in this line place for i=1:EPOCH for j=1:length(folds) for k in range(length(folds)) if j != k model 2) My second question is if I have a single file for all train validation and test splits, should I keep test set constant ( I mean take the 10% of the file first and use that part always as a test set and then apply k-Fold cross validation for the remaning part for creating train/val sets) or should test set also be changed ?
