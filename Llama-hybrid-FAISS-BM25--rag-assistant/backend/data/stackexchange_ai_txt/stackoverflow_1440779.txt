It seems to me that you'll need to learn using WPF PathGeometries . I haven't used them much, but from what I learned, I think it's possible to do the ROC curves. If you want scaling, resolution, zooming. I think you'll be better of getting something that is already done like Telerik , Infragistics , DevExpress or ZedGraph . Otherwise you're likely to spend a lot of time implementing it yourself.
