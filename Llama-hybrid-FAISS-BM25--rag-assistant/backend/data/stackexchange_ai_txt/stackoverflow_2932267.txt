Sorting a google calendar feed (parsing with DOM)

I'm embedding dates from google calendar into a website, and it's all working, with the exception of sorting. For some reason, it sorts into reverse-chronological order, when I'd really just like it to be normal chronological (first event first). this is the output: August 11th: Intern depart August 6th: Last Day of Summer Camp July 7th: Ignore this July 6th: This is another example event July 5th: example June 28th: Summer Camp Starts June 24th: Summer Pool Party June 21st: Intern arrival date June 15th: Assistant Director Arrival Date June 14th: Director's training begins May 26th: Brainstorm day for directors I'm really still just learning a lot of this stuff- thanks for the help in advance! load( $feed ); $entries = $doc->getElementsByTagName( "entry" ); foreach ( $entries as $entry ) { $status = $entry->getElementsByTagName( "eventStatus" ); $eventStatus = $status->item(0)->getAttributeNode("value")->value; if ($eventStatus == $confirmed) { $titles = $entry->getElementsByTagName( "title" ); $title = $titles->item(0)->nodeValue; $times = $entry->getElementsByTagName( "when" ); $startTime = $times->item(0)->getAttributeNode("startTime")->value; $when = date( "F jS", strtotime( $startTime ) ); $whentime = date( "g:ia", strtotime ( $startTime ) ); $places = $entry->getElementsByTagName( "where" ); $where = $places->item(0)->getAttributeNode("valueString")->value; $links = $entry->getElementsByTagName( "link" ); $link = $links->item(0)->nodeValue; print $when; if ($whentime == "12:00am"){ ; } else{ echo " at "; print $whentime; } echo ": "; echo " "; print $title . "\n"; echo " "; echo " "; if(empty($where)){;}else{ echo " "; print $where . "\n"; } print $link; print " "; } } ?>
