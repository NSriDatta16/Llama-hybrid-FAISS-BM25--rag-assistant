Matthijs, You are wrong. 32-bit is far more efficient than 16-bit - in modern processors... Perhaps not memory-wise, but in effectiveness 32-bit is the way to go. You really should update your professor to something more "up-to-date". ;) Anyway, to answer the question; float and double has exactly the same performance, at least on my Intel i7 870 (as in theory). Here are my measurements: (I made an "algorithm" that I repeated for 10,000,000 times, and then repeated that for 300 times, and out of that I made a average.) double ----------------------------- 1 core = 990 ms 4 cores = 340 ms 6 cores = 282 ms 8 cores = 250 ms float ----------------------------- 1 core = 992 ms 4 cores = 340 ms 6 cores = 282 ms 8 cores = 250 ms
