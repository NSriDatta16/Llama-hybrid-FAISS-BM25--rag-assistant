google analytics - multiple trackers on one page (traditional and asynchronous)

I'm writing a widget that will be embedded in other people's websites. I'm using Google Analytics to track all the people that visit all instances of my script on the embedding websites. I understand that the new asynchronous tracking code resolves this problem so that there's no interference with those websites' own Google Analytics accounts. However, what if my analytics tracking code uses the new asynchronous tracker, and the embedding website is using the legacy (traditional) tracking code? Would there be any interference between these two blocks of code? My tracker code: ... _gaq.push( ['myTracker._setAccount', 'UA-XXXXX-2'], // naming the tracker 'myTracker' to be different from any default tracker already defined ['myTracker._trackPageview'] ); ... Embedding website's code: try{ var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-xxxxxx-1"); pageTracker._trackPageview(); } catch(err) {} Can pageTracker and myTracker co-exist and register analytics information to their own separate accounts?
