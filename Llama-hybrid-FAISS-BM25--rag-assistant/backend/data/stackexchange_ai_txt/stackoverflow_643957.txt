Deploying to Windows is certainly possible, but the tool support is not nearly as good as for Unix style operating systems. There is an entire chapter about Windows deployments on the book " Deploying Rails Applications: A Step-by-Step Guide " by Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Bruce Tate, and Clinton Begin . See also " Deployment Strategies for Rails on Windows servers " articles by Brian Hogan.
