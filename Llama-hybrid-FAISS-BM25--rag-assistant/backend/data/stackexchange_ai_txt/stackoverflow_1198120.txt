You could use some other headers to help, like these ones (ones that come to mind when looking at a dump of $_SERVER ) : HTTP_USER_AGENT HTTP_ACCEPT HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET Using several informations coming from the client will help differenciate different clients (the more information you use, the more chances you have that at least one of those is different between two clients)... ... But it will not be a perfect solution :-( Depending on the kind of proxy software and it's configuration, there might be a header called X-Forwarded-For , that you could use : The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header is a de facto standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. This is a non-RFC-standard request header which was introduced by the Squid caching proxy server's developers. But I wouldn't rely on that either : it will probably not always be present (don't think its' required) Good luck !
