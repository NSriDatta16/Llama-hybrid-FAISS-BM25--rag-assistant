I am not sure if it can be used for a time series, but there is a function is.matrix_ergodic {popdemo} which tests ergodicity of a matrix. I also think that definition of white noise is stronger than that of ergodicity, because a process can be ergodic even if it is not independent, because it refers to asymptotic property. But independence is often formulated as third condition of whiteness, in addition to time independent first and second moments.
