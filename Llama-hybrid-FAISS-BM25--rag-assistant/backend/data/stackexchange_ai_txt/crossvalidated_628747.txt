Repeating the same item with different offsets using the *mirt* package

Let's imagine that we want to develop an IRT model that describes the probability that a basketball player scores a basket when he shoots the ball from a certain distance. Distance is a continuous variable, and let us assume that this is not an experiment but an observation in a natural setting. That is, individual players have different numbers of attempts and we cannot predetermine the distances from which they will shoot the ball. The problem can be thought of as individual subjects repeatedly solving the same test item, but that item contains an offset (a fixed parameter). In the IRT paradigm, we can describe the problem as follows: $$ P(\text{player } i \text{ scoring from distance } d) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-a(\theta_i-F(d))}} $$ Where $F(d)$ is an increasing function describing the change in task difficulty over distance. This function is assumed to be known, so it can be modeled as a fixed parameter that varies from trial to trial (i.e. offset). I am trying to solve the problem with the help of an excellent mirt package. But I'm running into two obstacles. 1) How can I work with repeated measures using mirt? By default mirt works with data in the wide format: Player First attempt Second attempt Third attempt Michael 1 0 1 Larry 0 1 1 However, this method assumes a fixed number of distinct items. I would need to work with the long format, which allows for different numbers of repetitions of the same item: Player Attempt score Michael 1 Michael 0 Michael 1 Larry 0 Larry 1 Larry 1 2) Can an offset be introduced into the IRT model? The resulting table looks like this: Player Attempt score F(d) Michael 1 5.486 Michael 0 8.427 Michael 1 6.712 Larry 0 9.002 Larry 1 7.217 Larry 1 7.214 Larry 0 9.563 I've thought of several solutions, but none of them are elegant. I would be very grateful to any advanced user for a suggestion on how to solve the situation. The problem I'm addressing is not really basketball related. I was just using the sport as an easy-to-understand metaphor.
