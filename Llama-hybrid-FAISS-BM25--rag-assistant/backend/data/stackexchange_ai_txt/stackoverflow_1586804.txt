Background image with a draggable second image (layers maybe)

I need to be able to take a background image and float a second draggable image (should be scalable, but with fixed proportions) Also the code should be able to 'flatten' the image for photo sharing. Oh, also the floating image should have a dropped shadow to give the illusion of depth. Thanks! Is this possible with jQuery, ajax, Yui or Dojo(other?)? Or am I barking up the wrong proverbial code trunk.
