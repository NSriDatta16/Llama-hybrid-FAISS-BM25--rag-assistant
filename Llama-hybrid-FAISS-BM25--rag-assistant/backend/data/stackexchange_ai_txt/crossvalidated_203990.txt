First, I would suggest to have a look at the book of P. Brockwell and R. Davis, Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting , 2002, second edition, Springer, New-York. The first chapter deals with trend estimation, and tests for stationarity. It is not too technical and full of examples and the first chapter is really easy. If you need a more technical reference, you can have a look at Time Series: theory and methods , 1991, second edition, Springer, New-York, by the same authors. That is for the citation part of your question. If you consider a time series $\{X_t\}$, you can always decompose it into a trend, a seasonal component and a (stationary) random noise, that is you can write $X_t = m_t + s_t + Y_t$, where $m_t$ is the trend component, $s_t$ is the seasonal component and $Y_t$ is a stationary series. First, I would suggest to test the stationarity of the observed series. You can use different tests to do so, based for instance on sample correlations. If there is evident deviation from stationarity, you could try to estimate a trend. There are many ways to do it. You've mentioned filtering, but you can also think about polynomial fitting (linear regression of your series using $t, t^2, t^3,\dots$ as explanatory variables) or exponential fitting (linear regression on the log of your observations with $t$ as explanatory variable). Finally, once you've done your trend estimation, test the stationarity of your residuals. If the residuals are not stationary you need some more sophisticated model for your trend. You can use a blackbox algorithm to extract the trend and the seasonal component. As already mentioned before the stl function in R does the job, but at the price of a lack of interpretability (how the trend is extracted). hope it helps!
