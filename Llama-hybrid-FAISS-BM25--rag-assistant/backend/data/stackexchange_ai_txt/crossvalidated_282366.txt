Why low results with Content-Based recommendation?

I'm unable to get a good result with my Content-Based recommendation (very low Precision) Items are different sort of services (Yelp DataSet). To compute the item's profiles, I used a classical approach with TF-IDF. Where each item has a number of attribute, and TF-IDF gives the weight of the attribute in the item. To learn the user profile, I perform a simple average of item's profiles previousely rated by the user. To compute similarity between user profile and item profile, I used the Cosine similarity. The recommendation result is a simple Top-K list, where I vary the value of K to analyze the different values of Recall/Precision. The problem is that I get alaways a bad Precision. 1- I want to know if it is normal to get bad result of Precision with my method. 2- I want to know if the dataSet could be the origin of the problem ? 3- Is there a more sophisticated method to learn the user profile ? Thanks for your help.
