CoreNLP SemanticGraph - search for edges with specific lemmas

I'm using Stanford CoreNLP's dependency parser, and wondering how to make a generic search for SemanticEdge(s) with specific head lemma, dependent lemma, and lexical relationship. For example, if I have an actual dependency like this: dobj(discover-4, insights-6) How do I search for it using lemmas instead of the literal word and the index? Basically I want to be able to pattern match the parts of the dependency graph using generic rules...
