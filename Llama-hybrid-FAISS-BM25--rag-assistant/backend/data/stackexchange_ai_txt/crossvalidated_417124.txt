There many great answers for this post but recently, I came across another difference. Clustering is one application where PCA and FA yield different results. When there are many features in the data, one may be attempted to find the top PC directions and project the data on these PCs, then proceed with clustering. Often this disturbs the inherent clusters in the data - This is a well proven result. Researchers suggest to proceed with sub-space clustering methods, which look for low-dimensional latent factors in the model. Just to illustrate this difference consider the Crabs dataset in R. Crabs dataset has 200 rows and 8 columns, describing 5 morphological measurements on 50 crabs each of two colour forms and both sexes, of the species - Essentially there are 4 (2x2) different classes of crabs. library(MASS) data(crabs) lbl Clustering using PC1 and PC2: Clustering using PC2 and PC3: #using PC1 and PC2: 1 2 3 4 1 12 46 24 5 2 36 0 2 0 3 2 1 24 0 4 0 3 0 45 #using PC2 and PC3: 1 2 3 4 1 36 0 0 0 2 13 48 0 0 3 0 1 0 48 4 1 1 50 2 As we can see from the above plots, PC2 and PC3 carry more discriminating information than PC1. If one tries to cluster using the latent factors using a Mixture of Factor Analyzers, we see much better result compared against using the first two PCs. mfa_model
