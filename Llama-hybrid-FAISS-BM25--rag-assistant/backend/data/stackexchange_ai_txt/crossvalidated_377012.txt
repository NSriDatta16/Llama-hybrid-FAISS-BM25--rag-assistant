Pro and cons on multivariate time series approaches

So I am working on a project where I want to forecast how a team will perform in their next match in a number of specific categories (goals scored, time spent in certain parts of the field, passes, ball control, etc.). This would then go up against another team's forecasted performance in a prediction model to simulate the outcome of a match between the two teams. I have data on all of the team's previous matches but am unsure of which path to take. I have looked into VAR, ARIMAX, and Random Forests but because there is no resource that really compares them at the same time I am getting a bit confused. What is the benefit of using a machine learning model vs a time series model? what questions should I be asking to figure out which path to take? Thanks for any help! Example of how data is stored at the moment: |----------|----------|...|----------| | Date | Goals | |Time in _ | |----------|----------|...|----------| | 2011-1-1 | 2 |...| 20 | |----------|----------|...|----------|
