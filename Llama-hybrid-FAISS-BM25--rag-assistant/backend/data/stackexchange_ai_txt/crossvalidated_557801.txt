In logistic regression, the coefficients of a variable indicates the expected change in log odds of observed outcome, per unit change in that variable. So by looking at these model parameters, one can get a feeling which variables are most crucial in increasing/decreasing the probability of observing the outcome. Something similar in random forest is the feature importance. In scikit-learn, it is possible to extract the mean decrease in impurity for each feature. So when this value is large, it means that splitting on this feature will on average more likely result in pure groups. It resembles large positive or large negative coefficients in the logistic setting. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html
