The possible answer might be is that the predictions of heights at specific weights include the uncertainty in the intercept: ** Pred110 = mcmcMat[,"beta0"] + 110 * mcmcMat[,"beta1"] # predicted ht at wt=110 pred100 = mcmcMat[,"beta0"] + 100 * mcmcMat[,"beta1"] # predicted ht at wt=100 ** But when the difference of heights is calculated, the uncertainty in the intercept is cancelled out: Pred110m100 = ( mcmcMat[,"beta0"] + 110 * mcmcMat[,"beta1"] ) - ( mcmcMat[,"beta0"] + 100 * mcmcMat[,"beta1"] ) = ( 110 - 100 ) * mcmcMat[,"beta1"] # difference of predictions Thus, it seems like that when we talk about the uncertainty in a difference, it should depend only on the uncertainty of the slope, not on the intercept.
