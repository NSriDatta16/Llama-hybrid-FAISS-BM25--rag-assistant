Best practice to test (unit and integration) a neural network implementation

I'm implementing my own neural network (with the term implementing i mean writing the code that run the neural network itself, not training). I implemented it for didactical purpose, but i does not know how to proceede for a validation of what i have done. So i would ask if there is some best practice for neural network test (eg : is there a dataset of neural nets with weight, input and expected output)
