Elegant Python?

I am trying to teach myself Python, and I have realized that the only way I really learn stuff is by reading the actual programs. Tutorials/manuals just cause me to feel deeply confused. It's just my learning style, and I'm like that with everything I've studied (including natural languages -- I've managed to teach myself three of them by just getting into the actual 'flow of it'). Classical music once had the concept of a 'gamut' -- playing the entire range of an instrument in an artful manner. I'm guessing that there may be a few well-written scripts out there that really show off every feature of the language. It doesn't matter what they do, I just want to start studying Python by reading programs themselves. I remember coming across a similar method years ago when I studied some LISP. It was a book, published by Springer Verlag, consisting solely of AI programs, to be read for their didactic merit.
