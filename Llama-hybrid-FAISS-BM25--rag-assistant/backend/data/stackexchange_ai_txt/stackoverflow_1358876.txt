file naming should be handled via a naming convention. {name}-{mod type}-{size}-{version}-{create date}.png {name}-final.png e.g. file-white_balance-800x600-v01-20090831.png file-white_balance-800x600-v02-20090831.png file-final.jpg the real point is to create an agreed on convention that people see the value in following (however simple/complex is necessary for your group). In my organization we do this for input/output datafiles, images, scripts, etc. (not the same convention necessarily for all, but that they follow something that was agree upon) Hope that helps.
