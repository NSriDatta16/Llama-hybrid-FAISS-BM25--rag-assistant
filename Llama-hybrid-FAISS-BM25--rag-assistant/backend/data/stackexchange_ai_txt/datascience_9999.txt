What's a good machine learning algorithm for low frequency trading?

I'm trying to train an algorithm to copy some of the top traders on various forex social trading sites. The problem is that the traders only trade around say 10 times per month so even if I only look at minute resolution numbers that's .02% of the time [ 10/(60*24*30)*100 ]. I've tried using random forest and it gives an error rate of around 2% which is unacceptable and from what I've read most machine learning algorithms have similar errors rates. Does anyone know of a better approach?
