An insight I gained from Jonathon Shlens' "A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis": Performing PCA is like choosing a camera angle, to gain the best possible view of the variance to be explained. So I'm joining user1843053. At proper angle, decision boundaries parallel to the axes of new, rotated coordinate system might make more sense than in original feature space, allowing for better performance of e.g. decision trees, even without discarding "non-principal" dimensions.
