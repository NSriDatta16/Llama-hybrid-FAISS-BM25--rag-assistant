I have used both Maven and sbt with Scala and found both of them pretty easy to use. However, sbt feel much more closer to Scala as its build files are written in Scala itself (as opposed to XML in Maven) and sbt feature a build REPL, has continuous compilation and testing etc. So I would advise you to use sbt for a simple Scala project. But in case you want to create standard Java projects like WAR, EJB etc, I feel like Maven has a better support for them. Also Maven has an enormous plugin ecosystem which enables you to do virtually everything, code coverage, reporting, code standard checking, documentation generation, and a lot more.
