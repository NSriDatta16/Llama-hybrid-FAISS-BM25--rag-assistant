No, in general, you can't rotate the principal components to obtain ICA. One of the defining traits of PCA is that the component directions are orthogonal. If you rotate the principal components, they'll still be orthogonal after the rotation. (This is because a rotation matrix is an orthogonal transformation .) Almost always, ICA components are not orthogonal, so rotation of principal components will not recover ICA components. The only caveat is trivial -- if the ICA directions are orthogonal to begin with, then they will still be orthogonal after rotation, for the same reasons.
