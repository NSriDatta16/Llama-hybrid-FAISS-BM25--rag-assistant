I do agree with Jan van der Vegt, standardization (e.g, [-1, 1]) or normalization N(0, 1) combined with the activation function can be very important with neural networks. I would check the dissertation of Pichaid Varoonchotikul: “Flood forecasting using artificial neural networks” for the ins and outs of ANNs. It has very interesting caveats. Anyway, I'm use to try first without, but when results are unsatisfactory, I'm use to made trials with either both. Not sure it will help but I would check the R package TSclust and related docs. The authors are very kindly and they will help you to find specific models to do so. They are experts on time series analyses! Good luck!
