This feels like a YAGNI issue to me. If you're just doing it because it MIGHT be useful, that's usually not a good enough reason for the extra complexity. Also, as others have noted, this is the sort of thing that unit tests should catch. Another thing I try to keep in mind is whether an abstraction is meant to protect programmers from themselves. Yes, it is theoretically easy to flip-flop two string arguments. But in all seriousness, paying attention to argument ordering has been a fundamental aspect of programming in most languages for decades. It's not something that should happen often, and it's certainly something that tests should be catching. If this type of thing is a common problem in your organization, I'd say you have bigger problems to worry about.
