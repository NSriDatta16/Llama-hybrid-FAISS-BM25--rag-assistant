proving consistency for a sequence of Bernoulli random variables

Let $X_1, ... , X_n$ be i.i.d Bernoulli random variables with unknown parameter $p\in\left(0,1\right)$. Let $\bar{X_n}$ be the sample average of the $X_i$'s. Prove that $\bar{X_n}(1 - \bar{X_n})$ is a consistent estimator of p(1-p). In order to prove this I was thinking to use the Chebyshev Inequality somehow, but I'm not sure how to go about it.
