Is there something wrong with this python code, why does it run so slow compared to ruby?

I was interested in comparing ruby speed vs python so I took the simplest recursive calculation, namely print the fibonacci sequance. This is the python code #!/usr/bin/python2.7 def fib(n): if n == 0: return 0 elif n == 1: return 1 else: return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2) i = 0 while i and here is the ruby code #!/usr/bin/ruby def fib(n) if n == 0 return 0 elsif n == 1 return 1 else fib(n-1)+fib(n-2) end end i = 0 while (i over several runs, time reports this average real 0m4.782s user 0m4.763s sys 0m0.010s thats for ruby, now python2.7 gives real 0m11.605s user 0m11.563s sys 0m0.013s Whats the deal?
