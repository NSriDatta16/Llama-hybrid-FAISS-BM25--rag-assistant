I'd consider a mixed model with an effect of time-in-career (maybe an additive/smooth term to allow for nonlinear effects) and a random effect of (time-in-career|player) , which allows for variation in the pattern for different players. That doesn't explicitly consider number of points in the previous year, but it seems like a reasonable start, and handles the temporal aspect and the grouping of data within players. this example model of rat growth curves is somewhat different from your example (focus on inference about treatments rather than prediction of individuals; small number of subjects, large number of points per subject relative to your data) but suggests that mgcv::gam(points~careertime+s(careertime)+ s(careertime,player,bs='fs'), data=dd, method="REML") would be a plausible first model. You might want to add s(year,bs="re") to include a random effect of calendar year, and I'd encourage you to use any other covariate/grouping information you have (team, age, ...)
