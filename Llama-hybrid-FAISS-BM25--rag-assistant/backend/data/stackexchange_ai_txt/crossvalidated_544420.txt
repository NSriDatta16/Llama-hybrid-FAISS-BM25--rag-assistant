How to interpret 'e' in Yamane's Formula?

If I use e=0.05, and from Yamane's formula I obtain, say, a sample size of 300 from given population size. Now, for instance, I obtain some descriptive statistics from the sample size such as the mean value of educated farmers is 20%. Can I interpret 'e' in this context is as I am 95% confident that the mean of the educated farmers in the population is 20%. or interchangeably, on average the number of educated farmers in the population is 20% (+ - 5%): i.e, (20%+5%) & (20% -5%). so technically between 15% and 25%. The formula I used is: n = N/(1+N (e)^2) n = sample size N = Total population size e = precision level 5% (0.05): Or does that mean, ' the sample size of 300 (Â±5%) truly/accurately represents the given population size?
