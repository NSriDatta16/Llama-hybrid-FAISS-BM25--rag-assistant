Kohonen self organizing maps: determining the number of neurons and grid size

I have a large dataset I am trying to do cluster analysis using SOM. The dataset is huge (~ billions of records) and I am not sure what the number of neurons should be or the SOM grid size to start with. Any pointers to some material that talks about estimating the number of neurons and grid size would be greatly appreciated.
