C#: Should a standard .Net string be stored in varchar or nvarchar?

We have an application written in C#, using .NET Framework 3.0 or 3.5 or something like that. As storage we use SQL Server, and we use Linq 2 SQL to talk with it. Currently most (if not all) text columns in the database, are set to the varchar type (of different lengths of course). But I started thinking... according to MSDN "The string type represents a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters." Does that mean that we should really change those columns to nvarchar for things to be stored correctly? Or how does that work? Their reasoning for setting them to varchar originally was because nvarchar requires twice as much space (if I have understood correctly). And as far as I have seen so far, it works with varchar, but we haven't done very much testing with unusal foreign characters... Could someone shed some light on this?
