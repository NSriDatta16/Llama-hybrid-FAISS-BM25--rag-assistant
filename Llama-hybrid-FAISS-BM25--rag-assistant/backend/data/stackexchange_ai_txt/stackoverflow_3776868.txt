IE9 Beta Support for localStorage

Does anyone know if current IE9 Beta fully supports HTML5 "localStorage" functionality? Normally the test for "localStorage" support can be done with js code just like: try { return ('localStorage' in window) && window['localStorage'] !== null; } catch (e) { return false; } Well, it seems that this kind of test returns "true" but if you try something like: localStorage.removeItem ('key') you get an error on the Javascript Console (SCRIPT16389 error). Any more info?
