The first question you need to ask is whether you really need the ID to be random. Sometime, sequential IDs are good enough. Now, if you do need it to be random, we first note a generated sequence of numbers that contain no duplicates can not be called random. :p Now that we get that out of the way, the fastest way to do this is to have a Hashtable or HashMap containing all the IDs already generated. Whenever a new ID is generated, check it against the hashtable, re-generate if the ID already occurs. This will generally work well if the number of students is much less than the range of the IDs. If not, you're in deeper trouble as the probability of needing to regenerate an ID increases, P(generate new ID) = number_of_id_already_generated / number_of_all_possible_ids. In this case, check back the first paragraph (do you need the ID to be random?). Hope this helps.
