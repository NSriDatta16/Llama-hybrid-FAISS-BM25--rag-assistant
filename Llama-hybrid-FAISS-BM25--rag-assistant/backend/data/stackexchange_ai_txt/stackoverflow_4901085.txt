Assuming that you know the width of the fly-in node, set it to position absolute and make the left the negative of the width of the node. Then, you need to calculate how far you want the node to animate. Determine the current width of the browser, divide it by two, then subtract the width of the fly in node divided by two. That'll be the left position where you want the node to end up. So, the total distance it has to move would be the current left position of the fly in node added to the end position. Fire your animate off of this number. Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/brianflanagan/KtUEL/
