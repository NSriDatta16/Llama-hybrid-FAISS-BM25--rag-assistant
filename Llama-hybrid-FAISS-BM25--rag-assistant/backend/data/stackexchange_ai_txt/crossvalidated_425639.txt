I remember reading, long ago (maybe 1990) a line from Jacob Cohen about the whole area of p value adjustment. He said "this is a question about which reasonable people can differ" (that might not be exact...but it's close). I agreed then and I still do. Much more recently, I read, in Statistics as Principled Argument by Robert Abelson (a marvelous book) that this sort of question is not so much about what can be done as what can be justified. So, if you don't adjust at all - can you justify that? Also, remember that when you lower the risk of type I error you raise the risk of type II error and consider whether the two errors are equally bad in your analysis.
