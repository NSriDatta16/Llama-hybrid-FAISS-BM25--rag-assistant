Because the generated fragment is not a valid XML file ( it's a fragment after all ), it is not possible to use XSLT directly. On the other hand you don't have to. Here is a simple trick that will give you exactly what you need. In your web.xml file insert XML comment between and elements, e.g. MyServlet my.servlets.MyServlet MyServlet /my-servlet Then use a token filter to replace @JSPS_MAP@ tag with generated content. This approach has an advantage that the original web.xml file is completely valid (a tag is hidden in the comment), but gives you total control of where and when the generated fragment will be inserted. So for DEV build, just copy ${orig-web-content.dir}/WEB-INF/web.xml to ${generated-web-content.dir}/WEB-INF/web.xml without filtering.
