Great question! Here are some thoughts on how to write/organize the results. Hope this helps! First, based on decision theory, choosing and justifying a threshold (before conducting your analyses) is important in order to avoid p-hacking, and explicitly writing/justifying that as part of your hypothesis testing procedure will make your results/analysis more robust. To follow up on thresholds, you also have to make sure if you're doing multiple comparisons and whether adjustments are necessary (they may change what is "significant" in your results). Second, to answer your question directly on IV4, negative findings and negative results ARE IMPORTANT. There is an unfortunate bias towards publishing/reporting positive results only, but negative results are equally important as they yield information on treatments we believed had effects or relationships on the outcome. Something like, "prior literature suggested IV4 and DV had a strong relationship but our studies could not corroborate that, potentially due to X,Y, or Z.. Future studies will require a closer examination to confirm or dispute the assumed relationship b/w IV4 and DV. In addition, we found that IV1-3 were related to DV, confirming prior studies... " Here are a couple of papers illustrating why publishing negative results keeps science honest and pushes it forward: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-07325-2 Weintraub, P. G. (2016). The importance of publishing negative results. Journal of Insect Science, 16(1). They describe the importance and also give strategies on how to publish negative results. Hope this helps.
