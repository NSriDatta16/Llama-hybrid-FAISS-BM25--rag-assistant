File systems are really, really good at storing large blobs of data and providing super fast access and manipulation for them (including fine-grained, byte level manipulation). If you need that, you can wrap the file system storage in a JNDI resource... Using a database for these things may have advantages (backup requirements are crystal clear), but the performance will be quite poor compared to direct file system access. That said, unless your app is actually performance limited by how quickly it can interact with the database for those specific activities, it's probably not worth second guessing yourself.
