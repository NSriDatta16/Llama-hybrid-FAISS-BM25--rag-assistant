Caching SQL queries

If I look in my profiler for SQL-server, it comes up with a lot of duplicate queries such as: exec sp_executesql N'SELECT * FROM [dbo].[tblSpecifications] AS [t0] WHERE [t0].[clientID] = @p0 ORDER BY [t0].[Title]', N'@p0 int', @p0 = 21 A lot of these queries are not needed to display real time data, that is, if someone inserted a new record that was matched in that query it wouldn't matter if it didn't display for up to an hour after insertion. You can output cache the asp.net pages, but I was wondering if there was similar functionality on the dbms (SQL-server in particular), which saves a query results in a cache and renews that cache after a set period of time, say 1 hour, with the aim of improving retrieval speeds of records.
