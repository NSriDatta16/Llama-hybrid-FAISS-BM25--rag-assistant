Align the coordinate labels of the triangles, so that they never collide with each other. Actionscript 3

Im trying to achieve something similar to the flash movie in the below link. http://mathopenref.com/coordtrianglearea.html As we drag the points of the triangle, the coordinates labels, ( A(1,2) ) are properly aligned and arrange themselves so that they never collide with each other and never falls inside the triangle. Please guide me.. Thanks in advance.
