How to save and load a Q-Learning Agent

I know this may sound nooby, but how do I save a Deep Q-Learning agent's progress? I mean when I close at i.e. episode 500 when my agent is trained and I restart (in my case a pygame) my agent is going to load its data and it will continue with its progress ( does not start again very stupid :) ). How can it be done? If you need more details/clarification, feel free to ask! :) Thanks for any answer! I really do appreciate it!
