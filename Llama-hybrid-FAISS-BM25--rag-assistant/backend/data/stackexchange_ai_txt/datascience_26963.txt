Extract feature vector of a CNN

How can I get the feature vector of my dataset. I have a fine-tuned CNN model with my data. Now I want to feed the features of all my dataset extracted from the last layer of the CNN into a LSTM. So far I have cnn_model = load_model('weights/pre-trained_CNN.hdf5') cnn_output = cnn_model.get_layer('fc7').output I know I will have to feed all my dataset into this model but I have no idea on how to "save" the features.
