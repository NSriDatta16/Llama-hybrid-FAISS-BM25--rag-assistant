The following didn't make OO click for me (it already had when I heard it), but I did find it a very nice nutshell description. A collegue of mine is fond of quoting a statement from one of his college professors, which went something like this: Write out a grid with the rows labeled by data types and the columns labeled by operations on the data. If you slice your implementation horizontally, you're doing object-oriented programming. If you slice it vertically, you're doing functional programming. Try thinking of OO as a way to organize your code in which the implementation of an operation on a programmer-defined data type is bundled into the definition of the data.
