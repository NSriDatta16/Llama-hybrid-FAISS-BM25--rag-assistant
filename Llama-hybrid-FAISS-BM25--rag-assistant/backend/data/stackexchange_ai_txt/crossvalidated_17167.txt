How to edit features of a chart from SPSS in MS Word?

Is there any way to edit a scatterplot created in SPSS/PASW after exporting/copying and pasting it into a Word document. I am finding that when I copy and paste my graph from SPSS/PASW into Word, the font size decreases. I can enlarge the graph in Word by dragging the corners but this makes the font look odd. I want to be able to edit the font size in Word. Is there any trick that I need to learn. I am very new to SPSS/PASW.
