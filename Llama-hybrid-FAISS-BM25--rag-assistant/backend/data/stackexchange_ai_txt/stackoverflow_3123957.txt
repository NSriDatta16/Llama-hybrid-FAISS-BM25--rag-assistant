The objective of ' #pragma once ' is to prevent a header from being reincluded. If you have it in a source file (usually a '.c' file), you won't be reading that twice (normally - I do know of a source file that reincludes itself [and I don't like it]; it does not use or want #pragma once , though!). So, a 'main file' in this context is one listed on the command line, for instance, rather than a header. As to the subject matter of the question - the GCC manual does not seem to have a comprehensive list. I don't know whether there actually is one.
