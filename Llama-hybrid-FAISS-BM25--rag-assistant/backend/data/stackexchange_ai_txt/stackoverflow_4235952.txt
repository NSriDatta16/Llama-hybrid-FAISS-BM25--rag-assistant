Regarding the elegant connection.setUseCaches solution above: sadly, it won't work without some additional effort. You will need to install a ResponseCache using ResponseCache.setDefault . Otherwise, HttpURLConnection will silently ignore the setUseCaches(true) bit. See the comments at the top of FileResponseCache.java for details: http://libs-for-android.googlecode.com/svn/reference/com/google/android/filecache/FileResponseCache.html (I'd post this in a comment, but I apparently don't have enough SO karma.)
