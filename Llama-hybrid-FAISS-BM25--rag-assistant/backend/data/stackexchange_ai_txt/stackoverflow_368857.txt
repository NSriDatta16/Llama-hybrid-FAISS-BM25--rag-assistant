Remember that the onchange event is triggered after you check the checkbox and then leave the checkbox . Did you try checking it, then clicking somewhere else on the document? You may want to employ the click and keypress events in jQuery instead (for checking the box via click and spacebar). Is there any reason you're declaring/defining a function within your document ready paragraph, rather than outside of it? One more edit; may I recommend this sleeker code: jQuery(document).ready(function(){ $("#g_1").hide(); $("#check").change(function() { $("#g_1").toggle(); }); });
