Before you question the copying app, you should most likely question the data path. What are the theoretical limits and what are you achieving? What are the potential bottlenecks? If there is a single data path, you are probably not going to get a significant boost by parallelizing storage tasks. You may even exacerbate it. Most of the benefits you'll get with asynchronous I/O come at the block level - a level lower than the file system. One thing you could do to boost I/O is decouple the fetch from source and store to destination portions. Assuming that the source and destination are separate entities, you could theoretically halve the amount of time for the process. But are the standard tools already doing this?? Oh - and on Python and the GIL - with I/O-bound execution, the GIL is really not quite that bad of a penalty.
