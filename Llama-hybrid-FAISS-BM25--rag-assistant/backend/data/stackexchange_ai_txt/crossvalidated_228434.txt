One of the causes of the packages producing different results is the way nodesize is implemented internally. In randomForest, the value appears to be a strict lower bound. In randomForestSRC, while we (unfortunately) don't document the subtlety, we will not attempt to split a node without at least 2 * nodesize replicates in a node. But when we do, it can result in one daughter = nodesize. What we can say is that "on average" our terminal nodes across the forest will be of size = nodesize. The result is that we can grow slightly better trees than RF with the "same" setting. If you set nodesize = 1 to avoid this issue, and accommodate for Monte Carlo effects by growing multiple forests with multiple simulations you will find that the MSE for both packages are coincident.
