This is a Visual-Studio-specific pragma directive that changes how members in struct s are aligned. The full details can be found here on the MSDN , but the gist of it is that it allows you to customize how much padding is placed in-between the elements of a struct . Packing things in tighter uses less space but can give you alignment issues.
