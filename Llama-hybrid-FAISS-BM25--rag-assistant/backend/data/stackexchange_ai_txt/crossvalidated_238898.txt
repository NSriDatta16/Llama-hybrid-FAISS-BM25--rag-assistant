Algorithm to differentiate a Neural Network with respect to features

I have trained a neural network to model a system and I want to use that neural network to optimize a cost function with only a subset of features. My hypothesis function is parameterized by one subset of the features and the other subset of features is the feature set for the hypothesis function. In order to find the gradient of the hypothesis function I need to find the partial derivatives of the neural network with respect to the features. I have worked out the math on this and could probably design an algorithm but is there a standard efficient way of doing this? I am planning on using a subset of the gradient vector and I was wondering what the optimal way to calculate the gradient vector is.
