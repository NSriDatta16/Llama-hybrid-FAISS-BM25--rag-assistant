Bayesian: Exponential Prior and Poisson Likelihood: Posterior Calculation

I am needing assistance in a particular question and need confirmation of my understanding. The belief is that absences in a company follow a Poisson(λ) distribution. It is believed additionally that 75% of thes value of λ is less than 5 therefore it is decided that a exponential distribution will be prior for λ. You take a random sample of 50 students and find out the number of absences that each has had over the past semester. The data summarised below, note than 0 and 1 are binned collectively. Number of absences ≤ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Frequency 18 13 8 3 4 3 0 0 0 1 Therefore in order to calculate a posterior distribution, My understanding is that prior x Likelihood which is this case is a Exponential(1/2.56) and a Poisson with the belief incorporated that the probability of less than 5 is 0.75 which is solved using -ln(1-0.75)/(1/2.56)= 3.5489. Furthermore a similar thread has calculated the Posterior to be that of a Gamma (sum(xi)+1,n+lambda) Therefore with those assumptions, I have some code to visualise this x=seq(from=0, to=10, by= 1) plot(x,dexp(x,rate = 0.390625),type="l",col="red") lines(x,dpois(x,3.54890),col="blue") lines(x,dgamma(x,128+1,50+3.54890),col="green") Any help or clarification surround this would be greatly appreciated
