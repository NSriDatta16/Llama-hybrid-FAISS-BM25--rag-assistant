A significant 3-way interaction (here among all of the within-subject variables) means that you can't properly assess the association between any one of those predictors and outcome unless you know the values of the other 2 predictors. Thus the "significant main effects" are potentially misleading, as each represents either the association of a predictor with outcome at baseline levels of its interacting predictors or an average over all levels of the interacting predictors, depending on how the model is structured. The way to "interpret the three-way interaction" is to recognize that it represents the additional association with outcome beyond what you would expect based on the individual coefficients ("main" effects) and their two-way interactions. That can be hard to explain in words. One good way to proceed would be to present the overall table of ANOVA results and then illustrate the 3-way interaction by showing representative predictions from the model.
