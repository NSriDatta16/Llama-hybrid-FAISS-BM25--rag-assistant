Clearly a linear combination of discrete variables is discrete. Whether it's reasonable to treat it as if it were continuous will depend. What you may want to avoid would be having any substantive fraction of the distribution focused on only a few possible values. If there was a good spread of values within most of the subscales and they mostly contribute reasonably near to equally (or at least in a way that no subscales very heavily dominate the variance) to that first principal component then you might get a principal component that it would be reasonable to treat as continuous for many different purposes. Of course, how important that is depends on what you're trying to do with it (some things are pretty sensitive to heavy ties, some things are not) and on what characteristics you need the result to have. Why do you care if it's reasonable to treat the result as if it were continuous? Why would you need that? Please note that your question is ambiguous about what you're doing. In the first paragraph you say you're trying to compare these principal components, and in the second paragraph you say you want to determine if there is association. Comparison and looking for association are usually quite different aims. Specifically "compare" would be about looking for differences (or lack of them) in some sense, while association would be looking (presumably in this situation) for some kind of correlation, presumably linear correlation, between pairs of values on the two things. You might talk about how the two sets of principal components might be related without reference to pairs of data (perhaps by looking at the cosine of the angle between the two components in 6-space), but then it's not really clear what that purpose is. What's the underlying research question (/question of interest) here? What's it all for?
