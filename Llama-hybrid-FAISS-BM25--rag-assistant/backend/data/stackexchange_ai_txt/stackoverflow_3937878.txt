This is called memory fragmentation and is a serious problem. You have to report out of memory even though there is technically enough to support the block. Managed languages like C# that don't allow pointers (in the normal case - please don't fixate on this) have the freedom to rearrange the underlying memory and fix this problem (though it's not free in terms of performance). To fix the problem in C: There's not a lot you can do because those pointers into the memory prevent you from reshuffling everything. Someone else has mentioned the buddy system and there are others but few are simple. A lot are based on having preset 'big chunks' and 'small chunks' and only allowing small requests small chunks etc... but that's all to stop arriving at the problem in the first place, once you're there you either deny the memory request or expand the pool.
