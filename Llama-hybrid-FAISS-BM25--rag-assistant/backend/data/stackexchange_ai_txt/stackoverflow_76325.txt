Move Active Directory Group to Another OU using Powershell

How do I move an active directory group to another organizational unit using Powershell? ie. I would like to move the group "IT Department" from: (CN=IT Department, OU=Technology Department, OU=Departments,DC=Company,DC=ca) to: (CN=IT Department, OU=Temporarily Moved Groups, DC=Company,DC=ca)
