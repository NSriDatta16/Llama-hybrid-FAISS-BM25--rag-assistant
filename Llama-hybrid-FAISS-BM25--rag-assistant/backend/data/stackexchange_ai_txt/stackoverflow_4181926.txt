Most browsers will default type to text/javascript , but other values are allowed, see http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp Also, as for W3C specifications As HTML does not rely on a specific scripting language, document authors must explicitly tell user agents the language of each script. This may be done either through a default declaration or a local declaration.
