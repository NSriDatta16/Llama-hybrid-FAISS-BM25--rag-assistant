What does it mean to factor a joint distribution?

A book I'm reading (Hogan & Mason, 2012, p37) contains the following passage: The joint distribution can be factored in two different ways into conditional and marginal probabilities that reveal different aspects of forecast quality. The calibration-refinement factorization is given by $p\left ( \hat{x},x \right) = p\left (x\mid \hat{x}\right)p\left (\hat{x}\right)$ [...] The second way of factoring the joint distribution is known as the likelihood-base rate factorization and is given by $p\left ( \hat{x},x \right) = p\left (\hat{x}\mid x\right)p\left (x\right)$ The context for this passage is the discussion of 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables, where the rows represent binary forecasts and the columns represent binary outcomes. On p32 of the same book a schematic table of this sort is provided. Ideally I'd hope for an answer that doesn't just provide a correct definition, and which also helps to build intuitions about what factorization means and what the point of it is. Hogan, R. J., & Mason, I. B. (2012). Deterministic forecasts of binary events. Forecast Verification: A Practitioner's Guide in Atmospheric Science, Second Edition, 31-59.
