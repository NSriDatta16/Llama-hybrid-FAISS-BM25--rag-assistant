Aggregates may have associations to other aggregate roots. e.g. a comment may have an association to both topic and user. Thats how I would model it anyway, aggregate roots are boundaries of consistency. A Topic does not need to be consistent in any way with its comments, thus comments does not need to be part of that aggregate. A user does not need to be consistent with all of his or her comments so users does not need to know about comments either. I would fetch the comments for a specific topic by the comment repository. e.g. var comments = commentRepo.FindCommentsForTopic(someTopic); //or by topic id for pragmatic reasons.
