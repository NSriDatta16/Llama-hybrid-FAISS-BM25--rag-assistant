Looks fine to me. Only thing I'd change is to use more Powershell features in place of fragile assumptions. E.g.: use Join-Path instead of string concatenation use the Env:\ provider to look up the %programfiles(x86)% dir (or better yet, use the HKML:\ provider to find the path - it's in SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\\InstallDir) when I have to write a string that contains literal doublequotes and variable expansion, I usually fall back to the syntax below. Personal preference, obviously. '"{0}" "{1}" /build "{2}"' -f $devenv, $solutionPath, $releaseProfile In some cases I'd be inclined to use Process.Start() so that I could capture the stdout & stderr streams independently (and maybe even control stdin interactively, depending on the application). PS - the '&' is not strictly necessary.
