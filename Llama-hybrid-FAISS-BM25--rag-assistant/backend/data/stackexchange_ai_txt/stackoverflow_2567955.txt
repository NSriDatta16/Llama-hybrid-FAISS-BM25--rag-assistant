The simple answer: No. Someone has suggested the idea of creating partial Association classes where the property names get defined, but that won't work either: Renaming LINQ 2 SQL Entity Properties Through Partial Classes . Your choice is to either spend a little time learning more about LINQ-to-SQL "behind-the-scenes" so that you can manually make the necessary modifications or to just change the property names through the Properties window. Personally, I just delete/redrag/rename, because not setting a property correctly is a pain to debug because the exceptions that get thrown give you little to no clue as to what caused it. I even went so far as to create a unit test library that takes each MetaTable object in the model and verifies the field count, the ServerDataType contents of each field, the association count, the names of each association, and the names of each end of the association. Every few changes, I run the unit tests to make sure that the model is intact.
