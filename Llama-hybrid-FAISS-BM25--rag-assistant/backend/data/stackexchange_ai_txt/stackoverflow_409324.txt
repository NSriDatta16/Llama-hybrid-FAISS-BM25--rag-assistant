There are two kinds of scrum masters: A project manager whose title has changed because of adoption of Agile. An exclusive scrum master who only facilitates the scrum and reports to the project manager (shusa). The second point is preached and practiced in 'truly' Agile organizations. It is expensive but it has some merits. Also, A scrum master is expected to be present with the sprint team all the time (not literally). If a project manager does that, s/he would be micro-managing. Scrum masters' role is not to manage budgets, but to put predictability around the sprint team, in terms of amount of work that the team can do. Scrum masters should know strengths and weaknesses of team members, and facilitate inter-scrum best practice sharing. So, my point is, if these roles are confused, the team may not do very well.
