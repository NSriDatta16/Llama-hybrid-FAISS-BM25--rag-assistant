Try applying jQuery .mouseout() to those links. $(".myLinks").mouseout(function() { $(this).css('background-position','0 0'); // original position of your sprite }); Dragging out of the link in mid-click (while the mouse is "down") is not something CSS is capable of handling. CSS would require an additional pseudo class like "a:unactive" for the same effect to happen.
