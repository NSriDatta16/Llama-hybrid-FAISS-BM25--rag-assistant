Random forests regression better than OLS out of sample

I am running an OLS regression on panel data. The dependent variable is the governement yield of several countries. The independent variables are several macroeconmic variables (i.e. inflation, unemployment, etc.). My data consists of 10 years of data for several countries (100 observations in total). I am using the LSDV method for Fixed effects. In the end, I obtain an adjusted R-squared of around 85%. On the other hand, I ran a random Forest using the same data. Here, I obtained an R-squared of 60%. I know these two R-squares are not really comparable. Therefore, I did a cross validation. I prepared a training set (first 8 years) and a test set (last 2 years). Then, I ran both models (OLS and random forests). The Random Forest regression outperforms OLS in the test set (using RMSE). However,RF seems to underperform insample. Have you had any similar results in the past? Thanks Jonas
