I also think @Tommy has the correct answer, but it's also worth considering that the built in storage classes are heavily optimized. Unless you are confident that performance will be an issue, it may be easier to use NSMutableArray and only move away after you've shown that you're having performance issues. If you need to store primitive values, take a look at CFMutableArray .
