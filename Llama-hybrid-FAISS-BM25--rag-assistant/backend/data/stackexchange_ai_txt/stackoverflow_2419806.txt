Non-Secure Video on https page

Okay, so I have created a webpage for a client who is using https protocol, but wants to stream video from a non-secured source (not YouTube, unfortunately). Best case scenario: I'd be looking for a way to stream the video without getting security warnings for mixed content (especially a problem in any IE). I realize this may be impossible, so my secondary question would be how to put some sort of placeholder into the page if the user decides not to view the non-secure content. This way my layout is not totally butchered. Obviously though, it would be best not to trip any security issues. The video we are trying to stream is accessed via the below code (given by client for embedding), if that helps anything. Any help is appreciated!
