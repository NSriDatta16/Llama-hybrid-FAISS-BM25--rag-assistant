It might be more useful to reframe the probelm more pragmatically, compared to scientifically. Many real-world classification problems have a long tail of categories with relatively few examples. The most common pragmatic approaches: Drop the instances where the category has relatively few examples Group categories together into a new catch-all category, aka "dustbin" Use domain knowledge to group categories together The result is fewer categories with more examples in each category. There will still be categories of more or fewer examples, aka majority/minority categories. Then other approaches can be taken (e.g., resampling or class weights).
