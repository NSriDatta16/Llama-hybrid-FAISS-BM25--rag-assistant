DOCTYPE html PUBLIC DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional

In the master page of mine the above line exists But why is it getting me problems? In a content page i am embedding an SWF object var flashvars = {xmlPath: "xml/" + GetQueryString("x") + ".xml" }; var params = { allowFullScreen: "true", wmode: "transparent" }; var attributes = {}; swfobject.embedSWF("main.swf", "gallery", "100%", "100%", "9.0.0", "expressInstall.swf", flashvars, params, attributes); If i comment out the DOCTYPE "line" the SWF object fills the screen (As it should). If i DO NOT comment out the DOCTYPE "line" the SWF object fills only in horizontal direction. So what is going on here? Could i have both DOCTYPE and the SWF object tiled in both vertical and horizontal direction? UPDATE: And here is the CSS that is applied without success *{ margin:0; padding:0; } html, body, #gallery { background: #EFEFEF; height:100%; } body { margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden; } ANOTHER UPDATE: In Chrome it works great, in Internet explorer the SWF fills 20% of the display and is placed at the top of the page and finally in Firefox, nothing is displayed.
