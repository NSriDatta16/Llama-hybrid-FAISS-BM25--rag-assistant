Finding out if a sentence is a question is not an easiest task, because there is many ways how people asks questions, many of them do not follows grammar rules. Therefore it is hard to find a good rule set for the detection. In such situations, I would go for machine learning and train an algorithm using annotated text corpus (creating a corpus and selecting a feature set can take some time). The machine learning based recognition should provide you better recall than the rule based approach. Here is a step by step instruction: Manual creation of train data set: Get an annotated -- with information if it is a question or not -- text collection or create such a corpus on your own (it should be more then 100 documents and many questions must not be straightforward questions ) Find most important features - extract part-of-speeches, 5W1H (what, which,..., how), get a position of a verb in each of sentences, and other things that can be useful in the recognition of a question Create a vector for each of sentences of features (you need both, positive and negative examples) based on the extracted informaiton, e.g., | Has ? | A verb on second position | Has 5W1H | Is 5W1H on 1st position in sentence | ... | length of sentence | Is a question | Use the vectors to train a machine learning algorithm , e.g., MaximumEntropy, SVM (you can use Wekka or Knime ) Use the trained algorithm for the question recognition. If needed (new question examples), repeat steps.
