Why won't Magento layout load

I am currently trying to replicate my IndexController to a BetaController. I want Beta to use the same template files as Index and I thought I have it correct in the layout xml file, but apparently it is not working correctly. I know the Beta controller is working correctly since I can output text from the controller. Here is my layout xml file. page/1column.phtml page/1column.phtml Basically what I did was created a new block called searchengine_beta_index and copied and pasted the contents from searchengine_index_index. Is this wrong? Should I have done something else?
