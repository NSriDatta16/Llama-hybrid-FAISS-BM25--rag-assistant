Getting SSL to work with Apache/Passenger on OSX

I use apache/passenger on my development machine, but need to add SSL support (something which isn't exposed through the control panel). I've done this before in production, but for some reason I can't seem to get it work on OSX. The steps I've followed so far are from a default apache osx install: Install passenger and passenger preference pane. Add my rails app (this works) Create my ca.key, server.crt and server.key as detailed on the apple website . At this point I need to start editing the apache configs, so I added: # Apache knows to listen on port 443 for ssl requests. Listen 443 Listen 80 I thought I'd try editing the passenger pref pane generated config first to get everything working, when I add: It starts off looking like this ServerName myapp.local DocumentRoot "/Users/jonnii/programming/ruby/myapp/public" RailsEnv development Order allow,deny Allow from all I then append this: ServerName myapp.local DocumentRoot "/Users/jonnii/programming/ruby/myapp/public" RailsEnv development Order allow,deny Allow from all # SSL Configuration SSLEngine on SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +StdEnvVars +StrictRequire #Self Signed certificates SSLCertificateFile /private/etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /private/etc/apache2/ssl.key/server.key SSLCertificateChainFile /private/etc/apache2/ssl.key/ca.crt SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0 The files referenced all exist (I doubled checked that), but now when I restart my apache I can't even get to myapp.local . However apache can still server the default page when I click on it in the sharing preference panel. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
