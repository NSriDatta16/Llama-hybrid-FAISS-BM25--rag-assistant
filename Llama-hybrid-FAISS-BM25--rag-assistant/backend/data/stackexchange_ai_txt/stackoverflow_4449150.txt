I wanted to comment on this answer but I'm not allowed yet so I have to post a new one. Pay attention that after cloning the svn remotes you have to init them locally, which is described in the docs. However, citing the docs: be sure to use the same URL and -T/-b/-t options as were used on server. git config -l | grep remote will list all configuration for all remotes (url, branches, ignore etc.) on the host repository. The output will be similar to: svn-remote.svn/bbpress.url=http://svn.automattic.com/bbpress/trunk svn-remote.svn/bbpress.fetch=:refs/remotes/svn/bbpress Then add it to, say, .gitignore (commenting with # and replacing = with a space) for future reference. After cloning use git config --add with this info, and you'll get the exact copy of those remotes.
