If I'm not wrong, you are trying to see which parameters to the SVM gives you the best result. Your problem is model/curve fitting. I worked on a similar problem couple of years ago. There are tons of libraries and algos to do the same. I used Newton-Raphson 's algorithm and a variation of genetic algorithm to fit the curve. Generate/guess/get the result you are hoping for, through real world experiment (or if you are doing simple classification, just do it yourself). Compare this with the output of your SVM. The algos I mentioned earlier reiterates this process till the result of your model(SVM in this case) somewhat matches the expected values (note that this process would take some time based your problem/data size.. it took about 2 months for me on a 140 node beowulf cluster). If you choose to go with Newton-Raphson's, this might be a good place to start.
