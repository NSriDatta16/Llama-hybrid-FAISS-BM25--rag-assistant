mysql import vertical csv data

I have a spreadsheet that is currently formatted improperly for a mysql import. The data are organized by column rather than by row. So, the first column has the field names, the second column contains record 1, and so on. Is it possible for mysql to understand this data? If not, any ideas on how to import these data besides redoing the spreadsheet? The data are currently in a google doc. Edit: I write php, if that helps the matter at all, though I was planning on importing using sequel pro.
