I'd consider this a nasty hack and try to avoid it if possible, but... You can mark the backing field as obsolete so that the compiler will generate a warning when you try to access it, and then suppress that warning for the property getter/setter. The warning codes that you'd need to suppress are CS0612 for the plain Obsolete attribute and CS0618 if the attribute has a custom message. [Obsolete("Please don't touch the backing field!")] private int _backingField; public int YourProperty { #pragma warning disable 612, 618 get { return _backingField; } set { _backingField = value; } #pragma warning restore 612, 618 }
