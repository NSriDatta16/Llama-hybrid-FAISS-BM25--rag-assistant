In Magento, how can i put an items shipping cost on the product page?

I want to put a shipping cost on the actual product page in Magento, so customers can see how much it will cost them. I can add in the shipping estimator from the basket page. But all i actually want is a line of text under the product price saying shipping from £XX.XX I have seen this tutorial: http://aneeshsreedharan.wordpress.com/2010/04/28/estimating-shipping-rate-on-product-details-page-in-magento/#comment-10 but it is not working for me on Magento 1.4.2 - i think this an older version is used on this tutorial. I am using a weight based table rate shipping method at the moment, with only one option. EDIT: I worked out the problem in the end: Rather embarrasingly I didnt realise the blog was stripping the formatting out. It was changing the ' to a ‘ I can now confirm the code below does display the shipping: isSaleable()) { $quote = Mage::getModel('sales/quote'); $quote->getShippingAddress()->setCountryId('*'); $quote->addProduct($_product); $quote->getShippingAddress()->collectTotals(); $quote->getShippingAddress()->setCollectShippingRates(true); $quote->getShippingAddress()->collectShippingRates(); $rates = $quote->getShippingAddress()->getShippingRatesCollection(); foreach ($rates as $rate) { echo $rate->getPrice(); } } ?>
