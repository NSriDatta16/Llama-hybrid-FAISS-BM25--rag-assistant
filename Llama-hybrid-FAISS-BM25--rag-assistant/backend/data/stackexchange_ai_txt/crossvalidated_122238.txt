Mnemonics neatly eliminate manâ€™s only nemesis: insufficient cerebral storage. There is SNOUT SPIN: A S e n sitive test, when N egative rules OUT disease A Sp ecific test, when P ositive, rules IN a disease. I imagine a pig spinning around in a centrifuge, perhaps in preparation for going into space, to help me remember this mnemonic. Humming the theme to Tail Spin with the words appropriately changed can help the musically inclined from a certain generation. I am not aware of any others.
