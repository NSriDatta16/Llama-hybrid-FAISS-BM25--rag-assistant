Response to Question 1: No. The contrast matrix you have illustrated asks for 4 contrasts: Fri vs Wed, Mon vs Wed, Thu vs Wed, and Tue vs Wed. Wed was chosen because R goes alphabetical. You could control this by ordering the df$day factor. The contrast you have specified: "1,1,1,1,-4" requests the average of Fri-Mon-Thu-Tue versus Wed and could be specified as cbind(c(1,1,1,1,-4)). Response to Question 2: Yes. The contrast in column 1 is comparing Treatment 1 to Treatment 5. Response to Question 3: cbind(c(-2,-1,0,1,2),c(0,0,0,0,0),c(0,0,0,0,0),c(0,0,0,0,0)) would generate a matrix in which the first column has the linear trend contrast IF the coefficients are in order. Note that in your day of the week example, your order is Fri-Mon-Thu-Tue-Wed and so this would not be a time-linear-trend since the factor levels are not order. So beware of that and use ordered factors to keep from pulling your hair out.
