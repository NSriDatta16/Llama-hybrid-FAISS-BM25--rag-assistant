Yup, It works fine. I am using it on a regression data set in which there aren't any binary values to begin with. For more reference, you can refer to classical examples like wine classification. In this datasets there are binary and real attributes. This classification problem was solved using Neural Networks and its variants by many: Comparative study of artificial neural network and multivariate methods to classify Spanish DO rose wines
