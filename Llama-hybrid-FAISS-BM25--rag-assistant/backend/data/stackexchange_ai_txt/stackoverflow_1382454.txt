Beginning with Xcode 3.2, Apple decided to not include project and file templates from 3rd party projects (including PyObjC, RubyCocoa or MacRuby). Since these template files were often updated more frequently than Xcode's release cycle, the templates shipped with Xcode were often out of date. Developers are now encouraged to install the templates directly from those projects' repositories. PyObjC templates are currently available only in SVN, though the PyObjC devs intend to make them available on the website "soon". This question details how to install new templates.
