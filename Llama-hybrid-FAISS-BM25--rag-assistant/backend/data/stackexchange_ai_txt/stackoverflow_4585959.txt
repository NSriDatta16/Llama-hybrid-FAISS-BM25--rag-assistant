Problem with JAXB and Hibernate3 illegal access

I'm migrating a system from hibernate2 to hibernate 3 and i'm getting the following error: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method com.sun.xml.bind.DatatypeConverterImpl. ()V from class com.sun.xml.bind.DefaultJAXBContextImpl at com.sun.xml.bind.DefaultJAXBContextImpl. (DefaultJAXBContextImpl.java:73) at com.sun.xml.bind.ContextFactory.createContext(ContextFactory.java:39) I have already searched in the hibernate migration guides and found nothing on this topic. Searching on google also proved no good. This error has been pesking me for some time already and I would like any kind of assistance. Thanks for you attention.
