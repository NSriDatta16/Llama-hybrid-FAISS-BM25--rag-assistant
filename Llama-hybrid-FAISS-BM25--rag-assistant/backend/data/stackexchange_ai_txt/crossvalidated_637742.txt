Does performing Likelihood Ratio Test to compare two nested LASSO models make statistical sense?

From what I've studied, the LRT is used to compare two nested models, i.e. 2 models having different sets of nested features, in my case e.g. Model1: binary_outcome ~ X1 + X2 Model2: binary_outcome ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 All the examples I could find online used simple linear/logistic regressions. I'd like to use LASSO to prevent overfitting since I have a lot of features. However, I also have high collinearity because many features are correlated. I also read that LASSO is unstable with highly correlated features... So my question is: Does performing a LRT test of two nested LASSO models make statistical sense?
