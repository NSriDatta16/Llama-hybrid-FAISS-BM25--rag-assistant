Huge difference in Wald and LR test in Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression

I have a dataset with 3726 observations. The values of '1' in the response variable is extremely rare: I have five 1's and 3721 0's. I used Firth's logistic regression to address this rarity (using logistf() and brglm() in R). I used 11 explanatory variables (mostly categorical). The results of Wald test show many of the variables significant with 90% confidence level. However, the LR test rejects the significance of all the variables, and almost all LR-based confidence intervals include 0. Why is there a huge difference and which one should I rely on? Thanks.
