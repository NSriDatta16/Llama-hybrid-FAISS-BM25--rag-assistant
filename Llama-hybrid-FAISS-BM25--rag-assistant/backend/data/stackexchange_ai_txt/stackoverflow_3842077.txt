Glad you found your problem, but to actually answer your question about the tag variable, it's simply a way to track messages. The tag is not sent with the messages, but when a response comes to it, that will have the same tag, so you can organize them. If you don't need to do that sort of thing, just leave tag as 0 and you can ignore it.
