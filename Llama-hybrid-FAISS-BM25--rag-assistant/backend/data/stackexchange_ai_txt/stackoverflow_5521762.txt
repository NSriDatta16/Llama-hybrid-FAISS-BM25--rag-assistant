Create a bit array of length 2^32 bits (initialize to zero), that would be about 512MB and will fit into RAM on any modern machine. Start reading the file, int by int, check bit with the same index as the value of the int, if the bit is set you have found a duplicate, if it is zero, set to one and proceed with the next int from the file. The trick is to find a suitable data structure and algorithm. In this case everything fits into RAM with a suitable data structure and a simple and efficient algorithm can be used. If the numbers are int64 you need to find a suitable sorting strategy or make multiple passes, depending on how much additional storage you have available.
