I'm not sure, but my understanding is that memoization requires that given a function y = f(u) , that f be deterministic (that is, for a given u , the y must always be the same), in order that the results of f may be stored. Caching to me seems to be more of a problem of determining what pieces of data are accessed frequently, and keeping those data in fast storage. The former is deterministic while the latter is stochastic.
