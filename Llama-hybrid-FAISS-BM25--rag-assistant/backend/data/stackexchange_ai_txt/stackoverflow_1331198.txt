I would suggest showing your UI to as many people as you can--preferably people who read a lot (Just because reading does wonders for your grammar and vocabulary). Getting something out that people can examine, however, is awesome--even if it's just a demo of the GUI. If you work at a company, get to know your QA and Tech Support people. They are usually really wonderful once they understand what you are trying to do--they will review your UI, give you input on text and usability as well as possibly new requirements nobody in engineering would come up with. If you work on your own, try to find a potential customer or two to review your UI. Ask them to pay attention to the text... The more eyes, the better. You might even ask your parents, wife or other family. What can it hurt?
