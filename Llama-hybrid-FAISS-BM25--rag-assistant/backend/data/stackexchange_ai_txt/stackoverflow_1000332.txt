I think you'll have to find the source of Gant.groovy and see what it's doing on that line. Apparently there is some problem caused by your project's specific configuration (since such a show-stopper bug would have been caught if it always occurred), but the error message does not contain much information. Alternatively, you could try upgrading Grails to the latest version 1.1.1 if you haven't already.
