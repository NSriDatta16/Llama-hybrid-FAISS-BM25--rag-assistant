Aggregate data - Difference in Differences Analysis

I am currently working on a DID analysis on the causal effect of a vacancy tax on the breaking and entering rate in the city. The purpose of the tax is to create an incentive for people to put empty and under-utilized homes onto the market. It taxes homes that are empty for more than 6 months in the reference year. My theoretical framework consists of social disorganization theory and broken window theory. The reasoning is that more empty homes means more opportunity for crimes, so less empty homes means less opportunity for crimes. The tax (treatment) took effect right away at the beginning of 2017. I have data of the numbers of breaking and entering for the treatment city and control city from 2014 to 2017 (3 pre-treatment and 1 post-treatment periods). I can get more pre-treatment data if needed but I believe 3 should be enough to establish trend assumption. Can I use my current data to do a difference in differences analysis? I am new to DID and I am not quite sure how to create an appropriate equation. Thank you in advance for your help!
