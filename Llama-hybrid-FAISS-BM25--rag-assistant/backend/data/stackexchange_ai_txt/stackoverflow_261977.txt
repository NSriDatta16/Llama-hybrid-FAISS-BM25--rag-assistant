I believe that since both sources share the same grain the answer is that you should have one fact table. Think about how you want your end-users to interact with the information. If it makes sense and the business reports will benefit from those data being co-located then that is your answer. Try though to avoid nulls in your fact tables. If you can enter a zero (and the zero makes sense for the data, i.e., think temperature) then do that. It will save your users some confusion and as TrickyNixon pointed out will cause aggregation issues. Actually you're at a great point here on the 'brownfield' application. You can look at what exists today and leverage experience to create a better design. This is the most important time to select the best grain that will hopefully not change for the life of the DW.
