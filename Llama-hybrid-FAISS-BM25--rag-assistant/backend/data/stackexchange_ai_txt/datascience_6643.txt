Do I need to buy a NVIDIA graphic card to run deep learning algorithm?

I am new in deep learning. I am running a MacBook Pro yosemite (upgraded from Snowleopard). I don't have a CUDA-enabled card GPU, and running the code on the CPU is extremely slow. I heard that I can buy some instances on AWS, but it seems that they don't support macOS. My question is, to continue with the deep learning, do I need to purchase a graphic card? Or is there other solution? I don't want to spend too much on this...
