We can generalise your problem by allowing any $y \in \mathbb{N}$ and assuming discrete states $x = 0,1,2...,y$ . Assuming that gamble outcomes are independent with fixed win-probability $0 , the transition matrix $\mathbf{P}$ for the Markov chain has elements: $$\mathbf{P}_{x_t,x_{t+1}}(y) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{I}(x_{t+1} = 0) & & \text{for } x_t = 0, \\[6pt] (1-\theta) \cdot \mathbb{I}(x_{t+1} = 0) + \theta \cdot \mathbb{I}(x_{t+1} = 2x_t) & & \text{for } x_t = 1,...,\lfloor y/2 \rfloor, \\[6pt] (1-\theta) \cdot \mathbb{I}(x_{t+1} = 2x_t-y) + \theta \cdot \mathbb{I}(x_{t+1} = y) & & \text{for } x_t = \lfloor y/2 \rfloor + 1,...,y-1. \\[6pt] \mathbb{I}(x_{t+1} = y) & & \text{for } x_t = y. \\[6pt] \end{cases}$$ The generalised transition matrix can be programmed in R as follows: TRANS_MATRIX Setting $y=20$ and $\theta = \tfrac{1}{2}$ gives the desired transition matrix, which we can display in R as follows: #Generate transition matrix MATRIX
