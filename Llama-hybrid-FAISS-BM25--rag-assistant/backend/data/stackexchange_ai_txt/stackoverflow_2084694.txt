How to input the image to the neural network?

I understand how neural networks work, but if I want to use them for image processing like actual character recognition, I can't understand how can I input the image data to the neural net. I have a very big image of an A letter. Maybe I should try to get some info/specifications from the image and then use a vector of values of that specification? And they will be the input for the neural net? Who has already done such a thing, can you explain how to do this?
