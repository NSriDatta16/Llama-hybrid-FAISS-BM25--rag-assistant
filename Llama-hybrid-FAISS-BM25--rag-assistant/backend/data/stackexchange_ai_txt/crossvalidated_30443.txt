As Procrastinator points out through the reference there are very many ways to generate bootstrap confidence intervals. The method you described is called Efron's percentile method. All bootstrap confidence intervals are approximate in term of the actual coverage. The referenced paper by Efron and DiCiccio describes several of them. Another paper that I recommend that explains the differences between the various bootstrap method is another article in Statistical Science by Efron and Tibshirani that appeared in 1986. They have a table that is particularly good at showing when the various methods work best. I go over this in some detail in my book "Bootstrap Methods: A Guide for Practitioners and Researchers, 2nd Edition" (2007).
