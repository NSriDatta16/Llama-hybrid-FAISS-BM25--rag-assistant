You want to reverse the problem: use the three classes to predict the binary outcome. This is essentially ANOVA but with a binary response instead of a normal response. I would use logistic regression and likelihood ratio test the model with the three-level categorical predictor (and an intercept) against a model with just an intercept. (This is essentially what ANOVA does.) This is easy to implement in R as well as other software. I will give an R example with a binary predictor, but you can tweak this for your problem with a three-way predictor. library(lmtest) set.seed(2020) x That final line with the lrtest does the likelihood ratio test to see if the predictor category influences the response.
