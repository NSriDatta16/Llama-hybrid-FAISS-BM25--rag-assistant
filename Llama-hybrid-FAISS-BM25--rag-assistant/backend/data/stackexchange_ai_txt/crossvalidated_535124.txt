If you have no observed correlation, then your covariance matrix is diagonal, and the PCA diagonalizes a matrix that is already diagonal (so it does nothing). If you have no population correlation but observe small sample correlations due to sampling variability, then the PCA is diagonalizing a covariance matrix that is nearly diagonal, and the result will be a minimally different set of features from the PCA.
