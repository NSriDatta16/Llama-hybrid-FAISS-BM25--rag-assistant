First, one thing that comes to mind is that the tournament data is different - the time effect was already mentioned before. Other possibilities include differently encoded features or unusual conditions. Another possibility is that you did both the cross validation and the evaluation on the test set incorrectly. I am slighty alarmed by I have 1110 examples of matches from the year 2013, with their outcomes and (which seems to me) relevant features. When testing the predictive power of your model it is important to not have the test data affect the model at all. One common and potentially very serious error is too pick features first using all the data. This includes an informal analysis using PCA or even just looking closely at the data. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning should always be done using training data only.
