I'm starting to put together a genie animation effect for iPhone, at git://github.com/rmd6502/Genie.git . Right now it's unbearably slow, as I'm doing all the calculations 'manually' rather than leveraging the hardware, but improvements are forthcoming. Any experienced GL developers who would like to contribute, please feel free to fork and send pull requests!
