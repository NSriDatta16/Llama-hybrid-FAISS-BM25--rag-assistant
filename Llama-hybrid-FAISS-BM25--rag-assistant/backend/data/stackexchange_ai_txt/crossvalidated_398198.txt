If the reasons for missingness invalidate a survival regression model, they certainly invalidate a logistic regression as well. If missingness still gives you a sample that is a simple-random-sample (SRS), then you can analyze those data as-is. The only issue might be small sample size: then collect more data. Weighting or imputation methods would only make a difference if you "knew something" about the remaining samples in the freezer. It does concern me somewhat that "availability in a freezer" is listed as reason you don't think you might have a non-representative sample. If you "sampled" the average expiry of milk at the grocery store by picking the first cartons from the shelf, the estimate would be biased because of a FIFO system: the older milks are setup to be bought first. In general, anything preferentially sampled because of convenience, time, or space tends to be non-representative (meaning some methods must be applied to calibrate estimates toward a target population). You can confirm this by actually performing an SRS of specimens from the freezer and ascertaining the collection date and also the exposure to determine if there is an association or otherwise.
