Connection between standard error of OLS and Logistic regression

I know that for OLS: $y=X\beta+\epsilon$ with $\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ , we have $var(\widehat{\beta}|X)=\sigma^2(X^TX)^{-1}$ . For logistic: $y^*=X\beta+\mu$ , where $\mu\sim logit(0,1)$ , and what we observe is y the indicator function, the variance of $\beta$ converges to $(X^TWX)^{-1}$ , where $W$ is diagonal with entries $p(x_i)(1-p(x_i))$ . The two formulae seem so similar to me, not just the $X^TX$ bit but also $p(1-p)$ is the variance of the binary $y$ . It's clear to me in OLS, variance of $\beta$ increases as variance of error increases. For logistic, can I understand it as: the variance of $y$ goes into $X\beta$ with variance of $\mu$ fixed, so it kind of goes to $\mu$ inversely with $X\beta$ fixed? In particular, I am wondering if my $X$ and underlying $\beta$ are the same, with the same variance in $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ , would my standard errors be pretty much the same/similar?
