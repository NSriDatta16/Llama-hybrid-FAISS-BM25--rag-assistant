If you want to take things further, then have a look at the actual function code of plm:::plm You will notice that there is a lot of argument checking, before a final call to plm:::plm.fit You could (if really wanted), skip straight to plm.fit . One final point. You mention that your problem is a Monte Carlo simulation. Can you leverage parallel computing for your speed increases?
