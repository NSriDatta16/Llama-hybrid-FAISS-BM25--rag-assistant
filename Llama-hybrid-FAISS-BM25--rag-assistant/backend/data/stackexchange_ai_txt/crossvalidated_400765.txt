Bishop (2006). Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) If you have ever heard about The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL), PRML can be treated as a bayesian version of it. The book talks about the most important models in statistical/machine learning from linear regression, NN, SVM to graphical models, all in bayesian perspective. The introduction to EM algorithm, variational inference and MCMC are well written.
