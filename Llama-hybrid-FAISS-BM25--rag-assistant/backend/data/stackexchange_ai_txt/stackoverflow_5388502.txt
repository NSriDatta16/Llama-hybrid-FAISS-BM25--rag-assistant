Erratic jQuery Draggable Behavior

I have a diamond-shaped grid (so a normal square grid, rotated 45 degrees) and I want to be able to drag a point around inside of this grid. I made my grid using the canvas element and applied a transform: rotate(45deg). However, this causes the jQuery draggable behavior to become completely erratic and I'm not sure a) what the pattern is to the new behavior and b) how to fix it or work around. Here's a link to the code: http://jsfiddle.net/Xgmgf/8/
