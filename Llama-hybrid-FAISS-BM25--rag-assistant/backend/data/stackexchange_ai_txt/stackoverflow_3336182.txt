There is currently no solution to your problem, as far as I know: the function that you give to map() must be accessible through an import of your module. This is why robert's code works: the function f() can be obtained by importing the following code: def f(x): return x*x class Calculate(object): def run(self): p = Pool() return p.map(f, [1,2,3]) if __name__ == '__main__': cl = Calculate() print cl.run() I actually added a "main" section, because this follows the recommendations for the Windows platform ("Make sure that the main module can be safely imported by a new Python interpreter without causing unintended side effects"). I also added an uppercase letter in front of Calculate , so as to follow PEP 8 . :)
