The best number of nodes in bottleneck layer in Autoencoder

I would like to perform dimensionality reduction using autoencoders (similar to PCA) and I am not sure how many components are optimal i.e. what should be the size of the bottleneck layer. I was wondering if there is any standard way to automatically find the optimal number of nodes in the bottleneck layer.
