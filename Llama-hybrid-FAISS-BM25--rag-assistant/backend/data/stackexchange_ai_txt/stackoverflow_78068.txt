You've got most of it covered. I always add space, time and money for 2 more things you might consider strange. A machine set up just like the average user. No development or debugging tools installed. Make it look like someone just bought it from the Apple store. I do image switching but I've know people who swear by switching to an external boot drive. Also include a 'free' lunch for a virgin. This is someone to come in and test your program that is NOT a developer and doesn't know squat about your software. You might have to do this more than once but don't ever use the same person again. As an added note, make very sure the 'free' applications and web sites you use are truly free, not just free for personal use! Good luck on your project!
