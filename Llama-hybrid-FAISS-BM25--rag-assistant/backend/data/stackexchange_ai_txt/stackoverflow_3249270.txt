Putting several hundred .doc pages into webpage

I have hundreds of .doc files with text that I need put on web pages. I realize I could convert every .doc file to .txt, then use a server side include to embed the contents of each page into a webpage. This would save a lot of time because I could simply have one .php?txt=... page which will display a different .txt include depending on the link the user pressed to get there. This works perfectly content-wise. However, all formatting is lost when it is converted to .txt (titles should be in bold) When I convert these .doc files to .html using Microsoft Word, the ~20 line documents become bloated >300 line .htm files (probably because each paragraph is put into textboxes) Dreamweaver's "Clean up Word HTML" helped a bit but the code was still extremely bloated. How would you suggest going about this? edit: I may have solved my own question, trying to embed Google docs into my page.
