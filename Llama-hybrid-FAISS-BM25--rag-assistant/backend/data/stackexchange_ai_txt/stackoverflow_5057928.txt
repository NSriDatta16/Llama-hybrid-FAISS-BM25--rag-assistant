Querying my JPA provider (Hibernate) for a collection of of an entity

I have an entity which looks something like this: Id (PK) Name Other business properties and associations... I have the need for my DAL (JPA with hibernate as provider) to return a list of the entities which correlate to some constraints (or just return them all) but instead of returning the entities themselves I'd like to receive only the Id and the Name properties. I know this can be achieved with HQL/SQL (something like: select id,name from entity where...) but I don't want to go down that road. I was thinking of somehow defining the pair a compositioned part of the entity and thought that might help me but I'm not sure that's "legal" as the Id is the PK. The logic for this scenario is to have a textbox which asynchronously queries the web-service (and through it the DAL) for the relevant entities and once an entity is selected then it is loaded as a whole and shipped to the front-end. Update: I am now pretty confident I'll be using the CriteriaBuilder interface of JPA to build queries and so JPQL/HQL is completely off the table. I think I might be looking for JPA's equivalent to Hibernate's resultTransformer (and I'll give it a non persisted class). Would appreciate any feedback, Ittai
