Is there a way to disable code coverage in PHPUnit for a single test?

Every time I run a single unit test in PHPUnit, a code coverage report is also generated. I have an older computer here at work, and if I could disable the code coverage when I don't need it, that would put less strain on my CPU. Is there a way to disable the code coverage on a per-test basis? I couldn't find any command-line switch that would do it.
