Significance testing between two mean correlation values

I have collected 50 data points from 9 individuals for 4 variables, say, a,b,c,d . For each individual, I correlated ab and cd using a Pearson correlation. Aim: I would like to test whether across all 9 individuals, correlation( ab ) is significantly different to correlation( cd ). Thus, I took an average of all the correlation( ab ) values after Fisher r-to-z transforming them, and did the same for correlation( cd ). I would now like to test whether or not these mean correlation values are significantly different. I have found this online calculator: http://vassarstats.net/rdiff.html In this calculator, I will set r equal to my mean correlations. I am wondering if n should be set to the total number of data points across all 9 individuals (450), or if n should equal the number of individuals the mean correlation was determined from (9)?
