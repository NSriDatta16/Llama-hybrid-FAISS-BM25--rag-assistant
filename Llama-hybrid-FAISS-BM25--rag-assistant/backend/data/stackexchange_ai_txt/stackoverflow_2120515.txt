I'd ask something like: a) what about caching? b) how can cache be organised? c) are you sure, you do not do extra DB queries? (In my first stuff I've made on PHP it was a mysql_query inside foreach to get names of users who've made comments... terrible :) ) d) why register_globals is evil? e) why and how you should split view from code? f) what is the main aim of "implement"? Here are questions that were not clear at all for me after I've read some basic books. I've found out all about injections and csx, strpos in a few days\weeks through thousands of FAQs in the web. But until I found answers to these questions my code was really terrible :)
