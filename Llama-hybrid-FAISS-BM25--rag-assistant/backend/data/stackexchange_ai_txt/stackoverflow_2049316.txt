What's the breakdown of that 1.7s? I suspect you are measuring the entire process? Using this piece of code I get about 200ms in average: var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/"); var stopwatch = new Stopwatch(); stopwatch.Start(); using (var response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse()) { stopwatch.Stop(); Console.WriteLine("Elapsed: {0}ms", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds); var responseStream = response.GetResponseStream(); if (responseStream != null) using (var sr = new StreamReader(responseStream)) Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", Regex.Match(sr.ReadToEnd(), @"title>(.*) Edit changed the code just to measure the actual HTTP request and tried again using Fiddler as well: Program above: Elapsed: 78ms Fiddler: Overall Elapsed: 00:00:00.0620000
