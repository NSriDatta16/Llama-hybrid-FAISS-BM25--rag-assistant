Memristors vs neural network nodes, what's the difference?

Knowing very little about AI, just a little puzzled by the claim that memristors may finally lead to AI that will equal, and likely pass, the power of the human brain. So, what's the difference between memristors (hardware) vs neural network nodes (software)? Very possible the two are complete non-related, but given that it's my understanding is neural networks are used to simulate "bio neural networks" seems to me that memristors are just the silco version of the bio version that is emulated by neural networks. Reason I ask, is because if they're very close or the same in concept (meaning they only differ in implementation) no idea how one could make the claim that memristors will close the gap on AI.
