I decided to write my own drag and drop list control for this one using JQuery and JQuery UI. You can try out a sample here: demo . The right side sort list will scroll down if the left list is too long thus making it easier to drag and drop. I still have more testing and a few bug fixes on this one, but it seems to be working pretty well.
