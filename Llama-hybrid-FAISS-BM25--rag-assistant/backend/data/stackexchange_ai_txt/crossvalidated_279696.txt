Very long autocorrelation with low Augmented Dick Fuller test result

I have daily a time series that after being first order differenced, has the ACF sinusoidal and that decays very slowly (more than 50 periods) and with a PACF, also oscillating, with very high values for the first 10 periods and above the 90% line. That would indicate a non-stationary series, but the Augmented Dick Fuller test is giving Test Statistic -11.116 p-value 0.000 Lags 25.000 Number of Obs 1700.000 Critical Value 1% -3.434 Critical Value 5% -2.863 Critical Value 10% -2.568 So it seems that the series is stationary. How can this be?
