I noticed when looking through the JavaDocs that requestFocus() "is discouraged because its behavior is platform dependent." You should use requestFocusInWindow() instead and see if the same problem occurs with it. requestFocusInWindow is part of the Focus subsystem , introduced in Java 1.4. On a side note, the default Apple Look and Feel has at least one property in the apple.laf namespace: apple.laf.useScreenMenuBar Edit: According to Sun , the Macintosh look and feel is only available on Macs.
