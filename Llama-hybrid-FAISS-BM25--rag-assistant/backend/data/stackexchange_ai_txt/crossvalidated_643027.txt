How to compare a single (counted) value to a mean for statistical significance in R

I am working on a project estimating salmon escapement through visual spawner surveys. We conducted weekly surveys and counted the number of individuals we observed. These numbers were used in an Area-under-the-curve model to estimate the number of salmon present across the entire survey period. This model provides a cumulative estimate (single value) with no mean or sd. I want to compare the current year's estimate (374.43) to the average escapement across previous years' estimates (n=19, mean=432.2179, sd=632.0642) to determine if my escapement estimate for this year significantly differed from historical data for a given stream.
