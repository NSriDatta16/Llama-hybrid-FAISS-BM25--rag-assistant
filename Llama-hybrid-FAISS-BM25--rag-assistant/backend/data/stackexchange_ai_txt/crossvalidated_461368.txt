Overfitting is a symptom of a complex model memorizing data. If you are you tuning hyperparameters (and thus giving your model the option to grow in complexity) on data that occurs during the same period of time on which you are training this may be occurring. IE you state you are training and validating on 2000-2018. Hold out several years for validation. If this still doesn't yield acceptable results consider a model designed for sequential data like an RNN.
