I think you are talking about the stalker app... // Tell the "stalker" rectangle to move to each touch-down - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [UIView beginAnimations:@"stalk" context:nil]; [UIView setAnimationDuration:1]; //[UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut]; [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES]; // touches is an NSSet. Take any single UITouch from the set UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; // Move the rectangle to the location of the touch stalker.center = [touch locationInView:self]; [UIView commitAnimations]; }
