Repeated CrossValidation, finalModel and ROC curves

I got a problem understanding the meaning of the finalModel when using a repeated CV. ctrl = trainControl(method="repeatedcv", number=10, repeats = 300, savePredictions = TRUE, classProbs = TRUE) mdl = train("Label~.", data=Data, method = "glm", trControl = ctrl) pred = predict(mdl, newdata = Data, type="prob") roc.1 = roc(Data$Label, pred$control) roc.2 = roc(mdl$pred$obs,mdl$pred$control) from what I understand : In roc.1 I tested the "finalModel" of the rCV training on all my database then build the ROC curve associated to this "finalModel". In roc.2 I build the "average" ROC curve using all the rCV process results. What I don't get is: what does the "finalModel" represent? Is it a model averaging all the trained models coefficients? Is it correct to use it a predictive model (on both the training dataset and a different set)?
