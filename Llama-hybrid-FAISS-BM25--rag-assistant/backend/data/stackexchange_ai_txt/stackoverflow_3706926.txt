IPhone: Custom Button - Why is title not showing?

So I basically dragged a button from interface builder's library, turned it into a Custom button. Then I added one png for the "default state configuration" and another png for the "highlighted state configuration". Let's just assume these png's are a red box and a blue box. Now, I'd like the Title to display for the button i.e., "Press Me" or something. But the Title doesn't show. Am I missing something?? (I also tried to have that text in different colors but no dice...) Thanks in advance.
