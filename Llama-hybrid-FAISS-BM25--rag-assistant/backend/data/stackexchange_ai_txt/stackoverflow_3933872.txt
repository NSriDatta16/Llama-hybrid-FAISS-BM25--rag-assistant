What object are you using to add your data to the PDF? MultiColumnText, Paragraph, Phrase? You should be able to use Document.PageSize.Height property to return the height of the Page. Then use PDFPTable.Height to return the height of your table. So just use the logic Document.PageSize.Height - table.Height, and you'll have the remaining y-axis space available. The PDFPTable object has properties named SplitLate and SplitRows. I believe you can use these properties to try and keep the table on one page.
