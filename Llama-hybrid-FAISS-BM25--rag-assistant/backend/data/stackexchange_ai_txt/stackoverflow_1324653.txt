What I would always go for (first) is to have a layered application Presentation Layer (JUST UI and databinding logic) Interface Layer to the Business Layer (defining the contracts for accessing the BL) Business Layer implementation (the actual logic, data validation etc...) Interface Layer to the Data Access Layer (defining the contracts for accessing the DAL) Data Access Layer implementation This organizes your application extremely well. Then I'd look for some MVC kind approach. I did not develop so much with WinForms, more with Asp.net and some Java Desktop clients (where I used MVC ). WinForms works more with the .Net databinding approach (DataSource, DataMember,...). You should go for that approach instead of trying to force something other. I found that it doesn't match that well. What's always useful is to lay out our UI logic into different controls (like UserControls in Asp.net). This facilitates reuse.
