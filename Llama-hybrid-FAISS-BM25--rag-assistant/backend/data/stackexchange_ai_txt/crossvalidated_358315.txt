I do not understand the issue: for the model as described, there is a joint posterior distribution \begin{align} p(\mu, \sigma^2 | x,\mu_0, \sigma_0,\alpha, \beta) \propto \overbrace{p(\mu | \mu_0, \sigma_0)}^\text{Normal} \underbrace{p(\sigma^2 | \alpha, \beta)}_\text{inverse Gamma} \overbrace{p (x | \mu, \sigma^2)}^\text{Normal} \end{align} that is non-standard in the sense that the marginal posterior distributions of both $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are not traditional distributions and are not from exponential families. But this distribution on $(\mu, \sigma^2)$ can be computed at any value of $(\mu, \sigma^2,x,\mu_0, \sigma_0,\alpha, \beta)$ and hence can be simulated by all sorts of Monte Carlo approaches, including the or rather a Gibbs sampler . Therefore, the lack of conjugacy does not prevent one from using a Gibbs sampler or another Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. They both produce simulations from the joint posterior $$p(\mu, \sigma^2 | x,\mu_0, \sigma_0,\alpha, \beta)$$ and not solely from the two marginal posteriors $$p(\mu | x,\mu_0, \sigma_0,\alpha, \beta)\quad\text{and}\quad p(\sigma^2 | x,\mu_0, \sigma_0,\alpha, \beta)$$
