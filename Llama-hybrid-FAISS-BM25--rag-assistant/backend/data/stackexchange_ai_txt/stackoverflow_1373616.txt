SQL injection checks? As in, strings you should be scared of? Much better in the long run to use .NET's SqlParameters (which check themselves for injection shenanigans more completely than you could hope to in ad hoc checks) avoid dynamic SQL in your SPs (because even parameterized queries can be jacked by unexpected input if you're concatenating strings and then executing them on the back end)
