ASP.NET - Dealing with dependencies when using the debugger

When we run ASP.NET through the debugger it runs in a special directory like: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0 I dont know if this directory is configureable. The problem is that if you have a file such as Transfer.xsl then you set its property "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy if newer". This copies the file out to the bin. But, we are not running inside the bin. So if I use a relative path StorageFolder\Transfer.xsl It becomes... C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DevServer\10.0\StorageFolder\Transfer.xsl But, Visual Studio does not copy files here even when you set the property described above. In the past I got around this problem by writing a pre-build routine to xcopy the dependencies to this "temp folder". It works, but flippen sucks caseadillas. Is there a better way?
