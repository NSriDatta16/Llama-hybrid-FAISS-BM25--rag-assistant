This is more of an extended comment than an answer. At the end I make a suggestion how to model the data but have low confidence in its usefulness. I have more confidence in the usefulness of the following two graphs. First I plot the outcome, pollinator abundance, against number of pollinator orders. The points are jittered to reduce overplotting. In a comment the OP explains: An order lies between larger groups like classes and smaller groups like species. For example, there are many species of flies which all belong to the order Diptera, bees (wasps, ants) to Hymenoptera, beetles to Coleoptera and butterflies and moths to Lepidoptera. The clarification and the graph make it clear that n_orders is not exactly a predictor: If we know that pollinators from 4 different orders were observed, we know that the abundance is at least 4. (Abundance is number of pollinators.) So abundance and orders are two aspects of pollinator diversity and they are strongly correlated. So I'm not sure n_orders should be included as an explanatory variable. Aside: It would have been better to count the number of pollinators from each order. Then we could have fitted a multinomial logistic regression. I also plot the outcome, pollinator abundance, against the predictor flower species richness, by site. Within each site, four transects are surveyed; these are indicated with a different shape. (There are 24 distinct transects; I use the same 4 shapes in each of 6 sites for readability.) It's obvious from the graph that the relationship between flower richness and pollinator abundance varies a lot from site to site. Therefore I suggest to add an interaction between flower richness and site. I also nest count (data collection survey) within transect, though it makes little difference as each transect was surveyed only twice. Pollinator_abundance ~ Floral_species_richness * Site + (1 | Transect / Count)
