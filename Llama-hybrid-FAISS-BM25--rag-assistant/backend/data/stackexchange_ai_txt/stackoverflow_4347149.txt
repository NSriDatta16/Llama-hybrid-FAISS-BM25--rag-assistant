OpenCart is designed feature rich, easy to use, search engine friendly and with a visually appealing interface. Unlimited Categories Unlimited Products Unlimited Manufacturers Multi Currency Multi Language Product Reviews Product Ratings Open Source Free Documentation Templatable Automatic Image Resize 20+ Payment Gateways 8+ Shipping Methods Demo: Frontend Admin (demo / demo) Download: You can download from the OpenCart Website or Directly (V1.4.9.1) My thoughts: With systems like Magento and osCommerce, there very bulky and poorly coded, OpenCart is a MVC Style framework, so if you have ever used codeigniter you would know half the system already. The system does not take up heavy resources unlike some frameworks, it has a robust admin interface that shows you graphical statistics of your sales and helps you forcast sales, simple and logical payment api systems which allow you to add more payment systems with just drag and dropping of files.
