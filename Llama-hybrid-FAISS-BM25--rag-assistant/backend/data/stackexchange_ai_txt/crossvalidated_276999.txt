Okay! Ill make it very easy. When using the std and variance USUALLY you are looking backwards, trying to see what is going on and then projecting the future. as you look backwards, the more trials usually helps get MORE info. More and more trials help narrow down what happened. and you now rotate better around the mean. Std and var just rotate around the mean so you get closer and closer to what will happen. Binomial is different! we already know whats up, we know the probability. so looking backwards isnt as useful because, well, we already know the probability. More and more trials doesnt help us understand better and better how things rotate around the mean, it just gives us wider and wider distribution. increasing the trials really only gives more room for variance. Imagine two scenarios: one you want to know how tall everyone is in a room. more measurements = closer to what the real average height is in the room, you are thankful for every new measurement. second you have a coin. you already know what the average is. its 50/50 i mean at that point you are done. so lets pretend you start flipping, well every new flip is only more room for error. you flip 10 times and you get all 10 heads, you say to your friend, what the heck! where were the odds of that, thats so dumb! well if you only flipped it once you would have only had one chance for some crazy outliers. more flips dont really give you more info they just give more room for crazy results. 0 math and 0 formulas, hope that helps.
