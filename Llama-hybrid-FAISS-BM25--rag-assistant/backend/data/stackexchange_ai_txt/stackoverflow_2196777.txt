There's a few ways you can do this: Sample data set: 12-50-99 Event A San Diego, CA 12-50-99 Event B Healdsburg, CA Flex 4 XML Declarations Below are 3 ways to get data into XML or an ArrayCollection, both of which you can pass to your data provider. 12-50-99 Event A San Diego, CA 12-50-99 Event B Healdsburg, CA Flex 3 works the same, but you just remove the tags. If you want the data to be dynamic, I would just create a property for your ArrayCollection or XMLListCollection in the block in your view, say [Bindable] public var myData:ArrayCollection; , and load the data into that via XML. By keeping your data external (not hardcoding/embedding data into MXML), you don't have to recompile, and it's easier to add more and more. In order to do that, you'd either need to use URLRequest or HTTPService. HTTPService is basically an MXML wrapper around the URLRequest. Something like this pseudo code: import mx.collections.*; [Bindable] public var list1:IList; [Bindable] public var list2:IList; [Bindable] public var list3:IList; public function loadData():void { eventsService.load(); // loads, may take a few frames/seconds } public function updateData(result:Object, property:String):void { // this["list1"] = xml; this[property] = new XMLListCollection(result); } Let me know if that works.
