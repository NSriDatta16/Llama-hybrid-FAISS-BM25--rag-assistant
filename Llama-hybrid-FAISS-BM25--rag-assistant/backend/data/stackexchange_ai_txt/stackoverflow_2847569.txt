As far as I know, Windows Mobile 6 is Windows CE 5 compatible. I occasionally deploy my CE 4 applications on my Mobile 6 phone without a problem. Usually CE executables and DLL's work on the desktop; sofar I've only seen them fail when using P/Invokes to coredll.dll, which is the CE equivalent for the Desktop's user32.dll. Don't know, my CE 4 device doesn't have enough storage space to copy the installer on it :P
