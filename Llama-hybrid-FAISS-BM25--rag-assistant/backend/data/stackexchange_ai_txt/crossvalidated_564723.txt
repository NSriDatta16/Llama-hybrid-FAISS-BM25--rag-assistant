Model Evaluation: R2 Score is very bad when the range of values is low but Mean absolute error is good

I have a dataset where the values of the dependent variable are small, i.e. range is 1.7 to 2.2. I fitted a model and made predictions on y_test , the predictions are good because the MAE is 0.3. All the predictions are almost close to y_test . When I'm calculating r2_score , the r2 value is -16, as the data points are small and their range is small. The sum of squares of the residual errors is far greater than the total sum of the errors. That is the reason why r2_score is very low. Refer the dataframe below. Did you see the above pics, the SSres is very huge where as SStot is very small. The difference between true values and predictions is on average 0.3, still why R2 score is so low? How to overcome this problem? Should I ignore this?
