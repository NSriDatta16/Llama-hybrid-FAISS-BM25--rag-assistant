I haven't used SRSS before, but I have written barcode generating software. If you are looking for alternatives, writing your own is not too difficult. You can find all of the information regarding barcode encoding online. I used Code 128 , and simply created a table of values in my source code. Rendering the barcode is just a matter of drawing solid black and white bars based on the information in the table, so you don't need to worry about embedding fonts. It looks like you want to use Reporting Services, so maybe this doesn't help. Either way, good luck with it!
