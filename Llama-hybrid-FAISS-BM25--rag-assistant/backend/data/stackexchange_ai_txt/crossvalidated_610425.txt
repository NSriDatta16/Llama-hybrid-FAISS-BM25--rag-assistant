The mathematical concept of a "random variable" does not require a belief in randomness You seem to be reading more into the mathematical concept of a "random variable" than is actually contained in the concept. Mathematically, the concept of a random variable is just a mapping from a sample space in a probability space to the real numbers, complex numbers, or some other set of values for a quantity of interest. This means that every random variable has a probability distribution and every quantity with a probability distribution is a random variable. So in fact these are not very seperate concepts; they are identical. Treated purely as a mathematical concept, this does not necessarily entail any particular metaphysical properties of the quantity, and in particular, it does not imply that the quantity is actually random in an aleatory sense. Perhaps this is a bit naughty and confusing on the part of the mathematics community, and I can see why it would lead to misunderstandings, but it arises largely for historical reasons relating to the evolution of probability theory. The most commonly applied paradigm for Bayesian statistics treats probability as an epistemological concept that describes our own uncertainty in a quantity, but does not take a position on metaphysical issues relating to determinism, indeterminism, and randomness. There is a good treatment of the philosophical and mathematical foundations of Bayesian statistics in Bernardo and Smith (1994) , which discusses the epistemological interpretation of probability in the "subjective Bayesian paradigm". This approach is agnostic on the metaphysical issue of whether or not randomness actually exists in nature --- either way we need a tool to describe our own uncertainty about quantities, and probability does this job.
