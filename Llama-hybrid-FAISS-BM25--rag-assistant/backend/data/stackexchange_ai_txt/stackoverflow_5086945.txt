Integrate live customer support with video/webcam on website

My organization normally provides customer support over e-mail and over the phone, but in particularly tricky situations we find we need to have an approximation of face-to-face communication. We're trying to find or build a software solution that we can integrate into our site. Our requirements are that: customers shouldn't need to download anything extra or open ports (but yes, Flash is okay) the server side components should be self-hosted communication should be private and secure No real requirements other than that. It doesn't even need to be free. Any recommendations for what's the quickest solution out there for this? Currently I'm looking at rolling our own using red5 or deploying openmeetings but this has got to be a common problem so I'm wondering what other people are doing. There's a whole spectrum of ready-made solutions out there and sadly the simplest ones look geared towards dating chatrooms.
