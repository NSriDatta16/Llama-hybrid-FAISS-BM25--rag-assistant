Decomposing time series with 2 trends

I have some web data from 2011 to present, and I would like to look at its seasonality in R. However, in June 2014, a change to the website was made that boosted the numbers by a lot, throwing off my seasonality analysis. Is the best approach to just examine the data up until this change, or is there a way to account for more than one trend in the decomposition?
