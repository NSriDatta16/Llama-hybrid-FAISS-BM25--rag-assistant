How to make LSTM predict multiple time steps ahead?

I am trying to use a LSTM for time series prediction. The data streams in once per minute, but I would like to predict an hour ahead. There are two ways I can think of for going about this: Squash the data into hourly data instead, taking the average over each 60 minute time period as one data point. For each (X, y) training data pair, let X be the time series from t - 120 to t - 60 , and let y be the time series from t - 60 to t . Force the LSTM to predict 60 timesteps ahead, and take y[-1] as the prediction. Are there any best practices for going about this?
