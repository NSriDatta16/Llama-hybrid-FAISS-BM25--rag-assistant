As I said earlier (aaarg.. SO outage), you can't initialize your Cloud Apps from inside a static constructor, as the static constructor will be called on type initialization. Type initialization doesn't happen when the assembly is loaded, but when your type is used for the first time. you should use create a class which derives from the class RoleEntryPoint. it's OnStart method will be called on Role startup. Here is a sample: public class WebRole: RoleEntryPoint { public override bool OnStart() { #region Setup CloudStorageAccount Configuration Setting Publisher // This code sets up a handler to update CloudStorageAccount instances when their corresponding // configuration settings change in the service configuration file. CloudStorageAccount.SetConfigurationSettingPublisher((configName, configSetter) => { // Provide the configSetter with the initial value configSetter(RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue(configName)); RoleEnvironment.Changed += (sender, arg) => { if (arg.Changes.OfType () .Any((change) => (change.ConfigurationSettingName == configName))) { // The corresponding configuration setting has changed, propagate the value if (!configSetter(RoleEnvironment.GetConfigurationSettingValue(configName))) { // In this case, the change to the storage account credentials in the // service configuration is significant enough that the role needs to be // recycled in order to use the latest settings. (for example, the // endpoint has changed) RoleEnvironment.RequestRecycle(); } } }; }); #endregion return base.OnStart(); } }
