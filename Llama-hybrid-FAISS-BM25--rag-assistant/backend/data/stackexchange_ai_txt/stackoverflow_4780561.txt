Mac OSX App Installation?

I'm testing an application I created in Xcode, archived and then 'shared' on the organizer - in order to test the installation process before submitting to the App Store. After I clicked the .pkg and installed it, it said it was successful, but the application doesn't show up in my Applications folder. Does anyone know what could be causing this? Do I need to attach a certificate with it before it will show up there? Zach
