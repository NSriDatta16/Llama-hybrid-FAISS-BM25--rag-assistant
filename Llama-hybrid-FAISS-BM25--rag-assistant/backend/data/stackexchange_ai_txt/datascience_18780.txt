What can i do after a PCA with the results?

After performing a PCA and studying the proceeding i ask myself what the result is good for in the next step. From the PCA i learned how to visualize the dataset by lowering the dimension, i got handy new vectors to describe the members of the population in a more efficient way and i learned which original predictors correlate and contribute more than others. I ask myself questions like, is there more to learn from PCA, is it a good idea to use the PCA model for a learning algorithms to perform better and is it possible to respect nomial or ordinal predictors in the PCA somehow?
