Today there are mainly two types of version control systems (VCS), the so called distributed VCS and the central repository systems. The most popular "distributed" VCS today are git and mercurial. The most popular central repository systems are subversion and SourceSafe of Microsoft. The http://hginit.com introduction explain the superiority of "distributed" VCS over the central system. With a distributed VCS every developer has its own local repository. It is generally used with a shared central repository holding the official release. But this is just a repository organization. "distributed" VCS are superior to purely centralized VCS in their ability to manage merging.
