A std::tr1::shared_ptr for Objective C++ on iPhone?

I am mostly a C++ developer, recently I am writing iPhone applications. The memory management on iPhone is OK to me, due to resource limitation, it's encouraged to use reference counters rather than deep copy. One annoying thing is I have to manage the reference counters by myself: alloc means counter = 1; retain means counter++, release means counter-- I wish to write a shared_ptr like class for Cocoa Touch, so I rarely have to manually manipulate the reference counters by myself. I doubt if there's any existing code for that, and I'd like to hear some advices, today is the 5th day since I started to learn objective c Thanks.
