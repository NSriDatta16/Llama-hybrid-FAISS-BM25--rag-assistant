What you have is called panel data : multiple time series which are "connected" in some way. Panel data are commonly analyzed in economics (where the connected time series would be GDP, unemployment rates etc.). I don't have a reference handy, but the Wikipedia page may be helpful. Dig into this. ANOVA is not helpful for time series or panel data. Alternatively, you can start by reading up on time series analysis and forecasting (e.g., with this free online textbook ), ignoring any connections between your series, at least at the beginning. On the other hand, while your data is discrete in the sense that there cannot be 2.3 or 5.7 page views, you are probably dealing with sufficiently high volumes that you can safely use standard methods which assume a (non-discrete) normal distribution on errors.
