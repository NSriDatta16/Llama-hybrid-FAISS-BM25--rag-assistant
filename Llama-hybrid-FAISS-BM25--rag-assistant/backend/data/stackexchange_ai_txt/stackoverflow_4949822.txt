Rails Routing w/ Passenger - How to get passenger to pay attention to root route?

I have a root route setup in my app, which works fine on a local webrick server. (localhost:3000/ brings up the home page). On my nginx/passenger server, though, it's looking for inside the public folder, and not paying attention to the route I have setup to redirect the root - so instead I'm getting a not-found error. Any help is greatly appreciated.
