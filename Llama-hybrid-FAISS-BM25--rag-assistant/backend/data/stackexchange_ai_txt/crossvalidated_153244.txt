Uncertainty of sum of values estimated through linear regression

I have a continuous record of a variable X, which I want to use as a surrogate for another system value Y. I have a number of measurements of Y, which I can plot against concurrent measurements of X to get a regression between the surrogate and my actual value of interest, Y. I then use that regression to create an estimated continuous record of Y. Y represents a load being transported past a point, and what I'm generally interested in is the total load transported over some time interval, so the sum of some number of Y values. My question: How do I define the uncertainty of my total load estimate, assuming that uncertainty primarily arises from the uncertainty in my regression? EDIT: Per the question, yes - X is a time series, with a sampling frequency much greater than the rate of change, so autocorrelated galore. Samples of Y occur infrequently and are spread out enough that autocorrelation isn't an issue in the regression itself.
