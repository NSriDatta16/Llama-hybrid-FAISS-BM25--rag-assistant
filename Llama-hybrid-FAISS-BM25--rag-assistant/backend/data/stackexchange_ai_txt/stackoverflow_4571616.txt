Where is the correct location for an AJAX call in Backbone.js?

I'm learning Backbone.js for a new app I'm building. I need to perform an AJAX call to get more properties for my model object (image, title & description of a book). Where is the correct place for this call? In the Model, View or somewhere else? specifically related to Backbone.js MVC model. Additional Info I'm using LocalStorage and not a server. The AJAX call will be to a web service API and constitutes only part of my actual model data.
