I've had similar problem and decided it by this way: downloaded new version of datatables-1.7 from this site ( http://datatables.net ); if this wil not help - try to look through your data in table of your database which you trying to use with datatables. Use any utulity for manipulating with databases. Pay attention to records if there are any wrong symbols in the ends of data in some cells like symbols of paragraph etc. If any - try to remove them from data. Then it must work. Good luck.
