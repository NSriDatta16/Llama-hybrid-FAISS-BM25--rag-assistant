How can I execute only tests and ignore testsuites in eclipse?

I have a project that uses testsuites to call the tests within a project. Running the tests with maven, it will correctly runs only the tests. Running the tests with eclipse, it runs both the tests and the testsuites! I could write a testsuite() to call all the testsuites in all the packages but is there a way to only execute the tests in the project and not the testsuites? Partly this is to enable the clover plugin in eclipse to report the code coverage for the project
