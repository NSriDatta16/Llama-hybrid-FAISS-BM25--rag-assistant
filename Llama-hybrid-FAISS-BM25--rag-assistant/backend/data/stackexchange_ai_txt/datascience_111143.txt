Time Series Clustering on sales data -- any ideas?

I have a retail store dataset, and I am interested to do some time series clustering on this data, what idea you find interesting for this purpose? I have so far: What sales trends there are across time? What products customers will purchase at what time? Customer segmentation across time? Any better ideas?
