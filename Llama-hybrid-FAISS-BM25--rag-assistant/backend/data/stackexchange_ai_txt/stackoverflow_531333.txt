Multiple target controls for ASP.net AJAX animation?

I'm trying to apply the same animation to multiple TargetControlID's -- for example, in a modal dialog, I would like to have a cancel button and a little "x" graphic in the upper right, either of which closes the dialog. Seems pretty inelegant to write two identical animations, one for each of these targets. I'd like to have one and apply it to two controls. Know what I mean? Any ideas?
