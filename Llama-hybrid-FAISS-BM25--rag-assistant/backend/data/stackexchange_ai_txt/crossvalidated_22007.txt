Charlie's suggestion to use other information to help determine what deterministic components are included is good. I would add that theoretical considerations might suggest appropriate deterministic regressors. Others have also suggested procedures for testing for a unit root that incorporate testing for the presence of deterministic regressors too. Enders "Applied Econometric Time Series" 2ed p213 has one such approach. I suspect there are others. Enders starts with a general formulation, tests for a unit root, if a unit root then tests for significance of the time trend, if time trend is not significant then tests for a unit root in a formulation without time trend and so on. In any such procedure some caution is needed: 1 Critical values used depend on whether the test can assume a normal distribution or not. 2 Final results are effectively a result of a sequence of pretests, and each result is conditioned on the previous tests being correct. So true significance levels are difficult (impossible?) to work out. 3 Serial correlation should be addressed at each testing stage. Otherwise the test results generated at each stage may be misleading and ultimately give a misleading final result.
