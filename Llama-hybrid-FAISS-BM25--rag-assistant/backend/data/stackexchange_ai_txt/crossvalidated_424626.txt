Correlation of non-stationary time series is a good place to start . Simple pearson-like cross-correlations can be easily computed BUT not easily interpreted when you have auto-correlated data. Google has shut down for a number of reasons ...including generating spurious false conclusions about cause and effect. Consider Transfer Function model identification strategies when you have TIME-ORDERED DATA https://autobox.com/pdfs/regvsbox-old.pdf essentially filtering/adjusting for the autocorrelation with the series. Also see Predict one variable based on another similar for an example of how two trending series were analyzed to extract the relationship between them. In this case the ordinary correlation coefficient would understate the relationship as a major intervention occurred due to an exogenous latent factor (level shift) .
