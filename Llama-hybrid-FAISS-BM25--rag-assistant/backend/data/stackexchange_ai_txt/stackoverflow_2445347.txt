If you want a consistent experience without wondering how the user's browser will choose to handle the file (i.e. display it inline, launch Acrobat, or try to save it, etc)... Google has made its own web-based PDF viewer available for free for embedding . You might use the iframe version in your website. ( This is a sample I created using their web viewer. They make available zoom, thumbnail and page controls - enough to get around the documents easily) You will have to make an ASP.NET page that delivers the PDF binary stream, then give Google's viewer the URL of that page. To stream a PDF through an ASPX page you'll want to Google and search for articles like these : http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307603 http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;326502 etc. Basically it's about HTTP and manipulating the MIME type, page headers, etc and writing binary data to the Response stream using available ASP.NET mechanisms. It might be worthwhile to post a separate question specifically about streaming PDF data through an ASPX page because the current question can be construed as a two-part question or being more oriented toward PDF viewers.
