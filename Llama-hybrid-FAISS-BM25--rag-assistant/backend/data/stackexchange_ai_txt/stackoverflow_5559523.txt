How can I only display a certain div if a record exists?

I have venue records where each has reviews, each review can be rated 1 to 5 and I'm displaying the average review rating using: I'd like to represent the rating as star images instead of a number. I have this setup in my view to hold the stars: px;"> with this css: .star_rating_container { width: 100px; height: 20px; background-image: url(/images/dim_star.png); } .star_rating { height: 20px; background-image: url(/images/lit_star.png); } The problem however is that I get a "You have a nil object when you didn't expect it! You might have expected an instance of Array. The error occurred while evaluating nil.*" error when I try to view a venue which has no reviews. I'm super new to programming and am struggling with how to fix this. Thanks for any help its much appreciated!
