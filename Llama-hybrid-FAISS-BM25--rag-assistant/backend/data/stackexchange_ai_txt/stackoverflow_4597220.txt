How to invoke RESTful WCF service method with multiple parameters?

I have a RESTful WCF service with a method declared like this: [OperationContract(Name = "IncrementAge")] [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "/", Method = "POST", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)] Person IncrementAge(Person p); Here's the implementation: public Person IncrementAge(Person p) { p.age++; return p; } So it takes the Person complex type, increments the age property by one, and spits it back, using JSON serialization. I can test the thing by sending a POST message to the service like this: POST http://localhost:3602/RestService.svc/ HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:3602 User-Agent: Fiddler Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 51 {"age":25,"firstName":"Hejhaj","surName":"Csuhaj"} This works. What if I'd like to have a method like this? Person IncrementAge(Person p, int amount); So it'd have multiple parameters. How should I construct the POST message for this to work? Is this possible? Thanks
