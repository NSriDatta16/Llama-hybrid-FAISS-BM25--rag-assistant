How to calculate difference between two sets in C?

I have two arrays, say A and B with |A|=8 and |B|=4. I want to calculate the set difference A-B. How do I proceed? Please note that there are no repeated elements in either of the sets. Edit: Thank you so much everybody for a myriad of elegant solutions. Since I am in prototyping stage of my project, for now I implemented the simplest solution told by Brian and Owen. But I do appreciate the clever use of data structures as suggested here by the rest of you, even Though I am not a computer scientist but an engineer and never studied data structures as a course. Looks like it's about time I should really start reading CLRS which I have been procrastinating for quite a while :) Thanks again!
