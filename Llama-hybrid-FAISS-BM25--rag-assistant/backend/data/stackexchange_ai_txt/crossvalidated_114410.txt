Manual calculation of ordinal logistic regression probabilities - starting at different comparison

I am having a little issue with manually calculating some predicted probabilities from a ordinal logistic regression (I am doing this as a learning exercise - I am aware I don't have to do this manually). Take the following example from the UCLA statistics training website: Import the data: library(foreign) library(MASS) dat Run an ordinal logistic regression: m Get the predicted probabilities: newdat Now, manually reproduce these values: # store the intercept values intcpts So this all works fine. However, in the process of figuring this out, I found another page on the UCLA site ( http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/spss/dae/ologit.htm ) which seemed to suggest that one should calculate the values the other way around (very likely, then somewhat, then unlikely - reference category last). As in: $ P(Y = 2) = \left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(a_{2}+b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2} + b_{3}x_{3})}}\right) $ $ P(Y = 1) = \left(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(a_{1}+b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2} + b_{3}x_{3})}}\right) - P(Y = 2) $ $P(Y = 0) = 1 - P(Y = 1) - P(Y = 2) $ Now I realise this should give the exact same results as the probabilities always add to 1, but I can't seem to get their logic to work in terms of actual R code or manual calculations. I am stuck always starting with unlikely and then moving on up to very likely. Am I missing something in the logic here? Can anyone suggest a simple calculation method?
