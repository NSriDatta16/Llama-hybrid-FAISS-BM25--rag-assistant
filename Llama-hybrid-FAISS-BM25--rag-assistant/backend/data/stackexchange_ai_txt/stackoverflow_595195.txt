I don't know if Settings->File Templates is what you have in mind, but I'll point it out just in case. You can easily create a class and add a main method by typing "psvm " and filling in the method body. You run it by right clicking on the class and selecting "Run". It's automatically be added to your Run/Config list, you just have to save it to make it permanent. But my gut feeling is that IntelliJ has no such a feature for reading somebody's mind about a "default main class", nor should it.
