Can I configure gitosis to ask for passwords and check against an Active Directory

I have successfully installed and configured gitosis on an Ubuntu server. We're currently just a few developers creating a development platform for a large organization (more than 2000 employees.) Currently they use subversion for version control. The departments can modify their users permissions by editing and commit a single file, much like gitosis.conf. However the difference is they don't need to push public keys for their users, but use the user's domain login, since subversion is configured to check users against our AD. Is there's a way gitosis can behave similarly: They edit gitosis.conf, but they don't need to add the public keys. How do I configure git/gitosis to ask for users password and check them agains the AD.
