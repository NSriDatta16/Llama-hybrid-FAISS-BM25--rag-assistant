Books / tutorials on how to do object oriented analysis and design of algorithms?

There is readily available a lot on info on how to do analysis and design of standard CRUD applications, or at least, applications more geared to the traditional windows application - having a couple of windows, where you click on buttons and then things happen. In the backyard there is some sort of repository where you persist your info, and that is it. What I am looking for is something more geared toward algorithms. For example, how to do the (object oriented) analysis and design of a neural network? Of a genetic algorithm framework? Of a physics simulation experiment? Are there any books/referneces on the matter? Thanks
