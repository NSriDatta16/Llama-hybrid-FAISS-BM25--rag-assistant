What is a good way of implementing per-page JavaScript in Rails?

Trying new things in Ruby - on each page I'm doing very rich stuff with jquery. Obviously if I put all the jquery into application.js it's going to grow very large very quickly. Is it a good approach to lazy-load a page-specific js file at the end? eg: $(document).ready(function() { $.getScript("/javascripts/this_pages_scripts.js"); }); Is there a rails-way way of doing this? I am aware of the new.js.erb etc. files and ujs, but I am still talking about more page-specific js - you know, drag and drop initialisers, dialog creators, etc. Thank you very much.
