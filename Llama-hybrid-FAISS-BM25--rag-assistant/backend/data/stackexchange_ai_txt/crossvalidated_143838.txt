Subset data in R

I have several time series and want to regress the dependent variable on the explanatory variables. My question is: Because of structural breaks in my series I do not want to include all the observations in my regression. How can I select the a range of observations for my regression using R? 5 6 8 20 25 28 For example: Suppose this is my data set. Now for my first regression I just want to use the obeservations 1 to 3 and for the second regression I want to use the observations 4 to 6. How can this be done without opening my dataset in excel and then rearrange my data?
