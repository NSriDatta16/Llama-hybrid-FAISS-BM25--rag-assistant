Are Linear Regression associations correct with a binary dependent variable?

Probably the simplest model when dealing with a binary classification problem is logistic regression . This relies on fitting a linear regression model to the data and then applying a sigmoid function to the results. So up to my understanding linear regression, here is used to associate a (let's say continuous) independent variable to a continuous dependent one. My question is: "Can we use the result of a linear regression for associating the two variables?" and if so "Can this association be compared to another, where the dependent variable is continuous?" By reluctance to the above questions is that when modelling a binary classification problem, we arbitrarily assign numbers to the two outcomes (e.g. "Yes" -> 1, "No" -> 0). But linear regression is not independent of the magnitude of these numbers (i.e. it would produce different results if "Yes" was mapped to 10 and "No" to 1). Is it considered correct , in practice, to base such associations on linear regression? Can they be compared to associations from linear regression models, where the dependent variable is continuous?
