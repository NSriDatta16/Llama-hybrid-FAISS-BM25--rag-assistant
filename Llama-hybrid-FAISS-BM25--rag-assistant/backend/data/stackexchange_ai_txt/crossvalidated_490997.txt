I haven't read the paper in detail (though their equation (2), where they claim that the MAE against the mean is the standard deviation, casts some doubt on the statistical expertise involved). If you divide the MAE by the mean of the time series, you can interpret the result as a weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (wMAPE; see Kolassa & Sch√ºtz, 2007 ). This may be what the authors calculated.
