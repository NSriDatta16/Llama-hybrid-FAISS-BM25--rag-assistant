Propery Setting Up Neural Network for Location to Location Analysis

I am attempting to train a neural network for a system that can be thought of as a macro-level postal network. My inputs are two locations (one of the 50 US states) along with 1 to 3 other variables, and I want a numeric result out. My first inclination was to represent the states as a numeric value from 0-49 and then then have a network with only 3 or so inputs. What I've found, however, is that my training never converges on a useful value. I am assuming that this is because the values for the states are wholly arbitrary - a value of 39 for MA has no relation to a value of 38 for CA, especially when 37 represents a jump back to CT. Is there a better way for me to do this? Should I be creating a network with over 100 inputs, representing boolean values for origin and destination states?
