The origin of the term "regularization"

When I introduce concepts to my students, I often find it fun to tell them where the terminology originates ("regression", for example, is a term with an interesting origin). I haven't been able to turn up the history/background of the term "regularization" in statistical/machine learning. So, what is the origin of the term regularization ?
