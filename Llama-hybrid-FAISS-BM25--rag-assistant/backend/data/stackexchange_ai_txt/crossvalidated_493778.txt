How to calculate the average and max of a beta distribution?

I have a beta distribution where the values of alpha and beta are given. And the value of x varies from 0 to 1. I need to calculate the average and mode of this distribution. How can I calculate the average? (I could not get a formula for with a simple google search. ) How should I calculate the mode?
