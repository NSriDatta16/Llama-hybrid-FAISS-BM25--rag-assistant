i found solution to my problem. I thought i tried that, but it seems i made some little mistake back then. Anyway, with the following code FacesContext facesContext = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance(); ExternalContext externalContext = facesContext.getExternalContext(); String basePath = externalContext.getRealPath("/"); FopFactory fopFactory = FopFactory.newInstance(); fopFactory.setBaseURL(basePath); FOUserAgent foUserAgent = fopFactory.newFOUserAgent(); foUserAgent.setBaseURL(fopFactory.getBaseURL()); Fop fop = fopFactory.newFop(MimeConstants.MIME_PDF, foUserAgent, output); // for some output you can access your images (and other resources) from your xslt file using relative path starting from your application's WebContent folder. In my case, i can access logo.jpg like this Took me time to figure out this, i don't get it why no examples with such basic thing on the net (or i can't find them :) Note: In FOP 2.0 there is no setBaseURL() method. Instead you pass the base URL as a parameter to FopFactory.newInstance() . Many of the other setters have been moved to FopFactoryBuilder .
