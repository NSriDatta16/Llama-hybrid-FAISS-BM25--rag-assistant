For GARCH model Bayesian estimation is better than ML estimation

In the work of [Ardia] - Financial Risk Management with Bayesian Estimation of GARCH Models_ Theory and Applications in which the Bayesian estimation method with uninformative prior distributions is compared the frequentist estimation method, it results that the first approach gives better results as regards the family GARCH models, in terms of forecasts, one step from the left tail of the distribution of returns. This happens because the posterior distributions of the parameters of the GARCH model $$\sigma_t^2=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 y_{t-1}^2+\beta \sigma_{t-1}^2$$ are asymmetric, and this implies that the Gaussianity assumptions, necessary for the ML estimate, are too weak, as you can see from the following figure which concerns a Markov-Switching jgrGARCH model with 2 regimes If they were true, with an uninformative prior distribution, the ML estimate and the Bayesian estimate should give the same result, exactly?
