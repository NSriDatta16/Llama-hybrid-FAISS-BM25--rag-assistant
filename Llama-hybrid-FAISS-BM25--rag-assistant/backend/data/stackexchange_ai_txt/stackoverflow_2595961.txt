Of course a method can return NSRange. But returning structures require special attention to the compiler because how the method is invoked is usually different ( objc_msgSend_stret vs. objc_msgSend ). Please make sure you declare phrase as Phrase* phrase = ...; so that the compiler knows -rangeInString:… is returning an NSRange, instead of id phrase = ...; (Also, since you don't show which line the compiler errors, make sure the function using return … == -1; is returning a BOOL not NSRange.)
