The estimated distribution from a bootstrap method does not always give sufficient information to compute a p-value, and neither a confidence interval. One problem is that p-values (and confidence intervals) relate to hypothetical values of the distribution parameters. The shape of the distribution given those hypothetical values, can be different from what is observed in the sample. When estimating a distribution based on a bootstrap distribution, then often an assumption is made about the transformation between the bootstrap distribution and the distribution to be estimated. For example: a shift or scaling of the bootstrap distribution when the means of the bootstrap distribution and the mean of distribution to be estimated is different. A simple case of a discrepancy is the use of a bootstrap distribution to determine confidence intervals for the maximum $\theta$ of a uniform distribution $x \sim U(0,\theta)$ . The observed sample will almost never contain the value $\theta$ and that value will be almost always outside the distribution estimated with the bootstrapping. Another problem is that a bootstrap distribution is an estimate of the true distribution and may have some bias. For example the standard deviation of a bootstrap sample will be on average smaller than the true deviation, and requires a correction. This is similar to the use of a Bessel correction. If you apply appropriate corrections and transformations then you can compute p-values based on the bootstrap distribution.
