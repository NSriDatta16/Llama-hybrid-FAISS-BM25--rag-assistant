Sending Email from centralized server with multiple web servers

I am building a ASP.NET MVC3 application that will be running on a couple web servers. Instead of each server/app sending its own emails(Asnyc) per request, I would like to leverage something like MSMQ and send messages to an email server that would pick up the messages and send an email. I have an idea of how to do this with a console app, windows service and MSMQ but was looking for some direction from anyone who has had success/experience implementing something similar. Any guidance, experience, technology, blog posts would be appreciated.
