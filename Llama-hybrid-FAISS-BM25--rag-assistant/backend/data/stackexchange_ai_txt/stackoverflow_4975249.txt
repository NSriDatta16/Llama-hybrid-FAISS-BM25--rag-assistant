In case anyone else comes across this question, in the forum post linked in Robert Christie's answer a user pointed out that simply using gtk.StatusIcon() is a more portable solution if you're just looking for tray icon functionality (as opposed to say a clock, or main menu applet). Additionally, if you think you need bonobo you should probably be using D-Bus anyways.
