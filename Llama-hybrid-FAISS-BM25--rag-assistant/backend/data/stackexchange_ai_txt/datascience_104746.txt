Is there an official procedure to compute mIoU?

Although it sounds silly, I'm not finding an official source to compute mIoU. I'm realizing a semantic segmentation task, and I want to compute the mIoU over a dataset. My doubt is, should I compute the mIoU of each image and average the results in the end, or should I build a giant confusion matrix of all image results and compute the mIoU from there?
