Proper workflow for model selection and hyperparameter tuning using cross validation

I have been trying to teach myself about machine learning and wanted to make sure I had the right idea about model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross validation. So given a data set, my understanding is that this is the general workflow should be. 1. Split into train and test 2. Use cross validation on training set to select model 3. After picking a model then perform hyperparameter tuning with cross validation Is that correct? Also, for step 3, should tuning be done with the whole data set or just the test set?
