Wald test failing to reject null hypothesis that a predictor is insignificant in regression when t-test on terms involving predictor show significance

I am running a logistic regression using a set of several predictors as well as several interaction terms. For each predictor, I am running a Wald test in statsmodels to test whether or not a predictor is significant in my model. I am doing this by testing the joint hypothesis that all terms involving the predictor (individually and in interaction terms) are zero. In some instances, I am unable to reject this null hypothesis, yet at the same time I can find instances of the predictor's interaction terms individually appearing significant in the result returned from statsmodels' summary method. So a contrived example would be, I check whether or not all coefficients for terms involving x1 are zero using a Wald test and find that I cannot reject the hypothesis that they are zero, but then looking at the interaction terms individually, I find the interaction term x1x2 has a p-value
