Open a new mail message ( ipm.note is the message class for emails) outlook.exe /c ipm.note Open a new mail message and populate sender: outlook.exe /c ipm.note /m someone@microsoft.com Open a new mail message with attachment: outlook.exe /c ipm.note /a filename Combination: (First one below didn't work in Office 2016, second did) outlook.exe /c ipm.note /m someone@microsoft.com&subject=test%20subject&body=test%20body outlook.exe /c ipm.note /m "someone@microsoft.com&subject=test%20subject&body=test%20body" The %20 has to be used to produce a blank space. More details at Command Line for Creating a Pre-Addressed E-mail Message Command-line switches can be found here This works for instance with a classic Outlook 2016 (build 16.0.4849.1000). But, as Snozzlebert notes in the comments , for a Outlook 365 Version 2001 (Build 12430.20184) the syntax would be: outlook.exe /c ipm.note /m "someone@microsoft.com?subject=test" the culprit was the & after the email-address - replacing it with ? solved the problem. It seems that Microsoft changed the syntax to the HTML mailto syntax.
