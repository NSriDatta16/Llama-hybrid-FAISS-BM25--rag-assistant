One way or the other, the view has to know about the controller. In my experience, events generated by GUI (such as button clicks, drag-and-drops etc.) are best handled in the view itself, since they're particular to the type of view you're using (would differ significantly if your UI was voice-based, for example). Controller should expose APIs like importFile(String filePath) with your 1) approach, you'd have to modify the controller whenever you add a new view / change things around in the view. 2) approach is better.
