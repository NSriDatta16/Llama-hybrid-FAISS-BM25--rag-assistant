How to hide an active category in Magento without disabling the URL?

Hey, we're running Magento 1.4.0.1 and would like to hide active categories from the navigation. When we do this, the parent category's URL 404s but all the children categories' URLs are still valid. i.e. magentostore.ex/brands/company is valid magentostore.ex/brands is not We would like magentostore.ex/brands to point to a page, but we don't want a tab saying "Brands" in our top-level navigation. How can we hide the parent from navigation while keeping it active? Thanks!
