Personally, I would use YouTube as an on-site music player. This way you can add video to your songs (or even just one or more static pictures) and post them to YouTube, letting them handle the hosting and the player. Embedding the videos on your site is a piece of cake, and they won't use up your bandwidth at all. YouTube's terms of service appear to permit this; see http://www.youtube.com/t/terms . Selling the songs could be handled with a simple PayPal link. Whenever you receive a payment email (which can include the name/artist of the song purchased), you can email back a link to the download. This link can be to a permanent download (which is the "to hell with it" approach to piracy), or it can be a link to a temporary copy of the MP3 that you place on your site (which you can remove after a day or two or whenever).
