google analytics tracking in iframe feeding to different partners

our partners sites leverages our iframes in their own websites. I was wondering if there is a way to track the analytics on the iframes. The problem is, if we also utilize these iframes on our own website, how do i avoid duplicate tracking where a visit is counted on our domain's analytics and also counted again in iframes? is there a way to get around it?
