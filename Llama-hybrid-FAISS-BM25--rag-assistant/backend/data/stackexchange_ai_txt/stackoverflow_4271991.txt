Overly complicated conditional operation question

So here's a fun code snippet I was working on and for the life of me can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. ( chomp($CMD=`whereis blah | awk '{print \$2}'`) || chomp($CMD=`whereis cat | awk '{print \$2}'`) ) ? (print "$CMD\n") : (print "Neither command exists."); print "$CMD\n"; When executed, this always prints the empty string. As far as I can tell, the second assignment to $CMD never gets executed. I've included "blah" and "cat" purely for demonstration purposes. Ideally I'll be checking for two commands that may or may not be installed on a given system. This is why I have the two assignments nested inside the conditional. If neither of these is found (therefore two empty strings) I'd like it to execute the false clause. But if one or the other of the commands does exist, I want it assigned to $CMD and the true clause to execute (just printing $CMD in the above example). I've played with various combinations but can't seem to make this work. I know this can be broken down and executed over several simpler statements to achieve the same result, but curiosity/stubbornness has gotten the better of me and I want to know why the above isn't working. Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.
