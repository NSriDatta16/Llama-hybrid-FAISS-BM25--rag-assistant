Seasonally adjust the data such that a normal day looks closer to flat. You could take today's 5:00pm sample and subtract or divide out the average of the previous 30 days at 5:00pm. Then look past N standard deviations (measured using pre-adjusted data) for outliers. This could be done separately for weekly and daily "seasons."
