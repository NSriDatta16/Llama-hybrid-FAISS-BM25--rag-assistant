How to deal with large spikes in time series feature values

Assume I want to convert time series features into stationary features by taking the percentage difference from the previous time step to the current. This can result in massive spikes where the feature went from 0 to say, 10,000 and then back again. How can I best deal with these types of features so that they would be handled well by a regression or neural network? I know the obvious thing is to try RNNs but I want to exhaust the vanilla neural network route before I go down that route.
