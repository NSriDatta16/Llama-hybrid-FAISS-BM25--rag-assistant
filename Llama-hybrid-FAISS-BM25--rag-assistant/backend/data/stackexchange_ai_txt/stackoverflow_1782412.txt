The array a is placed on the stack, the address for the first element is the same as the address of a. &a[0] and &a is the same address The array b is allocated with malloc, the address for the storage is on the heap, whereas the address for the pointer b is on the stack. &b[0] is not the same address as &b . That's why the first scanf and printf works but not the second. The C-FAQ explains it in much greater detail.
