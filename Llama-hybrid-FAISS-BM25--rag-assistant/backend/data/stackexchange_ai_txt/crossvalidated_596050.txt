BIC values in LCA models

I have been reading posts on this forum about how to assess LCA models. One question asked about BIC statistics to assess model fit. The answer said that you shouldn't really worry about the absolute value of any single BIC statistic; the BIC only matters relative to other models. Some seem to argue that you can get different BICs depending on the software program, so the absolute value of the BIC is irrelevant. But in my case, I am worried about the absolute value of the BIC because it is gigantic! In the worst set of models the BIC is in the 7 million range. But after adding weights and covariates, the lowest BIC I have been able to get is around 2 million. The LCA results make a lot of sense and are quite interesting actually, am I able to pick a model based on the relatively lower BIC values compared to models with more/fewer classes. The reason why I am worried is because I have seen different conventions for how to publish this part of the LCA results. Some folks do publish the BICs in tables that evaluate class solutions, other articles using LCA do not. What advice would you offer? Should I exclude any tables including the BICs? What other ways can I improve the model fit?
