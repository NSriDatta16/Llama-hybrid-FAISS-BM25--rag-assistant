Large/complex dataset for ORM validation?

I'm looking for freely available sample data to do some ORM validation and performance testing on. My main requirements are: Discriminated types: it needs to include some kind of inheritance eg Party -> Person and Organisation; Reasonably complex data model; Some reasonably large tables (in the hundreds of thousands of rows at least); Multi-platform: at a minimum Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server; Readily understandable. For example a CRM application is what I call readily understandable. People understand clients, customers and so forth. Can anyone point me to anything like that?
