The answer depends on what do you mean under the "current logged in user". Logged in where and why? In general TeamCity does not require to be logged on it in order to start a build. You can configure TeamCity to start a build on every commit to the specified VCS root, for example. In this case you can pass only name of the user, whose account is used for accessing the VCS root ( %vcsroot.user% ). Another case, if you need a name of the windows user, under which account TeamCity build agent is running? If so, you can`t get it using TeamCity. You need to retrieve it inside of your build script.
