Flex project architecture?

What's the best way to organize functionality modules in a flex project? I saw some people put all modules in one view stack ,and so the application interface is only load once, but when the application get larger, the whole compiled swf would be very big. If we put swfs in different pages, we pass request parameters through HTTP request, we lost the benefits from flex RPC services, slow loading, and we can't see any superior comparing to php,asp,jsp... what's the best practice to organize front end architecture?
