Prior distributions can come from anywhere as long as the information content impinges on the problem at hand. For example, if you have developed a new variety of green beans, it is highly reasonable to take information on caloric content from existing green bean varietals. If you were interested in forming a prior on corporate bankruptcy rates, the spread between B+++ and D could act as rough bounding information as the default rate must be less than that spread. Last year's overall batting average for the major leagues could be used as a prior for the batting average of a new rookie, although absent any other information, it should likely be the case that the average should be shifted downward since rookies tend to have lower averages than seasoned players. There are no assumptions that would be violated by that. The best weight would be to ask an experienced actuary.
