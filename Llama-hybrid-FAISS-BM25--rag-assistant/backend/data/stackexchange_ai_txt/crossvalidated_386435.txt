Algorithms for combining Bayesian networks?

Are there any algorithms for combining multiple Bayesian networks? For example, let's say I have 5 variables A, B, C, D and E, and I build 5 Bayesian networks on different random subsets of these, let's say: A, B, C C, D A, E, D B, E, A A, D Is it possible to recover a single BN that is an aggregate of these 5 individual BNs in the general case?
