Judging by the reading source for MapCaptchaStore, this class is NOT thread-safe. I'm not 100% willing to stand behind this answer though, because synchronisation may be happening at a higher level (eg all accesses to a single instance of MapCaptchaStore may be synchronised on another object). You could use another implementation of CaptchaStore. For example, EhcacheCaptchaStore
