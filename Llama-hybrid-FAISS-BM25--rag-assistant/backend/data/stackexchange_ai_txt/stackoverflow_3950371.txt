Extract region and replace them back for a template

I have a template where I want to replace certain regions. In my example below, I want to extract the regions between the ... comments, manipulate it, then replace them back after the manipulation. I do not need the logic to merge the fields, but I need to extract the regions so I can use my logic and place it back into the template. Does anyone know of an elegant or simple way to extract these regions? I am also hoping to extract the url values in the process as well if it is easy to do along the way. [element='h1'] [element='price'] [element='was_price'] Details [element='h1'] [element='price'] [element='was_price'] Details [element='h1'] [element='price'] [element='was_price'] Details [element='h1'] [element='price'] [element='was_price'] Details
