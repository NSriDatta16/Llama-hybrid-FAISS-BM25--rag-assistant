Applying the min-max scaler to new data might result in points that are above $1$ or below $0$ . This is true. Use those values. It is not a theorem of regression that you must use scaled features. This is to help with optimizing the parameters of a neural network (so a computational issue, not a statistical or mathematical one). Once you have trained your model, having feature values constrained is less important. You certainly want to apply the same transformation to your new feature values, but feature values below zero or exceeding one should flow down your network just fine. It might be that this means you are extrapolating to a time when your model does not apply, yes. That is part of the challenge in predicting the future.
