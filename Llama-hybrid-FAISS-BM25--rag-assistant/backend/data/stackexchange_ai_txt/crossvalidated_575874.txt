First, use the untreated group as the reference. With all in that group having events, it will provide the most stable reference against which to compare the other groups. That would seem to make the most sense in your study anyway, as you presumably want to know how each drug combination improves survival versus no treatment. Second, for this type of pilot study there is probably no real harm in then just ignoring the coefficient for the group with no events. You can't estimate a coefficient without events in the group; you can just say that in your report. Third, maybe better, you can used a penalized approach like that in the coxphf package . That's used for the related problem of perfect separation in logistic regression . It imposes a penalty on coefficients that should prevent this type of problem, although it will introduce some bias in the coefficient estimates. Finally, with only 25 events your model is in severe danger of overfitting. You typically need on the order of 15 events per predictor that you are considering in your model. With 6 groups that would mean about 90 events. I recognize that this is a pilot study, but don't be surprised if a more complete study gives substantially different, probably lower-magnitude, coefficient estimates.
