"Executable was signed with invalid entitlements" when adding code signing entitlements

I am about to publish my first free app on the appstore. Following the instruction on the developer portal, I have added an "Entitlements.plist" file, and referenced this file in the "code signing entitlements" project setting. After I did this I can no longer test the app on my Ipod, with this error message "Executable was signed with invalid entitlements". If I remove the reference to the entitlements file, everything works fine. I have already done this: - re-downloaded my provisioning profile and installed it in organizer - Tried making a new provisioning profile and installed that - unchecked "get-task-allow" in the plist-file. - Tried "clean all targets" Can any of you shed any light on this one? Is this critical when publishing to the appstore? I have my distribution profile ready, but I suppose I have to solve this isssue first. I am thankful for any thoughts on this matter!
