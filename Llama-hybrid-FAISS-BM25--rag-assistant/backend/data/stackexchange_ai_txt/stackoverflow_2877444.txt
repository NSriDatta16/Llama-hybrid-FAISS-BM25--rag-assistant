Lots of people are confused by this. Here's how I think of it. I don't think of "ref" as meaning "by reference" at all. I think of "ref" as meaning "alias". That is, when you say void M(ref int x) { x = 123; } void N(int z) { ... } ... int y = 456; M(ref y); N(y); what that "ref y" means is "please make the corresponding formal parameter x an alias to the variable y". That is, x and y now are both variables for the same storage location . When you write to x, you're writing to y because x is another name for y. When you pass without ref, as in N(y) you're saying "y and z are two different variables such that z begins its lifetime with the same contents as y". Once you start thinking about it like that you don't have to worry about pass-by-ref vs pass-by-value, blah blah blah, it's all very confusing. The key difference is that normal passing creates a new variable and initializes it with the argument , whereas ref makes an alias to an existing variable . I wish we'd used "alias" instead of "ref"; it would have been much more clear.
