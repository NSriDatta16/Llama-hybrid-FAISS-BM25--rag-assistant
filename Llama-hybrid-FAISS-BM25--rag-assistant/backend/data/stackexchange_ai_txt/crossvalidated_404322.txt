Cox regressions and logistic regressions can have significant omitted variable bias. Omitting a predictor that is related to outcome from such models can bias the coefficients of the predictors that are included even if they are not correlated with the omitted predictor. This answer is one of several on this site that note this problem. So it is generally unwise to do multiple single-predictor Cox or logistic regressions. The single Cox multiple regression is the best way to go. That said, have you checked your model for linearity in the numeric predictors (Age and state) and for proportional hazards? Those tests are important for interpreting your results reliably. And how many events do you have? You don't want to have too few events for the number of predictors that you are evaluating.
