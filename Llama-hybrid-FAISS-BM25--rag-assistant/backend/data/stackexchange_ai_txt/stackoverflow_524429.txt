You don't need to use PHP to get this functionality, and it's generally a bad idea to do so due to potential security concerns. Essentially, you're swatting a gnat with a nuclear bomb. If you're not using a dynamic language, then you're looking for server side includes. In IIS, for instance: Be aware that you often have to configure the server to utilize them, as this feature is often turned off by default. Both IIS and Apache support server side includes, but they use different configurations. You can find more information here: Server Side Includes EDIT: I don't mean that it's a bad idea to use PHP, just using PHP solely for including other files. It creates a larger attack surface by bringing PHP into the mix when it's not needed, thus the potential for security issues when the functionality of PHP is not required. EDIT2: I think it's a bad idea to assume you won't be a target because of your size, and thus you can ignore security. Most sites are compromised by automated worms and turned into malware hosts, spam zombies, or pirated software/media servers. Apart from the fact that you might end up being involved with infecting others, your site can become blacklisted and it can cost you real money in bandwidth overage charges. We're talking hundreds or thousands of dollars. Just because you're a small site doesn't make you any less of a target. Just being on the internet makes you a target.
