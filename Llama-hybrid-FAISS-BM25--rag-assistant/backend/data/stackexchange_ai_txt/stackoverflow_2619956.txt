My advice would be to just mimic a reasonably well-thought out implementation from C++. One such implementation is SGI's Linked List . Note that the page I refer to is not code, it's a list of signatures and definitions much like the one you provided. Linked Lists are somewhat too low level for the average C# programmer to need to actually be thinking about them in normal circumstances. Usually, a basic understanding of how they work and the complexity of the different operations involved is sufficient, e.g. concatenating two linked lists can be done in O(1) time. Note: Take note of the "Model of" section of the SGI page, since each think lists are a "model of" provides complexity guarantees.
