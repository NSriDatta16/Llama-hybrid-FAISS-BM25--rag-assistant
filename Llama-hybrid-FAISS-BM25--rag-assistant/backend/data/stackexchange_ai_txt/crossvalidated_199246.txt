One option is to create seperate models for each team. If you're trying to predict the score you are probably going to want to use a Random Forest Regression since you're predicting a continuous response (not Random Forest Classification) You are correct that you should only use information that you would have had before the game starts in your model. You can simply calculate your metrics for each team based after subsetting for the relevant time interval. What you can do is create three datasets: training (for fitting the random forest with different n values), testing (for testing the accuracy of the model) and validation (for out of sample comparison). Alternatively, you can use cross-validation .
