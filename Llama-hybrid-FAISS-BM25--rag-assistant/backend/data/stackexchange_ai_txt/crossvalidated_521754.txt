How to interpret the value of an interaction coefficient between two effects coded binary predictors?

Let's imagine an experiment where people look at pictures and then rate their mood after each one from 1 (sad) to 7 (happy). The pictures can either be happy or sad (IV1), and participants are either doing the experiment on a high resolution or a low resolution monitor (IV2). (This is not my real experiment, just an example.) These two predictors are effects coded and the data are analyzed at the trial level with mixed effects linear regressions. Let's say the coefficient for picture type is +1. I think this means that on average, mood after happy pictures is rated two points higher than sad pictures (remember it is effects coded). Let's say the coefficient for screen type is +.5: people are on average 1 point happier when doing the experiment on high resolution monitors. Can you help me intuitively understand the interaction coefficient? Let's say, for example, I expect the effect of picture type to be a three point difference on the high resolution monitor, and a one point difference on the low resolution monitor. What interaction coefficient would that translate to? I think that I know how to work this out with dummy coding, but I am at a loss now with effects coding.
