How do I train a (logistic?) regression in R using L1 loss function?

I can train a logistic regression in R using glm(y ~ x, family=binomial(logit))) but, IIUC, this optimizes for log likelihood. Is there a way to train the model using the linear ($L_1$) loss function (which in this case is the same as the total variation distance )? I.e., given a numeric vector $x$ and a bit (logical) vector $y$, I want to construct a monotonic (in fact, increasing) function $f$ such that $\sum |f(x)-y|$ is minimized. See also How do I train a logistic regression in R using L1 loss function?
