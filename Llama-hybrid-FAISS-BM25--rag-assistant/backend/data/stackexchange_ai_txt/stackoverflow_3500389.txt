There is a Silverlight TV episode dedicated to a custom preloader... start from here... http://johnpapa.net/silverlight/customer-preloader-silverlight-tv-006/ And see also this post: http://elegantcode.com/2010/03/05/creating-a-custom-silverlight-pre-loader/ HTH EDIT: OK now I got you. This seems like an open topic. A solution is to provide your own logic: this is a good blog post by tim heuer http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/09/24/silverlight-isolated-storage-caching.aspx Otherwise look for MEF and dynamically load XAP's (this would be my recommended way, too) Because you got way much more control check out these article http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/MEFDynamicLoading.aspx http://www.davidezordan.net/blog/?p=1734 and gblock the mef master himself http://johnpapa.net/silverlight/silverlight-tv-11-dynamically-loading-xaps-with-mef/ This open's even possibilities to cache, load on demand and split up you app in portions... Hope I got you right this time...
