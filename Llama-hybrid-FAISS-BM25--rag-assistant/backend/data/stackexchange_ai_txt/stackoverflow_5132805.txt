And note this warning in the tftpd package description: Tftpd is a server which supports the Internet Trivial File Transfer Protocol (RFC 783). The TFTP server operates at the port indicated in the `tftp' service description; see services(5). The server is normally started by inetd(8). Tftpd is not suitable for use with the PXE bootloader; for that, use atftpd or tftpd-hpa. I don't know why it isn't suitable, but when it is labeled like that, I would suggest paying attention. :)
