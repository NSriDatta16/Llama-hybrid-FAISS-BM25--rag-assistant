Problem Adding UITabbar to Existing UITableView - iPhone SDK

Wonder if anyone can help me with this problem. I have created a Window based application. I have then added a Navigation Controller to the Window (via Interface builder) and subclassesd UITableViewController and used the table delegates in this class to draw my root view table. This all works fine. I am now trying to add a tab bar to the view. I have done this by dragging a UITabbar in Interface Builder onto the Main Window. The problem is that when I launch the app, it looks like the table is now being drawn over the top of the UITabbar which therefore makes the UITabbar unaccessible. Can anyone help me ? Thanks in advance, Martin
