You have two (classes of) choices: You could build some distribution mechanism yourself. You could use an existing tool to handle the distribution and storage. In the simplest case, you write a program on each machine in your network that simply listens, processes and writes. You distribute from X to each machine in your pool round-robin. But, you might want to address higher-level concerns like handling node failures or dealing with requests that take longer to process than others, adding new nodes to the system, etc. As you want more functionality, you'll probably want to find some existing tool to help you. It sounds like you might want to investigate some combinations of AMQP (for reliable messaging), Hadoop (for distributed data processing) or more complete NoSQL solutions like Cassandra or Riak. By leveraging these tools, your system will be significantly more robust than what you could probably build out yourself.
