Database schema - organise by object or data?

I'm refactoring a horribly interwoven db schema, it's not that it's overly normalised; just grown ugly over time and not terribly well laid out. There are several tables (forum boards, forum posts, idea posts, blog entries) that share virtually identical data structures and composition, but are seperated simply because they represent different "objects" from the applications perspective. My initial reaction is to put everything that has the same data structure into the same table, and use a "type" column to distinguish data when performing a select. Am I setting myself up for a fall by adopting this "all into one" approach and allowing (potentially) so many parts of the application to access the same table? FYI, I can't see this database growing to more than ~20mb over the next year or so...
