Extracted from Hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn & Tensorflow Data cleaning: Fix or remove outliers (optional). Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, medianâ€¦) or drop their rows (or columns). Feature selection (optional): Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task. Feature engineering, where appropriate: Discretize continuous features. Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.). Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.). Aggregate features into promising new features. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features.
