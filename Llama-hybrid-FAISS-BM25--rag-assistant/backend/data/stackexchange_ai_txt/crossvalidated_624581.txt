Although $f$ is stated as neural network, I think theorem 1 of paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09766.pdf will answer part of your question, i.e. , if $f$ is bi-Lipschitz then $I(Y, X) = \infty$ . Furthermore, $f(X) = c$ is not a bi-Lipschitz function. A example of piecewise linear function， a general form of constant function， is present in section 4.3； I think at least for that example the mutual information is a finite constant for piecewise linear function.
