The whole deployment process consists of 2 steps: Uploading package and configuration file to blob storage and actual VM commissioning process. I don't think that you can do much about reducing time for VM commissioning process as this is controlled by Windows Azure. You can however take care of the first part where you upload your package file in blob storage before deployment and then specify the blob URL. However given that your package size is 18MB, I think most of the time is being spent on VM commissioning. Regarding your approach about putting images and styles in blob storage, I think that's the correct approach. There are two distinct benefits to this approach: If you need to change some image, all you will have to do is upload the new file in blob storage. You don't have to redeploy your package file. If needed, you can take advantage of Windows Azure CDN to deliver this content which is more or less static.
