General - Is there a way to calculate an average based off of an existing average and given new parameters for the resulting average?

Lets say, we're calculating averages of test scores: Starting Test Scores: 75, 80, 92, 64, 83, 99, 79 Average = 572 / 7 = 81.714... Now given 81.714, is there a way to add a new set of test scores to "extend" this average if you don't know the initial test scores? New Test Scores: 66, 89, 71 Average = 226 / 3 = 75.333... Normal Average would be: 798 / 10 = 79.8 I've tried: Avg = (OldAvg + sumOfNewScores) / (numOfNewScores + 1) (81.714 + 226) / (3 + 1) = 76.9285 Avg = (OldAvg + NewAvg) / 2 (81.714 + 79.8) / 2 = 80.77 And neither come up the exact average that it "should" be. Is it mathematically possible to do this considering you don't know the initial values?
