Can Bayesian Optimization solve this problem?

Suppose ${\bf{x}} = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and $f({\bf{x}})\propto 1_A({\bf{x}}) \prod_{i=1}^n {x_i}^{\alpha_i-1} e^{-\beta_i x_i}$ , i.e. $f$ is proportional to the product of independent gamma distributions (with not necessarily equal parameters) truncated on a set A. In other words, we are truncating the range of original product distribution to a nontrivial subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and then normalize to get a probability distribution. I can use gibbs sampling to draw samples from $f$ and find the empirical mean. This truncation and normalization changes $\mathbb{E}(X)$ to some complicated function of all $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ . Suppose an arbitrary $y \in A$ is given. How to set the hyperparameters so that the empirical marginal mean converges to $y$ ? Basically we want to invert this map to set $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . Since the mean is a black-box function, can bayesian optimization solve this problem? (I've just come across it) or maybe hierarchical modeling? Random search is not computationally feasible. Thanks.
