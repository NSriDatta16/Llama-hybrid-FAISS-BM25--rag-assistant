Logistic Regression: What do people exactly mean by “cell size”? (example: small cell N's but no warning messages and convergence criteria met.)

I've been performing some logistic regressions and found some great results. The problem is I'm unsure if my model is stable or not. This is mostly because I am confused about what people mean by cell size for logistic regression. I keep reading inconsistent prescriptions. Some people say I need 10-15 observations per variable while some people say I need 10-15 observations per cell. I also get confused if people mean per cell when including all variables or just the main exposure/control vs event/ no event. The overall N is 331. Let's say I have data in a 2x2 table with the typical exposure/control by event/ no event: . Event No Event . . Exposure 103 15 . . No Exposure 150 63 In this example, the smallest cell size would be 15. So, I could perform a logistic regression with 1 independent variable, right? So let's say I wanted to add another variable to the same data, like Race (African American or not, 1 or 0) and here's the cell breakdown: . Clinic Event Race N . 0 1 1 121 . 1 1 1 92 . 0 0 1 46 . 0 1 0 29 . 0 0 0 17 . 1 0 1 14 . 1 1 0 11 . 1 0 0 1 Would this now mean that my smallest cell is 1? Or, would I still refer to the original 2x2 table and it would still be 15? I'm asking because when I run my logistic model in SAS with 6 independent variables on this same data, I do not get any small cell warnings and the convergence criteria is met. Does this mean I'm okay and don't need to necessarily worry about cell size? I have been running exact logistic regression models anyway but they take a VERY long time (whole other story). I'd rather just report the standard LR results to save time (assuming they are legitimate).
