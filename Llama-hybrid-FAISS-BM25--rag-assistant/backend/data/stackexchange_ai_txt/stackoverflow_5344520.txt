Grid form layout using jsf (Jdeveloper & ADF)

I am trying to build a 6x6 grid layout. In each cell, there will be an input check box. I want to bind the checkboxes to my backing bean in a "consecutive fashion"...meaning, I would like to be able to iterate over the checkboxes to see whether they are checked or not. Basically, there must be an underlying data model. For example, you can drag over and drop off as a table, any item in the data control palette. Then in my application module, I can modify the view object as I wish before I save to the database. Now if I have a table with 36 rows and two columns (one is Id, one is Numeric (1 or 0)). I would like to drag over that table and drop off as a Grid that will enable a user to update each of the rows by selecting or 'un-selecting' a checkbox.
