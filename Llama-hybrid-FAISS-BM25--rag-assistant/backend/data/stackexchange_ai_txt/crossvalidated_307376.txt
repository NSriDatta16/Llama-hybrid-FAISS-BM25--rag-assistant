Check out Norm Matloff open textbook "From Algorithms to Z-Scores" out of the University of California. In section 17.11.1 he goes over the issues of significance testing and its 'basic fallacy' in easy-to-understand terms. What he suggests you do is look critically at statistics and how it's used (rather than something applied blindly). He writes the following: Form a confidence interval. Pay close attention to the width of the confidence interval. If it is too wide, your analysis may be suggesting that the power of your analysis is not sufficient at that you may need more data. http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjgktOexujWAhUJwYMKHSz6DJkQFggoMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fheather.cs.ucdavis.edu%2F~matloff%2F132%2FPLN%2FProbStatBook.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2uvuxQfHIFqcqceOp4mNpB
