In the future please provide a reproducible example for a question such as yours, as I don't have any idea on the characteristics of your data set. As @Irishstat mentions your data might not have a trend/pattern and could have a level shift. Expanding my comment: arima(0,1,1) is a simple exponential smoothing. The level of the forecast would be flat i.e., last value of the actual. Below is an example illustrating my comment. library("fma") library("forecast") ## Without Drift fit.m As you can see the first model without drift does not capture the downward trend. The forecast is flat. forecast.m$mean Time Series: Start = 1994 End = 2003 Frequency = 1 [1] 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 62.87244 The second model with drift term captures the downward trend as it includes drift term: forecast.t$mean Time Series: Start = 1994 End = 2003 Frequency = 1 [1] 60.13606 57.75869 55.38132 53.00396 50.62659 48.24922 45.87186 43.49449 41.11712 38.73976
