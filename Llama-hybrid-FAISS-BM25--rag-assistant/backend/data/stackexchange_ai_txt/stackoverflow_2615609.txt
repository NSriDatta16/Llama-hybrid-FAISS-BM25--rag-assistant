To write a binary file on Windows you need to explicitly open it as binary, i.e.: xkcdpicfile=open("C:\\Documents and Settings\\John Gann\\Desktop\\xkcd.png", "wb") note the extra b in the options: "wb" , not just "w" ! I would also recommend losing the print chunk which may send arbitrary binary sequences to the console and possibly caused undesired side effects. If you're keen to see the hex bytes whizz by meaninglessly, maybe print repr(chunk) , if you insist. But I'd find something more meaningful to show, e.g. len(chunk) and maybe the total number of bytes so far.
