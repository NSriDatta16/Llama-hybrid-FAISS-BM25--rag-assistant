Random forest parameters

I'm trying to make decisions regarding Random forest parameters for classification. My dataset contains 26 features and 6300 instances. How can I decide the values of (the number of trees, number of features, number of the bootstrap sample and the minimum node size) is there any formulas I should calculate help to decide about these values? Thank you
