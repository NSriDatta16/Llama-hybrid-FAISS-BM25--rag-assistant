Can jQuery.getJSON put a domain's cookies in the header of the request it makes?

(Note: See also the related question Can browsers react to Set-Cookie specified in headers in an XSS jquery.getJSON() request? ) I can't seem to set a cookie (whose name is mwLastWriteTime ) in the request header of a JSON operation. The request itself is a simple one from the Freebase MQL tutorials, and it is working fine otherwise: // Invoke mqlread and call the function below when it is done. // Adding callback=? to the URL makes jQuery do JSONP instead of XHR. jQuery.getJSON("http://api.sandbox-freebase.com/api/service/mqlread?callback=?", {query: JSON.stringify(envelope)}, // URL parameters displayResults); // Callback function I'd hoped that I could set this cookie with something along the lines of: $.cookie('mwLastWriteTime', value, {domain: ".sandbox-freebase.com"}); Unfortunately, looking in FireBug at the outgoing request header I see only: Host api.sandbox-freebase.com User-Agent [...] Accept */* Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Referer [...] But if I don't specify the domain (or if I explicitly specify the domain of the requesting site) I can get mwLastWriteTime to show up in the headers for local requests. Since the .sandbox-freebase.com domain owns these cookies, shouldn't they be traveling along with the GET? Or does one need a workaround of some sort? My code is all JavaScript, and I would like to set this cookie and then call the getJSON immediately afterward.
