Loss function to widen distribution of predictions

I'm working on a project where my business counterparts want my model's distribution of continuous predictions to more closely represent the distribution of actual values. Below is an example of what my model looks like now. This is how the business would like it to behave instead. Which loss function would encourage the model to more closely resemble the second graph? Currently I'm using RMSE as my loss function, but I'm curious if other loss functions like median absolute error would lead to a model with a better spread.
