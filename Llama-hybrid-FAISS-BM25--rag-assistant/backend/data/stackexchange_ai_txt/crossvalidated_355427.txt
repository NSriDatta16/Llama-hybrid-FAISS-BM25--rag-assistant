Autoencoders and Collaborative Filtering: Is one network per training sample really necessary?

I have been researching on how to apply neural networks to recommender systems and have come across this paper ( AutoRec: Autoencoders Meet Collaborative Filtering by Sedhain et al. ) where they model it with an auto-encoder. So far so good, but then they proceed by stating that each training sample will be provided to its own neural network(auto-encoder) and I see no advantages on using this approach besides being able to distribute the load of the training stage over a network, yet, they do not ever mention this guess of mine! Is this point relevant at all for successfully training the network or am I missing something?
