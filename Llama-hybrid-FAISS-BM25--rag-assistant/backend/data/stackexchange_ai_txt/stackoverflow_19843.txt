Generics in c# & accessing the static members of T

My question concerns c# and how to access Static members ... Well I don't really know how to explain it (which kind of is bad for a question isn't it?) I will just give you some sample code: Class test { int method1(Obj Parameter1){ //in here I want to do something which I would explain as T.TryParse(Parameter1); //my problem is that it does not work ... I get an error. //just to explain: if I declare test (with type Integer) //I want my sample code to call int.TryParse(). If it were String //it should have been String.TryParse() } } So thank you guys for your answers (By the way the question is: how would I solve this problem without getting an error). This probably quite an easy question for you! Edit: Thank you all for your answers! Though I think the try - catch phrase is the most elegant, I know from my experience with vb that it can really be a bummer. I used it once and it took about 30 minutes to run a program, which later on only took 2 minutes to compute just because I avoided try - catch. This is why I chose the switch statement as the best answer. It makes the code more complicated but on the other hand I imagine it to be relatively fast and relatively easy to read. (Though I still think there should be a more elegant way ... maybe in the next language I learn) Though if you have some other suggestion I am still waiting (and willing to participate)
