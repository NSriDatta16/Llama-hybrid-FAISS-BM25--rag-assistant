The attention is not to end call that is already started, but to drop the call before that was started. The meaning is - you dial some number , press send , program receives the call request and aborts it , so the call never starts. It is also possible just to change the phone number (to extend short numbers to full one, etc.) and pass the call. It works fine: public class phoneReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver { public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { if (intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL)) { abortBroadcast(); if (getResultData()!=null) { String number = null; setResultData(number); } } } }
