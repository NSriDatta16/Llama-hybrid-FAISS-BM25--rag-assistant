Machine learning matching methods?

My goal is match each of the invoices created to each payment made. So for example, if I have a set of invoices: InvoiceDate InvoiceCategory 02/21/2016 Amazon 08/17/2016 BestBuy 08/17/2016 Amazon 08/21/2016 BestBuy Let's say each of those rows are matched respectively with each row here: PaymentDate PaymentCategory 04/1/2016 Paypal 9/19/2016 Credit 9/22/2016 Paypal 9/29/2016 Check That is, 02/21/2016 Amazon matches with 04/1/2016 Paypal and so on. I want to then train some model on this training set. I want the model to figure out from the example above that the PaymentDate comes roughly a month after each InvoiceDate . And that BestBuy matches more closely to Check than Paypal (because intuitively, Best Buy accepts check payment but not Paypal) So if my test set consists of InvoiceDate InvoiceCategory PaymentDate PaymentCategory 02/21/2015 Amazon 9/19/2015 Credit 08/17/2015 BestBuy 04/1/2015 Paypal Then the ML should predict that 02/21/2015 Amazon matches with 04/1/2015 Paypal and 08/17/2015 BestBuy matches with 9/19/2015 Credit I've heard about recordlinkage in Python. However, it seems to only link records with identical values. That won't work in my case because in the example above 02/21/2015 matches with 04/1/2015 even though their dates are different But what ML model matches records like this?
