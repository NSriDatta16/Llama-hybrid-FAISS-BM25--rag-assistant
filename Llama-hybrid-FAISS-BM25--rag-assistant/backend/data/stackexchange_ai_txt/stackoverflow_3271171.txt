Binding ArrayCollections of Arrays

I've been kinda stuck in trying to organize data and bind them to a Repeater in one my applications. What I did at first, was to save an array of arrays, so that I could've accessed any value very easily. But then I realized that I needed to bind them to a Repeater, so I had to switch to an ArrayCollection of arrays. But the Binding issues weren't solved, since there are still arrays (not bindable) inside the ArrayCollection. So, what can I do?? Below an example of what I want to do: the traces show that the array size changes, but the repeater doesn't update. Any idea?? What's the best practise?
