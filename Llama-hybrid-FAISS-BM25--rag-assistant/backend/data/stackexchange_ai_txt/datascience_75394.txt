How to determine what algorithm to apply in the following dataset (included)

I have a dataset that I will be using to build a classifier on. Below I have plotted the First and the Second Principal Component of the data using sklearn.preprocessing.PCA . Since the two different classes are not well separated a linear classifier will not work here. My question is which classifier would be best for this scenario. My research brought be to KNN . But My intuition says the class ratio is highly imbalanced a large value of k in KNN would always tend towards the larger class count. It will be a nightmare to train it on SVM since therw are to many observations in the dataset and it will take too long.
