Using Lucene just as an inverted index

Lucene has a great capability of incremental indexing. Which is normally a pain when developing a IR system from scratch. I would like to know if I can use low-level Lucene APIs to use it only as an Inverted Index, i.e., storage for inverted lists, position information, term frequency, idfs, field storage, etc... Bottom line is that I want to implement my own weightings and scoring of documents. I'm aware of Similarity class, but It does not give the flexibility I want.
