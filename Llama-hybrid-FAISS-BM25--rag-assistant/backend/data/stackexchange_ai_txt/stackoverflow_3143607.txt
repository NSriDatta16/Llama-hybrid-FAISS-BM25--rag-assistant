Best approach to programming highly complex business/math rules

I have to take a piece of data, and apply a large number of possible variables to it. I really don't like the idea of using a gigantic set of if statements, so i'm looking for help in an approach to simplify, and make it easier to maintain. As an example: if (isSoccer) val = soccerBaseVal; else if (isFootball) val = footballBaseVal; .... // 20 different sports if (isMale) val += 1; else val += 5; switch(dayOfWeek) { case DayOfWeek.Monday: val += 12; ... } etc.. etc.. etc.. with possibly in the range of 100-200 different tests and formula variations. This just seems like a maintenance nightmare. Any suggestions? EDIT: To further add to the problem, many variables are only used in certain situations, so it's more than just a fixed set of logic with different values. The logic itself has to change based on conditions, possibly conditions applied from previous variables (if val > threshold, for instance). So yes, i agree about using lookups for many of the values, but I also have to have variable logic.
