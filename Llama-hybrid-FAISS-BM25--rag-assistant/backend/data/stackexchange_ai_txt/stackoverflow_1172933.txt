Using web.config to ban user-agents

Is it possible to ban certain user agents directly from web.config? Certain robots seem not to follow robots.txt, and to avoid pointless server load (and log-file spamming) I'd like to prevent certain classes of request (in particular based on user-agent or very perhaps IP-address) from proceeding. Bonus points if you know if it's similarly possible to prevent such requests from being logged to IIS's log-file entirely. (i.e. if-request-match, forward to /dev/null, if you get my meaning). A solution for win2003 would be preferable, but this is a recurring problem - if there's a clean solution for IIS7 but not IIS6, I'd be happy to know it. Edit: Sorry 'bout the incomplete question earlier, I had tab+entered accidentally.
