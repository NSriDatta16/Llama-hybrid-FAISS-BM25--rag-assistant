jQuery Droppable: dropping outside div?

Is there any way I can get jQuery to perform a function when you drag an item outside a droppable DIV? Let's say that we have draggable or sortable items in a div and you want them deleted if they are dropped outside their parent div. I know there is the "out" event but that works as soon as you drag the item outside the div, not when you drop it (release mouse button).
