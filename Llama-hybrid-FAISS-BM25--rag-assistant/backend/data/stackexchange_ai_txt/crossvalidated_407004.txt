Misunderstanding of time series autocovariance

I'm reading the "Time Series: Theory and Methods (2nd ed.)" by P.J.Brockwell and R.A.Davis. I've stopped at the one moment at pp.218-219 (Chapter 7 "Estimation of the mean and the Autocovariance function"). In the proof of theorem 7.1.1 if $\gamma(n) \rightarrow 0$ as $n \rightarrow +\infty, $ then $$\lim_{n \rightarrow +\infty} n^{-1} \sum_{|h| Could anyone explain me the first equality in this part of the proof?
