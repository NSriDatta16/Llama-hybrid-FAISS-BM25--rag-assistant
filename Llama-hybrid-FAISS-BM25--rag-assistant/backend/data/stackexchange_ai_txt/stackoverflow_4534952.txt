well, store the images at app server in file system and save it's reference to users table's image_location column. refer: Photo storage for web app Side Note : If you have multiple app server, better store the files at a shared location accessible to all the app server in indentical manner. It's not a good idea to store file in database. As indicated by @sasidhar, here is what I would do: Make a central image server with Unix OS on it. Will make sure it has fixed IP. In your app, use JSch to secure copy file from client machine to a dedicated directory at the server Update the users table's image_location with relative path of the image from "/" When viewing, I will check the relative path of the user and fetch it again using JSch secure file tranfer protocol. By the way, setting up a FTP could be a better alternative. Why should you not use DB as file storage? See here: Storing Images in DB - Yea or Nay?
