Of course it's useful. Have you ever used std::distance or std::advance ? They use metaprogramming to do the right thing for bidirectional/random access iterators. (that is, repeated ++ or -- for bidirectional iterators, and += or -= for random access iterators). TMP is most useful for libraries that need to do one thing for a type argument, or do another thing for a different type argument (i.e. distance/advance). Are there insane (e.g. Boost::Spirit::Qi) things you can do with metaprogramming? Sure. That's not the average case though.
