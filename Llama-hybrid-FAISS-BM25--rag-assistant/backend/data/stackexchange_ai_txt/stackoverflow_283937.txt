Now that you posted the code fragment and a working workaround was found (@Windows programmer's answer), I can say that perhaps what you are looking for is -ffloat-store . -ffloat-store Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a register or memory. This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more precision than a double is supposed to have. Similarly for the x86 architecture. For most programs, the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating point. Use -ffloat-store for such programs, after modifying them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables. Source: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.6/gcc/Optimize-Options.html
