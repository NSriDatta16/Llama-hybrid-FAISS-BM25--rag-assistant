You have a couple choices: Use the PreviewXXX events which are fired during the "tunneling" phase of WPF event routing . The parent controls can always preview the events going down through them to children. Use the more advanced approach to hooking up events leveraging the AddHandler method to which you can pass a parameter called "handledEventsToo" which basically means you want to know when the event happened "within" you even if some descendent element handled the event itself.
