How to create a HTML link without extension?

Recently I saw in several websites links that are the text of the link and without any extension. The following link (http://www.iicd.org/articles/bolivian-farmers-test-pdas-to-speed-up-organic-certification), for example, the link is the text that is shown in the page but in lower caps and with (-) connecting the words. Is this generated on the fly or how does this work? Thanks in advance.
