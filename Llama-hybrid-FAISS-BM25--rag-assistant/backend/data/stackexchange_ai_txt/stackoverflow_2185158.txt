Converting a large SQL Server Database to Azure Storage

I have a very large database structure, (Data is not important at this point, I can migrate the info in the db pretty easily if the structure is done) , all reside in SQL Server and I even published it to SQL Azure, but thinking about the limitation of SQL Azure in size, made me decide to switch most of the tables that do not need all the bells and whistles of SQL Azure to Azure Table and blob storage. I was thinking of creating a TT template that dose that, but was wondering if their is a tool that do that. Any ideas or thoughts? The only tables that i would keep in SQL Azure would anything related to transactions like payments.
