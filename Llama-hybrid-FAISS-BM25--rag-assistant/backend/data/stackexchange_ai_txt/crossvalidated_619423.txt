Time Series Forecasting with multiple input, single output that has multiple values for each time step

I'm trying to understand if possible to generate a time series forecasting program that is able to deal with multiple values for each time step. Examples like this tensor flow guide show time series forecasting with a single set of data for each time step but is it possible for the timestep to also have multiple sets of values?
