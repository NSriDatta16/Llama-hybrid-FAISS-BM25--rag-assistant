In a standard CGI application, I don't see how you can "push" data to them. For a client interaction, the data goes through the CGI/presentation layer to the middle tier to remain in session storage (or cache) or to the backend to get stored in the database. That is of course unless you have a thick application layer which is a caching locus and kind of a middle tier in itself.
