Your correct. The solution is just create a flag variable that whenever the user drags the timeline, ( event.preventDefault() ) the anchor tags. This solution might pose more errors though because what if the user "accidentally" slightly drags the timeline but what he/she wants is to click the link? the timeline might not be that responsive anymore. My suggestion is, prevent default all anchor tags then use double click to visit a particular link.
