Really you should use Ant or Maven to run JUnit tests, or do it the pure JUnit way and organize all of your tests into Suites and run the suite via the JUnit command line, but in order to iterate all files in a batch file, just use the for command like this: for /R %%i in (*.class) do echo "%%i" Just replace the echo with a call that does something you need. Note you need to quote the variable in case there is a space in the path name.
