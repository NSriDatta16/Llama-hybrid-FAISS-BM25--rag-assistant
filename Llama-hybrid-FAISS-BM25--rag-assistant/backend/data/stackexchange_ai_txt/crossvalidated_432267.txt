How can I create a new variable from answers that come from two different variables?

I have two variables: RACE & HISPANIC RACE has 5 responses 1-White 2-Black/AA 3-Asian etc. I am interested in those that answered 'White' HISPANIC has 13 responses 0-11=Hispanic countries 12-Not Hispanic I am interested in those that answered 'Yes' in 00 to 11 I am looking to create a new variable ETHNICITY made up of those that 1-White and those that answered 00-11-Hispanic. I am predicting heart disease rates(dependent) among three other variables, ETHNICITY is the only one where the answers come from two different variables. I am using SPSS, binary logistic regression. Do I First, compute a new variable for each White=1 and another for HISPANIC=00-11? Second, do I then create a new variable to merge the two? How do I do that? I've had trouble doing the compute If,
