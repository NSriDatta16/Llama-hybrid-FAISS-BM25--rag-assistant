High code coverage is more an indication of how widely you've tested your code base, ie if you've tested all the code paths possible in your system etc. They give no indication of the quality of individual tests, but is one metric to measure the quality of your unit tests as a whole. As for high performance, you need to categorize your tests, separating out the tests that touch your database or other high latency services. Keep your performance tests in a separate category as well. Also make sure you keep an eye out for integration (or end to end tests), for instance a test that opens up a web browser, posts and then verifies the response. If you do this, you don't really need to worry about the performance of your tests.
