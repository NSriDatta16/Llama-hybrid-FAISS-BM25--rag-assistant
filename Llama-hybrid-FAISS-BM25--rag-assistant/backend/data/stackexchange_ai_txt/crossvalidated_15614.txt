What you are doing with using lags of explanatories is in my opinion a very bad idea if the explanatory variable is auto-correlated with itself. The lags are correlated thus identification will probably fail as you are trying to use ESTIMATION to perform IDENTIFICATION. Box and Jenkins and a host of others suggest pre-whitening to identify the correct X structure in an ARMAX model. Art becomes science when you understand what to do. Time series is not art but intelligent analytics done artfully make the science a lot easier. In my opinion the art "nearly vanishes" as you hone the science.
