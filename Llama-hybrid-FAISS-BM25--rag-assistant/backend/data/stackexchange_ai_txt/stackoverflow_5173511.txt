XSL to flatten a nested list

This is the opposite of a question I asked a couple of months ago. I have a nested structure that I need to flatten. For example, the input might be something like this: text num1 num2 sub-num1 sub-num2 sub-sub-num1 num3 text num1 num2 text And the output should be flattened as follows: text num1 num2 sub-num1 sub-num2 sub-sub-num1 num3 text num1 num2 text I think I could do it in a un-elegant way, but I was hoping someone might have a better method to share. This needs to be done using XSLT 1.0
