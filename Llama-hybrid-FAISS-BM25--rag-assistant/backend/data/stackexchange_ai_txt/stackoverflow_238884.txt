Unfortunatly VB.NET does not provide 'skinning' out of the box. It simply uses the standard windows interface. The only changes to the UI are made when you change the display properties. I'm not aware of an open source project that provides skinning functionality, however I have used a number of commercial products. By far, one of the best I have used is the Application Styling Framework found in NET Advantage by Infragistics.
