Zend Helper design usage example

I have a view that loops over a database table returning dogs information. Here's the controller: public function listAction() { $dogDao = new DogDao(); $this->view->infoDog = $dogDao->retrieveDogInfo(); } On the view I can retrieve dog information like this: if(isset($this->infoDog[$i])){ $dog = $this->infoDog[$i]; This works fine. I now need to add additional dog specific information but that dog information, is not an information that I can get from the Dog General Info table, it requires some joins, and the retrieval of a number at the end. public function retrieveVerySpecificInformation($dogId) { return $numberSpecificForThatDog }; I (believe) I need a helper that does those calculations and my question is: I should call this helper on the view where the for resides yes? But how can I connect those informations in a way that I get for given dog A, both: The general dog information AND that numberSpecific for that particular dog A ? I mean, how can we properly integrate the helper here? Can I have some help please? Thanks in advance, MEM
