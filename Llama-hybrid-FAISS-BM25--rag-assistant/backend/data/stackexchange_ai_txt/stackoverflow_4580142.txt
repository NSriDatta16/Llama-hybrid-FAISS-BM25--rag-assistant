I've built a site which uses Maps API for displaying events across the globe (300+ of sport events), so yes, it's possible. The geocoding works really well in general (just as on the Maps site). I've used it with a Map display where the user can drag a marker to adjust the exact location, then saved the coordinates. In this way, you won't really need a 'did you mean?'-type box.
