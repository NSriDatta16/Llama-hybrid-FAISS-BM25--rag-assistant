I recommend removing the unusual contrasts argument and re-running this. Using the defaults will help you use documentation and other resources that describe the model that's being fit. Under the default contrasts; The intercept coefficient is a log odds; the log odds of getting an accurate answer, for questions in the lowest color category, where word type is the lowest level (WordType=0), and in average participants (i.e. where the random intercept term is zero). The word type coefficient (a `main effect') is a log odds ratio, i.e. it describes a comparison. More specifically, it estimates the log of the ratio of the odds of getting an accurate answer, comparing questions with WordType1 to WordType0, among questions in the lowest (reference) color category and in average participants. The color main effects can be interpreted similarly; the comparison is of each color level to the reference category, this time keeping word type fixed and in average participants. The interaction coefficients describe comparisons of comparisons, so their descriptions get still more long-winded. For example, the WordType:Color21 coefficient estimates the log of the ratio of two coefficients that describe Color21 main effects, among questions which are of WordType1 and and WordType0, and these comparisons are all made in average participants. Using exp() on the non-intercept terms you get an estimate of the parameter as described above but omitting 'log' throughout.
