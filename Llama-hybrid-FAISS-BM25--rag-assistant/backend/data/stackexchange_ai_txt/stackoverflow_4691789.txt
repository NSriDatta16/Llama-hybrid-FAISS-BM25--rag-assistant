I read what's above and I feel much better knowing that some people out there are trying to figure out the issue as mine. Well, As you may know, you can't find the whole information about your clients in magento back-office. I wanted to have a very big table where I can see all of my clients (those who have an account= registred) ( and those who just registred to news letters newsletter_subscribers) Since I don't really know how magento provides those information, I wrote som SQL code to extract data. As It is said above you can't have all the information about clients in one query. Actually, you will need as much queries as the clients Attributes. If the entity client has 45 attributes (name, lastname, middlename, email .....) then you will need 45 queries to extract them... My question was HOW ??? The answer is VIEWS !! Actually, I wrote Views to extract each attribute information. That means That I wrote 45 veiws, each view selects an attribute I don't know How it is done in your database, but, You may know that Each entity has a entity_type_id. In my case, I'm interested in the customer_entity and the customer_address_entity. the customer_entity has a entity_type_id = 1 the customer_address_entity has an entity_type_id = 2 Each entity has attributes. So, if you want to see what are the attributes available for the customer entity run the query : Select attribute_code, attribute_id, backend_type from eav_attribute where entity_type_id =1 Same thing for address entity by replacing the 1 by 2. The column attributes_id is very important because this will enable you to find your attributes by id the tables : entity_customer_vachar, entity_customer_int, entity_customer_text, entity_customer_datetime You'll maybe find out the the firstname attribute_id = 5 in this table as Joseph Mastey wrote in he's query... The information are dispatched by type in the tables above. When you run the query above, you will see that each attribute has a backendtype. that means that the informations you are looking for is one of the tables suffixed by its type. For example, if you are looking for firstname which type is varchar, then you'll find it in customer_entity_varchar and so on. If you are still reading, that may mean you understand what I'm talking about. Other wise you need to look at the EAV model And the magento 1.3.2.4 database schema at http://inchoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/MAGENTO_v1.3.2.4-Database_Diagram.pdf I can't post the whole solution because It's not ready yet, I'll put a zip file if that can help. Meanwhile, If someone knows how the use magento objects wiht a php file to get to the data without editing the magento Core, that would be great! Thanks
