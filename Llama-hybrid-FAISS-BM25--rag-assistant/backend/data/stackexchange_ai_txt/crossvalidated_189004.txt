Suitable non parametric test

I am trying to determine which type of non-parametric test is most suitable in this situation: Public and private sector organisations were sampled in a study which aimed to determine what percentage of budget was spent on IT systems and technology upgrades in the previous fiscal year. Results were as below: Sector % of budget Public 2.58 5.05 0.05 2.10 4.30 2.25 2.50 1.95 2.33 Private 5.40 2.55 9.00 10.55 1.02 5.11 24.42 1.67 3.33 What kind of test can I use to determine whether the percentage expenditure is greater for the private than the public sector?
