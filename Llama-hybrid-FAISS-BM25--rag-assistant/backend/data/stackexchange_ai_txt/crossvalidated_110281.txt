Logistic Regression - Binning - Interpretting p values

My name is Abhi and I am trying to teach myself regression by solving some practice problems available on the internet. I am using RStudio as my development environment. Problem Statement Given the age, sex, class(first,second,third), ticket_id for each passenger can you predict if he survived or died when the titanic sank. I did some initial data analysis and it seems passenger class and ticket id are fairly predictive. Here are the results from my first model Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4431 -0.8649 -0.6772 0.9332 1.7806 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.1713 0.2171 5.396 6.80e-08 *** Pclass -0.5654 0.1110 -5.094 3.50e-07 *** Ticket2 -0.4361 0.2421 -1.801 0.0716 . Ticket3 -0.8311 0.2033 -4.089 4.33e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1186.7 on 890 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1067.8 on 887 degrees of freedom AIC: 1075.8 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 My question is why do I get poor p values for Ticket2? Does this mean Ticket1 and Ticket2 should be merged? Not enough samples for Ticket2? Any help would be much appreciated.
