H2O deep learning is finding local minimum or saddle points, that's likely why you are seeing the fluctuations. Try varying l1 and l2 regularization, input layer and per layer dropout. Those are usually a good starting point for building models that eventually converge. You will likely want to do some sort of search (grid or random search) across these hyperparameters. The H2O booklet covers much of these items: http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-slater/3/docs-website/h2o-docs/booklets/DeepLearning_Vignette.pdf
