Does Keras allow using independant classifier

I have spam data set classified into 0:ham or 1:spam. I created the Embedding layer with Keras and then I used Conv1D following with other layers. My question is about adding a classifier like Random Forest or SVM or anything else using Scikit-learn library after the Conv1D layer, so that the output of Conv1D can become as input to Random forest? for example: model.add(Conv1D(filters=100,kernal_size=2,activation="relu") model.add(RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0)) ... model.compile model.fit I know the second line gives syntax error but I tried to explain my idea. Thank you.
