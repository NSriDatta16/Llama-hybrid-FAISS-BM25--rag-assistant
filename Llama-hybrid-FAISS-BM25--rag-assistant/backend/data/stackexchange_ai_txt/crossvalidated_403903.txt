One way to think of it is to consider the latent variable interpretation of logistic regression. In this interpretation, we consider a linear model for $Y^*$ , a latent (i.e., unobserved) variable that represents the "propensity" for $Y=1$ . So, we have $Y^*=X\beta + \epsilon$ . We get the observed values of $Y$ as $Y=I(Y^*>0)$ , where $I(.)$ is the indicator function. When $\epsilon$ is distributed as the logistic distribution with mean 0 and variance $\frac{\pi^2}{3}$ , a logistic regression model correctly describes $Y$ . That is, $P(Y=1)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-X \beta}}$ is the correct model for $Y$ . When $\epsilon$ is distributed as the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, a probit regression model correctly describes $Y$ . The polychoric correlation between two variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ is the implied correlation of $Y^*_1$ and $Y^*_2$ assuming a probit model. A benefit of the latent variable interpretation is that the model coefficients can be interpreted as the linear change in $Y^*$ corresponding to a 1-unit change in a predictor holding others constant, in contrast to the log odds ratio interpretation often used for logistic regression (and it seems almost impossible to interpret a probit regression coefficient). The modeled implied mean and standard deviation of $Y^*$ can be computed to see how much in standardized units of $Y^*$ a 1-unit change in a predictor is associated with, just as you would with a continuous outcome of arbitrary scale. In addition, this interpretation works regardless of whether logistic, probit, or some other type of regression model or error distribution is used.
