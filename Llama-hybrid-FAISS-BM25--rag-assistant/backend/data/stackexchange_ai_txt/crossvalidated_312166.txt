Yes, that's possible (if I understand you correctly). Some packages can make this simple, with some it may be harder. One simple way is to "explode" your matrix into single trials like this, subject | test | trial | success --- | --- | --- | --- 123 | A | 45 | 1 110 | B | 40 | 0 100 | B | 40 | 1 100 | A | 40 | 0 Then you model this as a simple logistic regression. The formula with glmer in R is then glmer(success ~ 1 + (1 | subject) + test, family = "binomial") .
