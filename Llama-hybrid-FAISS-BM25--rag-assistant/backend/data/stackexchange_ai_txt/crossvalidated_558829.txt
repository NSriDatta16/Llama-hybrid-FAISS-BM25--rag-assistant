Can "Prediction" and "Inference" be used Interchangeably?

Within statistics, I have heard that almost all analysis can be broken into two general classes: Prediction : E.g. Statistical Modelling, Machine Learning Inference I have seen the term " inference " being used to describe the following: Inferring the parameters of an unknown probability distribution. Inferring the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon. Making inferences about a population are made based on certain statistics calculated from a sample of data drawn from that population. My Question: Although this is more of a pedantic issue - but in the above three points, is there anything stopping you from replacing "inference" with "prediction"? For example: Predicting the parameters of an unknown probability distribution. Predicting the independent, actual effect of a particular phenomenon. Making predictions about a population are made based on certain statistics calculated from a sample of data drawn from that population. Can someone please comment on this? Thanks!
