As creating threads in appservers is discouraged, I'd modify the setup a bit. I'd move the core of processing to a message driven bean, and have the Quartz job just send a message to the queue on which the MDB is listening. The MDB in turn can call your EJB, and like this everything remains within what's allowed by the standard.
