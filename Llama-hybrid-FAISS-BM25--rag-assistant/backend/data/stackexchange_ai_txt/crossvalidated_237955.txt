Nothing seems to be awry here. Coefficients in logistic regression are indeed scale-dependent; predictors with smaller SDs will in general get larger coefficients. If you want the variables to be on comparable scales, you can standardize each continuous variable by subtracting its mean and dividing by twice its SD. Gelman, A. (2008). Scaling regression inputs by dividing by two standard deviations. Statistics in Medicine, 27 , 2865â€“2873. doi:10.1002/sim.3107
