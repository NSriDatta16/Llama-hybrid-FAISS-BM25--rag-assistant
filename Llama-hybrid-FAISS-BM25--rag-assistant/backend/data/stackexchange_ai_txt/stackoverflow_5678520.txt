Packaging a magento extension: Step 5: Contents

I have a script which works on magento stores. It works fine if it is dumped on the root folder of the webstore. I want to package it where others can also use freely. I've used package manager to step 5. where there is Role: Path: Type: Include: Ignore. What should i put in these fields? the location of my file is app/core/community/magentofile.php Any help would be appreciated. thanks.
