Central Limit Theorem for Wilcoxon signed rank tests

Let $X_i, i=1,2,...,n$ be a set of iid observations, assumed symmetric about $\mu$. Let $R_i$ be the rank of the absolute deviations from some $\mu_0$, i.e. $R_i=\text{rank}(|X_i-\mu_0|)$. Let $Z_i=\text{sign}(X_i-\mu_0)$. Under the null hypothesis $\mu_0=\mu$. If I pick up only one sample each time, let X be the random variable, the expected average value E(X) is 0.5, isn't it? the variance of X is 0, isn't it? so how how can I apply CLT for signed rank tests?
