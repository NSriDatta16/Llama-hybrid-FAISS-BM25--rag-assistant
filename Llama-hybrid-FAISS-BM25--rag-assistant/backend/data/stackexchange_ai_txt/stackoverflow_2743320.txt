You can selectively disable warnings with a pragma: // Disable warning messages 4507 and 4034. #pragma warning( disable : 4507 34 ) If you can emit such warnings (or an #include) in the generated code files, you're done. Alternatively, you can disable them globally on the command-line for the compiler: /wd4326 disables compiler warning C4326. Then re-enable them (via a header file) in the files you want them for: // Report warning 4326 as an error. #pragma warning( error : 326 ) Finally, you can set different compile options for each source file by altering the Properties in the project file. Personally I find that a maintenance nightmare, but there are times you have no choice. Edit : I see that your source files are C#, not C++. Using the C# command-line: to suppress CS0028, you could specify /nowarn:28. Unfortunately, /warnaserror makes all warnings errors.
