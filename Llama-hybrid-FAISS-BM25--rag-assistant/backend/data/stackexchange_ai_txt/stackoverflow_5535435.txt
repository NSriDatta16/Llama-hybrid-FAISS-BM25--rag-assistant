Indeed, the best solution is to upgrade to a newer version. Don't worry, upgrades are not that difficult. http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/AdminGuide/Installation#HUpgradinganXWikiInstallation There are two parts in an upgrade: the platform, meaning all the files on the filesystem, and the wiki content, since quite often things change in the default wiki documents. Your specific bug can be fixed by upgrading the platform part, so if you're not too confident about upgrading the wiki content, you can just leave the old content in place. In order not to lose your current database, be sure to leave the old "database" folder in place, and just replace the "webapps\xwiki" part.
