Since ui:fragment doesn't support rendered most of IDE (like Netbeans mark it as error BUT it works because in JSF parameters are inherited) This is actually a bug in JSF 2.0 Facelets tag file declaration (in Mojarra, that's the com/sun/faces/metadata/taglib/ui.taglib.xml file). The rendered attribute is overlooked and missing in the tag file declaration (and also in the JSF 2.0 tag documentation ), while it is really present in the UIComponent . The IDE validation is based on the tag file declarations and hence it gives a misleading validation error. This issue is fixed in JSF 2.1, the missing attribute is added to the tag file declaration (and also in the JSF 2.1 tag documentation ). If either just ignoring the IDE warnings or upgrading to JSF 2.1 is not an option, then you can consider using the component instead: It outputs nothing anyway if you don't specify the id , style , styleClass and like attributes, else a simple will be rendered. If all what you have is plain vanilla HTML (i.e. no JSF components), then you can also consider using . text 1 text 2 text 3 However, the is deprecated in JSF 2.0 (which in turn has also a documentary bug by the way, the JSF 2.0 tag documentation does not mention deprecation, but the JSF 2.1 tag documentation does).
