Just to add to the discussion, this is mostly an assumption that simplifies the mathematics of inference. To take a concrete example, I am in the field of image processing and usually most algorithms will assume that the noise in the image is IID. This is hardly ever the case because most of the time we do some pre processing on the imaging (for ex: smoothing or averaging) and this will introduce correlation among neighbourhood imaging pixels. Also, pixels belonging to similar structures will have similar properties, the point spread function of the measurement device etc. will all make the IID assumption strictly not true. In any real world case, it usually turns out to be an assumption but it depends on what you are trying to achieve to be able to tell whether the assumption is valid or not.
