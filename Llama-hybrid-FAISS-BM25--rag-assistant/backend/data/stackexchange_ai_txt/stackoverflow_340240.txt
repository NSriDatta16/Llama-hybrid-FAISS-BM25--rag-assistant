You migth want to add a unique relational key among the two tables instead of using the agent name in both. Something like this: Table1: id, agent_id, ticket_id, category, date_logged Table2: agent_id, agent_name, department, admin_status A SQL example: SELECT t2.agent_name, t1.date_logged FROM table1 t1 INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t2.agent_id = t1.agent_id However you might want to use some kind of outer join so I suggest you take a look at some articles over the Internet.
