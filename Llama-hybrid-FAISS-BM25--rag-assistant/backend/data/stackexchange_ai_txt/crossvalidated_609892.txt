Bootstrapping for testing set

I know that for fitting a random forest model in a training set, you create many bootstrap samples with the training data set and fit a decision tree to each bootstrapped training set. Then aggregate predictions from every tree to get the single prediction. But, the question is, for testing, can you please inform me how it works in an unseen set? I don't think you can create many bootstrap samples with the training data. Do you create bootstrap samples with the test data? Thanks in advance for your help
