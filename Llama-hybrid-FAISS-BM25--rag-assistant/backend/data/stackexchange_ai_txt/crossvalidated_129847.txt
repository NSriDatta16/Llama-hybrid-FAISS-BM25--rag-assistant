Applying the Bayesian Information Criterion for Stepwise Selection Algorithms on Time Series

The title sounds rather complicated for fairly simple statistics issue. I've created a factor model that tests adding additional factors by checking if the improvement in the mean squared error between the factor returns and the returns has improved by more than a given percent. However, I understand from Monarcha (2009) and other statistics sources that this does not penalize enough for the risk of over-specification. After some reading, I've been looking to apply the Schwarz Criterion which is unfortunately has a relatively poor wiki page. My question is fairly simple and shows my lack of understanding, what is $\hat L$ in $\mathrm{BIC} = {-2 \cdot \ln{\hat L} + k \cdot \ln(n)} $ for my problem? Is it just the mean squared error?
