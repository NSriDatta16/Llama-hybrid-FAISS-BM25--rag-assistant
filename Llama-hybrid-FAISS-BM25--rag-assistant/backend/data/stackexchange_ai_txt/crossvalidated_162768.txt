You can use the Paired t-Test, which is described this tutorial: http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/paired-t-test.pdf . It is a variant of the Student's t-Test https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Paired_samples . This tests whether there is a statistically significant difference between the average (mean) satisfaction ratings between two retailers. Important: the distribution of differences between ratings for each month needs to be approximately Normal, i.e. roughly symmetric, single mode near the mean, and tails that are thin. In simple terms, it must look like a bell curve, roughly. Here is a web page that walks through an example of a Paired t-Test in R: http://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/d_09.html . Please be aware that statistical significance is not the same as practical significance , a.k.a. "effect size". I might be that Retailer A has statistically significantly better satisfaction than Retailer B, but the magnitude of the difference (effect size) might still be very small -- say 8.9 vs. 8.7. The only thing that statistical significance tells you is that the difference you are seeing is not likely due to random variation in your data.
