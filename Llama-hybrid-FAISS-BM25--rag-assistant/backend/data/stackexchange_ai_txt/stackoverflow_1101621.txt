What's the best way to organize worker processes in Rails?

I frequently have some code that should be run either on a schedule or as a background process with some parameters. The common element is that they are run outside the dispatch process, but need access to the Rails environment (and possibly the parameters passed in). What's a good way to organize this and why? If you like to use a particular plugin or gem, explain why you find it convenient--don't just list a plugin you use.
