In response to you showing and asking about the results of OLS models, in general, OLS is not appropriate for truncated data, as it will not adjust the estimates of the coefficients to take into account the effect of truncation, resulting in biased coefficients. It is similar to estimating a logistic regression using OLS. But just as with logistic regression, a linear model will sometimes fit just as well, or almost as well, as a non-linear model. (That's why there is something called a linear probability model that models continuous probability values between 0 and 1 using OLS and that is sometimes used by practitioners instead of logistic regression.) The fact that you obtained "appropriate" predicted values is simply due to your data allowing for a good linear approximation of the data generating process. You'll probably find good examples of modeling compositional data, but for reference, since you asked for general information and are using R, the censReg package allows for estimation of a censored regression model with both lower and upper limits of the dependent variable that can be any numbers, which is a generalization of the the standard Tobit model with a dependent variable left-censored at zero: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/censReg/vignettes/censReg.pdf The model will be estimated using Maximum Likelihood, as is usually done for censored/truncated/limited dependent variable models, not using OLS.
