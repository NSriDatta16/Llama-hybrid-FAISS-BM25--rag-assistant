If your outliers occur because of natural outliers in the distribution, then yes, your estimations will become more stable with more data. Let's say you're using a logistic regression, in a theoretical case where the outcome depends on an observed variable with some normally distributed noise. Outliers will come in the noise, and accidentally you hit a value in the noise that's three standard deviations outside of the normal distribution. Then this will have an effect on the estimated intercept and coefficient in your model, and this will be much stronger if you don't have much data. With more data, the effect of these accidents will average out. But this is a very theoretical case. If your outliers arise from something more weird, or something that you didn't include in the model but is actually structural, or maybe they are arbitrarily large, then more data might not be able to save your model.
