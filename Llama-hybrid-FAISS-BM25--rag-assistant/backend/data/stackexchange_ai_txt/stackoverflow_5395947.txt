How to get gvim to play nicely with Visual Studio 2010?

On my last job, they used Visual Studio 2005 (and occasionally Visual Studio 97), and for command line convenience I used vim for editing things like Mercurial version control configuration files like hgrc and .hgignore However my coworkers soon began to complain that vim would change the encoding of the files, and would cause a message to popup in Visual Studio telling them about the encoding difference. After that I stopped using vim and just ended up editing the files in Visual Studio. Are there any changes to vim's configuration I can make so that this does not occur? I'd use notepad to edit my files but it always puts that pesky .txt extension on the ends of my files. I'm also aware of solutions like Notepad++, but I just wondered if there was a solution for this in vim.
