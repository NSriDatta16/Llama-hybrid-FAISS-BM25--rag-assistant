The Problem ist that you set PostItNotes as the BaseClass instead of the Class itself. That means what you add to the stage is a Class that has only the logic and not the graphic elements. What you need to do is go back to the symbol in the library -> right click -> properties and change the BaseClass to flash.display.MovieClip (or in your case flash.display.Sprite if you don't need the Timeline) and set PostItNotes as the Class. EDIT: package { import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.events.MouseEvent; public class PostItNotes extends Sprite { public function PostItNotes() { super(); addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, onStartDrag); } protected function onStartDrag (event:MouseEvent):void { stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, onStopDrag); startDrag(false); } protected function onStopDrag (event:MouseEvent):void { stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, onStopDrag); stopDrag(); } } } I added the drag action to your PostItNotes class because I think this is where it belongs to as the drag really only concerns the post-it itself. You probably have to remove the drag code where you had it before. Do you need help on the creation of the new PostIt too?
