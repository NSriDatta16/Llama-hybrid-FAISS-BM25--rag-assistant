As described in other answers, Python is a good general-purpose programming language, whereas R has serious flaws as a programming language but has a richer set of data-analysis libraries. In recent years, Python has been catching up to R with the development of mature data-analysis libraries such as scikit-learn, whereas R is never going to be fixed. In practice, I use Python (actually, Hy ) for almost everything and only turn to R for relatively esoteric methods such as quantile regression (the implementation of which in Python's statsmodels appears to be broken). There are several ways to call R from Python; PypeR is one that's simple enough that I've gotten it to work in such hostile environments as a Windows server. Edit : I encourage anybody who would like to argue about this further to talk to the authors of the linked essay instead of commenting on this answer.
