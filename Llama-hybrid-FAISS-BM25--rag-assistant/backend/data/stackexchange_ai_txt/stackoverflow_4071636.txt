Limit character number in input

Is there a function to limit the number of characters a user can enter in the CLI to read in a variable? I can limit the amount of characters a value can storage, so if i put string[4] and i enter abcdef , the variable stores just abcd . I need to limit the number of characters a user can write. How can this be done? This should be in standard Pascal, not Delphi.
