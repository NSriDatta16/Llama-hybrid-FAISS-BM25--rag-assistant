Are PCA solutions unique?

When I run PCA on a certain data set, is the solution given to me unique? I.e., I obtain a set of 2d coordinates, based on interpoint distances. Is it possible to find at least one more arrangement of the points that would meet these constraints? If the answer is yes, how can I find such different solution?
