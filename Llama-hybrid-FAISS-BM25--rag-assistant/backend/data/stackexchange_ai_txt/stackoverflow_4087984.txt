jQuery to Find/Replace html text when not inside an html tag other than P, DIV, SPAN, TD

I have an html text fragment that's part of the page's DOM that I need to run a find/replace on and I need some help figuring out the best way to create the find/replace function. For example, I would like to take the contents of the dom object whose id="content" and run a find replace using a target search phrase. I need the function to replace each instance of the phrase it finds in the content with " The Phrase ", providing that the phrase does not appear inside of any tag other than a div, p, span or td tag, and return the replaced xhtml text. Can I do this with jQuery dom traversal along with some replace method?
