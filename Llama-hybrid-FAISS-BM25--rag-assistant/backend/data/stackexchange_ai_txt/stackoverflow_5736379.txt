Working with complex numbers in real time with GNU Radio

I need to work with data received from the USRP (using the gr-sounder to be specific), and I'm not exactly sure how I would do that. Are there any python packages I can use to work with the data, and more specifically, how would I use them. To be more specific, I need to calculate the error between vectors in real time. e = |h1 - h2| ^ 2 where each h is an impulse response vector. Also, a plot of the incoming data would be great. Thanks Edit. Heres some more info. I'm working on a project to determine by how much a channel is changing by measuring the changes in the complex impulse response. I'm using GNU Radio sounder to measure the impulse response, and my plan is to take a simple moving average of the impulse response vectors over N periods, and then calculate the error between averages. So for instance, lets say h_avg1 is a vector which is the average of the first N impulse response vectors (which are periodic/repeating) (h1 + h2 + ... + hN) / N , and h_avg2 is a vector consisting of the average of the second N impulse response vectors. Using the above formula, I want to calculate the difference between the two averages. I dont really need to work with successive periods, so instead, I'm working with averages. GNU Radio sounder provides a list of complex numbers, which represents the impulse response vector. What I need to do is perform VECTOR addition, VECTOR division, VECTOR subraction, and VECTOR multiplication, given this list of complex numbers.
