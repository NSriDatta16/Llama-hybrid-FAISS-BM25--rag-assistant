First off, AVG(cijfer) is actually referencing nothing. You need to assign the AVG() to a variable like this: AVG(grade) AS avgrade Perhaps you could try a query like this: SELECT AVG(grade) as average FROM grades, class_id AS cid, (SELECT classname FROM classes WHERE id=cid) AS cname FROM grades ORDER BY date DESC GROUP BY cname; Hows that work out?
