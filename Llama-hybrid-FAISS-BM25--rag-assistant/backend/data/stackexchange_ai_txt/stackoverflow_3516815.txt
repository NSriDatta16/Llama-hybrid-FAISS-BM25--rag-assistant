If the solution from Merkyn Morgan-Graham does not work (see my comment, I'm not sure), I propose to create a independent object-structure that contains your directory-objects. Do this work with a BackgroundWorker . If it's finished, use this structure to build either the TreeViewItem-nodes directly (because this is not so slow if you have a few hundred of them) or use it as a ViewModel (better). BackgroundWorker bgWorker = new BackgroundWorker(); bgWorker.DoWork += (s, e) => { // Create here your hierarchy // return it via e.Result }; bgWorker.RunWorkerCompleted += (s, e) => { // Create here your TreeViewItems with the hierarchy from e.Result }; bgWorker.RunWorkerAsync();
