One reason not yet mentioned is that writing menus as lists helps search engines parse your site better. Top of the line search engines will be able to figure out nested divs and even tables (in some cases) but it's always better to make the crawler's job easier to avoid possible confusion. EDIT: Links as requested: http://blog.fryewiles.com/seo/03-04-2008/ul-titles-nesting-uls-for-better-seo http://importantseotips.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-using-div-is-better-than-table-seo.html http://webdev.entheosweb.com/2008/02/24/why-i-switched-to-a-tableless-design/ I actually couldn't find many articles specifically addressing ul tags for SEO, so I will have to qualify my answer by declaring my opinion. I am of the opinion that using an unordered list to present menuing will assist crawlers in correctly parsing and indexing your site. Generally, well organized data (such as a list) lends itself to better and speedier crawlability. Organizing your data well will significantly improve the likelihood of a bot correctly finding your keywords, and ranking your site. (Now if only my opinion on the subject were as valuable as Larry Page's. ;-) )
