Difference between a SVM and a perceptron

I am a bit confused with the difference between an SVM and a perceptron. Let me try to summarize my understanding here, and please feel free to correct where I am wrong and fill in what I have missed. The Perceptron does not try to optimize the separation "distance". As long as it finds a hyperplane that separates the two sets, it is good. SVM on the other hand tries to maximize the "support vector", i.e., the distance between two closest opposite sample points. The SVM typically tries to use a "kernel function" to project the sample points to high dimension space to make them linearly separable, while the perceptron assumes the sample points are linearly separable.
