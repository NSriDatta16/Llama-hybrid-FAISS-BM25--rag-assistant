average length of stay in hospital calculation

I need to calculate the average LOS (Length Of Stay) over 15 years. My formula is the following: total number of days in hospital (for each patient) / total number of patients discharged Because I need to express this average per patient/year I was thinking to do the following: {total number of days in hospital (for each patient)/total number of patients discharged}/15 Is this correct? Thanks for your help in advance
