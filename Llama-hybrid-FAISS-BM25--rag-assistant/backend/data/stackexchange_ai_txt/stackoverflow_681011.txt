Getting the number of packets in a pcap capture file?

I need a program which prints the number of packets in a capture file which uses the pcap format . This number does not seem available in the pcap header (probably because it is written before the capture starts) and it does not seem there is a "footer" in the file, with this information. So, I believe the only algorithm is to loop over all the packets and sum them. It is in O(N) and, for large traces, quite long. I post here to see if someone has a cleverer idea? I tagged with "C" because it is the language I currently use but I believe it is a language-independant issue.
