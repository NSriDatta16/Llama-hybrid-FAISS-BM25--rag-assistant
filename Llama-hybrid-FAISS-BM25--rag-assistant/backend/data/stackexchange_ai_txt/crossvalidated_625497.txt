I ran into a problem as this recently. It is possible that there is some innate order in your dataset, e.g. time series, or rows are sorted by a certain column. When you do train-test split, the dataset is shuffled by default. However, cross_validate do not shuffle dataset by default. To avoid the problem, you can use shufflesplit when generating cross validation data splits. cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=0.25, random_state=0) cv_results = cross_validate(model, data, target, cv=cv) or any other way to explicitly tell cross_validate to shuffle dataset before split, e.g. use K-Folds cross-validator and pass shuffle=True.
