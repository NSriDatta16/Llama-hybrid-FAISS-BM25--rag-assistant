Just want to illustrate a simple way to look at part (a) without going through all the Markov chain routine. There are two classes of states to worry about: being one step away and being two steps away (C and D are identical in terms of expected steps until reaching A, and B and E are identical). Let "$S_B$" represent the number of steps it takes from vertex $B$ and so on. $E(S_C) = 1+\frac12[E(S_B)+E(S_D)] = 1+ \frac12[E(S_B)+E(S_C)]$ Similarly write an equation for the expectation for $E(S_B)$. Substitute the second into the first (and for convenience write $c$ for $E(S_C)$) and you get a solution for $c$ in a couple of lines.
