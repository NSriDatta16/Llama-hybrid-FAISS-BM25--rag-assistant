Symbian C++ - Persistent storage of a single variable

I wish to store a single variable in my application that will be saved between runs. This will be a version number that will be used to trigger an update option and so will change only rarely. Does anyone have suggestions on the best way of implementing this? Considering it's such a simple requirement I am interested in the simplest solution. Thanks!
