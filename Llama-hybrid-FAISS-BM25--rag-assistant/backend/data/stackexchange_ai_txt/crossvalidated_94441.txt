How to interpret insignificant categorical variables for logistic regression

I am trying to interpret categorical variables with more than two classes. Some are significant whilst other classes are not. What can I infer from the insignificant ones? Does this mean the insignificant ones and the reference category equally influence the dependent variable? For example: ETHNICITY (Reference Category - Indian) Other Asian: Sig = .273 exp(b) = 1.123 African: Sig = .000 exp(b) = .148
