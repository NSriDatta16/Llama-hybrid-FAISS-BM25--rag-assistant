Checking if a Magento product is a child of a configurable product

I have the following code to grab a list of Products $collection = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->getCollection(); $collection->addAttributeToSelect('name') ->addAttributeToFilter("category_ids", array('finset'=>$this->category_id)); foreach($collection as $product) { echo $product->getName(); } My question is, how can I NOT echo products that are 'simple' but belong to a parent 'configurable' product. (for example don't show "Red Shirt Medium" as it belongs to "Red Shirt") I have worked out that this association lives in ' catalog_product_super_link ' but I have only just started with Magento and unfortuantely don't know how to do the filtering :) Cheers guys, Chris.
