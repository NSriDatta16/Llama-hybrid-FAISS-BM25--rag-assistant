The answer by @SLi already explains very well what the cost function you have defined does. However, I thought I would add that the cost function is used to calculate the delta value from cv.glm , which is a measurement of the cross validation error. However, critically delta is the weighted average of the error of each fold given by the cost. We see this by inspecting the relevant bit of the code: for (i in seq_len(ms)) { j.out and the value returned by the function is: list(call = call, K = K, delta = as.numeric(c(CV, CV + cost.0)), seed = seed)
