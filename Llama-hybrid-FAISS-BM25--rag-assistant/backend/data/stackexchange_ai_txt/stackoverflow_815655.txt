iPhone SDK 3.0 beta 4 broken, Internal Error

Final Edit: This problem is solved, after I downgraded to SDK for iPhone 2.2, then deleted all the files in the Crash Logs in the Organizer window (then upgrade back to 3.0 beta 4). Apparently there were too many of Crash Logs associated with my iPhone (like 300+). Thanks you guys for insights! Original problem: After I update my iPhone SDK to the newest Beta 4 (released April 28th), Xcode completely crashes whenever I open it, leaving me this: alt text http://ivzhao.com/temp/sdkbroken.jpg Anybody have any idea what this Internal Error, NSCFString out of bounds businesses are? Now I can't even open the Xcode to do some normal, non-iPhone related programming. So frustrating. My guess is maybe it has something to do with my Device (in the Organizer window). So is there's anyway to delete my iPhone's profile in there (Ivan Zhao's iPhone) so I can start a new one. I try to uninstall/reinstall SDK but my old iPhone's profile remains. Edit: I copy pasted the error message in from Console (Application/Utility/Console). Now looks like something wrong with the external editor compatibility (I am using TextMate as my external text editor.) The problem now is that I can't even open Xcode->Preference to set the text editor back to Xcode's defult. Any ideas? 03/05/09 9:22:49 PM Xcode[2457] Error loading /Library/InputManagers/Edit in ODBEditor/Edit in ODBEditor.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Edit in ODBEditor: dlopen(/Library/InputManagers/Edit in ODBEditor/Edit in ODBEditor.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Edit in ODBEditor, 265): no suitable image found.
