Machine learning data leakage

I have a dataset with Information about a transaction that a customer made in the store. the target is Indication of whether fraud was committed in the transaction. One of my feature is SuspiciousWords_Score. The meaning of this feature is how many suspicious words appeared in the invoice of that transaction Suspicious words are determined by the number of times the word appeared in a fraudulent transaction in the last 2 years. Of course, for some of the records, words are counted that at that point in time the word that appeared in the invoice was not suspicious because the word did not appear in the invoices of transactions where there was fraud before that transaction, but since the pool of suspicious words was determined when the dataset was created, then this word is counted for that transaction. My question is - is this an data leakage or not?
