PHP allow img tags only

I need your assistence related php. In php, i want to allow html tags only, i tried php's built-in function strip_tags() but it's not giving me the output i need. For instance, in the following code strip_tags() allows img tags but along with text. $img = " This is a detailed paragraph about Fawaz and his mates. "; echo strip_tags($img , " "); What would be the proper way to just allow or any tag only from the function or variable. Any help 'd be appreciated. Thanks
