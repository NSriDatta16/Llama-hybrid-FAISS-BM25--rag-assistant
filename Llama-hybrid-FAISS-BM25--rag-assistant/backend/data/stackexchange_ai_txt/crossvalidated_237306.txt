If you have finite difference, you can also try hidden Markov Chain. I am not clear about your idea that a state space model will certainly be linear. We always define a state space model with the following format: $Y_t = X_t + e_t$, $e_t \sim N(0, 1)$ $X_t = X_{t-1} + a_t$, $a_t \sim N(0, 1)$ but another format: $Y_t = X_t + J_t\cdot e_t$, $e_t \sim N(0, 1)$ $X_t = X_{t-1} + K_t\cdot a_t$, $a_t \sim N(0, 1)$ where $J_t$ and $K_t$ are under the Markov Chain assumption, for example, $J_t$ could be 1 or 100, so it is non-linear. Well, not sure if this is what do you mean by 'a state space model will certainly be linear and time invariant'.
