"I have heard that its not easy to normalise a database even upto a third normal form." I think you have a hearing problem. One of being in the wrong auditorium. But then again, if say the opposite, then that will be "just another thing you've heard someone say". So I won't bother, except to encourage you to try and document yourself properly on the advantages of normalizing (such as, e.g. "redundancy-free databases", meaning there is no way for the database to contain contradictory data), and the alleged (mostly false) disadvantages (such as, e.g., "loss of performance"), and then do some critical thinking for yourself. It's not like such good documentation is not available, the issue having been debated about for decades already.
