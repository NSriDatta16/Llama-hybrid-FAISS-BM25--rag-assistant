Bayesian network on non-normal data

I have a dataset of continuous non-normal data (values are scores from 0 to ~1.9), I'm reading the bnlearn to see how analyzed this data but I'm not sure how to deal as the data follows a non-normal pattern. I'm thinking about about discretizing data in three categories (low score, intermediate score, high score), for some variables I cannot discretize in 3, just 2. Is this a good way to deal with non-normal data? Or is there a better way to deal with this? Thanks.
