In your method, you would build a model which maps the input features (ad type, customer descriptors) to the output (purchase made = 0/1). You can use a model such as a logistic regression, or a decision tree (which can model the interaction effects between the ad type and the customer descriptors.) This seems to be reasonable and is one of the approaches commonly used for ad selection. A few other options based on customer similarity: Near-neighbour based approach: Based on the customer descriptors, identify similar neighbours of the current customer. Compute the probability of conversion for each ad type for all the neighbours put together, and pick the ad type which has the highest probability of conversion. Cluster based approach: Form clusters of customers based on the customer descriptors. Map the current customer into one of the clusters, and pick the ad type which maximizes conversion probability for that cluster. With respect to designing a system of ad selection using such a model, it is also important for the system to explore new regions of the space, so some small randomization of predictions will help here.
