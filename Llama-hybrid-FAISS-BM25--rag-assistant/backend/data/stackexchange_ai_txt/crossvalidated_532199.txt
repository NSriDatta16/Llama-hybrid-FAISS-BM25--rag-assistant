Basic question but what is the best way to compare averages?

Fairly basic math question so apolgies.. say i have the following clusters, i calculate the avrage across all clusters so it's 363.33(100+450+540), would it then make sense to do the calculation 100-avg, 450-avg, 540-avg to see how above or below each segment is above average? Just wondering what best way is to compare the spend. Is it not e.g. row 2 did 450-363.33 better than average, does such a statement make sense. Should i divide by standard deviation of the column and compare the z scores?
