Standard containers are untyped: you can store any value in a list or mapping, and use almost any value as a key in a mapping. Java has untyped containers, too, but usually people enforce static type checking by using generics. You can implement interface of a container (not explicitly, you just define a set of methods with right names) and your class will work as a container. You may do what you please, including type checking, having default values, efficient storage, etc. Lists (arrays) in Python have rich subscript semantics, e.g. you can get one- and multi-dimensional slices using simple expressions. Both built-in and third-party special containers (e.g. from numpy ) use it to great effect.
