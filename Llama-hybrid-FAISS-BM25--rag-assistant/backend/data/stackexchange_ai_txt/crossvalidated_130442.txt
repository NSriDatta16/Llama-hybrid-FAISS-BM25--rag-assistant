The relationship between confidence and accuracy might potentially be investigated by considering them as a multivariate response; that it, you could analyze the conditional correlation between the two, conditional on some set of predictors. The difficulty with that is that accuracy is a proportion while confidence is a Likert-scale item, makes the usual multivariate analysis tricky. It might be possible to deal with the Likert item as a multinomial logit and deal with some multivariate binomial relating those with the accuracy variable. Another possibility might be to look at partial least squares type models (but again, even if you treat the Likert item as interval, there's the problem of the binomial accuracy); yet another possibility is some Bayesian graphical model.
