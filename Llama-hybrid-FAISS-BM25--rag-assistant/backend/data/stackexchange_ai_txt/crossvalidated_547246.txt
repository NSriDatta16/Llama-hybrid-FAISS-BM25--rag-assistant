Is kurtosis and skewness subadditive?

I would like to ask a question regarding the subadditivity of high-order statistics such as Kurtosis and Skewness. Here Kurtosis refers to actual Kurtosis instead of excess Kurtosis. Are they sub-additiveï¼Œ i.e. A is denoted as one financial asset's return time series, and B is denoted as that of another asset. A+B means the portfolio of A and B at any possible combinations. So the question asks whether the (empirical sample) Kurtosis of a portfolio is smaller or equal to the summation of Kurtosis of each individual asset. Kurt (A+B) Is that the case?
