For some initial hints, consider a logistic regression in a non-Bayesian context. If the true $B_0$ in some situation were $0$, what would the probability of success be when all $X$ variables were $0$? Note that $B_0$ is on the logit scale, so you have to convert this into a probability. Now, if your prior for $B_0$ were centered on $0$, that implies that in some sense (n.b., there are different positions on what Bayesian priors are supposed to mean) you believe the true value of $B_0=0$ (or at least did, before seeing your data). The width of a prior represents your certainty about your prior belief, with wider priors implying greater uncertainty. The posterior can be understood (very loosely) as a weighted average of your prior and what your data tell you, with the weights being proportional to the width of your prior. So the result / mean of your posterior for $B_0$ will be partway between $0$ and what the data suggest, being closer to $0$ the narrower your prior and closer to what the data suggest the wider your prior.
