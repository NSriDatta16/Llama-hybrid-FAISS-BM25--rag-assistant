AIR application can save and load files to/from local filesystem. Use File class to save what you have downloaded. Keep the list of records in local SQLite database or in XML files, whatever is best for you. You can search XML easily with XML selectors, if your list is not very big, this may be enough. Store images in File.applicationStorageDirectory. When they are needed, check the list first, if image is not there, load from internet.
