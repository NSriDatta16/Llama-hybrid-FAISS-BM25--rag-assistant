Rails keeps changing my string "?" into "%3F"

Basicaly I just want to insert this + "?direction=desc" in helper method. But once it parses it comes out like this.. /organizations/search?order_by=contactable%3Fdirection%3Ddesc Anyone know a way around this? My Helper Method: def search_sort(name, sort_by, order = 'asc') link_to(name, url_for(:overwrite_params => { :order_by => sort_by + "?direction=desc" :page => nil }), :class => 'selected save_pushstate') ... I know what you're thinking. Just add :order into it. The problem being is that I 'm using an AJAX history saver from #175 of railscasts. $(".save_pushstate").live("click", function() { $.setFragment({"order_by" : $.queryString($(this).attr('href')).order_by}); //$.setFragment({"direction" : $.queryString($(this).attr('href')).direction}); return false; }); And it rewrites my url to just one "fragment". I can't have two! So I decided that if I can just add the direction param in the href hard-coded, it could deal with this whole mess.
