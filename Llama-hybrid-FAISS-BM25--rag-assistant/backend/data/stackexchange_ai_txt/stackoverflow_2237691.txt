It depends. If the digital audio was generated synthetically (like by another function) and you can thus rely on the fact that, in one case, you'll get true digital silence (zeroed samples), then the solution is simply to test for the zeroed samples over the measurement window. Anything other than zero is not silence. I would guess, though, that you're dealing with real-world audio recorded from, say, a microphone. If this is the case, then measuring the energy in a time window and comparing it to a threshold indeed makes sense. The two parameters that you'll have to determine are: Threshold energy level Length of the time window If the threshold is too low, your false positive rate will be too high; background noise that is not a beep may be interpreted as a beep. Conversely, if your threshold is too high, your system could categorize a beep as noise. Luckily, if you're doing audio with a reasonably low background noise, your performance won't be very sensitive to this threshold. Longer window lengths will decrease these false positive/negative rates, thus making your system more robust, but system usability may suffer with overly long windows. For instance, automated phone systems classify keypresses to aid menu navigation. If they required the user to hold each key for three seconds at a time, the accuracy would improve but at the expense of almost all usability. I encourage you to NOT make a decision based solely on the one maximal sample as Paul suggested. Doing this completely undermines the resistance to false positives provided by the length of the sampling window.
