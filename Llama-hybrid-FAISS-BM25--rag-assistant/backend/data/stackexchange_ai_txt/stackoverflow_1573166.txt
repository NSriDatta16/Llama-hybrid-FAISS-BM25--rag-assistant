What is the typical workflow for development of a Zenoss ZenPack?

ZenPack development seems to involve the creation of a variety of persistent state. There are model classes which represent explicitly persistent state. There are skins which are associated with model objects. There are organizers and instances of persistent classes (data sources, graphs, etc). Considering that during development, many things are done wrong before they're done right, and considering that loading up a ZenPack that does things wrong has persistent consequences on the Zenoss instance it is loaded into and that these consequences are hard to undo, what is the usual approach for development of a ZenPack?
