Texture Image processing on the GPU?

I'm rendering a certain scene into a texture and then I need to process that image in some simple way. How I'm doing this now is to read the texture using glReadPixels() and then process it on the CPU. This is however too slow so I was thinking about moving the processing to the GPU. The simplest setup to do this I could think of is to display a simple white quad that takes up the entire viewport in an orthogonal projection and then write the image processing bit as a fragment shader. This will allow many instances of the processing to run in parallel as well as to access any pixel of the texture it requires for the processing. Is this a viable course of action? is it common to do things this way? Is there maybe a better way to do it?
