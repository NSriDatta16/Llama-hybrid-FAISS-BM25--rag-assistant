If your desires is to use Selenium then I can suggest instead use the TestPlan front-end instead of another language. In additional to a domain specific language it offers nice test case management. You can organize your tests into a nice hierarchy and it will execute all of them and report the results. It takes care of a lot of details of launching Selenium and smooths over many difficulties in the RC API.
