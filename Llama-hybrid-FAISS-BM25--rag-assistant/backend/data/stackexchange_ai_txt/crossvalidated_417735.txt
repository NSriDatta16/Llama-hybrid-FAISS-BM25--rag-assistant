I mean, you could compare feature selected SVM to non-feature selected naïve Bayes if you wanted to, I would just say the comparison wouldn't be truly fair to the naïve Bayes classifier. Same way you could decide to tune on of your algorithms but not another. It's probably not a great idea as you will be losing out on potentially better algorithms but you certainly could do it. You have to weight the cost/benefit computational time/effort vs. results.
