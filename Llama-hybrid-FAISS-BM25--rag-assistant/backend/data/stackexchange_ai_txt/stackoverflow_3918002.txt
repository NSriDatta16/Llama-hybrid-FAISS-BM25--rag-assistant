I ended up inelegantly solving my problem by adding a code-behind file for my ResourceDictionary that contains the DataTemplate. I wasn't aware that this was possible, but found this explanation: Is it possible to set code behind a resource dictionary in WPF for event handling? Instead of using the EventTrigger to begin a Storyboard that hides the edit controls I added a Click handler to the code-behind. It's a bit kludgy as I have to locate the panels relative to the button clicked as that is the only reference available, but it works. Still looking for a better solution if anyone has one.
