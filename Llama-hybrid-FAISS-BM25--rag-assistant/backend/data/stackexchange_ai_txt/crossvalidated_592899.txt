Excludding outliers is used in setting PAT Limits (PART AVERAGE TESTING) for automotive testing. We want to throw the outlier away (Fail it) when calculating the Upper and Lower PAT limits. The outlier would be logged as a failure and Binned as such. Yes outliers are interesting, but not always necessary to keep in a distribution. I have not determined how to do this. in Excel yet.
