The more you get into building sites, the better off you are using a framework. Everyone starts off pretty much the same, straight up html, css, javascript, php and all from scratch in a small directory structure. Personally, I would never go back to building sites without a framework because without one, you are required to re-write the wheel every time. A framework takes care of a lot of redundant work for you, allowing you to focus on the specifics of the site and new functionality not yet built. That being said, not using a framework isn't horrible either (for small sites). A small five page site with no data storage, form submission or heavy back-end use, really doesn't need a php framework behind it.
