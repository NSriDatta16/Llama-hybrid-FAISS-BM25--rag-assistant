Python: urlopen not downloading the entire site

Greetings, I have done: import urllib site = urllib.urlopen('http://www.weather.com/weather/today/Temple+TX+76504') site_data = site.read() site.close() but it doesn't compare to viewing the source when loaded in firefox. I suspected the user agent and did this: class AppURLopener(urllib.FancyURLopener): version = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; zh-CN; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.8" urllib._urlopener = AppURLopener() and downloaded it, but it still doesn't download the whole website. Can someone please help me do user agent switching, if that is the likely culprit? Thanks, Narnie
