Python: how to do basic data manipulation like in R?

I have been working with R for several years. R is very strong in data manipulation. I'm learning python and I would like to know how to manipulate data using python. Basically my data sets are organized as data frames (e.g excel sheet). I would like to know (by example) how this kind of basic data manipulation task can be done using python? 1. Read csv file like the following var1, var2, var3 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9 2. Subset data where var2 in ('5', '8') 3. Make a new variable --> var4 = var3 * 3 4. Transpose this data 5. Write to csv file Your help and example is most appreciated!
