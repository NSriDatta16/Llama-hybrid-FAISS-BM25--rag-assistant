Use LightGBM or FFM - imbalanced dataset

I have a highly imabalanced dataset but one that is not sparse. In train there are 1328 positives out of 104000 . In validation and test set there are 400 positives out of 103000 Which algorithm should I experiment with: Boosting (LGBM/XGBoost) or FFM (field aware factorization machines)?
