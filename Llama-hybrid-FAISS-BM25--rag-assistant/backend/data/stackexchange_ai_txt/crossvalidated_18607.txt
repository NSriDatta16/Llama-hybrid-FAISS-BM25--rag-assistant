Function to convert arithmetic to log-based covariance matrix?

Is there a function in R that will take the mu and Sigma of an arithmetic-covariance matrix and return the mu and Sigma of a log-based covariance matrix? I have the code for a function implementing the reverse -- from log-covariance to linear covariance -- in R (pasted below in case this is helpful). Note that this code implement's Meucci's math on Appendix page 5 of the attached .: linreturn Simulation code validating the above approach: # Experiment with two assets # initialize with average log returns and log-based covariance matrix m1 Alternatively, is there a function in MATLAB that performs the procedure? (I could analyze the open-source and port this to R.) Thanks
