Average absolute value from one reading to the next is potentially a very good measure of volatility. You might consider whether a 1 second interval is optimal, vs. computing successive changes after averaging over, say, 3s intervals. Other useful summaries might include the maximum acceleration over a long time period, and the 0.9 quantile of the 0-100 acceleration measurements. But it would be nice to have data on break usage, depending on what your real unstated goal is.
