Additivity of sample (rather than population) variances

I'm trying to use the fact that variances are additive to derive the variance of an unknown random variable. Say that A and B are both independent normally distributed random variables. A third variable C is the sum of A and B ( C = A + B ). Since A and B are independent and variances are additive, var(C) = var(A) + var(B) . Let's say that I know var(C) and var(B) , but not var(A) ( A is latent while C and B are known). I want to derive var(A) . With some rearrangement of the above, we have var(A) = var(C) - var(B) . This seems straightforward to me, however putting this into practice has given me a bit of trouble. Let's say a , b , and c are samples from A , B , and C , respectively. Given finite sample sizes, there are scenarios where var(b) is greater than var(c) (when the sample size is quite small), just by chance (giving negative values for var(a) , which is, of course, nonsensical). Here is a simulated dataset (in R) that illustrates this case (where a derived var(a) is negative). #set simulation parameters set.seed(15) #sample size n sigma_b sigma_c sigma_b #true sigma_a sigma_a_true It's now clear to me that you can't apply the additive variance principle to sample variances in this way. Is there any way of incorporating the fact that these are sample (and not population) variances when trying to derive either var(A) (population variance) or var(a) (sample variance)? In other words, can I get an estimate of var(A) or var(a) with some uncertainty (either analytically or through simulation)? Is there a sampling distribution for var(A) in terms of var(C) and var(B) ? To put this into context, let's say I have one realization of a, b, and c (a single sample from each). My principal goal is to get some estimate of var(a) (with uncertainty), given var(c) and var(b), to use as a prior for the variance in a Bayesian framework (of course, understanding the issues associated with using data to set priors). I thought that perhaps I could use the fact that $\frac{(n-1)}{S^2} \sigma^2 \sim \chi_{n-1}^{2}$ (where $\sigma^2$ is the sample variance, $S^2$ is the population variance, and $n$ is the sample size) to get at this using simulation, but still can't seem to fix issues with negative values when the sample size is small (as in the above N = 15 example). Any thoughts greatly appreciated. EDIT : Fixed error in equation in last paragraph; added clarification on goals
