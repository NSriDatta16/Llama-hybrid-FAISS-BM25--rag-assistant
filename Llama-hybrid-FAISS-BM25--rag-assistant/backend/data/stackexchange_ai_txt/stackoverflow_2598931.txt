The quick answer to your question is Yes. There is a decent'ish drag drop xaml design part to VS2010. However I would strongly recommend you look at Blend when doing UI work. RIA to me often means that the applications experience is "Rich", and Blend makes a lot of things trivial compared to VS. Plus it's part of most MSDN subscriptions these days, so cost is less of an issue.
