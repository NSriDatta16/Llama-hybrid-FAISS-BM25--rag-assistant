How to test if occurrence distributions are equal with dependent variables

Description of the experiment Each experiment is a performance done by an artist/athlete, and these are independent. I have $k=4$ judges labelled $J\in \{1,2,3,4\}$ that can classify a performance into one of $m=5$ categories labelled $C=\{Elegant, Powerful, Graceful, Technical, Instinctive\}$ . Observing $N=200$ experiments we get the following table 1 2 3 4 Elegant 12 10 8 7 Powerful 27 28 27 28 Graceful 46 39 37 43 Technical 23 44 31 38 Instinctive 92 79 97 84 I want to test if the distribution that each judge assignes to a performance is the same. Although the performances are independent, the evaluations of the judges are not, judge $1$ might find $Powerful$ the same features of the performance that judge $2$ might find $Technical$ , so performances that the first one classifies as $Powerful$ the second one will classify them as $Technical$ . I think my hypothesis would be: $H_0$ : The judges do not follow a distribution to classify the performances. $H_a$ : All the judges (or pairwise) follow the same distribution. Question: What test should I use? I'm completely lost in what kind of test should I use as observations are correlated. If it is a Chi Square test, do I have my hypothesis inverted? What would the degrees of freedom be?.
