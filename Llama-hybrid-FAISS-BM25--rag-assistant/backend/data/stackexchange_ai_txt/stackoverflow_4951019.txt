Android sdk, Apart from saving image in sd card, are there any places i can save the photo to?

I have read alot of references from the web about android storage for images. Most of them were saying Images are stored insided sd card same as photos that was taken with camera. Does android allow us to store them in local memory in the android phone rather than sd cards?
