I have some comments for each question. Question 1: You say that you will begin coding level 1, 2, .. one by one. I recommend you to create a reusable framework instead or see it in the big picture instead. For the information you provide I think you are going to make some kind of RPG game. There are lots of things that can be shared between levels such as the Shop, the dialog system, for example. So focus for extensibility. Why wait for designers to pass on the image? You can begin your coding by starting with pseudo graphics file you created yourself. You can then work with designer in parallel this way. And you can replace your pseudo graphics file with ones provided by designer later. Question 2: JPG is not suitable for pixel-art style image, that appears a lot in most 2D game. And the GIF support only 256 color. The best choice to me seems to be PNG. The designer should always keep the original artworks in editable format as well. It's likely that you want to change the graphics in the future. Question 3: It depends. The format mentioned, where character's animations are kept in single file, is called Sprite . If you kept your resource in this sprite format than you will have some works reading each of the sub-image by specifying coordinates. However, sprite helps you keep things organized. All the 2D graphics related to "Zombie" character is kept in one place. It is therefore easy to maintain.
