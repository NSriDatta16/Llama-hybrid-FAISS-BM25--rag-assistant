What is the most elegant and efficient way to provide AAA to web services using a WS gateway and LDAP?

I'm looking for the best way to provide authorization, authentication, and auditing to web services. I'll be using a web service gateway appliance deployed to the DMZ, and there will be an LDAP instance as a user store behind the firewall. How should it be built? Cheers KA Update As pointed out in an answer below, LDAP isn't ideal for auditing. We're now looking at a call to our CRM system for this function as we can audit the usage by customer.
