EasyEnsemble explaination

Could someone please explain how the EasyEnsemble algorithm works? Im using it for a prediction model for imbalanced minority class. Please don't refer me to this paper, as it makes no sense to me. EasyEnsemble and Feature Selection for Imbalance Data Sets Im using the algorithm in Pandas, with the UnbalancedDataset library which is on GitHub UnbalancedDataset I get an array of matrices as O/P, I don't know how to use this in the end, to train with random forests. Thanks
