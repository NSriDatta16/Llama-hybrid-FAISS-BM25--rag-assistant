You could use the built-in (well, if you have the memcached extension installed) Memcached Session Handler to store them in a session. Alternatively, you could write your own Session Save Handler to store it in a database or other memory storage (such as APC, etc). Or, you could use one of the many session implementations out there such as: Zend Session Pear Session 2 Code Igniter Sessions etc...
