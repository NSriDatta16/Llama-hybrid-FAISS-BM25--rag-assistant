Which repeated measure statistical test must I use in this case?

I have a set of general conditions A, B, C, D, E and F to solve a problem. Each of these conditions lead me to different number of experiments according to a parameter that i change in each general condition: condition A has 6 experiments condition B has 24 experiments condition C has 28 experiments condition D has 5 experiments condition E has 25 experiments condition F has 8 experiments Each experiment returns a 10-dimensional vector of accuracy used in a cross-validation machine learning approach. Now I want to compare the conditions in pairs: I want to know if its better to use condition A than B, condition C than D and Condition E than F. Which statistical test can I use in this case? My suspicion is a repeated-measure based statistical one.
