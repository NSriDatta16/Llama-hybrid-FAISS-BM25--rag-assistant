Embedding a DOS console in a windows form

Is it possible to embed a DOS console in a Windows Form or User Control in C# 2.0? We have a legacy DOS product that my Windows app has to interact with, and it's been requested that an instance of the legacy product should run within the Windows application. At the moment, I'm using the user32.dll to locate the window that the DOS product is running in, minimising then maximising the window, and typing characters into the window. This isn't a very good solution to the problem, as it means my application has to store the window name in application settings, and requires that the user returns to the correct page of the DOS app before using the interaction function. EDIT: Some more information The legacy app needs to be visible to the user, but not in a separate window. I've tried TimothyP's answer and it works very well, but is it possible to achieve the same functionality, but with the DOS window visually embedded in a windows form or user control instead of popping up in it's own window? Preferably in a ShowDialog() way so that the user cannot interact with the app wile they are in 'Legacy Mode', so to speak.
