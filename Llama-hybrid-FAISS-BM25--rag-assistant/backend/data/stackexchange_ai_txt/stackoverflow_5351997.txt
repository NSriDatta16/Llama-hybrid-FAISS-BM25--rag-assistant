You can embed fonts in your WP7 applications in the same way that you embed fonts for any Silverlight application as decribed in the Embedding fonts in Silvelright blog post by Paul Yanez. You simply check the Embed checkbox in the Text pane in Expression Blend. NOTE: You will need to make sure that you are licensed to use the font in this way or that it is free for use in this way.
