You can always think about your data as about a single set. In A/B testing it just happens that part of your dataset is related only to the method A and the other part is related only to the method B. I'd suggest to take a look at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Chapter2_MorePyMC/Ch2_MorePyMC_PyMC3.ipynb#Example:-Bayesian-A/B-testing
