Goodness of fit measure for GLM with log link and Gaussian error model

I have a GLM model with a Gaussian distribution and a log link and I would like to assess the goodness of fit. I tried to take the regular $R^2$ but that was not possible with my model. I then resorted to the McFadden pseudo $R^2$ , which is actually meant for logistic regressions. I would like to know if the McFadden pseudo $R^2$ is usable in my GLM as well? Or if not what would a goodness of fit measure be for GLM models with Gaussian distribution and a log link?
