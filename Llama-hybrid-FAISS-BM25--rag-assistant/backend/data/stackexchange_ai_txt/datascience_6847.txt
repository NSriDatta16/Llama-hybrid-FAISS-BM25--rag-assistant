Estimating destination according to previous data

I need an advice. I can resume my problem like that : I have some travels in a database, for example : Person1 travelled from CityA to CityB on Date1 Person1 travelled from CityB to CityC on Date2 Person2 travelled from CityB to CityD on Date3 ... We can consider that these cities are in the complete graph. Now, according to all the travels in the database, I would like to know where a PersonX is likely to go. I can know when he come from (or not). I don't know if I should use machine learning, data-mining or graph theory.
