Code Signing Identity does not match in my keychain, for mac app store developing?

1, I already download the "Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority",and add it into my keychain. 2, My team leader already had created two Cers for Mac App store developing, I download and add it into my keychain. 3, I used two methods to sign my add, but failed all. First, add code sign section in my .xcodeproj(3.2.5). Second, I used script: productbuild --component ./bin/MAS_Release/MyApp.app /Applications --sign "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: My Company Co., Ltd." --product ./src/MyApp/MyApp-Info.plist MyApp.pkg But it failed with information: Code Signing Identity '3rd Party Mac Developer Application: My Company Co., Ltd.' does not match any valid, non-expired, code-signing certificate in your keychain. I observed that my certifications in keychain don't have small trangle. how make the small trangle absence?(when I'am importing the Cers from my Agent, it don't have the trangle absence)
