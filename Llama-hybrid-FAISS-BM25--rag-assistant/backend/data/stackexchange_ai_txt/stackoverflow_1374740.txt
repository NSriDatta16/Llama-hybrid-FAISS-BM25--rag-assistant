Have a look at Max Kuhn's caret which is designed to support exactly this: Classification and Regression Training as per its title. It wraps around Random Forest as well as numerous other packages, and has ample documentation, including this JSS paper . Besides caret, you can of course just use the predict method on the model you get returned as this example from the help page suggests: data(iris) set.seed(111) ind Instead of a random sample using ind , just subset the data yourself into training and validation sets.
