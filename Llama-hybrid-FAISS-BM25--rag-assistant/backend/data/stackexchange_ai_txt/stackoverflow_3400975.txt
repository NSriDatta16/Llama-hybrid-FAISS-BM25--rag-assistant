Connect to web that requires user/password

I'm a bit new to Java and more to connections stuff with it. I'm trying to create a program to connect to a website ("www.buybackprofesional.com") where I would like to download pictures and get some text from cars (after the login you have to enter a plate number to access a car's file). This is what I have right now, but it always says that the session has expired, I need a way to login using the username and password of the mainpage, am I right? can someone give me some advice? Thanks Note: I want to do it in Java, maybe I was not clear in the question. //URL web = new URL("http://www.buybackprofesional.com/DetallePeri.asp?mat=9073FCV&fec=27/07/2010&tipo=C&modelo=4582&Foto=0"); URL web = new URL("http://www.buybackprofesional.com/"); HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) web.openConnection(); con.setRequestMethod("GET"); con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; JVM)"); con.setRequestProperty("Pragma", "no-cache"); con.connect(); BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream())); String line = null; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { System.out.println(line); } A colleage helped me with this so I'll post the code that works: public static URLConnection login(String _url, String _username, String _password) throws IOException, MalformedURLException { String data = URLEncoder.encode("Usuario", "UTF-8") + "=" + URLEncoder.encode(_username, "UTF-8"); data += "&" + URLEncoder.encode("Contrase", "UTF-8") + "=" + URLEncoder.encode(_password, "UTF-8"); // Send data URL url = new URL(_url); URLConnection conn = url.openConnection(); conn.setDoOutput(true); OutputStreamWriter wr = new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream()); wr.write(data); wr.flush(); wr.close(); return conn; } This will submit the form info on the page I need and after that, using cookies I can stay connected!
