Even if you only use a particular style once there are still benefits to keeping it with your other styles and not putting it inline. First, there is the separation of concerns that leads to improved maintainability. If you know you are going in to make only a style change, there is a single place to look for any changes. Another benefit is the self-documentation from having to type out the class name. By giving that style a name, even though it is used once, it makes the semantic code below more declarative -- you can read that not only is this random p a paragraph, it is also, say, the intro paragraph. This is, of course, assuming that you are never going to use that particular style again. If you might than there is even more reason to factor it out into a named style. Inline styles aren't evil, but they are somewhat of a gateway drug.
