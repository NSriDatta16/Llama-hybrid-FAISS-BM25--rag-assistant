How can the (Ensemble) Kalman filter be viewed as a MCMC algorithm?

I am struggling with quotes like The EnKF applies a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method ... ( 1 , p. 6) or In fact, the Kalman filter is a MCMC algorithm in the case of a linear and Gaussian state space model with known parameters. ( 2 , p. 5) I cannot find the construction of a Markov chain in the description of neither linear nor ensemble Kalman filter. Could anyone please clarify how this is meant? [1] Evensen, Geir. "The ensemble Kalman filter for combined state and parameter estimation." Control Systems, IEEE 29.3 (2009): 83-104. [2] Johannes, Michael, and Nicholas Polson.
