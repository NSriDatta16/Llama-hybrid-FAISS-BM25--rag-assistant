One solution is using the same technique that is used in sequence learning. In that technique we use from Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM module. we can train recurrent neural networks to learn very specific outputs for an arbitrary sequence of inputs, which is very powerful. To know more about this, you can follow this link .
