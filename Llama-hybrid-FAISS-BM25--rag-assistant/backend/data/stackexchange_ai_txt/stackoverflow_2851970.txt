To answer your main question: “How do I simulate a hover with a touch in touch enabled browsers?” Simply allow ‘clicking’ the element (by tapping the screen), and then trigger the hover event using JavaScript. var p = document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0]; p.onclick = function() { // Trigger the `hover` event on the paragraph p.onhover.call(p); }; This should work, as long as there’s a hover event on your device (even though it normally isn’t used). Update: I just tested this technique on my iPhone and it seems to work fine. Try it out here: http://jsfiddle.net/mathias/YS7ft/show/light/ If you want to use a ‘long touch’ to trigger hover instead, you can use the above code snippet as a starting point and have fun with timers and stuff ;)
