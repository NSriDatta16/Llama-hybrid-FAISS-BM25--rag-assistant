I'm currently trying to create a dummy (binary) variable to account for the fixed effects, but the dependent variable that I'm trying to calculate is also a dummy (binary variable). I am not sure whether you're referring to the policy variable or the country fixed effects, or both. The country "dummies" (plural) represent country fixed effects, while the year "dummies" (plural) represent year fixed effects. The treatment "dummy" (singular) should be one variable representing when treatment 'turns on' (i.e., switches from 0 to 1) in treated countries. In other words, HR equals 1 for treated countries and only in their post-treatment years, 0 otherwise. The equation you're considering allows for almost any treatment pattern. For example, the onset of treatment is allowed to start at different times in different countries; treatment is even allowed to reverse, meaning that the treatment variable may 'turn off' (i.e., switch from 1 back to 0) within countries after a brief exposure period. I would pay close attention to the treatment variation within countries over time. When trying to create the dummy variable one of my treatment groups is unaccounted for due to perfect multicollinearity. You didn't really show us "how" you coded the policy variable. Instead, all you've showed us is the equation you estimated in R. Let's first consider what you're estimating: $$ \text{GDP}_{it} = \delta\text{DH}_{it} + \alpha_i + \lambda_t + u_{it}, $$ where you observe $\text{GDP}$ in country $i$ in year $t$ . The parameters $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_t$ denote fixed effects for countries and years, respectively. The policy variable $\text{DH}_{it}$ is the primary variable of interest. It should equal 1 in only those country-year combinations where the policy is in effect, 0 otherwise. Now you indicated that software is dropping $\text{DH}_{it}$ , which shouldn't be the case assuming you observe countries before and after the policy and you acquired control group. I suspect the country fixed effects fully absorb your treatment variable, which suggests it's a time-invariant regressor. The country fixed effects already account for time-constant factors, which include a country's membership to the treatment group. Again, your treatment variable should switch from 0 to 1 in only those country-year pairs where the treatment in effect, 0 otherwise. On the other hand, assuming the policy goes into effect at the same time in all countries, then it's also possible that your treatment variable is being absorbed by the time fixed effects. This would happen in settings where all countries experience the same shock/exposure and in precisely the same year. I find this scenario less plausible, as you already indicated that you have a subset of countries never exposed to treatment. To avoid this issue, ensure $\text{DH}_{it}$ is equal to unity in treated countries and in their post-treatment periods, 0 otherwise. Note how "0 otherwise" means $\text{DH}_{it}$ is equal to 0 in the years before the policy in treated countries , and 0 in all years in control countries .
