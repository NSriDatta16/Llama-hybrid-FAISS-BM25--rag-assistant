storing Hudson build scripts in a git repo

I'm looking to version and backup the task configurations and scripts in hudson now that we have more than one person editing them and this seems like a great job for git. I'll bet someone already has a plugin or something that will do this automagically. If not then would it work and or be ellegant to just run git init in the hudson config dir?
