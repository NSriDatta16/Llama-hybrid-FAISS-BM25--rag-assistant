How to change Hash values?

I'd like to replace each value in a hash with value.some_method . For example, for given a simple hash: {"a" => "b", "c" => "d"}` every value should be .upcase d, so it looks like: {"a" => "B", "c" => "D"} I tried #collect and #map but always just get arrays back. Is there an elegant way to do this? UPDATE Damn, I forgot: The hash is in an instance variable which should not be changed. I need a new hash with the changed values, but would prefer not to define that variable explicitly and then loop over the hash filling it. Something like: new_hash = hash.magic{ ... }
