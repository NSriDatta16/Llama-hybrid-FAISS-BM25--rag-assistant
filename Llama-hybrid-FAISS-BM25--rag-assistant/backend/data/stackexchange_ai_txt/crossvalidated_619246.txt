The simple answer is that Prophet uses MAP because it is a Bayesian model. While one of the advantages of Bayesian models is that if you have some prior information, it can be included in a Bayesian model through the priors, though it is not the only scenario where we use Bayesian models. For example, the Why would someone use a Bayesian approach with a 'noninformative' improper prior instead of the classical approach? thread discusses when and why the Bayesian approach is used while there is no strong prior information. The long story short, it may be desirable because the results may be easier to interpret, it returns the uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box, it may be easier to estimate the parameters (returning some, not necessarily "good" result) , it allows for using priors, etc.
