You can program in .NET completely free with VS 2010 express and an open source database. I'd stick with whatever everyone in your team has the most experience in. If you have several man-years of .NET experience, I would not move because you lose all of that. You do not want your entire team "learning from scratch" when they are trying to build something for production. There is nobody there to guide the team across the vast asteroid field of gotchas and little quirks that each new programming language presents when you first start learning it. My advice, stick with .NET even if that means using the open source alternatives available to you. Also, if your project is going to grow into something that spans across multiple servers, etc... you may want to consider biting the bullet and buying commercial licenses. This way, you get support and you have someone to "blame" when (not if) things go wrong. Either way, there are plenty .NET open source and commercial solutions that can be used to ensure your project has the right level of cost associated with it, while still being able to leverage your team's existing skill set.
