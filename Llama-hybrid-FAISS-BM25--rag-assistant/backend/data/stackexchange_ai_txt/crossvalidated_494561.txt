If you've got count data, you need some sort of generalized linear model (GLM), typically either poisson or negative binomial, poisson being the more traditional for counts. If you've got zero inflation, your options are zero-inflated models. I've used both Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) and Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB). If your data is nested, then you'll need some sort of fixed effects to control for that. You may need a Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM), which is a specific instance of what is known as multilevel modeling. Using ZIP or ZINB with which seems to be possible, just treating the unit of aggregation (country) as a fixed effect. To add another opportunity to the mix, your data is also panel data (factors x time series). If so, you may want to use an interrupted time series or segmented regression approach. However, panel data analysis is its own thing.
