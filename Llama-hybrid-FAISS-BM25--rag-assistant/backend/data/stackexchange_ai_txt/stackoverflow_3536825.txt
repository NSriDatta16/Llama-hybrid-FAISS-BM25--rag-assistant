Interfaces in .Net

I would like to use the same code for copying files to an FTP server, and through USB. I've already written some code, which as of now uses functions from the System.IO namespace. To minimize code duplication, I've listed the functions which I need from the system.IO namespace, and I was thinking of designing an interface exposing similar functions, and then two classes, one for FTP file operations, and one for local ones. I have a few questions about Interfaces though: Could design my interface so that the File.* and Directory.* organisation be preserved (so that routines declared in the interface follow the same hierarchy than in the IO namespace)? Is there a way, for local operations, to just map functions from the IO namespace to the corresponding interface functions (writing something like Sub IO.File.Delete Implements IOInterface.File_Delete )? Can I declare something like Dim IOHandler As IOInterface , assuming that IOInterface is the name of my interface? Can I then write both IOHandler = New LocalIOHandler and IOHandler = New FTPIOHandler , assuming LocalIOHandler and FTPIOHandler are my two classes implementing the IOInterface ? Thanks! CFP.
