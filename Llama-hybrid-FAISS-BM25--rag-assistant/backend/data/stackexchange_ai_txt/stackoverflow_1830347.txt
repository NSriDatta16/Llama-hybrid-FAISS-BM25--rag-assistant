Quickest way to pass data to a popup window I created using window.open()?

I have javascript code to open a popup window using the window.open() function. I'd like to pass data from the parent window to that popup window and I can't seem to find an elegant or simple solution anywhere on google or SO, but it seems like there should be support for this built into JS. What's the easiest way to pass data to the popup window? Thanks in advance for all your help!
