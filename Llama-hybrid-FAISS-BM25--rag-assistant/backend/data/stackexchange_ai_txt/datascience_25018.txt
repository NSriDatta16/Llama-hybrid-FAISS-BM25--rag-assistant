As mentioned python's pandas library is good start. They have a lot of time series functionality, see e.g. the documentation here . You can load your data like so: import pandas as pd s = pd.read_csv("your_file.csv",header=None,index_col=0,names=['timestamp','value'],squeeze=True,parse_dates=[0]) This gives you a timeseries with the timestamps as index: s Out[1]: timestamp 2016-01-02 00:00:00 49.972332 2016-01-02 00:00:01 49.969006 2016-01-02 00:00:02 49.960003 2016-01-02 00:00:03 49.949001 2016-01-02 00:00:04 49.943005 Name: value, dtype: float64 s If your data is too big to process as a whole, you can iterate over chunks using the chunksize option in read_csv .
