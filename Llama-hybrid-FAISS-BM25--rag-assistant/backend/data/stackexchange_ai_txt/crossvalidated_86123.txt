Modelling a time series with the "optimal" combination of N proxy series

I have a time series T . I also a universe U of time series such that A , B , C ... Q are time series that belong to the universe U . My problem decomposes into the following sub tasks: Find a subset of N time series from universe U . Denote this subset S Find an optimal scaling (a scalar matrix) to be applied to each of the time series selected in S such that: i. a new optimal time series O is created from the combination of the time series in S ii. O closely "tracks" T - i.e. O is highly cointegrated with T I am thinking of implementing this in R. Can anyone please point me in the right direction of implementing tasks 1 and 2? Edit Note: T and the set of time series in U are all non-stationary.
