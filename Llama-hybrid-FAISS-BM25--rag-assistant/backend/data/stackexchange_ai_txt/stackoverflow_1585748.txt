Assuming that you mean the address indicated in the browser's address bar, I don't believe that it can. Setting document.location or window.location will automatically trigger a page reload, as far as I know. As olliej said, you can change the hash parameter (a.k.a. fragment identifier), which does not trigger a page reload.
