Which NLP library has the most mature Chinese language models?

I am trying to do some NLP on Simplified Chinese texts (needing to extract sentence structure and to do named entity recognition). I've used spaCy previously for English texts, but I see the notes on the Chinese models suggest they are a work in progress, and the NER extraction accuracy has been poor for the examples I've tried. Which NLP library has the most mature pre-built Chinese language models? Ideally Python based.
