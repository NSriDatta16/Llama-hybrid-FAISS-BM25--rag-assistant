Input to `.fit()` should have rank 4. Got array with shape: (31500, 784)

I am new to CNNs and am working on/using the MNIST dataset. After splitting the data to train and test sets, I needed to use 'ImageDataGenerator'. The code I used is the same code on the Keras API site. The shapes are as below: print(X_train.shape, X_test.shape ,y_train.shape ,y_test.shape) (31500, 784) (10500, 784) (31500,) (10500,) But I suddenly faced a ValueError. Here is my code below: import tensorflow as tf from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator datagen = ImageDataGenerator( featurewise_center=True, featurewise_std_normalization=True, rotation_range=20, width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True, validation_split=0.2) datagen.fit(X_train) The error: ValueError: Input to `.fit()` should have rank 4. Got array with shape: (31500, 784) How can I handle this error? Could anyone help?
