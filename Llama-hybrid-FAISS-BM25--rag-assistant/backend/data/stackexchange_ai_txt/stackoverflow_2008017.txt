jQuery is a great library for DOM manipulations, and centering it's API around selectors is one of the reasons why it's so popular today. The thing is, jQuery wouldn't be needed if the browsers DOM APIs were more consistent and easier to use. And I agree with Robert Harvey (commented above) that as an abstract layer over the DOM jQuery does a very capable job. But as I understand, you dislike jQuery plugin system and the jQuery UI, not the core library itself. Personally, I prefer a YUI style API for components and widgets, because at the higher abstraction level DOM elements become less important. I think the reason why jQuery UI authors chose this design is to make API more consistent with their main product, jQuery library. But I don't agree that this was a good decision.
