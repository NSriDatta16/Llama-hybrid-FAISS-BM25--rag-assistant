ARIMA: no trend, no seasonality, so what is there to forcast?

I am very new to this topic. From what I understand, time series prediction with ARIMA requires that the series be series. So there is no seasonality, and no trend. In my limited understanding, this means that there is only "non-systematic" data in the series. Which, again according to my limited understanding, is random. Given this, what is there to predict, considering we have only the random component of the time series left?
