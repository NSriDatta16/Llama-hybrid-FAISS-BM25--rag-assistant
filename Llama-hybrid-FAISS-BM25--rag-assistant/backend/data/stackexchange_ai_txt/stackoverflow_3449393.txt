Instead of using daemon.py, you may want to consider leveraging Ubuntu's Upstart system which provides an easy way to set up a respawning daemon. From the same link, it features: * Services may be respawned if they die unexpectedly * Supervision and respawning of daemons which separate from their parent process If you are using Ubuntu9.10 or later, take a look at /etc/init/cron.conf as an example. For earlier versions of Ubuntu, I believe the upstart scripts are located in /etc/event.d/. For an explanation of Upstart keywords, see here .
