Use abstraction if you have default methods (with accompanying code) for inheritors. Use interfaces if you just need to make sure that classes inheriting from this parent should implement all methods defined. Word of caution: use abstract classes and interfaces only if you intend to enforce structure and organization (usually with a team). There's a performance overhead.
