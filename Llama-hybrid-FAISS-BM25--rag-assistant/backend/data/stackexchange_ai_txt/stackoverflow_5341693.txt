Add an auto_increment column in Magento setup script without using SQL

Previously I asked how to ALTER TABLE in Magento setup script without using SQL . There, Ivan gave an excellent answer which I still refer to even now. However I have yet to discover how to use Varien_Db_Ddl_Table::addColumn() to specify an auto_increment column. I think it has something to do with an option called identity but so far have had no luck. Is this even possible or is that functionality incomplete?
