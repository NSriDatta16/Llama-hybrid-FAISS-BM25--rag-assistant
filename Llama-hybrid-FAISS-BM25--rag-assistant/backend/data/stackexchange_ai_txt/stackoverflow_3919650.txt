Are you absolutely certain that using RowNumber("NameOfOrganizationGroup") doesn't work? Click on the matrix, click the upper-left corner selection box to select the entire thing, then right-click on the selection border and get properties. Switch to the Groups tab and look at the names of the groups in the Rows section. That's what goes in the scope of the RowNumber() function. If you already know this and tried it, my apologiesâ€”I didn't mean to assume you didn't know. It's just not 100% clear from your question that this is not the solution.
