almost everything is covered by others .. i hope you don't need any toolboxes like optimizarion toolbox , neural network etc.. [ I didn't find these for python may be there are some .. i seriously doubt they might be better than Matlab ones..] if u don't need symbolic manipulation capability and are using windows python(x,y) is the way to go[they don't have much activity on their linux port (older versions are available)] (or need some minor symbolic manipulations use sympy , i think it comes with EPD and python(x,y) supersedes/integrates EPD) if you need symbolic capabilities sage is the way to go, IMHO sage stands up good with Matlab as well as Mathematica .. i'm also trying to make a switch ...(need for my engg projs) i hope it helps ..
