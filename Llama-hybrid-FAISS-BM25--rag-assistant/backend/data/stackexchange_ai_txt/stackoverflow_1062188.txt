Hudson has a set of plugins which you can use to extend its functionality to best suit to your requirements. One of this plugins is the Cobertura Plugin. Once you've installed it, in each of your project's configuration a new Post-Build action will appear with the title 'Publish Cobertura Coverage report'. With this configuration Hudson is able to build cobertura graphs from a generated report. It's up to you to make your builds generate that report. For this task, if you are using maven, plugins are available to add them to your reports. Hope it helps.
