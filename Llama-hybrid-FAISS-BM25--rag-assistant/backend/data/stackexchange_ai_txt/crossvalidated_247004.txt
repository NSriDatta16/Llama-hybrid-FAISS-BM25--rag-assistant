Statistical significance of difference between distances

I have over 3000 vectors on a two-dimensional grid, with an approximately uniform discrete distribution. Some pairs of vectors fulfil a certain condition. Note: the condition is only applicable to pairs of vectors, not to individual vectors. I have a list of about 1500 such pairs, let's call it group 1. Group 2 contains all other vector pairs. I want to find out if the distance between vectors in a pair in group 1 is significantly smaller the average distance between two vectors. How can I do that? Statistical test : Is the central limit theorem applicable to my case? That is, can I take means of samples of distances and use Student's t-test to compare means of samples that fulfil the condition with means of samples that don't fulfil the condition? Otherwise, what statistical test would be appropriate here? Sample size and the number of samples : I understand that there are two variables here, for each of the two groups I need to take n samples of the size m and take the average of each of the samples. Is there any principled way to choose n and m ? Should they be as large as possible? Or should they be as little as possible, as long as they show the statistical significance? Should they be the same for each of the two groups? Or should they be larger for group 2, which is contains many more vector pairs?
