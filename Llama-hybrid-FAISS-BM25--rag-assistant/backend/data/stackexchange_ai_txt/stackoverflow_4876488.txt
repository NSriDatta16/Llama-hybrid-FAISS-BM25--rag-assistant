Animation in OpenGL ES view freezes when UIScrollView is dragged on iPhone

I have an animated transparent OpenGL ES subview (a modification of Apple's template EAGLView class) which draws a rotating sphere. Just like Apple's example, CADisplayLink is used on devices where available. On the same screen, there is a UIScrollView containing UIButtons that can be selected. When the user scrolls the UIScrollView, the animation of my EAGLView freezes. This behavior is reproduced on iOS Simulator 4.2 and on iPhone OS 3.1.3 on an iPhone 2G device. Any ideas on what to do to prevent pause of the EAGLView, apart from coding my own scroll view?
