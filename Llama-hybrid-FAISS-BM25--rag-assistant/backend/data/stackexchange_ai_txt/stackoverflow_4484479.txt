jQuery UI Datepicker - allow only certain weekdays

I'm using jquery UI datepicker on a huge project and I realize now that I'll need to allow only certain weekdays on some areas. I read their documentation and didn't find anything about it.. I know that there are some datepickers scripts for jq which can do this but I don't want to use any additional script for this if it's possible. Anyone know any workaround for this? Maybe I'm misunderstood anything in their documentation? NOTE: example of desired behaviour: http://codeasp.net/blogs/raghav_khunger/microsoft-net/1088/jquery-datepicker-disable-specific-weekdays Thanks in advance for help, Cheers Pedro
