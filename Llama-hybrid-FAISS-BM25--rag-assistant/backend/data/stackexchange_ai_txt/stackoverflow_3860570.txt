How do I drag a web page onto a C# button in my app?

I know how to do drag and drop in C# when it comes to files. I can take a file off my desktop and drop it on my C# app (onto a button) and that works fine. However, if I have Firefox loaded, and I try to drag the web page link I am viewing and drop it onto my C# app, I am unable to do it (I get a circle with a slash through it). I can drag the link to my desktop first, drop it, then drag it to my app and that works fine. But I want to be able to drag it directly to my C# app button from the browser window. Anyone know how I can implement this? Thanks.
