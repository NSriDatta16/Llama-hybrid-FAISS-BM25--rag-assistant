php tool for generating css shorthand

I'm generating a dynamic CSS using PHP. I've got individual values looking like: $padding_top = 10; $padding_bottom = 10; $padding_left = 10; $padding_right = 10; Now, I would like to generate CSS shorthand for all css rules where shorthand notation is possible. So the above example should turn into: padding: 10px; I'm sure there must already be a library for this, but I couldn't find it, and before I start writing a hairy heap of conditional statements, I thought I'd give it a go here first.. Any suggestions as to how to most elegantly achieve this?
