PHP 5.2 is considered as not maintained anymore. So, in theory, there should be no new version of PHP 5.2 -- and no new version is planned. See the announcement of PHP 5.2.16 : This release marks the end of support for PHP 5.2 . All users of PHP 5.2 are encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3. Still, if a very severe / critical bug is detected, it is possible that some PHP code-developper might decide to release a new version, to fix that bug. That's what caused the release of PHP 5.2.17 , for instance. But this is not something that's supposed to happen ever again : critical bugs are not something you expect ;-)
