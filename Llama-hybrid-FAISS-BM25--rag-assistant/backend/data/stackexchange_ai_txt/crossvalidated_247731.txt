One possible response to your first question about measuring "skewness/kurtosis" would be to estimate a tail index. While there are several rigorous methods for this, e.g., Pickands or Hills methods, Gabaix proposes an easily implemented estimator based on log ranks and OLS here ... http://www.eco.uc3m.es/temp/jbes.2009.06157.pdf . Once you have this metric, then this wiki page on Tweedie distributions (the Examples section) provides a "lookup" table of extreme value distributions that would classify the fatness of the tails (based on the magnitude of the index) here ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedie_distribution . This should help with deeper insight into the behavior of your returns. However, a single month of returns, even high frequency returns, is not very much information, particularly wrt the stock market. There are many regularities, e.g., seasonalities over hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc., time periods, that simply won't be estimable, not to mention enabling analysis of important long range dependence structures. It would be much better to push for a significantly longer time series. What you haven't described for us is the objectives or purpose behind your analysis. This information should guide a decision as to the frequency of the returns. In its absence and in the abstract, not much can be said.
