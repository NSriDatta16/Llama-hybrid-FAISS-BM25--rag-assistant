message in empty to drag

I am working on drag and drop tool using jQuery UI's sortable widget. I'd like to add a message into an empty div where something can be dragged into, like: "drag here". I'd like to remove this message as soon as something is in that div. There will be times when the page loads with something already in that div, so it can't be only on action, but onload needs to check it too. How do I go about it? Here's my code: $("#divFrom, #divTo").sortable({ connectWith: '.connectedSortable' }).disableSelection();
