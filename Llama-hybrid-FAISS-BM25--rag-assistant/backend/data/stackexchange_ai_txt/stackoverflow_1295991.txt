Reflections and other transformations with Java Polygons

I'm working on a project that requires me to do simple geometrical transformations : translation reflection over x and y axis On some figures drawn on a Java applet. The previous guy working on the applet was drawing the figures from arrays representing the caretesian points for the vertices of each figure. I decided to represent the figures as Polygons because it added some nicer organization to the code, I could use the arrays he was using to construct one, and also because I figured transformations would become easier. After finding Polygon didn't have any methods for reflection, I tried another route: I cast the Polygon as a Shape, then an Area, and then applied a AffineTransform that should have done what I wanted; unfortunately, Graphics doesn't have a method to draw Area objects, and I couldn't cast back into a shape. So, does anyone know of a way to do geometric reflection using Polygons? Or, is there some other means through which I could perform this?
