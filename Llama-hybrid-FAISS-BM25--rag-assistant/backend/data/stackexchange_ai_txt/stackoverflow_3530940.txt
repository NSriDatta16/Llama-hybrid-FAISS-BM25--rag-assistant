The problem is that the probabilities follow a logistic curve. You could fit a proper smoothing line if you change the birthday function to return the raw successes and failures instead of the probabilities. birthday Now, you'll have to add the points as a summary, and specify a logistic regression as the smoothing type. ggplot(x, aes(n, Dups)) + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") + stat_smooth(method = "glm", family = binomial)
