There is so much detail that you have not specified in your question that it is hard to recommend a specific approach. Certainly, the graphical approach outlined by @Sunil is a great way to start particularly if the data is continuous. Additionally, you could investigate some of the statistical tests for multicollinearity. For example, the Farrar â€“ Glauber test is a statistical test that may be useful to identify highly correlated attributes that may negatively impact some machine learning techniques. It is also equally important to realize that not all ML techniques are sensitive to multicollinearity.
