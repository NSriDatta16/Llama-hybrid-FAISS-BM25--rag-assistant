You can do: floor (log10 (abs (x))) + 1 Or if you want to save on cycles you could just do comparisons if(x This avoids any computationally expensive functions such as log or even multiplication or division. While it is inelegant this can be hidden by encapsulating it into a function. It isn't complex or difficult to maintain so I would not dismiss this approach on account of poor coding practice; I feel to do so would be throwing the baby out with the bath water.
