calling a sql stored procedure using the rows() method in grails?

I am working in a previously existing grails project that has some search functionality built into it. It has created a new Sql object using my SQL Server datasource, and it seems like it is attempting to call a stored procedure like so: def qResults = sql.rows(spCall) where spCall is a String and looks like this: EmployeeQueryClient 'SomeClient', 1,1,0 Where "EmployeeQueryClient is the name of the stored procedure, and the other things are the parameters. I can't find any documentation supporting this kind of call - is this correct? How would I really do this if it is not?
