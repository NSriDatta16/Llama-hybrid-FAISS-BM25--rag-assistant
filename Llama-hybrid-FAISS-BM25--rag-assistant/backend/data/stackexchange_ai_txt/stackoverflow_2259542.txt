Even if possible, I suspect Go is significantly slower than C or Objective C. Most independent benchmarks seem to suggest poor performance using the current development versions. These microbenchmarks against C suggest Go is 2 to 150 times slower than C. It is even slower than Java and C# Mono. So I see little reason to call Go a performant alternative. Although it depends on your application, I suspect leveraging the GPU api is the best bet for most performance problems.
