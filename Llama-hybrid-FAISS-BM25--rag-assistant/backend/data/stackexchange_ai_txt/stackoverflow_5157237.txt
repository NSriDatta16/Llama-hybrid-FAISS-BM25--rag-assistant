You must set a fixed size for your divs, so when the new one appears, it's constrained with the given side. I updated your JSFiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/WZCJu/16/ Have a look at how I constrain the size for your divs in the CSS. To improve layout, I took the liberty to add some styling to the submit button, so the HTML is a little bit modified too. If you have any trouble understanding my solution, ask some questions.
