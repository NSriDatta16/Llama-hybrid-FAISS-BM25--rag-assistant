VIM: how to replace a word

I guess, the problem is pretty common. Let's say, we have a source file and wish to replace some string with another string. Usually, I use the following command: :%s/test/testValue/gc But, what if the string is pretty long and we need just to touch it up? It is boring to type something like that: %s/someLongAndDirtyString/somelongAndDirtystring/gc Is it possible to place a cursor on someLongAndDirtyString word, press some magic key and get the following in the last line? %s/someLongAndDirtyString/someLongAndDirtyString/gc Then we may change the new string a bit and proceed with replacing. Sure, it is just an idea. Please, provide me with the best way of doing such replacements. Thanks
