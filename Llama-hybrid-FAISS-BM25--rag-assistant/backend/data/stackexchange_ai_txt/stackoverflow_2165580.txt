Beyond using the Google Webmaster tools for the Googlebot (see Robert Harvey 's answer), Yahoo! and Bing support the nonstandard Crawl-delay directive in robots.txt : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt#Nonstandard_extensions When push comes to shove, however, a misbehaving bot that's slamming your site will just have to be blocked at a higher level (e.g. load balancer, router, caching proxy, whatever is appropriate for your architecture).
