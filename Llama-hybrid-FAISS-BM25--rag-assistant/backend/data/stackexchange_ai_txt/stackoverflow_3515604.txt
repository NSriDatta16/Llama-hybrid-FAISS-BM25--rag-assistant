How to get local symbol coordinates from actionscript?

I have a symbol originally created at [-100,-100] coordinate (left top corner). Now I put an instance of this symbol on a stage at [0,0] stage coordinates (by dragging it with a mouse in IDE). Having this instance can I still determine original [-100,-100] position from actionscript somehow? ( myInstance.x returns stage coordinate). What I do: create a new symbol in a library located at -100,-100 coordinates during its creation put an instance of this symbol on the stage at some different coordinates in actionscript try to get original -100 value from instance object, like: this.myInstance.x (only this returns stage coordinates) Why I am doing this: I am trying to put this movieclip into a BitmapData: var myClip:MovieClip = this.myInstance; var bmp:BitmapData = new BitmapData(myClip.width, myClip.height); bmp.draw(myClip); The problem is BitmapData looks like taking only part of a clip that lies in positive coordinates. To overcome this I would need to provide transform matrix with corresponding offsets: var m:Matrix = new Matrix(); m.tx = 100; m.ty = 100; bmp.draw(myClip, m); I would be able to calculate this offset if I knew original symbol coordinates before it was dropped on a stage. Hopefully this makes sense.
