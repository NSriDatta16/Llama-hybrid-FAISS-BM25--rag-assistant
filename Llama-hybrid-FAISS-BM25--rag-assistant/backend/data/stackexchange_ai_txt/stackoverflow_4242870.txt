The same as the difference between an intranet and the internet. A private cloud is one set up for a specific group or organisation and usually isolated from the big bad world (behind firewalls and such). A public cloud is, well, public, out on the internet proper. For example, a certain big company I know does cloud computing but only using servers they control. It gives them the same benefits as public cloud computing but with more control and less security worries. They also do public cloud computing but they wouldn't be comfortable to allow control or access to their more precious data to be at the whim of anyone else.
