"Working folder's changing" feature for StarTeam folder's object

I need to reproduce partly a behavior of StarTeam 2005 client's dialog box "Folder Properties" in my tool based on StarTeam 2005 SDK. Unfortunately, when I has tried to implement "working folder's changing" feature I has confronted with some trouble. I has found read/write IStFolder object's properties DefaultPathFragment and AlternatePathFragment , but cann't to find any method/property what allows to switch between deafult/alternate paths' usage. Also, named properties' changes always stores locally only, never stores on server, even after update() method usage (as opposite to, e.g., Name property's changes) Can I to implement named functionality somehow?
