Invalid parent values in JAGS

I read through some other forums with the same error but have not yet been able to figure out my case. When I run the model: y I get the error: Error: Error in node gamma[2] Invalid parent values I thought the issue might be in my tau's, as other answers have involved either accidentally having 0 as a gamma parameter or landing negative values for variance in normal distributions, but I can't figure out the issue with mine. Any help is greatly appreciated, I'm not great with JAGS (or Bayesian methods in general). ***EDIT, updated the variance (or precision, technically) in the models and still get the error. ***EDIT 2, removed the loop and expanded, still get invalid parent error with beta[2].
