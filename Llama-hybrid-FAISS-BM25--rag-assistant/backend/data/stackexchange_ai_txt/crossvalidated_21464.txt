I'm not sure about the exact way to implement this with LIBSVM. Just one think that you should keep in mind, that before you implement the voting you have/might want to check whether this is beneficial for you ? In other words, you need to check whether your SVMs output is "different" enough so voting would be valuable. You can read more about voting in general and specifically about "Measures of Diversity" here: http://users.rowan.edu/~polikar/RESEARCH/PUBLICATIONS/csm06.pdf
