What exactly is building a statistical model?

What exactly is building a statistical model? These days as I am applying for research jobs or consulting jobs, the term "building a model" or "modelling" often comes up. The term sounds cool, but what are they referring to exactly? How do you build your model? I looked up predictive modelling , which includes k-nn and logistic regression.
