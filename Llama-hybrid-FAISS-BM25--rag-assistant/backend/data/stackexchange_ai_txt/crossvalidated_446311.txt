You say " ... that the classical ANOVA (and ANCOVA) experimental design techniques can be expressed as linear regression ... ". I think this is a confusion, fundamental experimental design concepts such as blocking, randomization, replication (and also treatment design concepts), have nothing to do with linear models in itself. This concepts are equally applicable when the analysis needs nonlinear models. It is maybe unfortunate that experimental design as a topic is confounded with some important models used for analyzing the results from the experiments. That being said, experimental design for non-linear models presents some new problems compared to the linear case. A presentation is this . In reality the problems mostly occur with the treatment design, that is, the choice of values for the covariables. With linear models this can be done without knowledge of the parameter values, for nonlinear models some knowledge of parameter values is indispensable. This leads to Bayesian ideas being useful .
