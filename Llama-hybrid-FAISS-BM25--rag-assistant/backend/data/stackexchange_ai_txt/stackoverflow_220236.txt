How to embed fonts in HTML?

I'm trying to figure out a decent solution (especially from the SEO side) for embedding fonts in web pages. So far I have seen the W3C solution , which doesn't even work on Firefox, and this pretty cool solution . The second solution is for titles only. Is there a solution available for full text? I'm tired of the standard fonts for web pages. Thanks!
