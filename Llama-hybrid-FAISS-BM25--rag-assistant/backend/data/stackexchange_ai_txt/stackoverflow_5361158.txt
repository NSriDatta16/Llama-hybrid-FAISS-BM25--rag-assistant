In general, it is not expected that a GET request has a body as it is meant to be a safe method only for information retrieval: In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested. So I guess Apache or the programming language/framework you are using skips/omits any entity header fields as it doesnâ€™t expect any containing entity.
