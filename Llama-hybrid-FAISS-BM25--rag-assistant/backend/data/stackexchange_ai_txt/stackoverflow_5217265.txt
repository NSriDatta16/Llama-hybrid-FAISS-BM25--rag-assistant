EDIT: You have to define it better for any machine learning algorithm to be applicable. For supervised learning, the algorithm tries to predict a "correct" label. What is a correct label here? What is the cost of misprediction? Alternatively, for unsupervised leaning, the algorithm tries to create useful subsets of the data. What is a good subset here? Are there any independent variables?
