ARIMA Modeling on specific time series

i have some time series example that i want to predict, lately i was applying ARIMA and Bayesian Forecasting method. But i really am interested in making a further best ARIMA Model (or just knowing some suggestion about the time series), so here is my time series data (it is as far only almost 2 years) data: purchase of Alpara Kapl medicine from Feb 2015 - Oct 2017 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 3 3 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 From these time series, i get best model of ARIMA is ARIMA(0,0,0) which is White Noise, but then there are other models (that is likely more redundant) from ARIMA(0,0,0) which is these (with the calue of AICc): ARIMA(2,0,2) with non-zero mean : Inf ARIMA(0,0,0) with non-zero mean : 97.09692 ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean : 98.46206 ARIMA(0,0,1) with non-zero mean : 98.42101 ARIMA(0,0,0) with zero mean : 104.5138 ARIMA(1,0,1) with non-zero mean : 100.3878 there is ARIMA(0,0,1) the best second model, but when using at forecasting, White Noise will give a flat forecasting (because its definition is not suitable for forecasting as i known so far), so is it a good way to implement ARIMA(0,0,1) for this reason? or maybe is there some other clue to define other model? any thoughts is welcomed thankyou :)
