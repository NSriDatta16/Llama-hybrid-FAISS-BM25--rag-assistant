I use the ASIHTTPRequest library to communicate with my webservice. It has built-in capability to handle cookies, so I simply login with a POST request and the cookie is set like a normal browser. When your network connection is down, you can still check for a valid cookie: - (BOOL) hasSignInCookie { NSArray *cookieJar = [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookies]; for( NSHTTPCookie *cookie in cookieJar) { if( [[cookie name] compare: @"JourneyTagID"] == NSOrderedSame) { return YES; } } return NO; }
