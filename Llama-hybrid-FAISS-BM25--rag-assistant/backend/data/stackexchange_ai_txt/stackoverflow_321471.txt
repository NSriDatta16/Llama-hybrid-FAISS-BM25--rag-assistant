Drag and Dropping an Object Reference VB.Net

I am trying to 'swap' two cells' contents, and their mappings. To do this, I need to drag and drop a reference to the cell as opposed to the string value itself. I can then use this reference to update a Dictionary as well as get the value. It allows allows me to do the swap as I will have a reference to the old cell to add the value needed in there. The problem I am having is I am not sure how to pass the cell reference: Private Sub DataGridView1_MouseDown(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles DataGridView1.MouseDown If e.Button = MouseButtons.Left Then DataGridView1.DoDragDrop(DataGridView1.CurrentCell, DragDropEffects.Copy) End If End Sub and in the drop event: Private Sub DataGridView1_DragDrop(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles DataGridView1.DragDrop 'Problem is here -->'Dim copyedFromCell As DataGridViewCell = DirectCast(e.Data(), DataGridViewCell)** Dim copyedFromKey As String = GetMappingForCell(copyedFromCell) Dim thisKey As String = GetMappingForCell(DataGridView1.CurrentCell) Dim copyedFromValue As String = copyedFromCell.Value Dim thisValue As String = DataGridView1.CurrentCell.Value mappings(copyedFromKey) = DataGridView1.CurrentCell mappings(thisKey) = copyedFromCell DataGridView1.CurrentCell.Value = copyedFromValue copyedFromCell.Value = thisValue End Sub Is what I am trying to do possible? Have I completely broken it? Thanks :)
