DragDropEffects.Scroll: why -2147483648 not 8?

A standard enumeration in System.Windows.Forms : [Flags] public enum DragDropEffects { Scroll = -2147483648, // // Summary: // The combination of the System.Windows.DragDropEffects.Copy, System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects.Link, // System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects.Move, and System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects.Scroll // effects. All = -2147483645, None = 0, Copy = 1, Move = 2, Link = 4, } Quite a strange value for Scroll, don't you think? As I understand these values all come from "the old times" of COM\OLE DROPEFFECT ... But why were they chosen so in the first place? Did author try to reserve the interval between 8 and 0x80000000 for something? Is it usefule somehow or is there an interesting story behind it or it's just another long-lived illustration of the YAGNI principle?
