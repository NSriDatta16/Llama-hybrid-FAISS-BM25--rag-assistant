How do you drag-and-drop from a TableView's icon to a stationary icon?

How do we go about coding drag-and-drop (or tap-and-drag) from a cell in a TableView on an iPhone? I'd like to have a set of drop destination icons that are stationary. I've been trying touchesBegan, touchesMoved and touchedEnded methods. These events fire nicely from a View so I can get a swipe to work nicely. Most likely the destination icons will be in a View so I think we are trying to get the drag-and-drop to begin in a TableView cell and end on an icon on a View that is beside the TableView.
