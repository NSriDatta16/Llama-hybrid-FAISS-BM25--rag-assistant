The Third Party page lists this Objective-C port . Unfortunately the project appears to be empty at the moment, but it's encouraging to see it anyway. I had heard internal rumours of the project, but hadn't seen it as an open source project before today. You could get in touch with the project owner (Cyrus Najmabadi) to ask about it though... (Small piece of trivia - Cyrus used to work on the C# team in Microsoft before he joined Google.)
