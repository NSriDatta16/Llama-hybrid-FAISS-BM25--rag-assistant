Using glTranslate and glRotate to move and rotate?

I am writing an application that draws a 2D triangle and rotates it around its z-axis depending on its position. Its middle (t1.tx, t1.ty) is constantly being changed when the triangle is dragged with the mouse. The problem is that when I drag the triangle to another location, instead of staying where its at and rotating, it rotates in a circle path around its center point. What I am doing wrong? I want it to rotate in its position. void drawTriangle() { glBegin(GL_POLYGON); glColor3f((float)200/255, (float)200/255, (float)200/255); glVertex2f(t1.tx, t1.ty + .2); // top point of triangle glVertex2f(t1.tx - .2, t1.ty - .2); // left point glVertex2f(t1.tx + .2, t1.ty - .2); // right point glEnd(); } void display() { glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT); glLoadIdentity(); glPushMatrix(); glTranslatef(t1.tx, t1.ty, 0); // move matrix to triangle's current center point glRotatef(theta, 0, 0, 1.0); // rotate on z-axis drawTriangle(); glPopMatrix(); glutPostRedisplay(); glutSwapBuffers(); }
