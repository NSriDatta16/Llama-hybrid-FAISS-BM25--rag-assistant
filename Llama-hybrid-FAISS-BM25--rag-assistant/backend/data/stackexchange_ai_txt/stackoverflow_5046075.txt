Unfixable mixed-revision working copy in SVN

I have a branch checkout that is clean (no modifications), but I cannot reintegrate the trunk back into my branch, because SVN thinks I have a mixed-revision working copy: c:\myproject> svnversion 2045:2047 The problem seems to be caused by one of my externals: c:\myproject> svn propget svn:externals tools -r1448 ^/tools/external/trunk/gandalf/bin gandalf/bin -r1508 ^/tools/external/trunk/gandalf/include gandalf/include -r1508 ^/tools/external/trunk/gandalf/lib gandalf/lib -r1428 ^/tools/external/trunk/jsdb jsdb -r2045 ^/tools/external/trunk/java/lib/jing.jar jing.jar You will note that all of them are directory externals rather than single-file externals, except for jing.jar, which is the same version as what "svnversion" thinks is the lowest range of my working copy, which is supposed to be a clean checkout of r2047. How do I fix this (besides not using the single-file external)? I've tried doing updates, fresh checkouts, and svn cleanup, and it still has this problem. I'm using TortoiseSVN 1.6.12
