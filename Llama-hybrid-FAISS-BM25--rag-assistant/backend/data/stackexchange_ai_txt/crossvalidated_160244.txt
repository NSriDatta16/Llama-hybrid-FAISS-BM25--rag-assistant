How to deal with a single Yearly spike with ARIMA?

I have a time series which shows an yearly spike around summer but otherwise is predictable by an AR(1) model. The tests on the data also show that the time series shows stationarity and is non-seasonal. How do I model the spike? (More details about the time series here: What does the following ACF curve mean ? (Picture attached) )
