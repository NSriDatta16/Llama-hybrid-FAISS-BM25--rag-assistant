How to perform a reggression on 3 functions using a Neural Network

I am currently building a neural network using Keras to perform a regression. I have 4 independent variables W,X,Y,Z . They are used to predict 3 different functions f1(W,X,Y,Z) , f2(W,X,Y,Z) , f3(W,X,Y,Z) . Should my output layer have 1 or 3 neurons? Also, should I be using a relu or linear activation function for the output layer? I'm currently using MSE for my loss function and adam for my optimizer. For my metrics, should I use 'accuracy' or 'r2'? Any suggestions? I'm sorry, I'm new to deep learning...
