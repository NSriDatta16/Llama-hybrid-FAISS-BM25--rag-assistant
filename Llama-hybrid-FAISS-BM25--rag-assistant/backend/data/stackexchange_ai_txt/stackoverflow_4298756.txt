This line: (progn (load "/home/adr/.emacs.d/elpa/slime-20100404/swank-loader.lisp" :verbose t) (funcall (read-from-string "swank-loader:init")) (funcall (read-from-string "swank:start-server") "/tmp/slime.4493" :coding-system "iso-latin-1-unix")) is Common Lisp, not Clojure, but since you set inferior-lisp-program to Clojure, slime can't start a swank server. See the following sections in swank-clojure project : Connecting with SLIME Embedding swank-clojure.el The functionality you want is probably in swank-clojure.el , but it is not recommended anymore. As you're already using ELPA: add-to-list 'package-archives '("technomancy" . "http://repo.technomancy.us/emacs/") t) M-x package-install ;(slime-repl) M-x slime-connect
