R studio SVM finding the optimal intercept given the coefficients of the hyperplane

I want to know how to obtain the optimal intercept using support vector machines. I have two classes of points normally distributed. I want to find the optimal c such that 2x1+x2=c separates the two classes of points. The way I have done it is by applying the classification 2x1+x2 to all of the points in my data set and then finding the optimal hyperplane using SVM (e1071). However, I don't get the hyperplane in the form 2x1+x2 (The coefficients are different but the hyperplane is optimal). Is there a way to input my own coefficients into R studio to obtain an optimal c(intercept)? In otherwords the value of c in wx=c that minimalizes the the classification error.
