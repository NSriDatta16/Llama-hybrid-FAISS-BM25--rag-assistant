Stepped wedge design to analyze healthcare intervention rolled out at different times to members?

I'm working on a pre/post analysis of longitudinal healthcare data where an intervention program was implemented on a member by member basis over a period of several years. Some eligible members received the intervention earlier while others received the intervention later in the study period. Rather than collect additional member-level data for a control group, which will likely be a very different population (with unmeasured confounders), could I instead estimate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) by gathering member-months who have not yet had the intervention at index time $t$ into an ad hoc control group, which will be matched to member-months who did receive the intervention at $t$ ? This would be a stepped wedge design clustered at the member-level, is that correct? I'm working with observational data, not a randomized controlled trial, but the same design principles should apply.
