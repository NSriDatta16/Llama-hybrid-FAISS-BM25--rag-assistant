What do you think of this interest point detection algorithm?

I've been trying to come up with an interest point detection algorithm and this is what I came up with: You go through the X and the Y axises 3n pixels at a time creating 3n x 3n squares. For the the n x n square in the middle of the 3n x 3n square (let's call it square Z), the R, G, and B values are averaged and rounded to preset values to limit the number of colors, and that is the color that square will be treated as. The same is done for the 8 surrounding n x n squares. After that, the color of square Z is compared to the surrounding squares, if it matches x out of the 8 surrounding squares where x 5 then that is an interest point (a corner is detected). And so on till all the image is covered. The bigger n is, the faster the image will be scanned and the the less accurate the detection is, and vice versa. This, supposedly, detects "literal corners", that is corners you can actually SEE on the image. What do you think of this algorithm? Is it efficient? Can it be used on a live video stream (say from the camera) on a hand-held device?
