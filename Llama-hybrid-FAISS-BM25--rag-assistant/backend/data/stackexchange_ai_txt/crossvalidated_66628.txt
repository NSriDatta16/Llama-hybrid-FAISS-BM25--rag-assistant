Usually the reasoning goes the other way, namely low reliability is a reason to look for additional items. High reliability does not in itself provide a compelling reason to remove items but it means you can do it without worrying about negative consequences. It doesn't mean that you “need” to do anything per se but it makes sense to point the high reliability out in this context. As @GottfriedHelms noted the main reason for doing this would be convenience/ease of administration, reducing the time needed to fill in the questionnaire and making it easier to integrate in longer survey instruments. In a typical scale building effort, you would generate many more items than you need so maybe they never intended to keep the longer scale. Obviously, it's a little odd not to mention this explicitly but it's still a very good reason. Note that PCA (and Cronbach $\alpha$, if that's what they use to estimate reliability) is generally not recommended for scale building. Results are often not too different but factor analysis makes more sense in principle.
