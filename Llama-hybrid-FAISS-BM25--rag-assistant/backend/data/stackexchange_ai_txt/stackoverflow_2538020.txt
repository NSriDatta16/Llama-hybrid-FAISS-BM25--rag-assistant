I know this is probably too late for you, but maybe will help someone else. I think you want to hook the BeforeCellActivate event of your grid. Here is a sample in VB.Net. Private Sub ugGrid_BeforeCellActivate(ByVal sender As Object, _ ByVal e As Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.CancelableCellEventArgs) _ Handles ugGrid.BeforeCellActivate 'find out if this is the column you are looking for, 'in this case I want Column with Key = "UnitNumber" 'also in this case, my Editor is a Masked Editor 'and I want to put in a customized mask Select Case e.Cell.Column.Key Case "UnitNumber" Dim maskedEdit As UltraMaskedEdit = _ DirectCast(e.Cell.EditorControl, UltraMaskedEdit) Dim newmask As String = GetRulesBasedMask( _ e.Cell.Row.ListObject, maskedEdit.InputMask) maskedEdit.InputMask = newmask End Select End Sub
