how to prevent a touch event passed to a UIView's superview?

I've made a program which contains pictures that can be dragged to move on the screen. also I used UIScrollView since the space is larger than the window. I subclassed UIView as a pictures view to display the picture and handle touches in this class. picture views are added as subviews to the scrollView. but now I have a problem: when I drag the picture, the scrollView moves together with the picture. I'm wondering if there is a way to consume the touches in the picture class to prevent them from passing to superview.
