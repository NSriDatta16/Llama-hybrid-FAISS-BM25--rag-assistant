Is there an English translation of Ladislaus Bortkiewicz’s book “The Law of Small Numbers" (1898)?

I finished reading Deaths by horsekick in the Prussian army – and other ‘Never Events’ in large organisations . It led me down a rabbit hole of thinking about Poisson point processes modelling demand on healthcare services that ended with: "I would like to read Bortkiewicz’s book". Unfortunately I don't see a reasonable quality English translation. Via a Reddit post I found this low-quality translation by Google Translate, but I would rather not read it.
