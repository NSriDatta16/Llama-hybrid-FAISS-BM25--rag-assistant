What does weighted cumulative frequency distribution mean?

I have two sets of data (temperature and catch) and I am following a proposed method in an article I am reading on the empirical cumulative function (ECDF) analysis. Firstly, I have derived the ECDF for my temperature data using the ecdf function in R. The second step was to get the catch-weighted cumulative distribution for temperature, which I honestly cannot understand the concept. $$ W(t)=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{y_i}{y}I_{\{x_i\}} $$ where $y_i$ is the catch for day $i$ ; $y$ mean is the average of catch for all days and $I_{\{x_i\}}$ is the indication function. How do I compute for this curve?
