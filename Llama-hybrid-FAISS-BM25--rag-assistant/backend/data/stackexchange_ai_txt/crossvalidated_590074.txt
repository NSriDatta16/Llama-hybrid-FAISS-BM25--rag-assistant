How to create a matrix with known number of signals for use in PCA testing

I'm looking for a way to create a matrix with a known number of signals and background error for use in PCA. The following example attempts this by combining signals of known amplitude, followed by the addition of error, also of prescribed amplitude. I'm a bit unsure as to whether I can definitively say that only X PCs are expected to be significant due to these definitions. Ideally, I would like to know this precisely, but I may need to ensure that the true signals are completely orthogonal to one another? I'm also unsure as to whether I have correctly prescribed the desired signal amplitude to be identified by the PCA. # make data --------------------------------------------------------------- set.seed(123456) m $sdev[1:n]^2, log = "y") sum(P$ sdev^2); sum(tot.var) abline(v = e-1+0.5, lty = 2, col = 2) # expected signal cut-off
