My answer with an example: ["hello this is xyz","how are you doing","great man..."] in this case "[samples, time steps, features]" means: sample: 3 because there are 3 elements in the list time steps: here you can take max_length = 4 length("hello this is xyz") = 4; length("how are you doing") = 4; length("great man...") = 2 (after removing punctuation "."). The reason of saying this is a time steps is, in first element "hello this is xyz" ==> t0("hello"), t1("this"), t2("is") and t3("xyz") features: the size of embedding for each words. e.g, "hello": 50D array, "this": 50D array and so on
