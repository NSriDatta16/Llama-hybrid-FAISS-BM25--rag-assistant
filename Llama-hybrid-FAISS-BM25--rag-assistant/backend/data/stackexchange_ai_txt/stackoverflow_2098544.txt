Problems creating a custom UIView

I'm trying to create my own UIView subclass. I've placed it on my view in Interface Builder by dragging out a UIView, then specifying my subclass's name in the Class Identity field. Yet my UIView does not draw itself. Here--in a simplified example--is the code in my UIView subclass: - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder { if (self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder]) { UILabel* label = [[[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:self.frame] autorelease]; label.text = @"Hello."; label.textColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; [self addSubview:label]; } return self; } I've seen reference to overriding drawRect:, but honestly I have no idea what I'd do in that method. I'm sure I'm doing something obviously wrong, but I have no idea what. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.
