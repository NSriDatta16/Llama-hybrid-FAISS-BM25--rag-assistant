Best practises for creating datasets for the purpose of finetuning LLMs

I am working on a problem for which no datasets exist. I have obtained several examples from this domain, and so far have been using them in Large Language Model (LLM) prompts(few shot learning) but I noticed results are not good and perhaps finetuning is the way to go. The expected output of LLM is to generate text and logical formulas. I am looking for tutorials that include best practises for the following and more: How to decide which fields (columns) to include? What types of data to include as input? Any pointers is extremely appreciated.
