Tweetie like swipe menu

How can I implement tweetie like swipe menu? I'm done with developing a tableviewcontroller with a customcell. The customcell implements touchesbegan and touchesMoved. It also reports swipe gestures via a selector to the parent tableviewcontroller. Now how should I go about hiding the "Swiped" cell and replacing it with a "swipe menu view" and how should I get the actions from the buttons present on the swipeview?
