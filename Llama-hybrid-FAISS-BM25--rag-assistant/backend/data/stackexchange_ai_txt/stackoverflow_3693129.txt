Ruby: undefined local variable or method work around

I usually will have some code that looks like the following: return if foo.nil? bar = foo[:bar] || 0 The problem with they above is that if foo[:bar] does not exist, I get an HTTP 500 error because a NameError exception gets thrown that looks something like: NameError (undefined local variable or method `foo'..) What's a more elegant work around?
