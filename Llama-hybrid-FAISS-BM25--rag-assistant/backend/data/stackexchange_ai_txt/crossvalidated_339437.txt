Finding the global minimum of a nonnegative, black-box, polynomial spline

A polynomial spline is a function whose definition domain can be divided into partitions such that the function is a polynomial on each partition. An example of a polynomial spline is $$ F(x)= \begin{cases} (x-3)^2 & if ~x 7 \\ 0 & \texttt{ otherwise } \end{cases} $$ Suppose that we have a polynomial spline $F$, but I do not know details about its partitions. In other words, $F$ is a kind of black-box polynomial spline. An additional detail (which may or may not be useful) I know about $F$ is that it is non-negative. I am looking for an efficient algorithm for finding minima of $F$. My guess is that this is an intractable problem. While there exists many blackbox global optimization algorithms, such as mcmc, genetic algorithms, I am looking for an algorithm that can take advantage our knowledge about the function structure aforementioned. Any idea?
