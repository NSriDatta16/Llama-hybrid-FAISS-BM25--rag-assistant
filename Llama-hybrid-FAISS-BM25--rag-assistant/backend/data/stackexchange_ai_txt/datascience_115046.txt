What is the difference between π(a|s) and π(s,a) in reinforcement learning?

In my understanding, $\pi(a|s)$ is the probability that random policy $\pi$ chooses action a given the current state is $s$ . And $\pi(a,s)$ is the probability that random policy $\pi$ chooses action a while the state is $s$ . I think both of them mean the same and have the same probability. Is that true?
