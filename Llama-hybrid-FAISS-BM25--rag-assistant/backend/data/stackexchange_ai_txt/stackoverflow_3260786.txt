JNI sources in the APK

I have an Android project with an NDK/JNI library in Eclipse Ganymede. Inexplicably, the bin folder contains a copy of all my C++ sources from the jni folder. So does the APK, if you rename it to ZIP and examine. If I delete those files from bin, then clean and rebuild, they're there again. What going on, please? I have no intention of distributing the sources along with the app.
