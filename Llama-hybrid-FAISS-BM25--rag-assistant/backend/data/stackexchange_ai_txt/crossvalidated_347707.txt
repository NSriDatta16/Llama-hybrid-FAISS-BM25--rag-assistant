How to understand Bayesian lasso?

I have a number of related questions on Bayesian Lasso: How can one understand the Bayesian lasso in a more intuitive way? I find this intuitive understanding a bit hard for this method. Related to 1., how does it differ between Lasso and Bayesian lasso? What is the advantage of Bayesian lassoï¼Ÿ Thank you!
