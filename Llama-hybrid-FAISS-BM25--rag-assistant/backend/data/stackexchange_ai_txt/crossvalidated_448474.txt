Interpreting Standardized Residuals vs Predicted Graph

I am performing a regression predicting difficulties with daily tasks, which can range from none to cannot do. There are many variables between those values, but it is a bounded dependent variable ultimately. In evaluating the residuals vs. predicted graph, there is a hard limit and downward slope. I used a square root transformation of the dependent variable to see if it helps, though a similar pattern emerges. In prior posts on this topic, I have seen many recommend re-working the analyses as various other forms of regression such as binning the results and performing multinomial logistic regression. However, in this model the standardized residual histogram is normal, the qq-plot seems normal, and the other results are broadly consistent with theory. What would be the practical ramifications of moving forward with this model beyond limiting generalizability?
