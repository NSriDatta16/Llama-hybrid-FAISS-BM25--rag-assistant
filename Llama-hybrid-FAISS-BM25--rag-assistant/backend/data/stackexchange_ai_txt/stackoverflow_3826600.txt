Mongoid relational Polymorphic Association

Does anyone know how to do a polymorphic association in Mongoid that is of the relational favor but not the embedding one. For instance this is my Assignment model: class Assignment include Mongoid::Document include Mongoid::Timestamps field :user field :due_at, :type => Time referenced_in :assignable, :inverse_of => :assignment end that can have a polymorphic relationship with multiple models: class Project include Mongoid::Document include Mongoid::Timestamps field :name, :type => String references_many :assignments end This throws an error saying unknown constant Assignable. When I change the reference to embed , this all works as documented in Mongoid's documentation , but I need it to be reference . Thanks!
