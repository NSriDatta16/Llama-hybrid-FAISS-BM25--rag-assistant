If, by standard utility, you mean 3rd-party library, then my answer is: almost! The Apache Commons is worthy of being a part of almost any Java application. Using IOUtils from the Apache Commons, you can achieve what you describe by doing this: final List list = IOUtils.readLines(new FileInputStream(file)); Set set = new HashSet (list); The set will contain each line from the file. Note: IOUtils is not generics-aware, so this code fragment will give a compile warning.
