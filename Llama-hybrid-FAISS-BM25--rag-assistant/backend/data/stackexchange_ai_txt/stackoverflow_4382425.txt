jQuery div/box reposition (similar to hubpages capsules)

I'm looking for some help setting up a page with re-positional divs/boxes. I would like the functionality similar to how you can setup capsules with HubPages, which includes moving boxes: Up Down Float right (making 2 columns) Change to full width (if floated right) Remove box Insert new boxes See screenshot for example: I don't want to use drag-n-drop jQuery UI, but rather have buttons to reposition the boxes.
