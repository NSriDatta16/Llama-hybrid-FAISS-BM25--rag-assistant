Binary or Multinomial Logistic Regression?

I wish to analyze the following : Predictor Variable (IV): Satisfaction of sexual needs as important (4 items scale and respond based on 4 point likert scale. Sum up to get the item score.) Response Variable (DV): Condom usagae (2 options : never or sometime) Questions: Should I use binary logistic or multinomial logistic? (some people tell me to use multinomial logistic but a book said to only use it when the DV has more than two levels, and my DV only has 2 levels - never or sometime). How can I use SPSS to analyse this? I need step by step help. The SPSS dialog box for logistic regression has three boxes: Dependent : I put in Condom Usage Factor(s): (I am not sure should whether I put Satisfaction of sexual needs as important here?) Covariate : (I am not sure whether I should put Satisfaction of sexual needs as important here?) I am very sorry. Maybe my question sounds silly but i really need help, as i am beginner. I couldn't get any tutor within my town.
