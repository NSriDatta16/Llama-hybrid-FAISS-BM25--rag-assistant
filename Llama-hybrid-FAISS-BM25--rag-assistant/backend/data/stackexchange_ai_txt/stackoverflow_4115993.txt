Haskell is informally defined as the language handled by GHC. GHC is the compiler of the Haskell platform . Trying to optimize your code with GHC may pay off more than switching to another compiler as you'll learn some optimization skills. There are many very useful extensions in GHC. I just can't see how to live without them. So, for anything serious (e.g. non-academic, non-experimental, non-volatile or using many packages), the pragmatic choice is to go with GHC.
