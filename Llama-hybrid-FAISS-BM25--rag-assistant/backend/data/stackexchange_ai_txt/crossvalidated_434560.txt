The between-within group interaction can be interpreted as such: does the difference between moments (within) depend on the treatment group that they are in (between)? The math behind this is very simple but important. Let's say you only had moments 1 and 2. We would find the interaction by subtracting moment 2 from moment 1, and use that value as a dependent variable in the model. So your dependent variable is now the difference between moment 2 and moment 1, and your independent variable is still the treatment group. Now if you run this model and interpret it normally, the interpretation will be very similar to above; just interpreted in terms of how the effect of the within-subjects variable is dependent on the between-subjects variable. So if you have a significant interaction for time spent using technologies when comparing moments 1 and 2, that means that the difference between these moments for time spent using technologies depends on the between-subjects variable (treatment) that they receive. To answer your second question, your between-subjects results and interaction results are complementary but tell you rather different things. These are not 2 between-interactions like interpreted elsewhere on this page. The between-subjects test can tell you if treatment 1 is more effective than treatment 2. So, on average across moments, this would tell you if treatment x is more effective than treatment y in a statistically-significant manner. The interaction would then tell you if the difference between these moments depends on the treatment they receive. The interaction is not necessarily important in determining whether the treatment is effective or not, but if you're interested how the treatment affects how participants' time spent using technologies changes between moments , it is ideal. PS: I know that this question is extremely old, but this is the first and most relevant result from search engines and I haven't seen a fully-correct answer yet.
