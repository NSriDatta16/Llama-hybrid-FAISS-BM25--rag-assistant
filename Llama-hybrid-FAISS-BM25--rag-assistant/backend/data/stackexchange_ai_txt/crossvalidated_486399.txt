Can I use logistic regressions and least squares coefficients in a meta-analysis?

I am trying to write a Economics meta-analysis. The papers that I have collected so far contain a 50/50 split between OLS models and Logistic regressions (coefficients reported as odds ratios). If we assume for simplicity that all the outcome variables are measured in the same way, I have used the method described here to convert the odds ratios to SMDs. My plan is to estimate the model using both the OLS and Logistic coefficients. I will include dummy variables for the different model types, as a form of subgroup analysis. Is this okay to do? Any help is much appreciated!
