Linq to Entities in EF4 using generated POCO classes

I used the ADO.NET C# POCO Entity Generator Visual Studio add-in to generate POCO classes for my entities. When I try to use the class in a Linq to Entities query such as the one below: var q = from w in entities.Widgets select new Widget { Id = w.Id, WidgetName = w.WidgetName, WidgetDescription = w.WidgetDescription }; return q.ToList(); I get the following exception: "The entity or complex type MyNamespace.Widget' cannot be constructed in a LINQ to Entities query". The only way around this is to use an anonymous type and then another LINQ query: var q = from w in entities.Widgets select new { Id = w.Id, WidgetName = w.WidgetName, WidgetDescription = w.WidgetDescription }; var r = from e in q.AsEnumerable() select new Widget { Id = e.Id, WidgetName = e.WidgetName, WidgetDescription = e.WidgetDescription }; return r.ToList(); This works but is pretty redundant. I understand why I'm getting the exception, but is there a more elegant way around this? The fact that the POCO classes are generated by the ADO.NET C# POCO Entity Generator doesn't seem related to the issue; I tried using my own POCO classes and saw the same exception. Many thanks.
