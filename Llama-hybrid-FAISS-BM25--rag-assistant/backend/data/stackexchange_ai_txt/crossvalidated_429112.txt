One strong variable load on components in principal component analysis?

Hello and good day to you. I am using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation to analyze variables on my research. There are 20 variables and 6 components were extracted. From the result, I noticed that the variables were strongly loaded on one component. And I attached the Rotated component Matrix which I got from the PCA analysis. As you can see from the picture there were 10 different variables which put into the first component I don't know where did I makes mistakes of where the fault is coming from, can anybody please give me a suggestion? Thank You.
