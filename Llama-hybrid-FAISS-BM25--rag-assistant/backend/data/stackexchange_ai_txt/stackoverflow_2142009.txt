The rails dispatcher is the entry point for a rails application and is used to bootstrap the environment. They have a long history and in a lot of ways they are almost obsolete. In days gone by rails apps used to be powered using cgi or fastcgi, which was a way for the webserver to communicate with a rails process. The boot process would be initiated by dispatch.fcgi or dispatch.cgi . Nowadays people are more likely to use apache/nginx+passenger or apache/nginx+mongrel/thin . (Does anyone still use lighttpd?) I'm a little fuzzy on how dispatch.rb is used, but I think it's used by upstream rails servers such as mongrel/thin to bootstrap the rails process. However, now that rails is rack compatible I'm not entirely sure if that has changed. You don't need to pay the dispatch.* files any attention. I hope this helps.
