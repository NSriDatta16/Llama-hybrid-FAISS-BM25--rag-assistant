Use a CDATA section. For example: Bob ]]> This is more elegant and readable in source than encoding special characters in entity references when you have a larger XML piece. If the XML you want to embed itself contains CDATA sections, you need to use multiple CDATA sections as described in another answer on Stack Overflow or on Wikipedia . Or you can always use plain entity references as described in other answers here.
