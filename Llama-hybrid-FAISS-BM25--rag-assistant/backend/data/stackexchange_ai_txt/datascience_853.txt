Unsupervised feature learning for NER

I have implemented NER system with the use of CRF algorithm with my handcrafted features that gave quite good results. The thing is that I used lots of different features including POS tags and lemmas. Now I want to make the same NER for different language. The problem here is that I can't use POS tags and lemmas. I started reading articles about deep learning and unsupervised feature learning. My question is: Is it possible to use methods for unsupervised feature learning with CRF algorithm? Did anyone try this and got any good result? Is there any article or tutorial about this matter? I still don't completely understand this way of feature creation so I don't want to spend to much time for something that won't work. So any information would be really helpful. To create whole NER system based on deep learning is a bit to much for now.
