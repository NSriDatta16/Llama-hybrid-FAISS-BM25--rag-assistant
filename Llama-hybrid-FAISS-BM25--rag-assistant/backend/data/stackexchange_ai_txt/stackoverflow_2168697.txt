If you have a UserMailer setup with a "password_reminder" method, you can call create_password_reminder instead of deliver_password_reminder and it will create the message without actually sending. Then you could send the output to the log file: Where you would have: UserMailer.deliver_password_reminder You can replace with: logger.info UserMailer.create_password_reminder.encoded Or if you want to send it to a file, you can do that as well. That being said, the production environment really isn't the place for this sort of thing. I've never had a need to do this, because my mailers have full test coverage. I'd look into that option instead, but I gave the answer you asked for because I don't know your full situation. Happy coding :)
