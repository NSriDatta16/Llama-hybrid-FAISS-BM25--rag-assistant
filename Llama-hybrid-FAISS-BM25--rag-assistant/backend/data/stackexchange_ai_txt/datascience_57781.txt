I guess, that you should add more data from other sources, such as an open statistic of salary changes in your region, distribution depended on age and so on. Your task looks like time series problem, but you don't have observation of necessary period. I think, that this suggestion is not correct "if 1% of all customers earned 20k, then I assume that 1% of the current customers also earn 20k ". You should at least multiple it on some constant depended on changes, which has happened during this period of 3 years.
