Drag and Drop a Groupwise Email to C# Winform

I have a need to be able to drag and drop a groupwise email to my winform application and am not having any luck at all. I am able to get a filename as such but it is only a name, not a path. Every time I call e.Data.GetData("FileContents", true)) or e.Data.GetData("FileContents", false)) or e.Data.GetData("FileContents")) I get null returned. Also, the GetFormats returns something strange and a simple Google search returned nothing. One of the formats was WPOF_DBOBJ_DRN . If anyone has some insight on this it would be greatly appreciated. Update: Just to add a few more details about this, there is also nothing on the clipboard from the drag and drop. Also took a look at the groupwise editor and word perfect isn't even installed on my pc and is most definatly not the editor.
