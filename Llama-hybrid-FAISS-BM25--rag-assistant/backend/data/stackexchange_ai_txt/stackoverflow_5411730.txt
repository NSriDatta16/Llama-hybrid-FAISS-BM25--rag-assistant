How to organize functions/methods in android app?

In my application, when user presses Sync button (calls function onSynchronize() ), I need to do the following activities: form url for data synchronization based on user's preferences download url parse data received for each item found in data download picture (another url) update ListView with data downloaded and parsed What is the best approach to split this activity between classes? Since steps 2-4 should be done in background ( ASyncTask ), and the same steps 1-4 will be used in the service (for automatic synchronization). Should I put step 5 in onPostExecute of according ASyncTask ? Or, should I put there steps 3-5? What is the most logical and clear approach?
