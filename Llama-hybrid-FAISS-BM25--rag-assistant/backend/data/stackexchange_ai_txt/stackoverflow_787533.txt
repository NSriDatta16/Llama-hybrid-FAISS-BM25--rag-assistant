Is #pragma once a safe include guard?

I've read that there is some compiler optimization when using #pragma once which can result in faster compilation. I recognize that is non-standard, and thus could pose a cross-platform compatibility issue. Is this something that is supported by most modern compilers on non-windows platforms (gcc)? I want to avoid platform compilation issues, but also want to avoid the extra work of fallback guards: #pragma once #ifndef HEADER_H #define HEADER_H ... #endif // HEADER_H Should I be concerned? Should I expend any further mental energy on this?
