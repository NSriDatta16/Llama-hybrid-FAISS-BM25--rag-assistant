[updated] The problem is that you are using the wrong tool for the job (namely the event.target property). This will return the element that the event happened on .. but not the element in the bubbling phase that handles the event... you need to use the event.currentTarget .. But in jQuery's case this is also the same as the this keyword inside the handler ... ref: http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/ Have a read at the Event order as explained at quirksmode. Special attention to Use of event bubbling and currentTarget [previous answer] Make sure that inside the .click method you use a function pointer or an anonymous function .. so $("a").click( function() {/*...*/} ); // anonymous function or function some_function() { //... } $("a").click ( some_function ) // function pointer but not $("a").click ( some_function() ) // unless some_function returns a function pointer..
