Should I use WPF or ASP.NET for my next Web Application development?

We have a web application that has been built using MySQL / PHP / Javascript+JQuery, with server-side HTML generation. The problem is that of the 10 software developers that work for the company, none are PHP experts (we're all .NET / C# developers). I need to make a recommendation to my management team on which technologies to use as the platform for the next generation of web application products. I want to leverage the .NET / C# expertise which the company has and is otherwise building, and so am inclined to recommend some Microsoft technologies. We don't want a client-side plugin, and we don't need flashy animations/multimedia, so I'm ruling out Silverlight. Is WPF ready for primetime? Is ASP.NET deprecated by WPF? How do I choose between these two technologies? Big Question, I know... I can refine it based on your comments if necessary. Thanks for taking the time.
