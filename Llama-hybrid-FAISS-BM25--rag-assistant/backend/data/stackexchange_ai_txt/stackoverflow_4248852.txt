I tell you when OOP is bad. When the architect writes really complicated, non-documented OOP code. Leaves half way through the project. And many of his common code pieces he used across various project has missing code. Thank god for .NET Reflector. And the organization was not running Visual Source Safe or Subversion. And I'm sorry. 2 pages of code to login is rather ridiculous even if it is cutely OOPed....
