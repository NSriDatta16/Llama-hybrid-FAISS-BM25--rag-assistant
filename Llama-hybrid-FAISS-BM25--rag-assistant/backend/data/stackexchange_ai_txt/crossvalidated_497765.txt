Assume you have housing data to predict prices. A polynomial equation of order 5 fits your training data well.Instead, you tried simple model, built a linear model(d=1), your estimates are too off from real values. Your model has a high bias, less variance. You tried, d= 2, 3, 4, 5 => Your bias decreases and variance increases. At d = 5, with the equation fitting your data, you have minimum bias and highest variance(out of all the cases) If you try higher order d = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 to fit your data, bias will decrease and variance will increase but at very slower rate.
