Printing data into a preprinted form in C# .Net 3.5 SP1

I need to print out data into a pre-printed A6 form (1/4 the size of a landsacpe A4). I do not need to print paragraphs of text, just short lines scattered about on the page. All the stuff on MSDN is about priting paragraphs of text. Thanks for any help you can give, Roberto
