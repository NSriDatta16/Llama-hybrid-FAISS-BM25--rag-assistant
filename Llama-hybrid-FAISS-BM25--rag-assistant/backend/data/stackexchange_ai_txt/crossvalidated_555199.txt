Sample size estimation for linear regression with repeated measurements

i'm in a bit of a pickle. I have a quantity y that I want to estimate from a measurement x, via linear regression. Per data point, i can repeat n-times the measurement of x, e.g. to get a better estimate, and average out the noise. Question is, assuming that sampling x is costly, how do I estimate the best n? in other words, how do I make a sample size estimation of the repeatition needed per data point to have a good estimate of the regression?
