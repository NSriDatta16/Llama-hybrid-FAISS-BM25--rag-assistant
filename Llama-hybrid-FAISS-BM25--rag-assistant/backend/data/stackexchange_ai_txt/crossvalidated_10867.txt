Tests for consistent measurements and outliers

I have 3 experiments, where some quantity was measured 3 times. Thus, 3 biological replicas, 3 technical replicas in each biological replica, 9 measurements in total. I need to answer the following questions: For each biological replica: are my 3 measurements consistent? To do this, I'm using Dixon's Q test. For average measurements derived for each biological replica: are these 3 measurements consistent? So, how should I go about the second question? Is it a good idea to use Dixon's Q test here too? What other tests can I use to address the above questions? I guess ANOVA is not suitable because samples are too small, right?
