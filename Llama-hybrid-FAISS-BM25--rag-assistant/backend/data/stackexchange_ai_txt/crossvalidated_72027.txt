Ballot problem with ties

In an election, candidate $A$ receives $n$ votes and candidate $B$ receives $m$ votes where $n>m$. The probability that $A$ is always ahead in the count of the votes is $\dfrac{n-m}{n+m}$. This is known as Bertrand's ballot theorem . A variation is to allow for ties. So for $n\geq m$ what is $P(A\text{ is never behind})$?
