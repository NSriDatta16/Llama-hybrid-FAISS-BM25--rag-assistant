Strict exogeneity and lagged variables

I am confused why strict exogeneity must be violated when we have lagged time series variables. My understanding of strict exogeneity is that a variable must be uncorrelated with error terms in all periods. But isn't exogeneity always a necessary assumption for estimation? If $x_t$ and $u_t$ are uncorrelated, and $x_{t-1}$ and $u_{t-1}$ are uncorrelated, how would it violate strict exogeneity if we have a specification with $x_t$ and $x_{t-1}$?
