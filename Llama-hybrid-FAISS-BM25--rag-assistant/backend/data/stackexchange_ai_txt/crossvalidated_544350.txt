Why do we apply the sample mean version of the CLT for a problem involving a sample size of 1?

I am having problems understanding the following question and answer. It seems to me that the sample size is n = 1 and the population size is N=500. If I read it this way then we do not have a large enough sample to use CLT. The answer uses n=500 but this is also N, so doesn't that imply the mean is certain to be 750 dollars? Question A small micro-loan bank has 500 loan customers. If the total annual loan repayments made by an individual is a random variable with mean 750 dollars and standard deviation 900 dollars. Approximate the probability that the average total annual repayments made across all customers is greater than 755 dollars. Answer Apply the (sample mean version of the) CLT using $(750,900^2/500)=(750,1620)$ . The z-value for this is $\frac{755−750}{\sqrt{1620}}=0.1242$ . Looking this up in the Z-table the closest value is 0.12 which corresponds to a probability of ( So the probability that the average total annual payments are greater than $755 is approximately: (>755)=(>0.12)=1−(
