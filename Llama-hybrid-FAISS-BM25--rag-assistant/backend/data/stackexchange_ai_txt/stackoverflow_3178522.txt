absolute css positions - firefox plugin to make it faster?

I do all my css work with firebug, using the up and down arrow keys to adjust top and left values. Anyone come across a firefox addon that lets me drag stuff around and then copy and paste the top and left values? edit: I have changed the question slightly from 'easier' to faster . Sorry for any confusion, I am not a beginner looking for tools to help me write css, simply to speed up my positioning slightly!
