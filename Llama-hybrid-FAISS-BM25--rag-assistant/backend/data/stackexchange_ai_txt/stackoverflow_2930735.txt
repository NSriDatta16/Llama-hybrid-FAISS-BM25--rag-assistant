Groovy 1.7 changes "final"?

Just started learning Groovy, got the PragProg book "Programming Groovy" and had a problem compiling one of the sample scripts: class GCar2 { final miles = 0 def getMiles() { println "getMiles called" miles } def drive(dist) { if (dist > 0) { miles += dist } } } def car = new GCar2() println "Miles: $car.miles" println 'Driving' car.drive(10) println "Miles: $car.miles" try { print 'Can I see the miles? ' car.miles = 12 } catch (groovy.lang.ReadOnlyPropertyException ex) { println ex.message GroovyCar2.groovy: 20: cannnot access final field or property outside of constructor. @ line 20, column 35. def drive(dist) { if (dist > 0) miles += dist } ^ Groovy versions prior to 1.7 do not give an error. I looked through whatever documentation I could find and did not see the issue discussed. What is going on here? Aaron
