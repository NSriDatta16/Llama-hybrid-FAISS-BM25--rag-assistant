How to auto apply drag and drop effect to dynamically added element?

I use jquery ui to apply a drag and drop effect on a serial of DIVs, for example: ... ... ... this DIV was dynamically added, not draggable The problem is dynamically added DIVs won't have this effect applied, how can i apply this effect on new members too?
