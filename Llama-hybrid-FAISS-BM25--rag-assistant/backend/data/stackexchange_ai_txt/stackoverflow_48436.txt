Keep in mind that a part of a Work Item Type definition for TFS is the definition of it's "Workflow" meaning the states the work item can be and the transitions between the states. This can be secured by security role. So - generally speaking - a "Change Request" would be initiated and approved by someone relatively high up in an organization (someone with "Sponsorship" rights related to spending the resources to make a (possibly very large) change to the system. Ultimately this person would be the one to approve that the change was made successfully. For a "Bug" however, ANY user of the application should be able to initiate a Bug. At an organization I implemented TFS at, only Department Heads can be the originators of a "Change Request" - but "Bugs" were created from "Help Desk" tickets (not automated, just through process...)
