How are eigenvectors and principal components related?

Possible Duplicate: Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues I am currently going through a PCA tutorial. However, I am a bit confused. For PCA, we calculate the covariance matrix and then find the eigen vectors and eigen values of the covariance matrix. These vectors are the principal components. How are the eigenvectors and the principal components related? Why does finding the covariance matrix from the data and its eigenvectors are the principal components?
