When the new tech was finally approved (after almost a year of political infighting) the CTO (who opposed it the entire time) claimed credit for the innovation and transferred the manager to a backwoods department. In another incident a new technology was proposed, with numerous examples of success in the same business area, and a committe was formed to study the issue. Five years later they are still studying the issue, and nothing has been done
