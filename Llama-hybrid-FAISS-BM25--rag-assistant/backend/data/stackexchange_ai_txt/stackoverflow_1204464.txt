I don't think there's a need for namespaces in databases, because the "namespace" by default is usually the database name. Usually in any application there's a lot more "functionality" that needs to be grouped than underlying data, so the namespace concept works better for code than it does for data storage. However, if you wanted to do this with your tables, SQL does support periods (.) in the table name, so you could have Contacts.Address or something like that if you wanted. Usually though, if you have this many tables, I would think your table name will essentially be the "namespace" + table name without the period (i.e. ContactAddress ).
