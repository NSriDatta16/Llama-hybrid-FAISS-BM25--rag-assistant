jQuery validationEngine

I am a total noob with jQuery and js and I am certain there is a more elegant solution then what I have come up with - but this is what I have so far and I'm stumped. I have a form that takes a long time to submit for various reasons - I am using validationEngine to validate the form fields inline which works great. I then needed to add a pop-up div to tell the visitor to please be patient why the application performs the requested search. My original solution worked great accept that the pop-up div showed when the visitor clicked submit regardless if the form was completely filled out or not - it the form is completely filled out everything works as expected - if they miss a field validationEngine shows the missing field notification and my pop-up div still shows up but obviously the form does not submit. That happens with this code: jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery("#approvalForm").validationEngine('attach'); }); $(document).ready(function() { $('#approvalForm').submit(function() { $('#progress').show(); }); }); So after some research I made some modifications that resulted in this code: jQuery(document).ready(function(){ jQuery("#approvalForm").validationEngine('attach', { onValidationComplete: function(form, status){ if (status == true) { $('#approvalForm').submit(function() { $('#progress').show(); }); } } }); }); And now everything works correctly except that you have to click the submit button twice and when you do the pop-up div comes up but the form does not submit.
