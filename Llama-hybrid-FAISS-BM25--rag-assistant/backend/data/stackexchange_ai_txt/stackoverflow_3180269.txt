Only Solution that Worked, and it was the one that feared the most and was trying to avoid. I had to start a new project and painstakingly move all 96 class files (about 27mb of text) over one by one, because dragging the classes over kept giving me an error. I tried dragging over the classes as one large group, but that would not work. A little "re-factoring", rebuilding the .plist info, and setting up the new targets, and it I got it working again. I think that there was some sort of legacy issues that Xcode was getting caught up on. It is working now under a new project, but there must be a better way.
