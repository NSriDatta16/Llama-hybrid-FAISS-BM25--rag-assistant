Meta-analysis: is there a way of including dependent effect sizes without averaging across them

I'm running a meta-analysis with a binary outcome (succeed/fail). I am primarily interested on the effect of predictors related to the study (e.g. age of participants, type of task) on the binary outcome, rather than the actual outcome of the study (that is i'm doing a meta-regression). In some cases studies report multiple outcomes from the same population. The intro meta-analysis textbooks (e.g. Bornstein, 2009) only give information about how to find the weighted average of multiple effect sizes and to use these. However, I am also interested in the different outcomes because they provide interesting (different) information. I can find lots of papers on the best way to find the average of multiple dependent effect sizes, however the only guide to this (in Cooper's 2009 handbook) is pretty undecipherable for me. Can anyone explain how to do this? If i use the same population twice, can i just divide the weight given to the study by the number of times it is included in the meta-analysis? I've read about incorporating a third level into the meta-analysis, however in most cases i've only got one observation from a single population so i'm not sure if that would work in that case. Thanks
