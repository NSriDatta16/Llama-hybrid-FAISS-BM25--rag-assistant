Unless there is some pressing need to do this, I would probably advise against it. The clarity of your code will suffer. Storing the outputs in temporary variables and then passing these variables to another function will make your code cleaner, and the different ways you could do this are outlined here: How to elegantly ignore some return values of a MATLAB function? . However, if you really want or need to do this, the only feasible way I can think of would be to create your own function secondreturnvalue . Here's a more general example called nth_output : function value = nth_output(N,fcn,varargin) [value{1:N}] = fcn(varargin{:}); value = value{N}; end And you would call it by passing as inputs 1) the output argument number you want, 2) a function handle to myfunc , and 3) whatever input arguments you need to pass to myfunc : abs(nth_output(2,@myfunc,x))
