At first it seemed from the responses that using the show/hide functions would not be possible if I wanted a value of display other than block . However, I then noticed that, when the tags were in the hidden state, jQuery had added an attribute called oldBlock to each of them. I then realized that this was for temporary storage of the display CSS value when the element is hidden, so that the appropriate value can be reinstated when the elements are shown again. All I therefore have to do is set the appropriate value for display before I hide the elements. Initial state: ... Calling .hide() takes us to this state: ... Calling show() brings us back to this state: ... The main problem was that I was NOT giving the elements a value for display in my initial state. They would therefore implicitly receive the browser default, which appears to be inline as I expected. However, jQuery will only use the oldBlock attribute if you explicitly set the value for display before you call the hide() function. If there is no oldBlock attribute, the show() function uses the default value of block .
