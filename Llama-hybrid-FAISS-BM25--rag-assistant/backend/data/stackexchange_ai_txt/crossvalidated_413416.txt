Do we need to stationarize a time series signal when using Kalman filter?

I am working on forecasting the number of logins. I know that before using ARIMA, it is important to remove trend and seasonality. But in the case of Kalman filter, I am not sure. After all it is a filter. Has anyone worked with Kalman filter to make forecasts? Thanks
