From looking at the RFE examples at Max's page , svmRFE_NG$resample and svmRFE_NG$pred$Resample (and their counterparts in svmRFE_NG$fit ), I'd say this depends on which characteristics you want to look at. svmRFE_NG seems to contain cross validation results of using different variables, so could be used for statistics about using different variables (consider e.g. svmRFE_NG$variables too). Not all information seems to be preserved here though, like the performance of a specific combination of variables, if I didn't just overlook this. In contrast, svmRFE_NG$fit seems to contain cross validation results for different hyperparameters of the "final model" (the best performing combination of features and hyperparameters). So those can be used for the more classic statistic about the final model you obtained from the whole process.
