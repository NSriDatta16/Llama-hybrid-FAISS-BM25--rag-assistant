string sReturn; if (sText.size() != sPassword.size()) { return sReturn; } for (size_t foo = 0, end_foo = sText.size(); foo I have rewrote it now using everyone's tips. I appologize for the mistake caused by the lack of attention -- clearing the string everytime I run through the loop. I hope it is OK now, please tell me if there is anything that is wrong with it. Thanks to everyone for their prompt answers.
