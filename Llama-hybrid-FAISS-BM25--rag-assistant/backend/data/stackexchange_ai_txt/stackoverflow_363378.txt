There's three ways of doing this that I know of - The one Albert suggested (resize it until it fits). Subdivide the texture into 2**n-sized rectangles, and piece them together in some way. See if you can use GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two . It's probably best to avoid it though, since it looks like it's an Xorg-specific extension.
