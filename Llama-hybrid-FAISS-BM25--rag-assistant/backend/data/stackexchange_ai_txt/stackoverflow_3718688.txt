If that is what you need to do, then yes. In my opinion though, you may wish to reconsider this requirement. I have often implemented similar frameworks, where forcing implementations in sub-classes was a clever trick. What I then found was that as a consumer of these frameworks I would duplicate code or default to some inane implementation (like the empty method). Neither of which is ideal, as they add clutter and noise, and reduce maintainability. Additionally, if the application of this pattern is as a self-factory (ie your example has sub-classes returning instances of themselves), then you may wish to try something different, like a proper factory pattern. Er, and by "try" I mean leverage an Inversion of Control Container, like Castle Windsor, Ninject, Unity.
