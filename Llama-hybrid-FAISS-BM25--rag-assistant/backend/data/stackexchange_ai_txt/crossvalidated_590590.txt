Update to Box and Jenkins Air Passenger data?

A textbook example of a time series is the Box and Jenkins Air Passenger data. In R you can get it with the command data(AirPassengers) . It has the number of international airline passengers each month from 1949 till 1960. Is there anywhere to download the true number of international airline passengers in 1961? I want that data so my students can compare several different forecasts to see which was closest in reality. I feel like this data set would be useful to essentially everyone who teaches forecasting.
