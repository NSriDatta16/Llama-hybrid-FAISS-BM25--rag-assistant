Actually, I think a lot of programmers and organizations have a lot of low-hanging fruit. Make sure you are using your time productively, know how to trade-off speed for quality appropriately, don't "gold plate" things beyond what your customer is asking for, etc. Profile your organization's processes. What is the bottleneck slowing you down? Context-switching (i.e., multitasking) is often a real productivity-killer. I suppose the problem with this is that when your back is up against the wall, organizational improvements like these seem like luxuries unto themselves, even though they are the things that could really help you speed up your work.
