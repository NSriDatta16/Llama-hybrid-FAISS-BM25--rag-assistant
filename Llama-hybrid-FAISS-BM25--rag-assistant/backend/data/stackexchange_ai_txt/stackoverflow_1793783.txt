"newbie issues" I've seen myself (I've used Eclipse for a good while, but it keeps "surprising" me occasionally) and helping colleagues just starting to use Eclipse: It's large and complex enough to be very intimidating to some at first. Seems people consider netbeans easier to use initially. One colleague took refuge with the VI editor for a god while... Installing plugins can be tricky (finding site URLs, awareness of plugins, why is "install"+"update" under the Help menu???) Updates are still slow (but much better than before) with Eclipse 3.5/Galileo. It's difficult to understand which plugins to install just by their name sometimes. Any platform besides Mac - preferences under the Window menu seems illogical? Understanding how to set the project class path neatly. Setting the right project JDK version. Lack of or unexpected interaction between ant/maven build tools' classpath and that of eclipse's (ant/maven clean causes Eclipse compiler errors when classpath is shared etc.). Views and (large number of) perspectives are confusing/overwhelming at first. Which are useful when? How to drag views to the desired location or restoring closed ones? Some JDK/Eclipse version combinations required too much PermGen space than available by default, took a while to diagnose.
