Magento theme problem

I tried creating a new theme in Magento by creating the following folders: /app/design/frontend/interface/default /skin/frontend/interface/default I copied into these folders the entire content of the base/default folders (in both skin and design). I enabled the theme bu putting "interface" in "current package name" for a website and expected it to look like the theme I had copied, but for some reason, nothing in the head is loaded. No css, js, ... I checked and all my xml/css/js files are all there though ... What might the problem be? The .phtml files are all being loaded. EDIT: I also noticed that selecting "base" as default package does not work either, but if you select "default", then it does load the base theme phtml files with some base and soem default css ... EDIT2 Fixed, not sure where the error was ...
