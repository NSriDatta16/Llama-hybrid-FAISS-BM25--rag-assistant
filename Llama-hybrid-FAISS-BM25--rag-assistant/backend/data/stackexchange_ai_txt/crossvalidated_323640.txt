If you sample with replacement from your original normal sample, the resulting bootstrap sample isn't normal . The joint distribution of the bootstrap sample follows a gnarly mixture distribution that is very likely to contain duplicate records, whereas duplicate values have probability zero when you take iid samples from a normal distribution. As a simple example, if your original sample is two observations from a univariate normal distribution, then a bootstrap sample with replacement will half the time consist of the original sample, and half the time will consist one of the original values, duplicated. It's clear that the sample variance of the bootstrap sample will on average be less than that of the original -- in fact it will be half the original. The main consequence is that the inference that you're doing based on normal theory returns the wrong $p$-values when applied to the bootstrap sample. In particular the normal theory yields anticonservative decision rules, because your bootstrap sample will produce $t$ statistics whose denominators are smaller than would be expected under normal theory, owing to the presence of duplicates. As a result, the normal theory hypothesis test ends up rejecting the null hypothesis more than expected.
