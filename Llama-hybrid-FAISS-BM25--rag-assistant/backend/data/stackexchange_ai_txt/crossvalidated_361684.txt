Find correlation between two time series. Theory and practice (R) is a good place to start your education. Note the discussion that points to the flaw of interpreting ( not computing ! ) correlation coefficients when you have auto-correlated data ...as you do . This problem was recognized for time series as early as 1926 by Yule in his presidential address to the Royal Statistical Society and nearly 100 years later we have Google https://www.google.com/trends/correlate/tutorial and tons of others promoting the erroneous interpretation ( i.e. using standard significance testing !) of time series correlations.
