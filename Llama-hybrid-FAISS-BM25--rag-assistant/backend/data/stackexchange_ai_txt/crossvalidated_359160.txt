All the trees from randomForest-model are use all the attributes of object, but not only mtry?

I have trained model for classification task in R using randomForest - "RF_Model" RF_Model returns: Call: randomForest(formula = measure ~ ., data = dat) Type of random forest: classification Number of trees: 500 No. of variables tried at each split: 3 Each object, which uses in that model, has 15 attributes. In my understanding (the basic knowledge I have got from here ): mtry = number of random variables used in each tree. So, I thought, that for each sample decision tree (from those 500 trees in the forest) will be used only 3 different attributes from 15. But when I tried to check that - I found that all the 15 attributes are used for each tree in the forest: k and as the result, tree returns the tree with 19-27 levels of depth, and always all the 15 attributes are used for the tree. What I am doing wrong or misunderstood? Why for the small trees in the forest (No. of variables tried at each split: 3) have been used not 3 distinct attributes, but always all 15?
