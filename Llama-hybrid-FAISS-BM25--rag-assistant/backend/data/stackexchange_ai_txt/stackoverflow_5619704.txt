As far as I know, there isn't any dedicated Javadoc tag for notes or remarks. Generally, the first sentence of Javadoc should give a brief description of the class/method/field. Then the full description should follow. And if you want to include any notes, a specialized paragraph with a "Note:" prepended should suffice. /** * Brief description. Full description of the method, generally without * implementation details. * * Note: Additional information, e.g. your implementation notes or remarks. * * @param input description of the parameter * @return description of return value * * @since version * @author name of the author */ public boolean doSomething(String input) { // your code }
