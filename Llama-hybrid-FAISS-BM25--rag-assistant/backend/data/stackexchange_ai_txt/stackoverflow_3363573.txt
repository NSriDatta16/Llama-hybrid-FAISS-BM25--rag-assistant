Multiplatform single-file storage

I need a way to store several images in one/two (some projects seems to us an index too) for both .NET and java. The file-format needs to be easy to decompress (I'm planing to do so on android). And also, for each file I need to be able to store the following metadata: file-index, name, md5-checksum. Also, the footprint of the framework should not be to big. And last, if you got any simple solutions to the problem, I don't need a framework, but could with some guidance probably code it myself. Thank you.
