You could require moderator approval for accounts, but the effectiveness of this depends on how large your community has grown. For a small community, have the trolls queue up at the gates makes them lose interest very quickly, especially if you're looking for patterns in account signup information. For large communities, the effectiveness of techniques used depends on how well they are used. Shadow banning aka muting the troll, can backfire if it is an innocent bystander. One effective way of handling this is to not mute the troll, but to ensure that bans on accounts are not made public; one wouldnt want to drag the community into it.
