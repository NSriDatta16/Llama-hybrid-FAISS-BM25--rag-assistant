The difference is that the sample covariance function divides by $n-1$ while you are effectively dividing by $n$ when using the mean function. Try typing the following instead: sum((a - mean(a))*(b - mean(b)))/(length(a) - 1) The reason we divide by $n-1$ is so that the statistical property of unbiasedness will hold. That is, on average, we will not be over or underestimating the true underlying covariance.
