The simplest (but not most resource friendly) solution (if you anyway have a single storage for walls) is iterating through the walls and instead of using the Flash default hitTest (I don't like the way it works since ActionScript 2) - just check the coordinates and if you see that there's going to be a collision on the next simulation step - handle it according to the game logic. The most useful optimization for this algorithm is creating a filter/data structure for getting only walls that are near to the player and so can be affected to the test for collisions.
