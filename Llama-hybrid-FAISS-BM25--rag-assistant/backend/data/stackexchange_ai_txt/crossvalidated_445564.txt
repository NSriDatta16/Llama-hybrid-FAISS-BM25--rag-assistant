CNN filters with different size using Keras

CNN can have multiple number of filters on raw input data. Normally I specify the number of filters needed as 'filters= 250 ' and the size of the filter as 'kernel_size= 3'. (This means I will make 250 filters and each filter has a window width 3 as this is for text). I also learned that theoretically these filters can be all in different sizes. So my questions are: Is it conventional/in most cases that people use consistent size of filters in CNN? Is there some option in Keras that I can set for having different sizes of filters in the same CNN? e.g. the 1st filter is width 3, 2nd filter is width 5, 3rd filter is width 7...etc.
