I think you're going to be much better off using an enum or static constants to name your fields e.g., static const int FIELD_NAME = 0; Static const int FIELD_NAME2 = 1; than doing this as different types (templates). Then you can go for std::valarray or boost::ublas::vector/matrix types to leverage existing code & get quality performance vector operations to boot.
