Yes, you still needs it. If you really want to take advantage of the higher PPI, you will use antialiasing. The point of it is to provide the "bleed" that is necessary to make the image appear as best as it can in it's analog form. The only reason the magical 300 PPI or DPI number makes a difference in print is that the dots bleed together some. When you're dealing with the hard edges of an LCD pixel, you have to use antialiasing or you're still dealing with the digital attempt to communicate in the analog. Since we're dealing with light emitting pixels, instead of light reflecting pixels, the need is even higher, since the contrast of the hard boundaries in the screen are even more noticeable. Reflective light blends and bleeds to gather better than the same light intensity be very directly from the emitting source. Antialiasing will be needed until we have high resolution organic, non-grid based displays, preferably reflective in nature.
