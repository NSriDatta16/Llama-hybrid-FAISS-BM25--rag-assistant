I would advise being very careful about using feature selection with so little data and a non-linear model. There is a significant risk of over-fitting the feature selection criterion (and ending up with a model with reduced generalisation performance). Especially if you use a brittle performance metric such as classification accuracy (I'd recommend something like the Brier score instead). Make sure you keep a separate test set that you don't use in any way to fit the model (including feature selection) so you can get an unbiased measure of performance. A better approach would be to use Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination - see the excellent book "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" by Chris Bishop for details.
