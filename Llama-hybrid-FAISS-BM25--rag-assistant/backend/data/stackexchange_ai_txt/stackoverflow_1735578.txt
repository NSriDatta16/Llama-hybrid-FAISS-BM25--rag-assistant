Magento - Displaying Configurable Product Options under a Grouped Product

I am trying to create a grouped product by grouping some configurable products. I know it is possible. The grouped products attributes should be set to Not Required. This is found on Inchoo's website. What I am trying to achieve here is that, I want to show the options of the configurable under the grouped products grid. For example, I have a product range called Melina Table. This will be a grouped product to show 5 sizes of the product and customer can pick one. But under the 5 sizes, there will be two colour options each. I am struggling to find a straight forward solution for this. Any kind of help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
