normalize identification values properly

I'm building a neural network to analyze a business' sales. I'm normalizing all input values to the range {0,1} . I'm struggling with the day of the week column. Business days are identified by a number ranging {1-5} (1=Monday). Normalizing these values to the range {0,1} is straightforward, but results in a major bias in the final output. The reason is that the full range of normalized values for the business day column is explored with every week worth of data, whereas other price-related column explore their full range of normalized values infrequently. The business day column ends up being the largest contributor to the final output. How can I normalize it to make its contribution more in tune with the rest of the inputs?
