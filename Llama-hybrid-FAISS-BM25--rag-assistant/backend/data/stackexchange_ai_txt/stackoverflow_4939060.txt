.NET CMS with custom authentication

I know there's tons of questions about .NET based CMS out there, but I have some specifics things I'm looking for. 1) Be able to leverage our application's existing authentication (We have our own implementation of of System.Web.Security.MembershipProvider as well as MembershipUser ) 2) Be able to restrict who can view certain pages/segments based on our custom roles, in addition to restrictions on who can edit them. Maybe most of them support this, but I haven't had much luck finding which ones specifically satisfy these requirements. (Being lightweight is also a plus, I've read about Orchard and N2)
