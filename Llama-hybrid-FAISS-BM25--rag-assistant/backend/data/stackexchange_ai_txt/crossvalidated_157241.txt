How to determine "trendiness" of a time series

I'd like to be able to compare two timeseries as to their level of "trendiness" to determine which trends better. For example, assume two stocks, Google and IBM. Would like to understand approaches to determining which of the two trends better. I realize that the concept of trend is a bit vague. If one were to look at charts of two stocks (GOOG and IBM for example) one may visually exhibit smooth trends where it goes up for 20 days with little interruption and then goes down for 30 days with little interruption whereas the other may be very noisy in its movement. Someone looking at the charts may say the first stock trends better. My question is how to mathematically/statistically determine this. One approach might be to mark highs and lows that represent at least an N% (say 15) change in prices on both stocks and the one with the fewest N% changes therefore trends better. Any other ideas? Is there a commonly accepted approach to this in the timeseries community?
