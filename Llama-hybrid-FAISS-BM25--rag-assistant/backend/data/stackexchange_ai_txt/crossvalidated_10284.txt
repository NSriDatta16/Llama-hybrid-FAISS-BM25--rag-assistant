If you are at all familiar with R (if you're building time series models, you should be), check out the forecast package. It's designed to choose parameters for Arima as well as exponential smoothing models, and uses a solid methodology to do so. It will probably get you a lot farther than what you are building in excel, especially because it will also allow you to explore exponential smoothing models. The two functions you are interested in are 'auto.arima' and 'ets.' /Edit: auto.arima can also be used to fit ARMAX models, which (if properly specified) can solve many of the problems identified by IrishStat.
