Best way to determine if I have enough time series data and it is spread out evenly?

I am working with some time series data produced by a sensor at a rate of 1 sample per second, and before I calculate an average for 1 hour, I want to make sure that I have at least 60% of data, but I also want to ensure that the data is sufficiently spread out so that it is not the case that my 60% of data only occurred at the beginning of the hour. Is there some statistical way or algorithm in determining that you have 60% of data and that it is spread out enough to give a confident 1 hour average? What would be my inputs for such an algorithm if one exists?
