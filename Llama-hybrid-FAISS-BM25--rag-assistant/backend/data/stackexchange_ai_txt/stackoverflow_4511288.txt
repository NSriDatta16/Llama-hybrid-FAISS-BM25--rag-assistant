Infragistics UltraWinGrid CTRL+A behaviour when using dropdown filters

I have a standard UltraWinGrid (V8.2) with some column/dropdown filters. I have implemented CTRL + A to select all rows. However when there is a filter applied, I only want to select all on the row that are not filtered out. I choose my words carefully as there are a couple of Visible properties but they seem to pertain to actual visibility on the screen - obviously this is not what I want.
