Volatility is the degree of variation of a time series such as an asset price or a market index, usually measured by the standard deviation of logarithmic returns. For any fund that evolves randomly with time, volatility is defined as the standard deviation of a sequence of random variables, each of which is the return of the fund over some corresponding sequence of (equally sized) times.
