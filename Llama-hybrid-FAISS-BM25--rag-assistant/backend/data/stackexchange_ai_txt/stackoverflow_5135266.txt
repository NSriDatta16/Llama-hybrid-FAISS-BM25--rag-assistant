jQuery Dialog and 960 Grid System

I have the following page layout using the 960 grid systm ---------------- header ----------------- | | side| main | | ----------------- I want to use the jQuery dialog to display a popup when the user clicks a link in the side menu. However no matter what I've tried the dialog's title bar always exapnds to fill the full screen. I've tried to set the height, the maxHeight and the zIndex of the dialog but this didn't worked. All I want is to have the dialog displayed in the center of the screen and this works whenever I don't include the 960 css but then I loose my layout. Is there something I'm missing? The code I'm using for the dialog is: var $aboutDialog = $("#aboutDialog") .dialog({ autoOpen: false, draggable: false, width: 640, height: 'auto', resizable: false, position: 'center', modal: true, zIndex: 4, buttons: [ { text: "Ok", click: function() { $(this).dialog("close"); } } ] }); My included files are as follows: Opera renders this correctly but FireFox 4 and Google Chrome 9 don't full html: Index Title My Gripes Categories About Privacy Hello World About content goes here Privacy statement This shows how the dialog is currently being rendered in FireFox 4 and Chrome 9. This is how the dialog is displayed in opera and how I would like it to display in all browsers:
