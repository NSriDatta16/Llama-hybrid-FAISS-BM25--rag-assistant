Text mining match in Python

I have one column called A and one column called B where column B is a more detailed description of column A , for example: A B want red apple I love RED apple 100% organic orange I love citric fruit 0% BANANA lover I have 2 banana 50% Basically the algorithm is if we have all values of A in B then give 100% match, if similar then give 80%, and if no value of A is found in B then 0%.
