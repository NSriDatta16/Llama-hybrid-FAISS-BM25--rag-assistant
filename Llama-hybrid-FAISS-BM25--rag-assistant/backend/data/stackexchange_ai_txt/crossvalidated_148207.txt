Modeling a proportion using longitudinal data

To illustrate my question I'll make a (very) fictional example. I have a set of 17 year old people that every year report how many cigarettes they smoked and how many miles they ran. Very few of those people will eventually be selected as Olympiads athletes. This setting gives us a data set of this kind: |subj | age | cigarettes | miles | will_be_olymp +------+-------+--------------+-------+-------------- 1 17 1 100 1 1 18 15 233 1 1 19 300 187 1 1 20 237 200 1 2 17 0 567 0 2 18 10 123 0 ... Now, assuming that age is not influential (for example, those boys are immortal elves), how do I model the probability of getting selected for the olympiads subject to the variables cigarettes and miles ? My idea was to run a logistic regression of this kind: will_be_olymp ~ a + b*cigarettes + c*miles where a is an intercept term. However, there is an obvious problem. This model ignores that those measures are correlated (as they come from the same subject, at a different age). One way to solve this problem (I think) would be to get a single random sample per subject, but this would require me to get an insane amount of measurements (to sample the space miles and cigarettes ), and I would waste most of the data collected. Also, a single subject may contribute more than once for a certain value of miles or cigarettes . What is the correct way to model this situation that leverages all the longitudinal measurements?
