Transforming GML with XSLT

i was trying to figure out what is wrong with this piece of code, but, after 4 hours, I give up! I tried a lot of different solutions here on stackoverflow and from arround the web, bot none of them worked. All i'm trying to do, is to put "gml:coordinates" value to the "point" attribute. I guess it has something to do with the namespace. Or something else... XML file: -7 -7 0 7 -7 0 7 7 0 -7 7 0 XSL file: 0 1 2 3 -1 And the Ajax script (returns correct results if attribute is set to "-7 -7 0 7 -7 0 7 7 0 -7 7 0" insted of "/gml:coordinates"): var xml = document.implementation.createDocument("", "", null); var xsl = document.implementation.createDocument("", "", null); xml.async = false; xsl.async = false; xml.load("xsl/ajax.xml"); xsl.load("xsl/ajax.xsl"); var processor = new XSLTProcessor(); processor.importStylesheet(xsl); var output = processor.transformToFragment(xml, document); document.getElementById("scene").appendChild(output); Thanks in advance.
