Does AUC for multiple logistic regression make sense if prediction is not the goal?

Does it makes sense to calculate the AUC if I do not want to use my multiple logistic regression model for predictions? I only want to calculate some odds ratios and test if the variables in my model have a significant influence and adjust for some covariates.
