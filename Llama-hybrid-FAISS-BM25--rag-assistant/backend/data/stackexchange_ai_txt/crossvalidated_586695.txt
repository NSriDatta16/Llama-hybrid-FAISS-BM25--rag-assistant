Linear mixed model overfitting

I am trying to determine whether it is statistically sensible to model a single outcome variable as predicted by a predictor with a high number of repeated measures. For example, the outcome variable for each subject is a single numeric value. The predictor variable has 80 values related to the one outcome variable. The time predictor variable is based on a time series, and the idea was behind this was too avoid data loss about the time series due to mean aggregation. However, I am wondering if this approach of maintaining the predictor across time only confounds the model further. Even if I were to include some dummy variable (time) to account for each of the 80 events, wouldnâ€™t the model likely be overfit? Thanks in advanced!
