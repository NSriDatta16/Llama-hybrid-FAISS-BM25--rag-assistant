Statistical tests for knowing the effect of a campaign on sales

I am currently working on my very first real life Data Science problem and I am facing a bit of a challenge in formulating the solution. The question is to find out if conducting a campaign has an effect on the sales overall. To do this, we have the data related to customer information, sales invoices, campaigns conducted with reference to the customers. I thought of the following ways to tackle this: We could simply split the customer base into 2 groups, those participating in campaigns and those not, and then just perform a statistical test (not sure which one yet) to see if there is a significant difference in their aggregate sales. Instead of comparing the aggregate sales, we could also compare just the frequency/count of sales across the 2 groups (not sure which model to use here) We could go for a logistic regression approach where the target variable represents whether a sale was made or not and then check which coefficients had the highest effect on the target I am not completely sure as to what would be the best approach here. It would be really helpful if I could get some insights into that. If there are better approaches to tackle this problem, please do share them! I would love to know more about them. Thanks in advance! Edit: I would like to add more information regarding the data itself in case it makes a difference in the assumptions made. I have 3 datasets Customers: This table, as expected, contains anonymized information about the customer, what campaign they were subjected to etc. Campaign: Information about the campaigns conducted like start and end dates, some descriptions regarding the campaign etc. Sales: This contains information about date of sale, the value of purchase, location of sale, etc.
