Regex reWord = new Regex("\\b[A-Za-z]*?(a.*z)[A-Za-z]*\\b"); ... this will return "Atlantic Treaty Organization", with the capture from a. * z being "antic Treaty Organiz". The problem is inherent in your method - unless you parse the user supplied "regex" of a * z (or a. * z, that's not quite clear from your post) by modifing * to [^\s] * ? as Svante suggests (or perhaps \w * ?), you're going to gobble up far more characters than you like. ". * " is, generally speaking, a bad idea when you're trying to be specific. It'll match everything but a newline, and there's nothing you can append to it that will stop that. Regex reWord = new Regex("\\b\\w*?(a\\w*?z)\\w*\\b"); ...will return just "Organization". Alternatively, if you absolutely must , for whatever reason, avoid modifying the user supplied regex, perhaps try spliting your strings into an array of words and test each word individually against the regex. Ultimately, it's GIGO - garbage in, garbage out. Feed your system a bad regex and if you don't fix it appropriately, you won't get what you're looking for.
