How to scale exponential data for a regression problem?

I understand that I should be scaling features between (0, 1) before feeding them into a neural network. However, what happens if future data could be larger than my current training data? For instance, if I am training a RNN on time-series data to perform demand forecasting, the product I am forecasting may be in a growth stage that will yield higher demand numbers in the future months than the past months. Is there a way to normalize data but still allow for larger values in the future?
