How can I expand(inline) property in an expression(C# 4.0)?

I have an expression of this form: Expression > expr = z => z.Show.OrgName == "xyz"; I need to convert/expand it to following form: Expression > expr = z => z.Show.Organization.Name == "xyz"; where OrgName property on Show entity resolves to Organization.Name . How can I achieve this assuming I need this to work in EF? You can imagine OrgName defined in Show class as below - public partial class Show { public string OrgName { get { return this.Organization.Name; } set { this.Organization.Name = value; } } } Appreciate your response, Anand.
