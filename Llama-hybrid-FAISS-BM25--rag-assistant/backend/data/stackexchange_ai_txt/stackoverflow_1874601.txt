Have you activated the secondary links from the theme settings? That would be: http://example.com/admin/build/themes/settings/name_of_your_theme I believe once you have activated the option, the variable will be populated. EDIT: Thinking a second more, I would also comment that I am not sure if the primary and secondary links are passed to the views templates. I believe those are passed to the page.tpl.php file instead. If I am right, and for some reason you want to add that variable to those passed to the views template, you will have to use a preprocess function, like explained here . EDIT #2: Indeed if you only need the secondary menu used in a specific views template, another approach would be to simply call menu_secondary_links() from within the template. This is not the most elegant solution ever, as it puts in a theming element something that should belong somewhere else, but it's up to you to make the call whether that menu in the views is a core functionality or a styling element. HTH!
