The method is extensively used to sample from a posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics. The following refers to that situation. Following Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution is proportional to the prior times the likelihood. In notations: $$ p(\theta | x) \propto p(\theta) \times p(x | \theta) $$ Sometimes, $p(\theta | x)$ corresponds to a known distribution, like Student. In that case, values can directly be sampled from that distribution and MCMC is not needed. But, $p(\theta | x)$ does not always correspond to a known distribution... Given the prior and the likelihood, however, you can always resolve the posterior at every parameter value up to a multiplicative constant (cf. Bayes' theorem above). As explained by @Sobi, "Uniform sampling" (as you suggest) will not work for continuous distributions. But, the MCMC method applies.
