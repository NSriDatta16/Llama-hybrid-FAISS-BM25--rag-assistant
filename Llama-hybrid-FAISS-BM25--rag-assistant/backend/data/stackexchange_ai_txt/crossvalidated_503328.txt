What does it mean if ROC curves (training ROCs) are very smooth?

I am a beginner to statistical / machine learning modelling and have a beginner question. What does it mean if ROC curves are very smooth? That is they actually look like curves. In textbooks, these curves usually have more angles and steep increases. I hope you get what I mean. Best, corkinabottle
