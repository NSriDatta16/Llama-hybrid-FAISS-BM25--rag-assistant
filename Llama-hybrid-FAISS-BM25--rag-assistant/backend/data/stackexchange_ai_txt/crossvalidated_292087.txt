I don't think you need anything specific to clustering. Just identify which features best separate your data. For example, you can train a decision tree or random forest to separate your cluster from the remainder of the data. This will give you important attributes. Or you could use a Fisher's linear discriminant and check the direction of the resulting vector if a linear separation works.
