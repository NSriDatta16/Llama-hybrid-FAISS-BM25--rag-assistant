When you look a satisfaction_level , you see that the mean of group0 is 50% higher than group1 mean. So, on average "satisfaction of left=0 people is more important than satisfaction of left=1 people". Now if a new person has a very high satisfaction level, it is more likely that he is from group 0. You have to check if the difference in means is statistically significant . Otherwise, this difference could be a coincidence. As @Seymour stated, you cannot draw conclusions about causality but only about patterns of co-occurrence.
