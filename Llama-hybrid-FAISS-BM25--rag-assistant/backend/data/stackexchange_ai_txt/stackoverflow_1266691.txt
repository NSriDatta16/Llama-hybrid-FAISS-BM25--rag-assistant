Thank you all very much for your help. I managed to get this working by creating an array as Dav suggested above. The code is a bit ugly, but it does the job - I'm pretty much a php newbie and I put this together from examples I found on the web. One last question, I'm using the explode function to separate the CSV file based on commas. I'm afraid this won't work if one of my fields has multiple commas, such as an address: 123 elm street, bethesda, maryland 20816. I would prefer to use fgetcsv when I create the array, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can someone help me out? Also, str_getcsv does not seem to be supported by the version of php on my hosting service so it doesn't work for me. Here's the code I've used so far - it gives me a perfect result based on my simple CSV file, which I'll post again below. Code: \n"; //here we changed the condition to $i \n"; //here will run another loop for the amount of columns for($j = 0; $j ". $name[$i + ($j * $rows_per_column)] . " &nbsp;" . $team [$i + ($j * $rows_per_column)] . " \n"; } echo " \n"; } echo " \n"; ?> Here is my CSV file: CSV Team Example.csv. The first column is player name, second column is team name, and third column is position they play. Scott L. Aranda,Red Devils,Offense Todd D. Smith,Blue Streaks,Offense Edward M.
