A bean is nothing much, really. For a class to be a "bean", all it requires is: to have a public, no argument constructor to be serializable (to implement the Serializable interface, either directly or through one of its super classes). To that, you can add getters and setters for properties of the class that conform to a specific naming convention if you want the fields to be discoverable in certain circumstances (e.g. making that class some object you can drag and drop from a visual editor in your IDE, for example). You can find more directly from Sun here .
