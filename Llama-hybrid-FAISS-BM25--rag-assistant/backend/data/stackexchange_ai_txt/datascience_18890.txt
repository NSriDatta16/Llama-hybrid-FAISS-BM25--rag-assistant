Identifying Customers who are more likely to purchase a given product category- Which model to use?

I'm pretty new to data science. I am working on a model to identify customers who are more likely to purchase a given product category. I did try market basket using arules package from R. I also used MatchIt, Matching algorithm and did try Propensity score matching to find similar customers who tend purchase in the given product category. But I'm not quite sure the model is good enough for this kinda problem. I'm just wondering what kind of model will be useful to find customers who are more likely to purchase a given product group. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
