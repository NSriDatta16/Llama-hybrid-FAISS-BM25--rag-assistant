You can use the isInterface() method of the Class class to do this. What is your reason for doing this though? Do you have a poorly documented library where you need to figure this out? Perhaps if we knew what you were trying to do, a more elegant solution could be offered. if(Class.forName("Person").isInterface()) //do interface stuff else //do class stuff or if(Person.class.isInterface()) ... EDIT: On reading your comment to T.J. Crowder's answer. This is what I would do: if(Person.class.isInterface()) System.out.println("Person is an Interface"); else System.out.println("Person is a class");
