The contents of my JComponent only refresh after a manual resize

I am trying to figure out why my JComponent refreshes when I manually drag my window, but it doesn't refresh when I call repaint or revalidate. The data is ready to be displayed, but it just won't show until I manually resize. Can anybody give some suggestions about what I can do or does this sound like it isn't a Swing problem since I tried repaint and revalidate? One weird things I've noticed is that if I have this code: sp.setSize(sp.getSize().width, sp.getSize().height+1); sp.setSize(sp.getSize().width, sp.getSize().height-1); If the first line is used, then the JComponent will refresh itself. If I use none or both of these lines it will not, which seems bizarre to me. I am basically just putting a JPanel in a JInternalFrame in a JDesktopPane. There are two main functions for what I am trying to do. One adds the new JPanel and the other tries to refresh it so the new data will show: public void addNewSP() { sp = new JInternalFrame("SP"); sp.setClosable(true); sp.setLocation(700, 400); //this should be changed to something based on screen size sp.setResizable(true); sp.add(popUp); this.parentContainer.add(sp, JLayeredPane.DRAG_LAYER); sp.pack(); sp.show(); sp.setSize(500, 500); sp.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500, 500)); } public void refreshSP() { sp.repaint(); sp.validate(); sp.repaint(); sp.validate(); parentContainer.validate(); parentContainer.repaint(); sp.setSize(sp.getSize().width, sp.getSize().height+1); sp.setSize(sp.getSize().width, sp.getSize().height-1); } } BTW parentContainer is the JDesktopPane
