I'm going to be bold and assume that you're only interested in the performance gains for your application. So I would suggest that you first copy the current environment and settings (so that's MySQL 5.0.27 et all) on a test server and simulate standard load and user interaction. Then upgrade to MySQL 5.1 or 5.5 on the test server and perform the same simulation, that way you get the real numbers you are interested in and you can practice on rolling out all these updates. You can use something as http://loadimpact.com/ for a reliable benchmark of your website. But always do multiple runs and take the average, min, and max to compare it.
