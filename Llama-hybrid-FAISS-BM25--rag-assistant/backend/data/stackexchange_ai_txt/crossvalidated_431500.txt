Recycling proposed values in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm goes under the name of Rao-Blackwellisation . For instance, we made such a proposal in Casella and Robert (1996) Rao-Blackwellisation of sampling schemes . Douc and Robert (2013) A vanilla Rao-Blackwellisation of Metropolis-Hastings algorithms Note that the weighting you propose in the question: $$[1-\alpha(x_i,y_{i+1})]h(x_i)+\alpha(x_i,y_{i+1})h(y_i)$$ is not optimal in that it is not guaranteed to bring the variance down. Even the one I produce [above] in one of my MCMC course slides does not always reduce the variance because of the correlation between the different terms. (Only the data augmentation case leads to a sure reduction in the variance, cf this fantastic paper by Liu, Wong and Long, 1994 . And vanilla Rao-Blackwellisation .)
