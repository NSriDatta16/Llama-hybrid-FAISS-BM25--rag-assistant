Opening program by double-clicking associated file, can't get filename!

I have a program that has a file type associated with it (*.cqd). When the user double clicks a .cqd file, it opens up my program just fine, but I can't for the life of me get the name/path of the file used to open the program. I've tried the following code: public static void Main(string[] args) { foreach (string s in args) { MessageBox.Show("MAIN: " + s); } } Which only gives me the path of the program itself. I've also tried: foreach (string arg in Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()) { MessageBox.Show(arg); } Which has the same effect. I'm having a hard time finding information on the topic because my searches give me "How do I open a file with it's associated program?" rather than the problem I'm having. Any help I can get would be appreciated. NINJA EDIT: This is not a WPF project. Sorry I wasn't specific on that. I also fixed a quick typo. FOUND THE PROBLEM! When I publish the application, it publishes to a .application file. I went into the project's /bin/release/ folder and found the .exe file. When I drag a file onto the .exe, it properly passes the path into the arguments. Guess I need to read up more on why this is, and if I can get the .application file to work with arguments, seeing as how it has the auto-update of ClickOnce in it. Thank you all for your help! If there's anything I need to do to close this thread, please let me know.
