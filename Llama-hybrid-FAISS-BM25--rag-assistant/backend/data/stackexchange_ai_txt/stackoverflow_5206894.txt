string to decimal number in scheme

What is the most transparent and elegant string to decimal number procedure you can create in Scheme? It should produce correct results with "+42", "-6", "-.28", and "496.8128", among others. This is inspired by the previously posted list to integer problem: how to convert a list to num in scheme? I scragged my first attempt since it went ugly fast and realized others might like to play with it as well.
