Since QSystemTrayIcon is a QObject, not a QWidget, my guess is this is not possible. The system tray icon isn't really owned by Qt - it's passed on to the 'desktop', i.e whatever part of the Gnome/KDE/Windows/Mac is drawing the relevant area. At least on Mac, you'd be dropping on the menu-bar, which would be a very strange UI. For Gnome and KDE it's a FreeDesktop.org standard, but again I don't think its your process which actually does the drawing, and hence there's no way for Qt to get events such as drag and drop to you.
