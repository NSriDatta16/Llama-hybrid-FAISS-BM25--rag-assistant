Neural network type question

This web link is to a site that talks about forecasting building electricity, like a time series regression concept. In the article they talk about the NN architecture as: the architecture of this neural network can be written as 120:7:24 Is an MLP type NN? What I also dont understand is if they account for times series methods to forecast/predict. For example I thought for time series applications a sliding window concept needs to be used Vs a typical regression problem that does not have any element of time. Any tips greatly appreciated!
