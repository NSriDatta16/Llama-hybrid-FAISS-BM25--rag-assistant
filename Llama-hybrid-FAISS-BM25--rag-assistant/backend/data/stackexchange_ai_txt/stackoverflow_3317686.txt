Regex: How to replace with the string literal "\1"?

I have a string, say r"a" . I want to replace every r"a" with the string r"\1" , but my regex engine does not understand this. I have tried: r"\1" -- crashes (can't match group 1 because there is no group 1) r"\\1" -- crashes (not sure why) Is this a limitation of my (proprietary) regex engine, or is it a general problem? Is there an elegant way of solving it? (I could e.g. replace "a" by "/1" and then StrReplace( "/", r"\" )... but that's not nice !)
