Selenium 2.0 IE Xpath Performance

I'm attempting to use selenium-dotnet-2.0a5 to iterate through many tables, and have to use xpath. e.g; var tableRows = _table.FindElements(By.TagName("tr")); foreach (var row in tableRows) { row.FindElements(By.XPath("td|th")); //iterate through tablecells and get text of each } Average times to iterate through about 50 rows, firefox 0-2 sec, chrome 6-8 sec, IE 60-70 sec. Most of my tests need to be run in IE, any tips on what can I do to get better xpath performance?
