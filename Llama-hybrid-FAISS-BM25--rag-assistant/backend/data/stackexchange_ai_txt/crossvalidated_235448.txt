Do ResNets from Microsoft experts represent convolutional neural nets?

I am talking about the article of Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun (Microsoft Research team): " Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognitione (2015) " ResNets won the 1-st place at Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015 (ILSVRC2015) In terms of architecture, do ResNets represent convolutional neural networks?
