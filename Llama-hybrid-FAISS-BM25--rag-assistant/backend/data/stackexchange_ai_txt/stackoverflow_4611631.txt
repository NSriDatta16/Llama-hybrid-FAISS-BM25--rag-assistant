While I wouldn't go as far as to say that nested classes are evil, they certainly can be "mischievous", and there are very few problems that a nested class will solve that couldn't be solved differently or more elegantly. So it really depends on your specific situation, but some things to consider are: Is the nested class going to be publicly visible? These are unwieldy due to the syntax consumers must use to refer to the nested type: OuterType+InnerType Source files get larger on average, and are harder to read and reason about (although this may be mitigated by the strategic use of partial classes). Code Analysis in Visual Studio will complain loudly about public nested classes (they're not considered good form by the framework design guidelines folks), so if you're using FxCop you'll need to make exceptions. If you post some more specifics, we might be able to provide more detailed guidance.
