One solution would be to have a third process act as an intermediary, and tell it to launch apps via RPC/Named pipes. Processes: Windows service Intermediary application The app you want to run The shim creates a communication endpoint (named pipe, WCF endpoint) and listens on it. When it gets a message to go ahead, it launches the app you want to run. Then, when the Windows service wants to launch an app, it finds and opens the endpoint (named pipe, WCF endpoint), and sends the message to launch the app. Then the intermediary application takes care of the process launching business, and doesn't have any of the limitations that the Windows service has. Make this intermediary process start with logon, and you're good to go. This is similar to how the Microsoft test agent/controller work when you need to run tests that interact with the desktop.
