Is there ever any benefit to modeling a time series at a monthly level, if all I need are forecasts at the quarter level?

I have a time series with 5 years of monthly data, but the business I'm working with needs only quarterly forecasts. So in theory I could just aggregate my data up to a quarterly series and then model it. But it seems like a waste of information. Is there any benefit to modeling it at the month level anyway?
