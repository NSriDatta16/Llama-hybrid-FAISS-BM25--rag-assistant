You can use the same basic algorithm used for Mean filter, just calculating the average. for(int i = 1; i Optionally you can use a slightly more flexible algorithm allowing you to easily change the window size. int winSize = 5; int winMidSize = winSize / 2; for(int i = winMidSize; i But bear in mind that this is just one simple technique. If you really want to do it using OpenCv tools, I recommend you access the openCv forum: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/OpenCV/join
