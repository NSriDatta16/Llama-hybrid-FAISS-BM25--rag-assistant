I would suggest that the ADO.NET Entity Framework has probably surpassed most other ORMs in popularity at this point, and will continue to grow faster than most in the future. This is mainly because it's a supported part of the .NET Framework itself. LINQ to SQL predated it, so it may still (at this point) be more used, but most newer development seems to be switching over to EF, especially as it's getting a lot more attention from Microsoft.
