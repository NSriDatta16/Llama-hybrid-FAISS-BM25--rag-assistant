Let us say that you want to manage the abundance of an organism, one way to achieve that is by regulating the probability of death. You might regulate the probability of death by making their living environment more rich or secure or whatever. You go out on the field, and from the $n$ individuals you observe $k$ deaths, so the random variable of the number of death $N$ follows a Binomial distribution. You may estimate the sampled death probability by $k/n$ , and you might find that it is much lower than what you expected. So you want to regulate things, and want to achieve a higher number of deaths. This can be achieved by determining a probability of death that will result to your desired number of deaths i.e solving $P(N>k)=0.9$ for $p$ . This will give you a probability of death that will lead to deaths that are more than what you observed with probability 0.9.
