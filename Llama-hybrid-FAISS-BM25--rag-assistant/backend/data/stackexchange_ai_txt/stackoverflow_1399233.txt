I would simply keep a blacklist of programs that send obviously broken Accept headers, like IE and Safari (according to the article). If the User-Agent header matches the blacklist, ignore the Accept header, otherwise don't. The problem with IEs Accept header is not that it puts image/* at the start, but that it doesn't indicate that it prefers HTML or XHTML over images (via the q parameter). AFAIK, the order of the elements in the Accept header is not significant.
