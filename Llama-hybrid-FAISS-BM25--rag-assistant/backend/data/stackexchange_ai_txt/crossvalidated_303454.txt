Maximum possible percentage above a sample mean

I was reading an article the other day about how 90% of people think of themselves as "above average" in terms of intelligence. Assuming that by average they are referring to arithmetic mean, what would be the maximum possible percentage of a sample or population that could actually have some measure of intelligence, say IQ, that was above the mean of the group? Is there some kind of mathematical proof of this?
