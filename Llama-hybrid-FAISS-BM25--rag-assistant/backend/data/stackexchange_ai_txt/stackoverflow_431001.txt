Have a look at System.IO.Packaging namespace. Quote from MSDN: System.IO.Packaging Provides classes that support storage of multiple data objects in a single container. Package is an abstract class that can be used to organize objects into a single entity of a defined physical format for portability and efficient access. A ZIP file is the primary physical format for the Package. Other Package implementations might use other physical formats such as an XML document, a database, or Web service. You can select different compression options for your package: NotCompressed - Compression is turned off. Normal - Compression is optimized for a balance between size and performance. Maximum - Compression is optimized for size. Fast - Compression is optimized for performance. SuperFast - Compression is optimized for high performance.
