For tree-based algorithms, it depends on the algorithm for building the trees that you use. If you use CART, as in sklearn, CART is by definition a greedy algorithm. For this reason, no one expects to find the global optimum when building a tree. However, local optima might do the job as well. This actually applied to gradient boosting and random forests, as they are built with trees. About SVM, there are two ways to fit an SVM: the dual and primal problem. Both ways involve sloving quadratic optimization problems, which solutions are always globally optimal.
