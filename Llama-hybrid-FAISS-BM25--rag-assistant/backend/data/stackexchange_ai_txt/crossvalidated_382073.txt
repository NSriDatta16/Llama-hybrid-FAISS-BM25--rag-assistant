In a gamma regression, how can i interpret coefficients?

My question is pretty simple, i have done a bayesian gamma regression with an inverse link, so: $\eta_i$ = $\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i1}+\dots+\beta_px_{ip}$ using an inverse link, mu is the reciprocal of $\eta$ , but now how i can interpret betas coefficients? agumenting an x by 1?...
