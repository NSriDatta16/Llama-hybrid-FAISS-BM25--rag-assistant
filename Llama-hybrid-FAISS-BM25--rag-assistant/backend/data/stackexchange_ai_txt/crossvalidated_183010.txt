Given that you are taking the sum of $L$ Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k,\sigma^2_k)$ variates, the sum $V$ is also Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(L\mu_k,L^2\sigma^2_k)$. Hence your outcome $V/\sqrt{L}$ is still one from a Gaussian mixture $$\sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{L}\mu_k,L\sigma^2_k)$$ I must add that I see little motivation for considering this simulation and average.
