No charge for use of the multi-billion dollar satellite network! Free information, well, timing signals! You could use GPS data to measure acceleration if you are expecting large changes and measuring over an extended interval. The GPSr will compute speed, and you could compute acceleration between readings. But there is an inherent inaccuracy. First, the average accuracy for a GPSr might be 50 feet . At 65 miles per hour, you are doing 95 feet per second. See the problem? Second, the accuracy for a particular device changes with the terrain and weather (local and outer space). So you couldn't compute a stable adjustment factor. No, the speed of your data transmission would not have a measurable effect on the computation, although you could compensate for that. The most interesting compensation, which is done inside your receiver, is made for the dilation of time caused by the high speed of the satellite. Einstein was right!
