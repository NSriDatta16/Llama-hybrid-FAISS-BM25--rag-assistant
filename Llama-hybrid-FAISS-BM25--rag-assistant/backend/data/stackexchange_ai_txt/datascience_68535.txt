Are these images too 'noisy' to be correctly classified by a CNN?

I'm attempting to build an image classifier to identify between 2 types of images on property sites. I've split my dataset into 2 categories: [Property, Room]. I'm hoping to be able to differentiate between whether the image is of the outside of some property or a room inside the property. Below are 2 examples of the types of image I am using. My dataset consists of 800 images for each category, and then a training set of an additional 160 images for each category (not present in the training set). I always seem to be get reasonable results in training, but then when I test against some real samples it usually ends up classifying all of the images into a single category. Below you can see the model I am using: IMG_HEIGHT = IMG_WIDTH = 128 model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (11,11), activation='relu', input_shape=(IMG_HEIGHT, IMG_WIDTH, 3), padding='same'), tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(11, 11), # tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), # Second convolutional layer tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (11, 11), padding='same', activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(11, 11), # tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), # Flattening tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), # Full connection tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'), tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop model.compile( optimizer=RMSprop(lr=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'] ) # now train the model history = model.fit_generator( train_generator, validation_data=validation_generator, steps_per_epoch=75, #100 epochs=5, # 15, or 20, and 100 steps per epoch validation_steps=50, verbose=1 ) Can anyone suggest the possible reasons for this? I've tried using different epochs and batch sizes, augmenting the images further, changing the Conv2D and Pooling layer size but nothing seems to help. Do I perhaps not have enough data, or are they bad images to begin with? This is my first foray into ML so apologies if any of questions seem obvious.
