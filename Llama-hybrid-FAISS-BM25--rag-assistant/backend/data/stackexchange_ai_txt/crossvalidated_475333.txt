In the first one, there is data leakage between training and test sets. The preprocessing should take place in the training set, and using the fitted preprocessing modules, you should transform your test and validation data. So, the first one is expected to be more optimistic on the performance. In addition, as far as I understand, you don't need time series splitting because data samples are human actions that are not temporally related. Finally, in general, I urge you to compare any two cases with only one change, e.g. don't change both class weighing and preprocessing step ordering at the same time. As a side note, accuracy is not a good measure of success, especially for imbalanced datasets.
