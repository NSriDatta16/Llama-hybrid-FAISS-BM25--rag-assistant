Your code as written doesn't make any sense. Perhaps you meant something more like this: public virtual List FillBugs() { // is this actually correct or did you mix up the concatenation order? // either way, I suggest Path.Combine() instead string folder = xmlStorageLocation + "bugs" + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar; List bugs = new List (); foreach (string file in Directory.GetFiles(folder, "*.xml", SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly)) { // i guess IBug is not actually an interface even though it starts // with "I" since you made one in your code bugs.Add(new IBug { Title = file, Id = 0 /* don't know where you get an ID */ }); } return bugs; }
