Job queue optimization algorithms

We have an application that requires assignment of jobs to resources. The resources have a number of attributes that define their suitability to a particular job -- some are preferences, some are hard constraints (all of the membership variety, e.g. "resource A is suited to jobs with color X, Y, or Z". Resources have a cost associated with them (the duration they spend on-line). We have the ability to recruit resources -- this takes a variable amount of time. We can recruit for a fixed interval of time. To give an idea of scale: There will be about 20 resources at any given time, 100 outstanding jobs. Completion of jobs takes 5-15 seconds. Recruiting a resource takes about 1-2 minutes, and we can recruit from 1-30 minutes of time (rerecruiting is allowed). We don't have much heads-up on jobs being submitted, maybe a few seconds. The goal is completion of jobs with lowest cost (resource usage) for a given average latency (job completion time). I'd appreciate pointers to algorithms, software libraries, or approaches to solving this problem.
