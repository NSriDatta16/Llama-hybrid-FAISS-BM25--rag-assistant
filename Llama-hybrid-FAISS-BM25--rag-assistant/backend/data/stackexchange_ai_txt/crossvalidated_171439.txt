The text from: "The ordinary least squares solution... and y is the column n-vector" denotes the frequentist approach to linear regression, and is generally termed "OLS". In Bayesian regression, there is a prior on the parameters. The often used Normal prior on the betas also has a frequentist interpretation: ridge regression.
