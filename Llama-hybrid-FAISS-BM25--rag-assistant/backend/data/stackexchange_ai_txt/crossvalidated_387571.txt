Data obfuscation strategies that keep statistical properties intact

I am getting data from a provider that contains identifiable information from a number of different organizations. The data aren't particularly sensitive, but to be safe, the provider wants to perform some obfuscation techniques on the continuous variables. I want to make sure ahead of time that these strategies will not problematize interpretation or analysis of the variables of interest. Two potential ideas: Mean centering the values prior to be given them Adding random noise to every observation Are there better solutions? The issue with mean centering is that it makes interpretation more difficult if the mean-centered variable is a DV, as you can't recover the true mean of the distribution. Random noise also clearly has its drawbacks as it will increase the variance of the estimates.
