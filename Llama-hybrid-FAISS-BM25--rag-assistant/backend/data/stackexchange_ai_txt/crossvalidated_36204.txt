You can use a sigmoid function $f(d) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha(d-\beta)}}$ to convert your SVM decision value $d = (w, x) + b$ into a number between 0 and 1 which can be treated as probability. You can adjust parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depending on your data. For more elaborate approaches, see these papers: B.Zadrozny, C. Elkan, Transforming classifier scores into accurate multiclass probability estimates. J.Drish, Obtaining calibrated probability estimates from Support Vector Machines.
