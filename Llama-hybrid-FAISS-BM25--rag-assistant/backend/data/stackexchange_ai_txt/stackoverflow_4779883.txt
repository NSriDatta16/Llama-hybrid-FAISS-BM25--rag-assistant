Enable USD and Jamaican dollar as currency in admin (System -> GENERAL -> Currency Setup) Save currency rates (System -> Manage Currency Rates) Rewrite Mage_Paypal_Model_Config (app/code/core/Mage/Paypal/Model/Config.php) class to allow Jamaican dollar as supported currency, i.e. you can add your country code in $__supportedCurrencyCodes array present on that file. Rewrite Mage_Paypal_Model_Standard (app/code/core/Mage/Paypal/Model/Standard.php) class to change the array parameters sent to Paypal. Here, you have to edit the Jamaican dollar amount to USD equivalent. Hence, sending data to Paypal as USD amount. It's about modifying function getStandardCheckoutFormFields() . You can rewrite/override those files by creating your custom module. OR, a simple way to override will be copying core file to local directory and editing the local file. For example: You can copy app/code/ core /Mage/Paypal/Model/Config.php to app/code/ local /Mage/Paypal/Model/Config.php and edit the file in local directory. Update: Here is a FREE Magento extension that supports PayPal payments for not supported currencies by PayPal. https://github.com/Meabed/Paypal-Multi-Currency-Magento
