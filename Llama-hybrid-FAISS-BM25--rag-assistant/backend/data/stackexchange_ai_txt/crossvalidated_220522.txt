Technically, you can achieve a log-uniform prior by declaring log_theta in the parameters block with lower=-3 and upper=1 like parameters { real log_theta; ... and then do in the transformed parameters block or model block real theta; theta It is never necessary in Stan to explicitly use the uniform density because if you simply omit it, then there is nothing to make the prior non-uniform over the support for the parameter as declared in the parameters block. All that said, it is usually a bad idea from a Bayesian perspective to impose lower and / or upper bounds that are not logically necessary for the data-generating process. If your bounds are too tight, then no matter how much data you have, you can never concentrate the posterior distribution on the true parameter value. Also, in Stan it is computationally necessary that there be zero posterior density at the endpoints of the support. You can have non-zero prior density at the endpoints of the support but are relying on the data to bound the posterior density away from the endpoints.
