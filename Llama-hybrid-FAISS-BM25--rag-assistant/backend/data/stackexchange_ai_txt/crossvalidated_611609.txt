Your P equation is just a probability mass function of Poisson distribution , but what you need is the cumulative distribution function for the distribution. They are both available in R as dpois and ppois respectively. What you are missing is the $\lambda$ parameter ( N in your case). It is not the number of trials, but rather something like the average number of virions (I didn't read the paper, so take it with a grain of salt). It definitely is not the number of tubes. To replicate the result you would need to know the parameter (either know what it was or how it was calculated by the author). Your comment has shed some light on what you are describing. To reproduce the result, you need to show the cumulative distribution function of the Poisson distribution parametrized by $\lambda = N$ . The cumulative distribution function $F$ calculates the probability that the random variable $X$ is less or equal to some value $x$ . In your case, you are interested in the "probability $Q$ that $x$ would be less than $m$ " since the Poisson distribution is discrete and non-negative, it's just $P(X . In the case of Poisson distribution, $$ P(X = x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!} $$ for $x$ equal to $0$ reduces to $e^{-\lambda}$ , as in the paper. This means that what they are calculating is $P(X=0) = e^{-\lambda}$ for different values of $\lambda$ , presumably equal to N . This is consistent with what you described, but I have no idea why the numbers are not consistent with the paper. I don't have access to the paper and don't know French, so cannot comment beyond what was described by you.
