Like everyone said, no. A lambda as an argument has already been suggested. A more elegant approach would be to accept an anonymous and set the properties according to the object. i.e. MyClass instance = MyClass.FactoryCreate(new { SomeProperty = someValue, OtherProperty = otherValue }); That would be much slower though, since the object would have to be reflected on for all the properties.
