python appengine form-posted utf8 file issue

i am trying to form-post a sql file that consists on many INSERTS, eg. INSERT INTO `TABLE` VALUES ('abcdé', 2759); then i use re.search to parse it and extract the fields to put into my own datastore. The problem is that, although the file contains accented characters (see the e is a é), once uploaded it loses it and either errors or stores a bytestring representation of it. Heres what i am currently using (and I have tried loads of alternatives): form = cgi.FieldStorage() uFile = form['sql'] uSql = uFile.file.read() lineX = uSql.split("\n") # to get each line and so on. has anyone got a robust way of making this work? remember i am on appengine so access to some libraries is restricted/forbidden
