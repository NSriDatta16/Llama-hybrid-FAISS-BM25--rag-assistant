If failure matters, check the exit status of an external program. To get the exit status in $? —see the perlvar documentation —use $? >> 8 or WEXITSTATUS from the POSIX module. In your case, 65280 corresponds to an exit status of 255, and according to the ssh manual ssh exits with the exit status of the remote command or with 255 if an error occurred. I'm surprised you aren't seeing some diagnostic from the failed ssh. Are you redirecting the standard error to /dev/null , or is it getting lost in a flood of other output? Are you using unencrypted ssh keys or rhosts authentication? Are you forwarding the connection to your authentication agent ( ForwardAgent in your ~/.ssh/config )? For debugging, can you cut out the middle man and issue the command to host C directly from host A?
