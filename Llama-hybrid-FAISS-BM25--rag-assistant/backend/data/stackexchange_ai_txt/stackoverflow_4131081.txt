You need a using statement to scope out your data context. Not exactly sure what you are trying to achieve, but something like this? Organization org=new Organization(); User user = new User(); using (var ctx = new YourContext()) { ctx.Organizations.InsertOnSubmit(org); ctx.SubmitChanges(); user.Organization = org; } using (var newCtx = new YourContext()) { // code to persist user }
