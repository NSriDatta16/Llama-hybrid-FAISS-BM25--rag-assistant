A fully convolutional network is independent of the number of pixels in the input if the output size is allowed to have a different number of pixels as well. This is due to the fact that the number of parameters in a convolutional layer is independent of the number of pixels in the input. However, the same convolution applied to images of different sizes, will produce outputs with different sizes. This scenario typically occurs in some sort of auto-encoder setup. After all, it is typically no problem if the size of the hidden representations is greater for large than for small images. E.g. for segmentation, as in the fully convolutional networks paper, or compression tasks. To make a prediction network truly independent of the image size, you would typically use global average pooling at some point in the network. Global average pooling reduces all pixels to a single value by computing the average pixel value. This makes it possible to add fully-connected (or convolutional) layers with fixed dimensions to obtain the desired output size. However, this has nothing to do with fully convolutional networks per se.
