Sine-Wave Fit To Time Series: Confidence Limits For Non-Normal Data

I have a time series that I know to be made up of several sine waves: $F(t)=C + \sum_{i=1}^NA_i\sin(2\pi f_it+p_i)$ Where $C$ is a normalization constant, and $(A_i,f_i,p_i)$ are the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the $i^{th}$ sine wave. I have already fit all parameters to my time series and am satisfied with the results; I just need to know how to get confidence limits for them. The time series has non-normal errors in its measurements (in my field the term is red noise), so apparently I cannot use traditional methods to find the 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties of my parameter fits. The method that I normally use is by using constant $\chi^2$ boundaries as confidence limits. Can I do something similar in the case of non-normal errors?
