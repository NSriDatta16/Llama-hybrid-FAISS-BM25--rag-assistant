Does machine learning methods adjust confounding effect of the variables?

I have implemented machine learning (RF) for analysis of a dataset, evaluating observations' survival. After analysis (including variable importance) one of my collegues asked me that does ML method consider independent effect of a variable, like what we see in adjusted multivariate coxph analysis ? I did not know the exact answer. As I know in ML methods, for example RF, split rule is log rank test, which does not account and does not adjust the confounding effect of the other variables. So for example if another variable has remarkable effect on both target and our variable of interest, based on logrank splitrule,RF would not know the confounding effect of another variable, and thinks that this is our variable of interest which causes the target. So I don't know that if my conclusion is correct or not? I did not find the answer in SE pointing out machine learning. I really appreciate your help
