As a general strategy, it's best to keep this data in an in-memory cache if it's static, and relatively small. Then, the 10k calls will read an in-memory cache rather than a file. Much faster. If you are modifying the data, the alternative might be a database like SQLite, or embedded MS SQL Server (and there are others, too!). It's not clear what kind of data this is. Is it simple config/properties data? Sometimes you can find libraries to handle the loading/manipulation/storage of this data, and it usually has it's own internal in-memory cache, all you need to do is call one or two functions. Without more information about the files (how big are they?) and the data (how is it formatted and structured?), it's hard to say more.
