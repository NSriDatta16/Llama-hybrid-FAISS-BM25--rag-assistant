What is wrong with this SQL schema?

I'm designing my first database for MySQL and the idea here is that we have orders that can contain multiple different items. So i decided to store order with all the relevant info in one table, items in another, and then create a third table where each ordered item is stored. Of course every time i will need to list an order i first will have to find every OrderedItemsID for which OrderID is the same as the OrderID i need and than match that to items. Now since this is my first DB design i'm not arrogant enough to think that it's a good solution, so i was wondering if anyone knows a good solution for this sort of problem?
