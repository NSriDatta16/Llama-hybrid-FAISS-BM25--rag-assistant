We tested both and found Enyim to perform the best for our expected usage scenario: many (but not millions) cached objects, and millions of cache-get requests (average web site concurrency load = 16-20 requests.) Our performance factor was measuring the time from making the request to having the object initialized in memory on the calling server. Both libraries would have sustained the job, but the enyim client was preferred in our testing.
