For simplicity sake, I would just reorganize the html a bit to put the newly displayed content inside the element that the mouseover event is bound to: Hover Me Test Option 1 Option 2 Then, you could do something like this: $('#hoverable').hover( function() { $(this).find("div").show(); }, function() { $(this).find("div").hide(); } ); Note: I don't recommend inline css, but it was done to make the example easier to digest.
