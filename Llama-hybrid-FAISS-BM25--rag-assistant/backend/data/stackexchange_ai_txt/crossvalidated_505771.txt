R-squared value depends on the number of data. when you use the quarterly plot of original values, the data is already clustered quarterly and in each quarter some averaging is already in-place. In other words, in each quarter which is represented by only one value, you already made those data averaged into one value and the add all those quarterly-averaged values into new plot.
