If you want your project to become logically well-organized, session management doesn't need to be in the beggining of the code .. In fact, if your code is well organized, you can even put it almost at the end of the process, if you care not to echo any kind of string before it. Personally, I prefer to treat sessions and ob as different libraries (created by myself in php to be handled my way), and think that's the best sollution. But that deppends on what you want to achieve.
