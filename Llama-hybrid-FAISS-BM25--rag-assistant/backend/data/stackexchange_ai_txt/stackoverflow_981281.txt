It sounds like you're also facing apathy within your own organization, if they are uncooperative about even naming the tool. I'd tell management that it's vital to know which tool it was. Somebody's got to either know, or have some paperwork that would help. Ask around, emphasize the importance, and document who you asked. In a case like this, take the usual CYA measures. After that, I'd stop worrying about it. You might want to make a few attacks on it just to look good, and it's possible you'd get lucky. However, if nobody else in the company cares about something important to the company, I find it too stressful to care about it much myself.
