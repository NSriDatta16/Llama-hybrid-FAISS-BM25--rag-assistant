I might be over estimating the intelligence of bot creators, but number 6 is completely useless against any semi decent bot creator. Using the C# browser control to create your bot would pretty much render 6 useless. From what I've seen with that type of software that's a pretty common approach. Validating on the useragent is pretty much useless too all of the blog spam I use to get was from bots appearing to be valid web browsers. I use to get a lot of blog spam. I would literally be deleting hundreds of comments a day. I made use of reCaptcha and now I might get 1 a month. If you really try to make something like this. I would attempt by doing the following: User starts off with no ability to post a url. After X number of posts have been analyzed in relation to the other posts in the thread then give them access to post urls. The users activity on the site, the post quality, and what ever other factors you deem necessary will be a reputation for that users IP. Then based the reputation of the IP and the other IPs on the same subnet you can make other decisions on whatever you want. That was just the first thing that came to mind. Hope it helps.
