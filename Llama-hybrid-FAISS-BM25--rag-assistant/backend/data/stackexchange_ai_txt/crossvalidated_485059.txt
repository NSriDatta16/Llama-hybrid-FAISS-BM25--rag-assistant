Would it be possible to, for example, perform a PCA to detect outliers, exclude these observations and train your neural network on the remaining observations? Or you could try to train a Partial Least Squares model to predict your output; it allows you to see for each observation, the correlation with the output, it allows you to detect outliers in relation to the output, to check which variables are mostly noise (irrelevant to the output), etc, so it could be useful to your case. Even if the PLS model's predictive ability didn't satisfy you in the end, you could use it to exclude outliers and to check if there are variables that are making the model worse (in the VIP plot), and you could adjust your dataset to train your neural network.
