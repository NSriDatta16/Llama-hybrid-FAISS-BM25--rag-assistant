Prove linearity of impulse response model

Given the following time varying model: $Z(t) = \alpha*t*Z(t-1)$ , how do I go about proving linearity? If you simplify based on some constant at Z(0), you get the general solution $ Z(t) = \alpha^tt!Z(0)$ which is pretty clearly not linear. Am I missunderstanding what is meant by linear? For transparency this is homework, some I'm happy for general guidance over a full solution. The question explicitly says "Prove linearity" not "prove or disprove linearity." And the professor has used these homework's for years. So... take that for what it's worth. This is in the context of time series.
