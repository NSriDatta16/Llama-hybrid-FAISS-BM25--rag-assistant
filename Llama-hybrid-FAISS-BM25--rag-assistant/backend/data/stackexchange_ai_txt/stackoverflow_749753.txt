jQuery + Safari 4 Beta

I have a (ASP.NET MVC) site that uses jQuery 1.3.2 and my jQuery functions refuse to invoke on Safari 4.0 beta [mac]. I CAN get them to invoke if I change the user-agent to Safari 3.2.1 Mac. This seems strange to me as I can't find any info about jQuery having issues with the beta and I don't know why the user-agent would change that. Anyone know how I can get jQuery to work on Safari 4 without the user having to change the user-agent?? Update : I opened up the page again this morning and all worked fine, with the proper UA. I think that maybe the JS engine went whacky and after a safari restart all was restored. Thank you all for your comments.
