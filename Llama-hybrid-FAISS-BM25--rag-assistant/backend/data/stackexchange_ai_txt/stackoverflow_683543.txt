Elegant way to implement manipulating temporary storage - ASP.NET

I have a user control, on load of which I have some data from the database. A user can manipulate the data in different ways (CRUD). The process of manipulating data can cause server side events or at the client side. Then there is a save button on the page that eventually processes the temporary data and writes it to the database. I am looking for an elegant approach to this. My thinking is: On load, use a hidden variable and serialize data (at that point in a form of a custom datastructure) to JSON On any event (server side/client side) that manipulates the data, deserialize, perform the operation and serialze back to hidden variable On the final save, deserialize to the datastructure that it was first loaded as and hit the database Since all this is happening in the ASCX.CS, I can't really use the cool OOP stuff (for polymorphism if in future they decide that these operations should not be done in temp storage but rather to the database) I am pretty much stuck with an approach of a class having a bunch of static methods that has one method for each of these operations. In the code behind, I will have to serialize/deserialze data as and when there are events that need to be handled. EDIT-Any help?
