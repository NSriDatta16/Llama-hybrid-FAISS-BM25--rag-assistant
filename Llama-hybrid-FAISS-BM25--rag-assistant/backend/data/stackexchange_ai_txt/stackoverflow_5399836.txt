Is there any way to get the full border when adding a border to a fieldset element?

When I add a border to fieldset element and then drag the legend down to work as a heading of sorts, the gap in the fieldset remains. Is there a way to have the entire border, without adding a wrapper div and setting the border on that? Example CSS fieldset legend { position: relative; bottom: -40px; background: transparent; } jsFiddle .
