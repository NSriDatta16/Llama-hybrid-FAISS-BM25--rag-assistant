jquery UI tabs - drag & drop between tabs? design issue

so my company is finally going to rewrite some pages using jquery. They wanted some sort of a search panel, and when the user clicks on a search result (it could be a plan, a project, an invoice), the result details will open in a new tab. all is good. each search result can contain documents and they want to be able to drag a document from say a plan in one tab to a project in another tab. also they want to able to view 2 things at the same time, say, compare 2 invoices side by side. by the very nature of the tab widget you are supposed to only see 1 tab at a time, so my gut feeling is that the tab widget is not the right tool for this. the accordion does not fit either, since you cannot keep 2 sections opened at the same time. any idea/suggestion for a better UI interface?
