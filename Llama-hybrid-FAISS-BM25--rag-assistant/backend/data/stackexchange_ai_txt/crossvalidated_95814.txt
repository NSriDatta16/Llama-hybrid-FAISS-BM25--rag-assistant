First, you get the mean zero by subtracting the mean $\boldsymbol \mu = \frac{1}{N}\sum \mathbf{x}$. Second, you get the covariances zero by doing PCA. If $\boldsymbol \Sigma$ is the covariance matrix of your data, then PCA amounts to performing an eigendecomposition $\boldsymbol \Sigma = \mathbf{U} \boldsymbol \Lambda \mathbf{U}^\top$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is an orthogonal rotation matrix composed of eigenvectors of $\boldsymbol \Sigma$, and $\boldsymbol \Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues on the diagonal. Matrix $\mathbf{U}^\top$ gives a rotation needed to de-correlate the data (i.e. maps the original features to principal components). Third, after the rotation each component will have variance given by a corresponding eigenvalue. So to make variances equal to $1$, you need to divide by the square root of $\boldsymbol \Lambda$. All together, the whitening transformation is $\mathbf{x} \mapsto \boldsymbol \Lambda^{-1/2} \mathbf{U}^\top (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol \mu)$. You can open the brackets to get the form you are looking for. Update. See also this later thread for more details: What is the difference between ZCA whitening and PCA whitening?
