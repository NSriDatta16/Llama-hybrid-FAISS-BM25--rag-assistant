MSIE 7.0 indicates that the specific version is Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0. You have to read the whole string, not just the first part. I'm pretty sure that the first part actually says "Mozilla/4.0", which just means that the browser is compatible with Mozilla 4.0. This is reported for historical reasons and to address issues arising from the widespread practice of "browser sniffing". A question was just asked yesterday about why Google Chrome and Internet Explorer put "Mozilla" in their user agent string. You should also read the answers to this similar question , which explain why IE reports two different version numbers in its user agent string.
