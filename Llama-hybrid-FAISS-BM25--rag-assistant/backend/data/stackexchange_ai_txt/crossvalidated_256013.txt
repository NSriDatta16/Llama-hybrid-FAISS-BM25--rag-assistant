How to select landmarks of Kernel to run SVM

Objective Clarify how to choose the kernel reference points (landmarks) to identify the non-linear boundary. Background Going through SVM at Coursera ML - Support Vector Machine and trying to understand how to choose the landmarks to measure the distances to feed into the Gaussian Kernel. It says "put the landmarks in the exact same locations as all the training examples ". Question Not clear why "the exact same locations of all the training data". Why using all the data? Number of features M and the number of data N is different and I suppose M Why not considering if a data to use as a landmark is classified positive or negative? I believe we would like to distinguish positive data (higher Gaussian probability), then why use the negative data as well as the landmarks? In the YouTube SVM with polynomial kernel visualization example (although it does not use Gaussian), the landmarks should be those that represent red points?
