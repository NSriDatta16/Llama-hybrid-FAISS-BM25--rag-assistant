Web app stress test

I am using pylot to stress test a web app I created. The test simulates 100 users logging in the app and the test lasts 200 secs. On average, approx. 4800 requests are made to the server and same number of connections to MySql, each of which executes 5 queries so we are talking about 24K queries during the test. The queries are simple and the tables are with very little data. The thing is that during the test I cannot access the app from the web. I either cannot connect to MySql or the response time is very slow. Bear in mind that the test is taking place at a CentOS VMware Image I have on my PC (512mb of memory allocated). Below are the results of the test Requests: 4809 Errors: 1 Avg Response Time: 3.358 Avg Throughput: 23.53 Current Throughput: 420 Bytes Received: 193028 I believe that the connect errors are caused by the low end test environment, but is there a way I can tune MySql to accept more connections? Thanks.
