Microsoft and bpm

This question is for people who follow Microsoft's BPM offering and WF. I was looking at their website http://www.microsoft.com/soa/ but much of the info seems to be from 2007 as if nothing new is happening after that. I know that IBM and others are more stronger in the whole SOA, ESB area but is it that microsoft not paying too much attention to this area? or is it the market is not interested as much as they are in Java based offerings from other vendors who have consulting arms? Also what do you think about the success of WF?
