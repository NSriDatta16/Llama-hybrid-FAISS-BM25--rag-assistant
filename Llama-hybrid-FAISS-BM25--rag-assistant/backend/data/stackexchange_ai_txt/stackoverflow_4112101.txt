SVD can be used to compare images (blocks) by applying SVD to two images and then comparing only the SVD approximations of them, up to a certain order. This can extended to more than two images by treating the SVD result as a feature vector (-> machine learning) for e.g. k-nearest neighbor or Cluster analysis . SVD based image compression ("approximation") is e.g. described here: http://online.redwoods.cc.ca.us/instruct/darnold/laproj/fall2001/adamdave/textwriteup.pdf .
