I think your markup is confused: A B C using this in the body of repeat: $(obj).clone().text('A 1').insertAfter(obj); should produce: A A 1 B C Likewise using this as the body of your remove function: $(obj).siblings('div:first').remove(); should then do this: A 1 B C Id that what youre trying to do or ami i misunderstanding? Also what is the siginifigance of the "repeat*" class or was that a thing to use as a selector for what youre trying to implement?
