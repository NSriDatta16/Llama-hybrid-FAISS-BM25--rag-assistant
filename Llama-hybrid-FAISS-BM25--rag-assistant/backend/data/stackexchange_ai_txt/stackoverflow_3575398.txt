On my humble opinion you must think on the receivers of the mail you are trying to send. I mean, if they have Mail User Agents that support a given format or not. Also, you should be aware of making a compatible HTML e-mail otherwise it won't be interpreted right on every Mail User Agent. Hope that helps,
