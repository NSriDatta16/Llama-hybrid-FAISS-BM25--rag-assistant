Analyzing microbiome and clinical data for event-prediction

I am analyzing clinical data and complex microbiome data in a longitudinal study. I already compared different groups at baseline and between baseline and "events" using linear mixed models (LMMs) and permutation-based analyses. Now, I would like to explore predictive modeling. During the time of the study some participants encountered "events". I would like to use explainable machine learning to model the risk for these events and find risk clinical/microbiome risk factors. I have no knowledge on this so far but am willing to learn - where would be a good starting point? I am working with R. Best regards and thank you for your help!
