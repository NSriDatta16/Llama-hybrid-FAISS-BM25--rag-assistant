Ok, figured this out. Had to insert extendedDesktop desktop into my app.xml file. and also into the same xml file. At lease Adobe Air 2.0 is needed, and ADT needs to be set in the Path. I put a list of the steps I took in getting the Air to Exe on my blog if you interested. UPDATE: Serje Jespers created a drag-n-drop tool to accomplish this task here
