Visual Studio 2010 - Is there a plugin for customizing the compiler output?

Basically, our solution is composed of about 30 sub-projects.. and growing. Compiling this monster is fast and compiler warnings/errors/general output just scrolls by in a mishmash of ... well, poo. On unix it's easy to write a filter to "pretty-ify" the compiler output into something readable and, ultimately, useful. Has anyone done this for VS2010? Something color coded as a minimum and one that would consolidate all the different projects would be ideal. Essentially, I'd love to have my compiler output displayed in a tree form with options to have all the children be closed unless there is a warning or error. I also don't mind creating something for this or even having a macro that runs after the compiling is done that creates a more organized output of the whole mess. Thanks in advance, Scott
