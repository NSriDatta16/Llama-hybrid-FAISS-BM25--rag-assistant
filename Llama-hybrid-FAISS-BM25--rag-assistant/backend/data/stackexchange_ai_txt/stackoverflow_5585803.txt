gcov on larger projects (static libraries, ...)

I'm working on larger project which has the following directory layout: Source MyA aa.cpp ab.cpp ac.cpp MyB ba.cpp bb.cpp bc.cpp MyTest testaa.cpp testab.cpp testac.cpp testba.cpp testbb.cpp testbc.cpp main.cpp Build MyA aa.o ab.o ac.o libMyA.a (static library) MyB ba.o bb.o bc.o libMyB.a (static library) MyTest testaa.o testab.o testac.o testba.o testbb.o testbc.o MyTest (executable) After compiling with -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage I execute the MyTest application inside the Build/MyTest directory. As expected there are *.gcno and *.gcda files inside the Build directory. After running gcov inside the MyTest directory different *.gcov files are produced but unfortunately not for everything inside MyA and MyB, although every function is called inside this two libraries. Tried different options but somehow I'm unable to create useful (means correct) *.gcov files with this layout. If I copy every cpp inside one directory and repeat the steps everything works as expected and the coverage analysis is perfect.
