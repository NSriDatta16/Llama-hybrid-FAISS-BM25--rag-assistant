Sticky mouse when dragging controls in VS2005

Maybe this is a dumb question, but I have the following behavior in Visual Studio 2005 while designing forms: 1 - Drop a control onto the form (suppose it's a Label, just for discussion) 2 - Drag that label to a specific location (aligning w/other controls, whatever) 3 - Release the mouse button 4 - The control is still stuck to the mouse!!! To get it un-stuck from the mouse, I have to hit ESC, which restores the Label to it's original location. This is driving me nuts. I literally have to use the arrow keys to move each control into place, pixel-by-pixel. I don't observe this behavior anywhere else in VS2005, nor do I observe it in the OS in general. I am running on Windows XP inside a Parallels Virtual Machine, hosted on OS X. I don't think there is a driver problem though, b/c as I already said, no other apps demonstrate anything like this. Please tell me there is some tiny checkbox buried somewhere that will turn off this behavior.
