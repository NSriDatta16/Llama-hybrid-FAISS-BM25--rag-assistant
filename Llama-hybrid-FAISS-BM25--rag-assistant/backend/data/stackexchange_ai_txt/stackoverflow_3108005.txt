Arm assembler right shifting after multiplpy long?

Newbie ARM assembler question. I am writing my first arm assembler program and I am trying to code this C fragment. int x = somevalue1 > 24); acc += (long long) c * a; I have coded the first part and computed the sum in r10, r11 registers. @ r6 =a, r4 = b, r0 = x,r2 =y, r3=c smull r10, r11, r6, r4 @acc = a * b smlal r10, r11, r0, r2 @acc += x * y Now I need to extract the value of "res" back from the r10 and r11 registers by right shifting the "long long" by 24 bits. How do I do that ? -thanks,
