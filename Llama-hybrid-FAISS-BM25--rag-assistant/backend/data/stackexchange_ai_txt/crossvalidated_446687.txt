there is also a simulation-based sensitivity analysis for matching estimators, which is described in Nannici (2007) and Ichino et al. (2008). In Stata, the program sensatt can perform this kind of analysis. Moreover, you could imagine a binary unmeasured confounder and stratify on it as proposed by Greenland (1996) and discussed in the context of matching by Harding (2003). This idea can again be combined with simulation techniques, see e.g. Groenwold et al. (2010) or Liu et al. (2013). In general, the latter two papers provide a good overview about sensitivity analysis techniques. Further approaches, which are not specific to matching but readily applicable to matching, are e.g. described in Arah et al. (2008), VanderWeele & Arah (2011), Blackwell (2013), Ding & VanderWeele (2016) and VanderWeele & Ding (2017). If you want to work with a minimal set of assumptions, it might be interesting to have a look at the literature on non-parametric bounds for average treatment effects (e.g. Manski, 1990).
