we all are new to Magento as the documentation is very scarce and incomplete. I advice you to take a look into this method : setTypeInstance from the Product model. and into this class Mage_Downloadable_Model_Product_Type . As you are creating the product through the API, the only issue is to find the correct format to put this data into the productData array that is required by the API. Probably in your array you'll need something like this: // this is speculation "type" => "downloadable", "download_path" => "url"
