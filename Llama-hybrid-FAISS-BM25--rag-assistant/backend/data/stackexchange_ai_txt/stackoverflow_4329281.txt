Agree with Dragontamer. Server side frameworks and client side frameworks solve different problems. Yes, you can access the server with a client side framework like jQuery or EXT, but you still need to communicate with an application server on the server. Application server (ASP, PHP, ColdFusion, etc) would be the M and the C in an MVC app, and serve up the "V". The client side framework would make the V pretty and add client side functionality (e.g. manipulating the data provided by the application server, such as sorting table data without refreshing the page). Two completely different animals that serve two completely different purposes.
