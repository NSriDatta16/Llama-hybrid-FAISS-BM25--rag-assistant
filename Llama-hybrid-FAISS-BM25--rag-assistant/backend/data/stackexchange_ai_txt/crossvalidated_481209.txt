Using an old trained model on a new data - comparing two populations

I have two populations with the same set of features. The range of the features' values is also the same. I trained Random Forest Algorithm on the first population. Thus, I wonder whether or not I can use the model for classification of the second dataset: how can I determine whether the model is suitable for the new data? I was thinking to compare each feature between the populations using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test since the features aren't distributed normally. But the problem is that my datasets are huge and I received the results that all features are significantly different. So I am not sure that this is the right was to compare between the populations... I would be happy to receive help!
