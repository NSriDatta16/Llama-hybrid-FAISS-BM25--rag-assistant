UIWebView rotation and memory problem

I have an UIWebView that loads a embedded XHTML like this: body = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height)]; body.scalesPageToFit = YES; body.backgroundColor = [UIColor scrollViewTexturedBackgroundColor]; body.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin; [self.view addSubview:body]; [body loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"article16" ofType:@"xhtml"]isDirectory:NO]]]; This XHTML have a lot of images, and when I rotate the device I got some memory warnings, and sometimes the app crashes. If I remove the autoresizing mask, specifically the UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth (I have tryed with only UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleLeftMargin and UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin with no problems), the memory warning stops, and the app does not crash anymore. If I remove all autoresizing mask, and set the new webView frame in didRotate or willRotate, I got the same warnings as using the UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth. There's a app, called Atomic Web that could open the same XHTML and rotate with no memory warnings, and safari can open it as well, but if I create a project with only that UIWebView, the app sometimes crashes. Someone knows what this may be? Can I set the webview frame in other way? Why can't I use the autoresizing mask? Thanks for your attention.
