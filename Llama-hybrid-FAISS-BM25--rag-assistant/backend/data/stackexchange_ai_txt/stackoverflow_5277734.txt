Magento - What is the internal url for shipping step in onepage checkout?

I am using an observer to check the shipping information provided by the customer during onepage checkout. By observing the event checkout_controller_onepage_save_shipping_method I want to redirect the customer back to the shipping step to re-enter their information. Following the conversation on this page, What is the correct way to stop a checkout from an event observer in Magento? , I have everything set up, but I do not want to redirect them to cart, just the shipping step. Mage::app()->getResponse()->setRedirect(Mage::getUrl('what/goes/here')); Can I make the code simply refresh the page? Mage::app()->getResponse()->setRedirect(Mage::getUrl('checkout/onepage')); does not work. Thanks!
