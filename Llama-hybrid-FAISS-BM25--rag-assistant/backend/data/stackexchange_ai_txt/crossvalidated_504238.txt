As you have some predictors for the sales variable, I would suggest you to analyze the correlation between different variables and sales. Use those variables as predictors while fitting regression model those have a better correlation. Also, try fitting autoregressive models available for time series analysis. Then you can choose the best model to forecast by accuracy measures and just go with that one.
