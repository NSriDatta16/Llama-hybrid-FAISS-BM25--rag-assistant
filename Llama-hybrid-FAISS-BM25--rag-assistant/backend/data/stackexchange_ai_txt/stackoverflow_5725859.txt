Factor graph is math model, and can be explained only with math equations. In nutshell it is way to explain complex relations between interest variables in your model. Example: A is temperature, B is pressure, components C,D,E are depends on B,A in some way, and component K is depends on B,A. And you want to predict value K based on A and B. So you know only visible states. Basic ML libraries don't allow to model such structure. Neural network do it better. And Factor Graph is exactly solve that problem. Factor graph is an example of deep learning. When it is impossible to present model with features and output, Factor models allow to build hidden states, layers and complex structure of variables to fit real world behavior. Examples are Machine translation alignment, fingerprint recognition, co-reference etc.
