cURL is easier than implementing client side HTTP. All you have to do is set a few options and cURL handles the rest. $curl = curl_init($URL); curl_setopt_array($curl, array( CURLOPT_USERAGENT => 'Mozilla/5.0 (PLAYSTATION 3; 2.00)', CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH => CURLAUTH_ANY, CURLOPT_USERPWD => 'User:Password', CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => True, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION => True // set CURLOPT_HEADER to True if you want headers in the result. ) ); $result = curl_exec($curl); If you need to set a header that cURL doesn't support, use the CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER option, passing an array of additional headers. Set CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION to a callback if you need to parse headers. Read the docs for curl_setopt for more options.
