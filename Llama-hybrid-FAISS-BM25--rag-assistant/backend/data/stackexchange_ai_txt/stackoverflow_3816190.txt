What you are talking about is a "cherry-pick" merge. Overall, cherry-pick merges are not a best practice, so if you are thinking this is going to happen lots, you should probably revisit your branching strategy (e.g. branch on feature, versus branch on release). Then you can simply merge entire branches instead of doing cherry-pick. You are going to find that TFS does not support this type of merge very well. When you merge on changeset, it will merge all files up to and including that changeset. You may be able to get away with labeling the files in the specific changesets and merging based on label, but I'm doubtful that will work. We have a situation in my organization where we needed to support this type of functionality. Ultimately, we wrote a utility that allows us to pick and choose files from multiple changesets and merge them to a branch. The code to do this is relatively straightforward.
