One of the differences is that bootstrap does not preserve the order of the observations. It will sample observations (or blocks of observations, if using Block Bootstrap) in random order. Because you mentioned MLdP, I assume that you are working with financial time series. A possible disadvantage of bootstrapping is that it will not always preserve some properties of the time series such as autocorrelation and volatility clustering. The Tapered Block Bootstrap mitigates but does not completely eliminate those limitations. In contrast, CPCV preserves the original order of the samples and just uses different parts of the dataset as training and validation data.
