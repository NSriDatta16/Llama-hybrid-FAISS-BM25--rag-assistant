TOC and figure side by side in a slide

I want to put a figure and the TOC side by side in one slide where it would look like TOC Figure I have tried to include them each in a minipage respectively and then put them both in a figure environment. But the result does not look good, for the TOC is formatted as a paragraph, instead of an itemize look. So, does anybody have a better solution? Thanks in advance. PS I use beamer for creating slides.
