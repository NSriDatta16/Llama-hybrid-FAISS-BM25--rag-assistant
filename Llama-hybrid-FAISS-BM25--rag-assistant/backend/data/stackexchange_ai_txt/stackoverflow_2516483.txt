The new HTML5 feature to persist data locally (localStorage) should help you here. In addition to coockies, now there are session and local storage objects, as well as, a simple version of relational database (all storing data on your local harddisk). One hint when storing/retrieving objects to localStorage ... it is a simple implementation of the Map interface, so the safest way to persist your object is by serializing them via JSON.stringify function and parse retrieved string with JSON.parse.
