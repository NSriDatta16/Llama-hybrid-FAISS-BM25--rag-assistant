I guess the relevant information is The database is already in use by another process: org.hsqldb.persist.NIOLockFile@882e422e[file =D:\product\10.1.3.1\OracleAS_1\j2ee\home\prodDb.lck Seems like there has been an unclean shutdown of the application or something like that and the HSQL database wasn't able release the lock. Or the user the application is running with has no privileges to access the file D:\product\10.1.3.1\OracleAS_1\j2ee\home\prodDb.lck I would strongly encourage you to use a different type of database in the production environment. Alternatives are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL, Derby, etc.
