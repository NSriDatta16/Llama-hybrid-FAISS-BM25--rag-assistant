Identifying trends in mutually exclusive categorical variables

I'm posting here as I'm not even sure where to start Googling. Say I have a system that can be in one of three states – A, B, or C – and only one of these states when observed, which I do annually. A time series of such observation might look like this: # Seed RNG set.seed(33550336) # Define data frame df If I was looking at numeric data, my first exploration tool looking for trends may be plotting the data over time, then fitting a simple linear model. I'm not sure what the equivalent is here for mutually exclusive categorical data. I could consider a particular state – A, for instance – and take a running mean of whether the system is in this state ( TRUE ) or not in this state ( FALSE ). df %<>% mutate(state_A = ifelse(state == "A", TRUE, FALSE), rollmean = rollmean(state_A, k = 3, fill = NA)) # Plot results ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = rollmean)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + geom_point() + xlab("Year") + ylab("Rolling mean") Okay, so there seems to be a trend, but this seems to be neglecting important information, since A, B, and C are all interrelated. I expect that there is an abundance of literature on analysing such data, so can someone suggest a foothold where I can get started? What would be the first analysis you do when working with these data?
