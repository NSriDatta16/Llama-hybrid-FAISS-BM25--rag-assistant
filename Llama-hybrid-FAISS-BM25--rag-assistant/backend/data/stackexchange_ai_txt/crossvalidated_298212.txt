What you are asking are some fundamental questions about regression analysis that are not just about your specific use case. Hence, I recommend you reading more on regression analysis or take an online course such as Statistical Learning thought by those whom actually proposed some of the regularization method I'm discussing: How do I select the one (or combination of) independent variable(s) that should represent student effort? (I imagine some will be strongly correlated, so might not be good to use in combination.) Selecting independent (or not so independent) variables depend on the regularization method used for logistic regression analysis. There are many of them such as LASSO (L1), Ridge Regression (L2), and Elastic Net . Have a look at this question . Each of these regularization methods treat correlated variables/features differently. L1, favors one and ignores the other (zero weight), while L2 distributes weights equally, and Elastic Net is basically a mix of both. This is from Elastic Net Wikipedia page: if there is a group of highly correlated variables, then the LASSO tends to select one variable from a group and ignore the others. To overcome these limitations, the elastic net adds a quadratic part to the penalty, which when used alone is ridge regression (known also as Tikhonov regularization). Now, regarding your second question: Is it okay to control for differences between courses (MOOCs) by adding course_id as an additional independent variable to the logistic regression? (This option seems to yield higher prediction accuracy and better model fit.) This is totally fine as long as you what you are doing which is separating the contribution of variables within course vs. among all courses. This is a very important topic in the regression analysis and very popular in clinical research. By creating a feature such as course_id , you'd need to also perform a regression for each course separately to analyze the contribution of variables for each course (within group). The weights (or contribution of variables) that you get when training on all courses together with course_id , would simply tell you the amount of contribution of variables for all courses, in general.
