VBA has two functions: TypeName and TypeOf (TypeOf does not have a VBA documentation article, but the function exists nonetheless). However, for a good example of their use, you can refer to the Determining Object Type article from the VB.NET documentation. Generic object variables (that is, variables you declare as Object) can hold objects from any class. When using variables of type Object, you may need to take different actions based on the class of the object; for example, some objects might not support a particular property or method. Visual Basic provides two means of determining which type of object is stored in an object variable: the TypeName function and the TypeOf...Is operator. TypeName and TypeOfâ€¦Is The TypeName function returns a string and is the best choice when you need to store or display the class name of an object, as shown in the following code fragment: Dim Ctrl As Control = New TextBox MsgBox(TypeName(Ctrl)) The TypeOf...Is operator is the best choice for testing an object's type, because it is much faster than an equivalent string comparison using TypeName. The following code fragment uses TypeOf...Is within an If...Then...Else statement: If TypeOf Ctrl Is Button Then MsgBox("The control is a button.") End If
