From a comment: The memory limitations are not very severe but the memory footprint easily grows to GBs and when we have competing processes for memory, it gets very slow. I want to reserve some memory from OS so that thrashing is minimal even when too many other processes come. Jagmal Let's take a different tack then. The problem isn't really with your Perl script in particular. Instead, all the processes on the machine are consuming too much memory for the machine to handle as configured. You can "reserve" memory, but that won't prevent thrashing. In fact, it could make the problem worse because the OS won't know if you are using the memory or just saving it for later. I suspect you are suffering the tragedy of the commons . Am I right that many other users are on the machine in question? If so, this is more of a social problem than a technical problem. What you need is someone (probably the System Administrator) to step in and coordinate all the processes on the machine. They should find the most extravagant memory hogs and work with their programmers to reduce the cost on system resources. Further, they ought to arrange for processes to be scheduled so that resource allocation is efficient. Finally, they may need to get more or improved hardware to handle the expected system load.
