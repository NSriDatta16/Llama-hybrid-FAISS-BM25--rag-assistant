For such response variables you need to respect the nature of the data by using a semiparametric ordinal model such as the proportional odds model which generalizes the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests. See here for resources for this model. Don't select a model by "significance" or $R^2$ . Fully pre-specify the model using subject matter knowledge. Otherwise the standard errors and P-values will be next to meaningless. I am unclear about the repeated measures part of the design, i.e., how many observations there are per subject. Since you mentioned mixed models I assuming there is > 1 observation per subject. You can deal with this using a mixed effects ordinal model using the R ordinal or mixor packages or a Bayesian proportional odds model using the rmsb or brms packages. Bayesian methods work better when random effects are involved.
