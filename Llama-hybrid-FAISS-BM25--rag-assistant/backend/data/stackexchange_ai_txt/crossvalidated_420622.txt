Model/link function to deal with dependent variable in range [-1,1]?

My dependent variable, $Y$ , contains values anywhere from -1 to 1 (i.e. it is bounded continuously on the range $[-1,1]$ ). I know that a regular OLS regression on such a variable would sometimes create predictions that would go under -1, or above 1, and I immediately thought a link function could be of use here (as it is in the case of logistic regression with binary variables), but it seems no link functions specifically constrain the predicted output to be in the aforementioned range. Neither Python's statsmodels' , not even wikipedia , mention a link function that could help out in this situation. What would be the way to approach such a modelling problem? If a link function does not exist for this specific case, are there other ways to handle such a dependent variable? Thank you ahead of time for any advice.
