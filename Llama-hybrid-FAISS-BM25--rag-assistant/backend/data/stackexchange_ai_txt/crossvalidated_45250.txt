You should consider the expertise of a voter as a latent variable of your system. You may then be able to solve your problem with bayesian inference . A representation as graphical model could be like this : Let's denote the variables $A$ for the true answer, $V_i$ for the vote of the voter $i$ and $H_i$ for its history. Say that you also have an "expertise" parameter $\mu_i$ such that $\Pr(A=V_i) = \mu_i$. If you put some prior on these $\mu_i$ -for example a Beta prior- you should be able to use the Bayes theorem to infer $\Pr(\mu_i \mid H_i)$, and then integrate over $\mu_i$ to compute $$\Pr(A \mid V_i, H_i) = \int_{\mu_i} \Pr(A, \mu_i \mid A_i, H_i)~ \mathrm{d}\mu_i$$ These systems are difficult to solve. You can use the EM algorithm as an approximation, or use complete likelihood maximisation scheme to perform exact Bayesian inference. Take a look on this paper Variational Inference for Crowdsourcing , Liu, Peng and Ihler 2012 ( presented yesterday at NIPS ! ) for detailed algorithms for solving this task.
