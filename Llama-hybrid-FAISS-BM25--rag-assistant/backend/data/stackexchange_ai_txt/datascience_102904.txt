BNF (Backus normal form) is a general framework that can be adopted to a variety of contexts. JSGF stands for Java Speech Grammar Format, thus is designed to work the Java programming language. If I wanted to leverage a larger community of knowledge and have my work compatible with as many systems as possible, I would use BNF. If I was coding in Java, I would use JSGF.
