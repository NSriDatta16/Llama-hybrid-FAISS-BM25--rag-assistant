For a start, you appear to be slightly confused about the args for re.sub. The first arg is the pattern. You have '[^äÄöÖåÅA-Za-z0-9]' which matches each character which is NOT in the Finnish alphabet nor a digit. The second arg is the replacement. You have """[^A-Za-z0-9]*""" ... so each of those non-Finnish-alphanumeric characters is going to be replaced by the literal string [^A-Za-z0-9]* . It's reasonable to assume that this is not what you want. What do you want to do? You need to explain your third line; after your first 2 lines, word will be a list of unicode objects, which is A Good Thing. However the encoding= and the errors= indicate that the unknown (to us) smart_str() is converting your lovely unicode back to UTF-8. Processing data in UTF-8 bytes instead of Unicode characters is EVIL, unless you know what you are doing. What encoding directive do you have at the top of your source file? Advice: Get your data into unicode. Work on it in unicode. All your string constants should have the u prefix; if you consider that too much wear and tear on your typing fingers, at least put it on the non-ASCII constants e.g. u'[^äÄöÖåÅA-Za-z0-9]' . When you have done all the processing, encode your results for display or storage using an appropriate encoding. When working with re , consider \w which will match any alphanumeric (and also the underscore) instead of listing out what is alphabetic in one language. Do use the re.UNICODE flag; docs here .
