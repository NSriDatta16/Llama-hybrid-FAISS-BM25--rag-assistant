I may be getting overly complex here but I would do something like this: var draggingFile = false; var event2; //elements with the class hotspots are OK var hotspots = $(".hotspots"); //Handlers on the body for drag start & stop $("body").live("dragover", function(event){ draggingFile = true; event2 = event; }); $("body").live("dragexit dragleave drop", function(event){ draggingFile = false; event2 = event; }); //Function checks to see if file is being dragged over an OK hotspot regardless of other elements infront var isTargetOK = function(x, y){ hotspots.each(function(i, el){ el2 = $(el); var pos = el2.offset(); if(x => pos.left && x pos.top && y BTW that's probably not going to work straight off the bat, so you'll have to tweak it a bit to work with your code.
