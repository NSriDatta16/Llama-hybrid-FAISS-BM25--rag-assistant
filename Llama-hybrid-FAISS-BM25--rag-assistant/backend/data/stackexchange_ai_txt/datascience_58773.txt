Predicting complete time series for given parameter sets

I am searching for an approach that is able to predict a complete time series for a given parameter set. Imagine a robotic arm which has a starting position and a target position. There is a sensor mounted to the top of the arm. For random start and target positions I can record the sensor values as a time series. Now, I would like to predict the sensor values for a previously unknown start and target position. Currently, the only approaches I can find try to forecast the next values for a given time series. Other approaches aim for generating new sequences for a given set of sequences, which is close to what I would like, but without the possibility to connect the sequences to parameter sets. Does anyone have an idea?
