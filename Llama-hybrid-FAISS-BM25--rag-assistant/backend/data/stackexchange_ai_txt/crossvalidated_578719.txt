confused about acf/pacf of this stock index

all I'm trying to determine the AR and MA of a time series by looking at the ACF/PACF plots but they doesn't look like the classic examples of the textbooks. it has 264 monthly values of a stock index from 2000 to 2022. The series is not stationary so I take a diff and then plot acf/pacf. As you can see the first and second lags of either plots are not significant but the third lag is. I don't know how to interpret this. Thanks for your help! Edited just to add some extra info (commands are from R) Regarding UNIT Roots: forecast::ndiffs(x) gives me "1", so it should be safe that taking a first difference is ok Regarding seasonality: forecast::nsdiffs(x) gives "0" A plot of the time series: plot(x) after taking the first difference: plot(diff(x)) and finally a descomposition using stl(x)
