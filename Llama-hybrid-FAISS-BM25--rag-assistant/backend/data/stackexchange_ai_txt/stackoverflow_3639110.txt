detect and suppress errors loading javascript file

I want to source a javascript file from facebook http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js The organization I work for has a firewall that blocks access to Facebook, it just goes to an html page that says "Access Denied blah blah blah" I want to be able to put a javascript src tag and detect and suppress the warnings when the browser tries to evaluate the html as javascript. Anyone know how?
