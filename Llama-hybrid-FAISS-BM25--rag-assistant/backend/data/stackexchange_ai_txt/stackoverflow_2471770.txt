According to the Java Security Overview Whitepaper (Page 14 paragraph 2) Java applets and Javaâ„¢ Web Start applications are automatically run with a SecurityManager installed. However, local applications executed via the java command are by default not run with a SecurityManager installed. That should mean that a call to System.getSecurityManager() will return non-null in an applet and will return null when not in an applet. Exceptions are possible, for example a security manager can be specified from the command line when running the program. boolean insideApplet() { return null != System.getSecurityManager(); }
