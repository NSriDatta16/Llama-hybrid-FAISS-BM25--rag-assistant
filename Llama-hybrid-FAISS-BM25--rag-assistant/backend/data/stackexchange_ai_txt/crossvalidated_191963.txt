neural networks - What is meant by "linear combination of inputs"

Just starting out with MLPs. I am reading a tutorial that I found here . It says that the disadvantages of using a linear function is that the neural net will only be restricted to learning " linear combination of inputs " Can someone please explain via an example what a linear combination of an input is ? I know what linearly separable functions are, but what is a linear combination of inputs ?
