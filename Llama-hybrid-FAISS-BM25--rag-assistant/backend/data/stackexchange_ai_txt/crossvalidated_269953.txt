A natural importance sampling distribution in this setting is a Gaussian distribution$$\text{N}(\hat{\theta},\tau^2\hat{\Sigma})$$ where $\hat\theta$ is the maximum likelihood estimator of $(\alpha,\beta)$; $\hat{\Sigma}$ is the asymptotic covariance matrix of $\hat\theta$; $\tau^2$ is a scaling factor that can be calibrated towards optimising the resulting effective sample size. Note that, as remarked in our book Bayesian Essentials with R (p.115-117), one can also exploits this approximation in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Deriving the asymptotic matrix can be done in R as > mod=summary(glm(y~X,family=binomial(link="probit"))) with mod$coeff[,1] corresponding to $\hat\theta$ and mod$cov.unscaled to $\hat\Sigma$.
