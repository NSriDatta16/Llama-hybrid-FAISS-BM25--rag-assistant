Maybe remove all the unecessary parens? But even then I would give it zero in the elegance stakes. The first thing an elegant function must do is to perform one task, and your description of the function - "compares two strings to see if string 'prefix' is contained in string 'other'" simply doesn't make any sense. a prefix must begin a string, not be included in it.
