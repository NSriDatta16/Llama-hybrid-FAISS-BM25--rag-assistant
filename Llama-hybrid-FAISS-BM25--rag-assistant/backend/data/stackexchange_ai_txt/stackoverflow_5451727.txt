Not sure if I fully understand your question -- but you could just add a simple counter for each group: int donations4 = 0; int donations5 = 0; int donations6 = 0; And then increment that counter in each of your switch cases, ex: switch(myInt) { case 4: ... donations4++; break; case 5: ... donations5++; break; case 6: ... donations6++; break; } Then when you're done - simply do the math to find the average. Although this is probably the simplest way, a better way would be to treat each group as its own object, and have the object internally track the # of donations, as well as the sum and average. -- Dan
