How can I know in which IClasspathEntry an IJavaElement belongs to?

I have an IJavaElement and I wish to know which one of the IClasspathEntry s of an IJavaProject the element belongs to. I have a feeling that I'm missing something obvious, but I just couldn't find a simple solution to that. Thanks in advance for any forthcoming tips and answers.
