Preventing IFRAME embedding, but with one exception

Let's say we have a web-page at a given location (like www.foo.com/page1.html ) and that page contains this (global) code: if (self != top) { top.location.replace(location.href); } So, if we try to load that page into an IFRAME, the page will "jump" out of the iframe into the browser window, which will (as a consequence) destroy the page that contained the iframe. This is OK, but I would like to implement an exception to that rule. Specifically, there is this other page on a different domain (like www.bar.com/page2.html ), and I would like that this other page is able to embed the first page via an IFRAME. How would I have to modify the code of the first page, so that it allows to be embedded into the other page? Is this OK? if (self != top && top.location.href !== "http://www.bar.com/page2.html") { top.location.replace(location.href); }
