Conditional generative models for large numbers of classes

I'm looking for a conditional generative model — could be cGAN or cVAE — that is particularly well suited to large numbers of classes. I'm expecting to require 500+ classes, but so many models are demonstrated using MNIST, or similar, that it's hard to have a good idea of how they'll perform with more than a few classes. Any advice appreciated.
