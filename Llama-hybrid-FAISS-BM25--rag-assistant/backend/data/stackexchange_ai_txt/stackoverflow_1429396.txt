It really depends on who you are and what your goals are. My familiarity with TIBCO is that it was a messaging system used by many of our competitors in financial services industries to send messages securely from web-based front ends back to mainframe for processing, and to deliver things such as stock quotes to our front end. We had our own messaging product which bore a strange resemblance to a messaging product that one of the higher-ups in our company previously worked at :) We had a 300 million technology budget, but keep in mind we also had 2 large datacenters and several production centers, as well as 3 offices for development. Now, a company in our situation might find it a good deal to use something like TIBCO out of the box (we could probably have saved a substantial chunk of that 300 million). If you don't have that kind of budget and your demands are much less, then for you it might indeed be a "ripoff". But, to develop that kind of system yourself, for an organization such as the one I worked at ... I'm sure it would use a substantial chunk of that 300 million.
