Why there is no any Sql Server in Add Connection list

I use Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional (I installed all components). Here is what I'm trying to do. I create a new ASP.NET project. Then I open Server Explorer (View->Server Explorer), right click on Data Connections and choose Add Connection. Then I choose Microsoft SQL Server and press Continue, but the 'Server name' list is empty. I launch Sql Server Configuration Manager and it shows that SQL Server is in running state (Agent and Browser are stopped) Why there is no any Sql Server in Add Connection list? -------------------------------------------------------------- I allow remote filestream for SQl Server, so no I can choose server in the list, but when I enter new database name and click Ok I get a error "sql server was not found or was not accessible" -------------------------------------------------------------- Here is a list of installed programs with 'SQL' filter
