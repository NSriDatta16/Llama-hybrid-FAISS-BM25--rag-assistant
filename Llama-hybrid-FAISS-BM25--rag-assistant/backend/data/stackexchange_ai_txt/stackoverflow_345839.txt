As pointed out by Aaron Fischer, for the time being the VS Silverlight designer is read-only. I'd just like to add that you still can drag-and-drop controls from the toolbox into your XAML markup. That's especially helpful when you add a control from an external assembly - say, a DataGrid - because it automatically creates the reference to the assembly and maps the appropriate namespace.
