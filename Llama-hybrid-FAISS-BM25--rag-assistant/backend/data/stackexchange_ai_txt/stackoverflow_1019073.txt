It all depends. What's the point of the project? If it's to become more attractive to employers, figure out what teams in your area are using, and use that framework. Cake and Zend seem to be popular with small and big shops, respectively. If it's to learn about PHP, you're much better off writing your own code from scratch. This forces you to really understand what you're doing at every turn. I'd suggest writing your code test-first. If you just need to get some work done, use the tools you know best, if they're suitable for the problem at hand. IMO, I'd use Yii if I were interested in trying yet another framework. After browsing the source for a minute or two, Yii seems to have pretty nice tests and test coverage, which both makes me trust the code more, and provides working examples of how to use the APIs.
