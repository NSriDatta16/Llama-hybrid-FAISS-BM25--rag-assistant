If I understand your question correctly, then this differs from the usual meta-analysis setup in that you want to estimate not only a common mean, but also a common variance. So the sampling model for the raw data is $y_{ij} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ for observation $i = 1,...n_j$ from study $j = 1,...,K$. If that is right, then I think the MLE of $\mu$ is simply the pooled sample mean, i.e., $$ \hat\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^K n_j \bar{y}_j,\qquad N = \sum_{j=1}^K n_j.$$ The MLE for $\sigma$ is a little trickier because it involves both within- and between-study variance (think one-way ANOVA). But just pooling the sample variances works too (i.e., is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$): $$\tilde\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N - K}\sum_{j=1}^K (n_j - 1) s_j^2$$ If $N$ is large, $K$ is not too big, and you are using weak priors, then the Bayesian estimates should be quite similar to these.
