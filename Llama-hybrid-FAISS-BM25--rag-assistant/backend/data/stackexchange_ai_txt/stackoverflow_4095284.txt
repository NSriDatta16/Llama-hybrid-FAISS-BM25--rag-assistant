design bigger/more complex applications When you say design bigger/more complex applications , i assume what you have in mind is what are generally referred to as "Enterprise scale applications". You can check out this question which talks about various criteria that help to try and objectify as to what it is that makes an application an enterprise scale application. Talking about these concerns, Small applications might not necessarily have a lot of these concerns applicable to them. Even with enterprise apps, with such a large set of concerns that need to be addressed, what differentiates the design is what concerns are given more importance. Also, in case of conflicting concerns, which one is chosen over the other. When designing for your application, if you try and keep these concerns in mind and make design decisions based on these concerns, then that will be one way to try of moving in the right direction. HOWEVER , this is easier said than done. Though seemingly a simple looking list, getting a design right is something seasoned architects lose sleep / hair / life over and is usually NOTORIOUSLY difficult to get right especially for a beginner. Some of these decisions are things learnt only from experience. In my personal experience, what greatly helped me was working with and under the supervision of experienced architects. To be able to learn and gaining the benefit of their knowledge and experience teaches you things no book / blog can. But no matter what i try, how long i try: i just can't get it right. My designs always seem wrong to me somehow. Frankly speaking, you are totally the wrong person to judge. How do you really know that your design is wrong? The only real way to say design is wrong is if your application doesnt do what it was supposed to do. If you want to have some validation of your design, then i suggest you ask someone who has worked on similar size projects which you have in mind and ask them to look at your design and review it - from their perspective. That, will really give you some good idea as to where your design is really at. Cause of that i never drawn through a bigger project, i'm kinda never satisfied with the structure of my program. Unfortunately, some of the real complexities in designing an enterpise application result from a variety of things that are just not possible to simulate otherwise. Some of them can be organizational constraints e.g. my client's CTO does not use allow the use of X technology ) to others like we need to integrate our application with that home grown MS Access app that one of our vendors is using. Such complications to the application and its design is something that you have to experience and there is usually a lot to be learned from it. To get such experience, you have to work in such places which provide this kind of opportunity. Usually, what i have seen is that the bigger the company, the more complicated their IT environment is and that gives the most opportunity for complex scenarios to arise
