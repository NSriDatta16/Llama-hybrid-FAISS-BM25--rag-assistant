A hash is supposed to be a unique combination of values from 00 to FF (hexadecimal) that represents a certain piece of data, be it a file or a string of bytes. It is used primarily for password storage and verification, and to test if a file is the same as another file (i.e. you hash two files, if they match, they're the same file). Generally, any of the SHA algorithms are preferred over MD5, due to hash collisions that can occur when using it. See this Wikipedia article .
