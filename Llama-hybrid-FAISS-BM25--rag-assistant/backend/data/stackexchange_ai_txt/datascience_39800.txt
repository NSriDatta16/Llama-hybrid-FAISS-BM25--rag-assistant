How to implement keras LSTM time series

I am learning how to implement Keras LSTM on a simple time series data. The dataset I'm using has $12$ columns and $300k$ rows. Each group of $200$ rows represents one time-series cycle. Then, the time starts again from zero and run for the next $200$ rows. I want to make predictions for sixof the columns. My questions are, how many (multiple of 200?) rows do I choose for train/test sets? Is my batch size $200$ ? What is the basis for choosing number of neurons?
