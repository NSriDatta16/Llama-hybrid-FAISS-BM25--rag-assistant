Program is skipping over Getline() without taking user input

This is a very strange problem, when my program asks the user for the address, instead of waiting for input, it seems to skip the getline() function completely Answerinput: cout > answer; cout > stringentry; cout > stringentry; cout > Record[Entrynumber].SSN; cout > Record[Entrynumber].Age; cout output to console would you like to add another entry to the archive? (Y/N):Y began record number 6+ 1. Enter the last name of the person to be entered John Enter the first name of the person John Enter the SSN of the person 22222222 Enter the age of the person 22 Enter the address of the person you entered: Joh,Joh 22222222 22 *¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ //////////////22 more lines of'|'////////////////////////////////////////////// ... ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦l3-j would you like to add another entry to the archive? (Y/N): Both cin.getline() and getline() do the same thing. I'm using MVC++ 2008. All of the fields in the Record array are structs, Record[Entrynumber].Address is a char array.
