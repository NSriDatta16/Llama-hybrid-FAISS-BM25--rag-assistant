Principal Component Analysis Question - Why do the Loadings Not Change As You Change the Number of PCs?

I am trying to teach myself how to use R Shiny and as a part of this dashboard I'm constructing, I have a section where a user performs principal component analysis and can use a slider to choose the number of PCs to include. Here is a snapshot of my code: PCA=preProcess(to_be_PCAed, method = "pca", pcaComp = input $num) rots=round(PCA$ rotation,6) The user will use the slider to choose from 20 PCs down to just 2. Whenever I display the matrix of loadings, the individual loadings for each variable do not change within a PC when I add or subtract another PC. Is that how Principal Component analysis should work? What am I missing here? My original thought was that the loadings determined which PC a variable would be classified under and I would think that the variables would be grouped together differently based on the number of principal components. So, I was expecting as I add or subtract a PC, the loadings would change. Can someone explain why this is not the case?
