On my (slightly older) system: root@tower:~/desktop/ccan/ccan/tap # dpkg -L libpcap0.7-dev /. /usr /usr/lib /usr/lib/libpcap.a /usr/include /usr/include/net /usr/include/net/bpf.h /usr/include/pcap.h /usr/include/pcap-namedb.h /usr/share /usr/share/man /usr/share/man/man3 /usr/share/man/man3/pcap.3.gz Hmm, seems like they should be there: root@tower:~/desktop/ccan/ccan/tap # man 3 pcap Reformatting pcap(3), please wait... You should have man/3 docs, I looked at mine, the formatting is just wretched. I grabbed the source to the library via apt-get source, it looks like the only docs bundled either way are the man pages. You might try their mailing list, if you do, be sure to answer your question here :)
