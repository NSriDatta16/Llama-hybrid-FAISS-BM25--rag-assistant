If you have no/ limited variability, then train a multinomial regression or neural network on each piece, centred.then you just sweep/place the network over each square. ( Standardized to a fixed size)... You might want to Google, correlation filters too. ( Ie you should do template matching, not hog etc).. Apart from standardising the size/location, you should standardize the colour...ie black on brown square, black on white square etc .. perhaps by doing Laplacian filter first?
