My advice would be to create a folder Development under /Applications and put the Eclipse folder you downloaded into Development then right click on it and choose duplicate(as many times as you need it). Finally rename the folders you duplicated "Eclipse - Java", "Eclipse - Blackberry", etc. or similar. That's all you'll have to do. Mac applications generally don't have an installation routine, you usually just drag and drop them to the applications folder.
