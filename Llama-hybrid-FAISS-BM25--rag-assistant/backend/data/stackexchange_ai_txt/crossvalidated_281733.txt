The online VB algorithm for LDA implemented in gensim and scikit in addition to computing topic distributions on new unseen documents implicitly computes $q(z_{id} = k) = \phi_{dwk}$ which is the probability of assigning a given a word $i$ in document $d$ to topic $k$. It is computed implicitly to save storage space (where for online LDA: $d$ is a batch-size of documents instead of the entire corpus). $\phi_{dwk}$ can be seen as a proxy to what the collapsed Gibbs sampler is doing by assigning topic labels to individual words in every document.
