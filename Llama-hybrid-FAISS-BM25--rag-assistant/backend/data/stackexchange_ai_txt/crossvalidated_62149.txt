Generating Bayesian network graph with dsc file

I'm using a free version of Bayesian network software called Netica. It allows only 15 nodes for the free version. Do you know any other software or R package that generate a kind of graph below using a dsc file? I know R package called bnlearn has a function read.dsc for dsc files, but am not sure how to make a graph. If you know how you can get R to make this kind of or similar graph (with probabilities of influence in each node box), please walk me through R scripts.
