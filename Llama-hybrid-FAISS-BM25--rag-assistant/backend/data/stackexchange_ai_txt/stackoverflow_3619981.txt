My standard answer to this question is: Refactor the Low-hanging Fruit . In this case, I'd be inclined to take one of the 10K-line classes and seek out opportunities to Sprout Class , but that's just my own proclivity; you might be more comfortable changing other things first (setting up source control was an excellent first step!) Test what you can; refactor what can't be tested, take a step at a time, and make it better. Keep in mind as you progress how much better you are making things; if you concentrate only on how bad things still are, you're likely to become discouraged.
