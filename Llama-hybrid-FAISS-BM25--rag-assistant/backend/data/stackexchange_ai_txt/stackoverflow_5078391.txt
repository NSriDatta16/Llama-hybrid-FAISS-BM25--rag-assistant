I also recommend using Quartz as Johan already suggested, it is a well-established solution for job scheduling in Java applications and also allows for central job storage in a database and clustering of multiple Tomcat instances. In case your web application uses the Spring Framework, you could instead use the built-in scheduling support instead.
