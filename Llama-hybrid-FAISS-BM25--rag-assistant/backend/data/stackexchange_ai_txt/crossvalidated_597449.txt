Relationship between univariate and multivariate normal distribution

I have a portfolio consisting of N assets with known average historical returns ( $r_1$ , $r_2$ , ... $r_N$ ) and a known set of weights ( $a_1$ , $a_2$ , ... $a_N$ ) subject to $\sum_{i=1}^N a_i$ = 1 I am currently running a Monte-Carlo simulation of this portfolio by first aggregating the individual securities to arrive at the portfolio mean and variance $\mu_p$ = $\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\times r_i$ and $\sigma_p^2$ = $\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N a_i a_jCov(r_i, r_j)$ I then draw 10000 random samples over a number of periods T from the univariate normal distribution with mean $\mu_p$ and variance $\sigma_p^2$ to produce projections of future portfolio values. For the purposes of my analysis, however, I'd need to simulate individual assets directly and only then aggregate them to a portfolio using the set of weights I have. So what I tried to do was to draw from a multivariate normal distribution characterised by a vector of means equivalent to ( $r_1$ , $r_2$ , ... $r_N$ ) and a covariance matrix in line with the historical covariance between my assets (which is anyway used to come up with the portfolio covariance $\sigma_p^2$ I was expecting to get equivalent results between the two methodologies (drawing from the univariate with aggregated portfolio moments and drawing from the multivariate with per-asset first and second moments and only then combining it in a portfolio), but it seems like the multivariate random samples always have a slightly lower median return than the univariate random samples. What am I missing here? Is there an additional adjustment needed to be made to the multivariate case? Any ideas are appreciated
