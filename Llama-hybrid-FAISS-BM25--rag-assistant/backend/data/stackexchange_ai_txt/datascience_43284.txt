Multi-Class Classification With Logistic Regression On Binary Data

I am trying to implement a multi-class classifier with using logistic regression. In my dataset, attributes are words, for example first attribute is 1 if the data instance includes word "x" and it is 0 if it does not include the word "x", so all of my attributes are binary. I partially understood how to implement multi-class logistic regression for categorical data from here https://github.com/tpeng/logistic-regression/blob/master/src/Logistic.java . However I could not figured out how to decide the weights when the attributes are binary. I found some academical articles about it but it is too heavy for me. I think this is really simple and well-known thing. How can I do that?
