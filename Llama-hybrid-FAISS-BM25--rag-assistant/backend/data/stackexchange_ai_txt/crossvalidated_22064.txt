Random walk out of sample forecasting

I'm having some problems in writing down in R the out-of-sample forecasting with a Random Walk. I have a multivariate time series (y) and I want to estimate the out of sample forecasting (y(t+k)-y^(t+k/t) result with a RW, for k =1,6,12. I write down this code, it works, but it seems to give me too much low errors. residuals1 I think that I'm doing some mistakes, do you have any suggestions?
