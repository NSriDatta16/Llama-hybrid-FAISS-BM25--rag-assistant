Thank you, all, for the feedback. I was aware of the low-level design patterns common to a programmer's toolbox and I had visited Hillside Group in the past. I will spend more time there. As I investigate further, I think the design patterns I'm after are closely related to data modeling. I am reworking a calendaring data model I threw together and due to emerging requirements some of the enhancements/fixes were a bit awkward. Unfortunately, as design goes, sometimes I have to head far enough down a path, let the requirements emerge, backtrack a bit, and then remodel based on shortcomings discovered from experience. From my experience, the data model plays a huge role in determining not only the elegance of the system, but also its UI. I'll stay posted for other resources that are recommended.
