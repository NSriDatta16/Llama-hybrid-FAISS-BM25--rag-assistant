Apache serving files from non-existent directories

I am sure I have goofed up somewhere in my configs. So this is what is happening. My document root does not have any folder called "2". Yet, if I access, for example, http://www.mostpopularsports.net/2/poll.php or even some totally crazy url like: http://www.mostpopularsports.net/2/poll.php/dsadsdsdsdsdsads apache is serving content from http://www.mostpopularsports.net/2.php (but, the image paths etc are all wrong as can be seen). This has caused serious trouble as Google has indexed some crazy non-existent urls due to this problem (most likely it crawled when I might be changing something .. argh.. never develop live). This is my .htaccess in the document root: Options +FollowSymlinks RewriteEngine on rewritecond %{http_host} ^mostpopularsports.net [nc] rewriterule ^(.*)$ http://www.mostpopularsports.net/$1 [r=301,nc] Options -Indexes And this is the apache virtual host config file inside sites-enabled: ServerAdmin ".........@mostpopularsports.net" ServerName mostpopularsports.net ServerAlias www.mostpopularsports.net CustomLog /var/log/apache2/mostpopularsports.net_access_log "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/mostpopularsports.net_error_log DocumentRoot "/var/www/domains/mostpopularsports.net" Options +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews Options -Indexes Order allow,deny Allow from all AllowOverride All I am stumped :(
