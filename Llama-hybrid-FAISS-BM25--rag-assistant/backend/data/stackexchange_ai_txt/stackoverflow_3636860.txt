It seems you are using an old version of OpenCv since it still uses the .configure mechanism. This is good in a sense, because CMake is not known to be cross-compilation friendly. LDFLAGS="-L/opt/Montavista/pro/devkit/arm/v5t_le/target/usr/lib" This is were the linker will look for libraries. It should be enough. Are you sure the libraries needed by OpenCV are in this PATH ? A first Hack would be to rename the libraries in /usr/lib, so that the linker don't find them, and see if it find the target libraries. This is ugly, maybe more than ugly. Don't do it. Yet. A second solution is to do native compilation. But it an emulated ARM box, not on real, slow and memory poor hardware. I have no experience either with this kind of cross-compile method, but here is a link to get you started. EDIT Wait !!, Which version of OpenCV are you using ? I thought OpenCV was not using .configure et al. ? There is probably a more elegant solution using .configure flags. Or maybe non optionnal libraries are somehow hardcoded.
