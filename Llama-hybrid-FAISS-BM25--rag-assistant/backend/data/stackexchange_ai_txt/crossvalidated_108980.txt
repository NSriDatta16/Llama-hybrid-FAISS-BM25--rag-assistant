I know it's a bit late but anyway my contribution to your question is this: You are using a gaussian kernel to train your one-class svm. This may mislead you for making deductions about the support vectors presence. If you just modify your example and use a linear one-class svm (always better explained in linear case) you will see that your sv are equally distributed in all the space. (I am not suggesting that linear is the best choice, just that are more straight forward to be be explained). As you have defined your question is that all the data points that are used as Support Vector are also considered to be outside the class so your concern is why the majority of sv is outside your class? My guess is that your data is quite dense and in the attempt to model the boundary a lot of your outliers are required for this task. If you make another experiment with sparser data I think that wont be such a problem.
