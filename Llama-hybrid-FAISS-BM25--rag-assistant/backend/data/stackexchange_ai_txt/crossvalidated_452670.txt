Very low specificity in random forests classification model with balanced classes

I've been building a model within a k-fold cross-validation,and seem to be getting pretty much the same results i.e. very high sensitivity and low specificity. What I've tried: Different values of k for the cv Different numbers of trees built Less features, selecting ones I know from clinical experience tend to be important However, it ends up being pretty much the same results, an example of which is below. Do you have any suggestions as to what might improve the specificity? Would e.g. dimensionality reduction or a different kind of model perform better for this kind of data (one continuous variable, the rest binary categorical)?
