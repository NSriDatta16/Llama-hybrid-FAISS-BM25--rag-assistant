When reading descriptions of how GC works, and the part about how long-lived objects end up in generation 2, and the collection of LOH objects happens at full collection only - as does collection of generation 2, the idea that springs to mind is... why not just keep generation 2 and large objects in the same heap, as they're going to get collected together? If that's what actually happens then it would explain how small objects end up in the same place as the LOH - if they're long lived enough to end up in generation 2. And so your problem would appear to be a pretty good rebuttal to the idea that occurs to me - it would result in the fragmentation of the LOH. Summary: your problem could be explained by the LOH and generation 2 sharing the same heap region, although that is by no means proof that this is the explanation. Update: the output of !dumpheap -stat pretty much blows this theory out of the water! The generation 2 and LOH have their own regions.
