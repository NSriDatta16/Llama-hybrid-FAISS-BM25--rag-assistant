Parameter learning in augmented Bayesian Networks

I was reading some material on parameter learning in Bayesian Networks, until this example popped: Although I have kind-of understood beta priors, but I am not being able to relate to this question in any way. Question 1: What does each tuple represent? The material says, to be consistent, we would want: a11 = a21 + b21 and b11 = b21 + b22 Why?
