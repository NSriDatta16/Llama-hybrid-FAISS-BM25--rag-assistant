So the problem really seems to be: the bots want their "bag 'o crap" because it has a high perceived value at a low perceived price. You sometimes offer this item and the bots lurk, waiting to see if it's available and then they buy the item. Since it seems like the bot owners are making a profit (or potentially making a profit), the trick is to make this unprofitable for them by encouraging them to buy the crap. First, always offer the "bag 'o crap". Second, make sure that crap is usually crap. Third, rotate the crap frequently. Simple, no? You'll need a permanent "why is our crap sometimes crap?" link next to the offer to explain to humans what's going on. When the bot sees that there's crap and the crap is automatically purchased, the recipient is going to be awfully upset that they've paid $10 for a broken toothpick. And then an empty trash bag. And then some dirt from the bottom of your shoe. If they buy enough of this crap in a relatively short period of time (and you have large disclaimers all over the place explaining why you're doing this), they're going to lose a fair "bag 'o cash" on your "bag 'o crap". Even human intervention on their part (checking to ensure that the crap isn't crap) can fail if you rotate the crap often enough. Heck, maybe the bots will notice and not buy anything that's been in the rotation for too short a time, but that means the humans will buy the non-crap. Heck, your regular customers might be so amused that you can turn this into a huge marketing win. Start posting how much of the "crap" carp is being sold. People will come back just to see how hard the bots have been bitten. Update: I expect that you might get a few calls up front with people complaining. I don't think you can stop that entirely. However, if this kills the bots, you can always stop it and restart it later.
