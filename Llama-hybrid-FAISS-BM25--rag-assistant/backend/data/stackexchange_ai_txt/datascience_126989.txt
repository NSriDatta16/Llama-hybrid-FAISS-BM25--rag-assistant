Using Text Embeddings for Semantic Search To create embeddings of questions and save them in a vector database for semantic search, you can utilize the OpenAI Embedding API to generate vector embeddings of your questions and then upload those vector embeddings into Pinecone, which can store and index millions/billions of these vector embeddings and search through them at ultra-low latencies. Providing Text for Embedding When providing text for embedding, it's important to consider the variations in the wording of questions that may lead to the same answer. To simplify the search for the right embedding, you can provide multiple questions that refer to a single answer. This approach allows the semantic search pipeline to identify the meaning between each of the queries and enables the system to return the most relevant results. By using these embeddings with Pinecone, you can effectively retrieve the desired information based on the semantic meaning of the queries. You can refer to the documentation for more info Hope that helps!
