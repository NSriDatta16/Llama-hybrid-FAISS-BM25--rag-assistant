Haml Markdown Filter Breaking on Example Ruby Code in Rails

I'm using Haml in rails and have been writting with the :markdown filter (bluecloth gem), but a piece of example code is in ruby and the page tries to execute the #{values}, how can I stop this? Here is the breaking bit of code: :markdown like_frags = [fields].flatten.map { |f| "LOWER(#{f}) LIKE :word#{count}" } or_frags The error that is returned: undefined local variable or method `f' I have found a solution myself but it's far from ideal: - f=nil;count=nil;like_frags=[];word=nil; I place this before the :markdown filter begins. I know it can be done because stackoverflow didn't break when I wrote that, so how can I achieve this too? Thanks in advance!
