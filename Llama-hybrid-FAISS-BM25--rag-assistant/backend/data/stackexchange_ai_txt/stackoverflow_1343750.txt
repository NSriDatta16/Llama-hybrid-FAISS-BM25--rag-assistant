Russ Greiner has a great list of project topics for his machine learning course, so that's a great place to start. Both GAs and ANNs are learners/classifiers. So I ask you the question, what is an interesting "thing" to learn? Maybe it's: Detecting cancer Predicting the outcome between two sports teams Filtering spam Detecting faces Reading text (OCR) Playing a game The sky is the limit, really!
