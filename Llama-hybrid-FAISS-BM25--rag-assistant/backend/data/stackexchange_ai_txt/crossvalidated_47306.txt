Simple way to fit large number of single factor logistic regression models in R - automatically

I have a dataset with one binary target variable called “target” and many many factors “F1”, F2”… “F200”. I’m trying to come up with code to fit 200 single factor logistic regression models and return the model summaries. Here is what I have so far single but this gives me only a summary of the first model. Am I missing something obvious here?
