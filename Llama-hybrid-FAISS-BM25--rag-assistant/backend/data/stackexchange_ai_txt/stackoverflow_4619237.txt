First of all, maybe you meant to say /data and /MyDIR. Second, they're direct children of /, the root filesystem, which is reserved to the superuser (root) and people who know what they're doing. Unfortunately the Windows world doesn't enforce nor encourage good practices, so you were able to create those two directories in your C: root (pretty much the analogue of the / directory). Long story short, it's likely you had to use root (probably masked as sudo) to make those two directories inside /, which means root is their owner, and it (and only it) has the permission to write inside them. You'd better create some alike dirs inside your home (cd ~ and you're there) using your regular user (because you have a regular user, haven't you?) and then use them. On the other hand you could use something like fuse and ntfs-3g to access those two dirs in the original ntfs filesystem corresponding to C:
