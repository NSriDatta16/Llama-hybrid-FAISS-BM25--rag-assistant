Well... XML is a file that anyone can read, since it's text. A database must be accessed through an API, and conforms to certain database-ey structures. You can make XML that's like a database, or make it different, too. You can probably prove that informationally they're equivalent, XML schema to Database schema. In practice you'll want to write an appropriate API to your particular XML structure. But others could read the schema and do their own... Databases shine because they usually have an API that lots of agents can access safely simultaneously. XML, by itself, is just a text file.
