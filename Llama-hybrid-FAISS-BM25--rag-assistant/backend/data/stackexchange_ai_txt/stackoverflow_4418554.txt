You can solve this problem if you add a through table to your ManyToManyField with an order attribute: class Paragraph(models.Model): text = models.TextField() class Document(models.Model): paragraphs = models.ManyToManyField(Paragraph, through='DocumentParagraph') class DocumentParagraph(models.Model): paragraph = models.ForeignKey(Paragraph) document = models.ForeignKey(Document) order = models.PositiveIntegerField() Of cource you will have to add some custom methods for updating the order etc, for that you can look into overriding Paragraph.save or use a post_save -signal for example!
