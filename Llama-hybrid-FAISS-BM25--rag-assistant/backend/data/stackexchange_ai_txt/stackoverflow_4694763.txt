Printing out list of attribute descriptions based on boolean columns in SQL

I've got a table with a few boolean columns like: IsProductionWorker, IsMaterialHandler, IsShopSupervisor, etc. A record in this table may have several of these column values as true. What I would like to do is have a query that returns 1 field with a list of all the attributes that are true, say AttributeList which, if those 3 columns were true would return: "Production Worker, Material Handler, Shop Supervisor". I can think of a few brute force methods and maybe a more elegant method through the use of a temp-table (I've done similar things before), but I'm curious as to what the best way of doing this would be and if there are any easier implementations. Thanks.
