You'd probably be better folding the select into the query with: User.find(:all, :conditions => "organization_id IS NOT NULL").each do |user| This will only fetch the relevant results from the database so there should be less unnecessary data retrieved and thrown away. EDIT: As suggested in the comments, the following would be correct for a many-to-many relationship assuming a join model called memberships (where user has_many :organisations, :through => :membership )... User.all(:joins => "inner join memberships on memberships.user_id = users.id")
