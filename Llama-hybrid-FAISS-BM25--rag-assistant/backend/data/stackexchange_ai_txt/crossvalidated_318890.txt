Unequal sample sizes, unequal variances, non-normality, more than 2 groups. Can I use ordinal logistic regression?

I read with the greatest interest: Alternatives to one-way ANOVA for heteroskedastic data If I want to determine if more than 2 groups are from the same population and I have to deal with unequal sample sizes, unequal variances and non-normal data, can I use the ordinal logistic regression (evaluating the likelihood ratio test)? Why? (I use R)
