What is your experience with software model checking?

What types of applications have you used model checking for? What model checking tool did you use? How would you summarize your experience w/ the technique, specifically in evaluating its effectiveness in delivering higher quality software? In the course of my studies, I had a chance to use Spin , and it aroused my curiosity as to how much actual model checking is going on and how much value are organizations getting out of it. In my work experience, I've worked on business applications, where there is (naturally) no consideration of applying formal verification to the logic. I'd really like to learn about SO folks model checking experience and thoughts on the subject. Will model checking ever become a more widely used developing practice that we should have in our toolkit?
