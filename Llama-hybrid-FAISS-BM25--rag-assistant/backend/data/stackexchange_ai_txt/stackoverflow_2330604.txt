I don't know the specifics of this problem but it is probably better to avoid this problem by setting the columns to "unique" so if a query tries to create a duplicate it will fail. I think the elegant solution to this problem is to avoid it at the point of data entry. I like using this query for tracking down dupes: select * from table group by `Email` having count(Email) > 1
