The $p$-value is necessarily a function of the sample size. If you artificially half your sample, you will get $p$-values that are too large. If you have a small dataset, then the bias can be substantial. If your dataset is very large, then the difference may be small. If you feel uncomfortable about sampling with replacement, then you shouldn't, but if for organisational reasons there is nothing you can do about it, then you can consider the jackknife. This can be seen as an approximation of the bootstrap, but you don't have to tell them that...
