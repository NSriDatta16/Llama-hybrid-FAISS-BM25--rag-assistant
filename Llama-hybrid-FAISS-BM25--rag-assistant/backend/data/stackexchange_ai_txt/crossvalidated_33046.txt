The most common extracted features for image recognition

I want to build a neural network, but because I have high resolution pictures, I rejected the idea of passing the entire image to the NN. I was wondering what are the most common extracted features for use as input to the NN. I know that features depends on the kind of images. But I guess I'm wondering what are the standard features . I'd also like to know about papers or books with information and/or examples about this topic.
