Meat consumption cannot be exactly normally distributed at any standard deviation; we know this for certain -- it's simply impossible to consume negative amounts of meat, but every normal distribution assigns positive probability to negative numbers. If we move instead to say it's approximately normal, then there are limits to how large you can make the standard deviation before it can't be very close to normal, but we can't say how large that is without first saying what we regard as not close enough to be counted as approximately normal. To satisfy most people for typical purposes, you'd need the mean to be at least several standard deviations away from 0. However, it is possible to consume no meat, and any distribution of meat consumption among many countries' populations (German or otherwise) will include at least a small proportion of people who consume none. A recent survey found that 10% of Germans are vegetarian and 1.1% are vegan [1], so if those figures are accurate fully 1/9th of people don't consume meat -- a substantial proportion. Any non-zero fraction at exactly zero consumption means it can't be exactly normal, and 1/9 is not small. In particular, a spike of 1/9 at 0 consumption makes something of a mockery of even an assertion of approximate normality. Leaving issues with the example (which imposed a positivity constraint) aside; if there are no other constraints or requirements other than the mean, the standard deviation may be anything at all; it is not restricted.
