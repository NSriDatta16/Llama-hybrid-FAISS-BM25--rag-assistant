Out of the 1000's of Access files how many have you been asked to support? I'm guessing less than 100. Why rebuild an application that A) no one uses B) works fine just the way it is? You need to begin a policy that it is an acceptable practice for a large organization to develop custom applications in a robust, scalable, reliable, yadda yadda yadda environment. Identify the Access applications you feel are critical or are being outgrown and just work on those. Be prepared to handle the expectation of getting their quick and dirty little applications on a quick turnaround. You'll have to show them the benefits of your new apps. I think you just need to be a resident expert and teach these users how to improve their application or get your input from the beginning to start them off right. The requirements to convert all of these files would otherwise be overwhelming.
