In PCA, does significance/importance of a PC correlate with explained variance?

For PCA eigenvalues S = [1.74 1.45 0.93 0.77 0.50 0.30 0.25 0.13 0.00 ...] where the 2 first PCs explain more than 50% of the variance, is PC1 the most important/significant factor? Or as the first 2PCs explain 50% of the variance the rest 6 PCs combined are equally significant as the first two? If not, is the PC1 is the most significant part of the variance for the data under investigation? Essentially, would it make sense to refer to PC1 representation of the data as the most important for the system under investigation?
