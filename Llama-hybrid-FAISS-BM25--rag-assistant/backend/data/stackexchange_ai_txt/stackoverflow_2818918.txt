Your example demonstrates why serialization is not suitable for long-term storage of data: you have no (real) control over the file format, and serialized files are very tightly tied to your source code - if you change your source code, you can't read previously serialized files in anymore. Applications where serialization is useful is when using RMI to send objects over a network connection, or for short-term temporary storage of data (for example for a cache on disk). For long-term storage of data, use something else, such as XML as Michael suggests or some other (standard) file format.
