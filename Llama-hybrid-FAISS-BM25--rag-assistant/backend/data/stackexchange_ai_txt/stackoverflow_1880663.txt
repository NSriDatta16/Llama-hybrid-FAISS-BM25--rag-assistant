OpenID URL shouldn't be encrypted because this is your "open id" literally, everyone should know the value. Besides, the URL needs to be an index in the database and it's always problematic to encrypt the index in the database. OAuth token/secret should be secret and encryption may improve security if you have to store the token long term. In our OAuth consumer application, token/secret is only stored in session for a short while and we choose not to encrypt them. I think that's secure enough. If someone can peek into our session storage, they probably have our encryption key also.
