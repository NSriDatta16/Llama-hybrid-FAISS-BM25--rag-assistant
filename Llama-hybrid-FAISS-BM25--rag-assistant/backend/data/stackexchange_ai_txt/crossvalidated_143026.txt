I think that the first and biggest hurdle is making sure that people indeed understand logistic regression and what an odds ratio actually is . If they get that far, you simply need to explain that proportional odds models take logistic regression one step further to account for ordered categorical responses. A naive approach could be to run a logistic regression model for a cut point. You could cut the outcome so that a positive response is a 3 or higher versus a negative response is a 2 or lower. This is a valid data analysis approach, except for that the cutpoint is arbitrary. You might get a slightly different outcome running the same model with a cutpoint at 2 instead of 3. Proportional odds models, in a sense, "average up" over all possible cutpoint models to maximize the amount of information you can get out of the data. This is very good for modeling the association between one or more continuous or categorical predictors and an ordinal outcome, and it can even be used to predict outcomes somewhat. An example of proportional odds "in the field" comes from the following paper , where authors examined the relationship between ambient air pollution and asthma severity (on a Likert type scale) Our results indicate that a 10-μg/m3 increase in particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) lagged 1 day was associated with a 1.20 times increased odds of having a more serious asthma attack [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05 to 1.37] "A more serious asthma attack" here is taken to be the lay interpretation of what the proportional odds model is estimating. It conveys, in essence, a very nice counterfactual interpretation of findings which is why I, as a statistician, like these models so much.
