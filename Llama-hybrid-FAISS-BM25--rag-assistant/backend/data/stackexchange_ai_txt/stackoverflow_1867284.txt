Returned AJAX array not being copied to array

I have simple AJAX function that uses jQuery to return an array of 300 test objects from a database. I can see the data is returned, and I can use FireBug to step through the first loop and step into the constructor. This data is copied to an JS array. The code fragment looks like: //retrieve star locations to display on page $.getJSON("stars.php?jsoncallback=?", function(data) { for (var x=0, xx=data.length; x FireBug says planetArray.length is zero. The Planet constructor looks like: function Planet(x, y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } I think it is a scoping issue but I can't seem to figure it out. In other languages creating a new object means it exists on the heap and survives the scope, but here it seems to disappear into the ether. How can I return an array and push it into my own array for use later (or even in another function)?
