Have a look at array intersection, e.g. [ 1, 1, 3, 5 ] & [ 1, 2, 3 ] #=> [ 1, 3 ] The first of the two arrays determines the sorting of the elements. So, just use a predefined array ["DVD", "Blueray", "ipod"] and perform an intersection operation with the unsorted array on it: a = ["DVD", "Blueray", "ipod"] & a . For example: a = ["DVD", "Blueray", "ipod"] & ["ipod", "DVD"] #=> ["DVD", "ipod"] . Very elegant and simple solution. Bonus: Invalid values are discarded without any exception or error or what ever. (Is it a bonus? Maybe!)
