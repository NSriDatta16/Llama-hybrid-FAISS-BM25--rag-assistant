You are mentioning two different problems: data gathering : here you want to get your data from an excel file for both the training and the validation modeling your data: here you want to do it with a neural network. For the data gathering , I suggest you to use pandas, a python library which can extract data from excel files with pandas.read_excel as well as many other source (csv files, parquet files). Then once you have the data in python you can try to understand them with a neural network. The book I used to learn it was handson machine learning by Aurelien Gueron ( https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml ). Hope you will find this useful. Before going to neural network you should also have a look at scikit learn a python library which is used for machine learning when you do not have enough data to train a neural network, if you are getting you data from excel files I guess you have less than 100 thousand data rows which might be a bit too few to train a neural net.
