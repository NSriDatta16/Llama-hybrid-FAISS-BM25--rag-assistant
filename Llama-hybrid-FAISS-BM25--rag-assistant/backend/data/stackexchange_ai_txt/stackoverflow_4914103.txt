See Visual Basic Naming Conventions on MSDN. As far as Hungarian Notation , as in your examples, this is discouraged. The type of the object doesn't need to be reflected in the variable name. It is better to give your variables good descriptive names for what they represent. So, instead of btnGo , call it GoToPage . Instead of frmMain , call it CustomerDetails . Use a descriptive name for the function of the control.
