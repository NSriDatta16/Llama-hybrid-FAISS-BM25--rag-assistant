AS3/Flash performance with large bitmaps

i have a AS3/FL10 based application that renders/animates/filters (blur) large PNGs (1 per view) (about 1100x900 px, roughly 2mb). Due to the fact that the fans start spinning like crazy on my notebook, i wonder if this is considered "bad practise". Unfortunately i need transparent images, so JPG is not a choice. Additionally, the PNGs are loaded dynamically, so embedding the files to the flash file (for utilizing flash jpg compression) is not a choice either. How do you guys deal with large bitmaps in flash? Any tips? thanks
