I'm more fond of the native python threading solution since I could join and reference threads around. AFAIK, NSThread s don't support thread joining and cancelling, and you could get a variety of things done with python threads. Also, it's a bummer that NSThread s can't have multiple arguments, and though there are workarounds for this (like using NSDictionary s and NSArray s), it's still not as elegant and as simple as invoking a thread with arguments laid out in order / corresponding parameters. But yeah, if the situation demands you to use NSThread s, there shouldn't be any problem at all. Otherwise, it's cool to stick with native python threads.
