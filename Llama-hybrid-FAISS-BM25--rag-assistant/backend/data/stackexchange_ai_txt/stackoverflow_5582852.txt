Setting the Site Property of TFrame

I am attempting to create a CustomControl in C# which contains a Delphi TFrame, which can be dragged from the VisualStudio toolbox onto a Form. This much I have working correctly, however when I attempt to resize the control errors occur due to the TFrame not running in design mode (it attempts to access the event handlers for a data grid on the frame). I have created a TFrame object in Delphi which contains various controls (data grid, combobox etc), and a CustomControl in C# which contains the TFrame object. To get around this problem I think I need to set the Site property of the TFrame object, so that DesignMode is true. How can I go about doing this? I know I can get around this problem by checking at the start of each method if the LicenseManager.UsageMode is set to DesignTime, but this seems a very bad way of solving the problem. So if possible I would like to get the site property set correctly. I am using CodeGear RAD Studio 2007 and Visual Studio 2008. Thanks in advance
