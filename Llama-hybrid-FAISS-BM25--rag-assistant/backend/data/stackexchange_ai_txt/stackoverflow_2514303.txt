If you build your application on the NetBeans platform (or at least using Swing), you should be able to use the NetBeans UML plugin . Pay attention to the licencing (although I don't expect problems there) and NetBeans versions (the UML plugin isn't available for all NetBeans versions). If you're building on Eclipse RCP, you could use the UML2 plugin.
