I see some here is citating Steve Gibsons opinion on the subject. Although Mr. Gibson is quite skilled in security matters (I do listen to every "Security Now" episode and encourage all interested in security to do the same), I believe he is a little bit out of touch with the current scheme of things when he predicts no future for IPv6. The use of IPv6 has already expanded beyond mere academic use, and is getting quite a lot of attention in the defence research industry where it is no longer a question of "if" but "when" it will replace IPv4 (in military networks, that is). Of course, the Internet as we now it will still use v4 for a very very long time, one of the reasons being that most of the hardware and software out there just isn't IPv6 compatible. I can't think of any downsides to implementing IPv6 now (apart from the extra coding time and the added complexity of maintaining two IP stacks, of course). In fact, with IPv6 things can be much easier. For instance, you can forget all about NAT traversal problems.
