How to use factor analysis / PCA / regression for data having serial IV and DV?

I have data regarding effect of a food chemical on blood and urine levels as well as effect on blood sugar and cholesterol. So I have following variables: 1. age 2. gender 3. food_level 4. blood_level 5. urine_level 6. blood_sugar 7. blood_cholesterol The thinking is that food_level is likely to affect blood_level and urine_level and these MAY affect blood_sugar and blood_cholesterol. Age and gender may have a modifying effect on these responses. How should I analyze this data: by multiple regression or by factor analysis/ principal component analysis? Thanks for your help. Edit: On reading more, it appears to me that this may need structural equation modelling (SEM). I am not sure how to proceed. I will appreciate very much if you could write how to get started or point me to some good link that may be of help in this situation.
