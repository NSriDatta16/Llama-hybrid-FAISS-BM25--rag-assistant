Tortoise SVN tree conflict with myself

Has anyone had the experience of moving a file in tortoise and committing successfully, only to later commit a different change and be told of a tree conflict where: the file in its original location has been deleted, but in tortoise is marked as missing the file in its new location is there, but marked as already added. (I use tortoise SVN, and we have client and server > 1.60) Nobody else changed either the directory or the file (according to svn log). Why is this happening? Is there a way to avoid it happening? If it does happen, is there a more elegant way of fixing the problem than by deleting the whole folder and updating again?
