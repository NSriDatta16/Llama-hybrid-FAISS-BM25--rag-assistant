The statistics here are obviously very good, in fact too good for any practical data set. Your model is almost perfect... Unfortunately, it's practically useless and I'll explain. In machine learning, if you see something like this you know you are in trouble . That can happen if there are problems with your data workflow. For example, you might have removed all outliers that you shouldn't, or you actually used a subset of your training data for the test set. It's fine if you're just toying SVM, but you'll never encounter something like this in real life.
