What would be the RegularExpression for the followings?

I have a nomenclature to respect while performing some tasks against the Active Directory. Here's the nomenclature: TT -EEE-Mnemonic: if TT = 'GA' or 'GS' or 'PA' or 'PF' -> the schema to create is a "group", with a groupScope of Global . LT -EEE-Mnemonic: if T = 'A' or 'G' or 'I' or 'N' or 'P' -> the schema to create is a "group", with a groupScope of Domain local . TTT -EEE-Mnemonic: if TTT* = 'CNX' or 'GST' or 'SVC' -> the shema to create is an "user" T -SSSS-Mnemonic: if T = 'A' or 'L' or 'M' or 'R' or 'S' -> the schema to create is an "organizationUnit" What I'm after is a simpler and more effective way than this: If(dn.Substring(3, 2).Contains("GA") _ Or variable.Substring(3, 2).Contains("GS") _ Or dn.Substring(3, 2).Contains("PA") _ Or dn.Substring(3, 2).Contains("PF")) Then schema = "group" ' Global' Else If(dn.Substring(4, 1).Contains("A") _ Or dn.Substring(4, 1).Contains("G") _ Or dn.Substring(4, 1).Contains("I") _ Or dn.Substring(4, 1).Contains("N") _ Or dn.Substring(4, 1).Contains("P")) Then schema = "group" ' Local' Else If(dn.Substring(3, 3).Contains("CNX") _ ' Well... You get the idea, don't you? End If I guess I could use a RegularExpression , or perhaps one for each of the nomenclature I got, something alike. Is there a way a RegularExpression could become handy in this situation? Or would it be best to stick with that old big-If? Any suggestions are welcome. Sorry for asking, but I'm not used to use RegularExpression . I know they exist, and bit of what they can do, but that's all. Thanks!
