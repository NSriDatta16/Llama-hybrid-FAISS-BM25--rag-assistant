In general, there is no problem with forming a confidence intervals when your sample is near the size of the (finite) population. You typically just need to use the finite population correction : \begin{align} {\rm finite}\ SE &= SE \times \sqrt{\frac{N-n}{N-1}} \\ \\ &= SE \times\sqrt{\frac{60-50}{60-1}} \\ \\ &= SE\times.41 \end{align} In your specific case (i.e., logistic regression), it is worth noting that this would be a Wald confidence interval, and Wald CI's rely on large sample theory. (There is some relevant discussion here: Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, chi-squared test, and the confidence interval for the OR? ) Your sample of 50 should probably not be considered large, so the CI will probably not really have the coverage it promises. Nonetheless, I think a confidence interval would add some legitimate information to help interpret your results, so I might still do it (with the appropriate caveats explicitly noted for readers).
