It sounds like there are two important bits of information in your data set. How many days old the data is, and what hour of the day that it is. The predicted value for a future time could be calculated as a weighted average over the data set, with weights decreasing with age, and decreasing also with how far off the hour for the predicted value it is. Edit : if the most important thing is not hanging onto data : Setting up bins as you propose (the naive solution) seems like the most reasonable approach. As new data comes in and is 'averaged' with the binned data, the new data can be given a larger weight to help recent changes overcome the 'inertia' of all the historical data.
