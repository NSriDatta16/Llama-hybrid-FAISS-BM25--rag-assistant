Add an FLV video on a jQuery tooltip

I currently have a quick line going like this: And when you hover over the image it shows the text in the title attribute, how would I go about embedding an swf in there? It contains javascript tags and div tags, putting it directly into the title tag causes it to error out. I am using the tooltip plugin for jquery. Any suggestions? Thanks.
