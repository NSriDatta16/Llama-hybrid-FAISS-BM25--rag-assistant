The problem with converting odds ratios into risk differences is that the risk difference for a 1-unit change in age depends on the level of age. This is because logistic regression is a nonlinear model. It is linear in the log odds but nonlinear in the probability. To get risk differences at each level of age, you need to use a marginal effects procedure (e.g., margins in Stata) or a model that is parameterized in terms of the risk difference (e.g., binomial regression with an identity link, aka the linear probability model). You can also plot the predicted probability at each level of age and simply present the plot as a summary of the results.
