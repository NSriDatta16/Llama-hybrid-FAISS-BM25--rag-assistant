c# excel AddChart

hi i am adding chart to excel from c# as follows Excel.Worksheet ws = (Excel.Worksheet) Globals.ThisAddIn.GetActiveWorksheet(); Excel.Shape chart = (Excel.Shape) ws.Shapes.AddChart(Type.Missing,100,100,100,100); is it possible now to add let's say Rectangle on the chart above for example like chart.Add(msoRectangle,100,100,100,100); // smth of this kind so that when i drag the chart, chart objects (for example above rectangle) will move with the chart... and is it possible to make it uneditable? thanks a lot!
