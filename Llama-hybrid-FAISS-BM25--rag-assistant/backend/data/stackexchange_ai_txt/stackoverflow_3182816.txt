Alternative to recursive file deletion in directories?

//Check that external storage is mounted and accessable String accessable = Environment.getExternalStorageState(); if (!Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(accessable)) { buildWarningMessage(); } //Set the cache directory CACHE_DIRECTORY = externalRoot + "/folder/.cache/"; @Override protected void onDestroy() { super.onDestroy(); File cacheFile = new File(CACHE_DIRECTORY); if (cacheFile.exists()) { deleteDir(cacheFile); } I'm currently using the above code to create a folder which is used to temporarily store images that the app uses later. deleteDir is just a generic recursive file deletion to empty a directory. Is there a better way to do this than to delete everything? Ideally I just want a temp folder that empties when the application closes.
