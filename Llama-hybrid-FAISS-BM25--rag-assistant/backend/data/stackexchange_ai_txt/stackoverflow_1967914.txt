How to handle mouse dragging event in JFreeChart

I want to know whether it is possible to listen to the mouse event of dragging in JFreeCharts. By default it is assign to zooming. I remove this zooming functionality with, chartPanel.setDomainZoomable( false); chartPanel.setRangeZoomable( false); And I have used ChartMouseListener interface for listening to mouse events. I'm able to track click and move events. But I'm unable to track the drag event. So I want to know where, is there a way for tracking mouse drag event? Please help me on this. Thnax in advance...
