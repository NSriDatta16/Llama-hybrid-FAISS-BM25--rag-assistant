AutoMapper: setup member name matching convention

I tried setting up a member name mapping convention so that the source members ending with a "Id" are mapped to destination members without Id. For example UserId -> User How does one do this? I tried using SourceMemberNameTransformer without success. Also tried using RecognizePostfixes(). this.SourceMemberNameTransformer = s => { return s.Replace("Id", string.Empty); };
