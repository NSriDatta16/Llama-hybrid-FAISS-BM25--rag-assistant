organize using directives, re-run tests?

Before making a commit, I prefer to run all hundred-something unit tests in my C# Solution, since they only take a couple minutes to run. However, if I've already run them all, all is well, and then I decide to organize the using directives in my Solution, is it really necessary to re-run the unit tests? I have a macro that goes through all files in the Solution and runs Visual Studio's 'Remove and Sort' command on each. In my understanding, so long as all projects still build after using directives are changed around, things should be fine at runtime, too. Is this correct thinking?
