Thank you for the interesting question! Difference: One limitation of standard count models is that the zeros and the nonzeros (positives) are assumed to come from the same data-generating process. With hurdle models , these two processes are not constrained to be the same. The basic idea is that a Bernoulli probability governs the binary outcome of whether a count variate has a zero or positive realization. If the realization is positive, the hurdle is crossed, and the conditional distribution of the positives is governed by a truncated-at-zero count data model. With zero-inflated models , the response variable is modelled as a mixture of a Bernoulli distribution (or call it a point mass at zero) and a Poisson distribution (or any other count distribution supported on non-negative integers). For more detail and formulae, see, for example, Gurmu and Trivedi (2011) and Dalrymple, Hudson, and Ford (2003). Example: Hurdle models can be motivated by sequential decision-making processes confronted by individuals. You first decide if you need to buy something, and then you decide on the quantity of that something (which must be positive). When you are allowed to (or can potentially) buy nothing after your decision to buy something is an example of a situation where zero-inflated model is appropriate. Zeros may come from two sources: a) no decision to buy; b) wanted to buy but ended up buying nothing (e.g. out of stock). Beta: The hurdle model is a special case of the two-part model described in Chapter 16 of Frees (2011). There, we will see that for two-part models, the amount of health care utilized may be a continuous as well as a count variable. So what has been somewhat confusingly termed "zero-inflated beta distribution" in the literature is in fact belongs in the class of two-part distributions and models (so common in actuarial science), which is consistent with the above definition of a hurdle model. This excellent book discussed zero-inflated models in section 12.4.1 and hurdle models in section 12.4.2, with formulas and examples from actuarial applications. History: zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models without covariates have a long history (see e.g., Johnson and Kotz, 1969). The general form of ZIP regression models incorporating covariates is due to Lambert (1992). Hurdle models were first proposed by a Canadian statistician Cragg (1971), and later developped further by Mullahy (1986). You may also consider Croston (1972), where positive geometric counts are used together with Bernoulli process to describe an integer-valued process dominated by zeros. R: Finally, if you use R, there is package pscl for "Classes and Methods for R developed in the Political Science Computational Laboratory" by Simon Jackman, containing hurdle() and zeroinfl() functions by Achim Zeileis.
