I just finished a graduate-level course in experimental design and am starting to learn machine learning... I bet there are people on this website who can answer this better than I can, but hopefully this answer will do. At their cores, experimental design (ED) and machine learning (ML) have different goals. The primary goal of ED is to assess the influences of treatments and, if applicable, compare the influences of different treatments . The primary goal of ML is to give accurate predictions . These different cores thus influence how each topic is developed: In ED, emphasis is placed on good design so that the variability (of treatment parameter estimates) is reduced , sometimes with the need to meet budgetary constraints . My ED professor once said something to the tune of "Statisticians are always criticized for demanding a large sample size. If you were a statistician working on missiles, firing a missile is a few million bucks down the drain." Fractional factorial designs, from what I understand, are particularly popular due to budgetary constraints. The primary goal of ED is statistical inference of treatment parameters . In ML, emphasis is placed on using predictive algorithms and the issues behind them (e.g., computational compexity, computer software/hardware issues, etc.). Given my experience in both, I would not try to compare the two subjects. It is like comparing apples to oranges.
