Multiple Copies of a Core Data Object in a UITableView

I'm making a simple UITableView Based game. It consists of Encounters, which contains Characters & Monsters (both of which contain a set of game stats), and will have a few controls in the cells for interacting with those characters and monsters. Characters will, by their object definition, only exist in an encounter once. A monster may be represented multiple time (For instance, the player's hero may be facing off against 3 Orc Battle-rager and 2 Goblin Hexers, but each of those are in the database once, I just want two or three copies of them for a given encounter. So I'm drawing a bit of a blank figuring out how to model this in the application. Basically I want to have a database of monsters, but when the user creates and encounter they select a monster, input how many they want, and end up with that many copies of the monster who can be interacted with individually
