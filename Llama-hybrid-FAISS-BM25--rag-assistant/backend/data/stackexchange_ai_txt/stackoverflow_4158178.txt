I have an image in a list view and I've set up a value transformer for that image that takes the name of the image file stored in the datasource and prepends a URL path to load the file from the server it resides on. Is this similar to what you're trying to do? If so, then there is a section on Value Transformers in the DashCode doc. It's one of the few things that is documented! :)
