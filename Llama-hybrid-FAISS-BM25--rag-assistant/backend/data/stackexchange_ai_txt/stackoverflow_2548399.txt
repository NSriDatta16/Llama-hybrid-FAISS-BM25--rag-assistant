Did you try accessing the "Services" GUI? Not sure if mercurial shows up there, but its worth a try... Start -> Administrative Tools -> Services If Administrative Tools does not show up, right click the taskbar, click properties, click "start Menu" and customize. Then check "Show Administrative Tools". This is from memory since our IT department prevents us average users from doing this :-) Good luck
