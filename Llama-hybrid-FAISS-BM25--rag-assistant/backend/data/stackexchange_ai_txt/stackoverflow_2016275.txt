I don't have enough points to comment, but I think the hash idea by Chris Jester-Young is really neat. statehash = { "RI" => "Rhode Island", "NC" => "North Carolina" } print "Enter your state abbreviation: " state_abbreviation = gets.chomp.upcase puts statehash[state_abbreviation] this code is a lot more concise and clear than a bunch of elsif and shorter than a case. It also allows for a hash of state objects, where the key is the abbreviation and the value is the object.
