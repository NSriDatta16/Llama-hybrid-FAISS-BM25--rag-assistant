Hava a look at JavaML ( http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/ ) and Encog ( http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog ). The latter focuses rather on Neural Networks than on many algorithms. Also, weka might not have very friendly java API (because, first of all, it's a GUI application, not a library), but when you get used to it, you start appreciating how many things are implemented there. I have used successfully all of them.
