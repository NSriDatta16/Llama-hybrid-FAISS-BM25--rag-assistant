Coloring by principal component loading

In a diagram, I would like to indicate an item's principal component loadings by color. The idea is to map the item's loadings on three principal components (e.g., the first three) onto RGB values. The items in question can be represented by 20-dimensional unit vectors (in the specific case motivating this question, the items are protein sequences and I am analyzing their amino-acid composition). The principal components are derived from eigendecomposition of the correlation matrix of these vectors for a large number of items. One can envision simple mappings like: eigenvectors = $n \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{T}$, target $n \times 1$ vector = $\mathbf{v}$, projection $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{v}'\mathbf{T}$, first three loadings of projection $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{p_{i \in 1\dots 3}}$, and a vector of RGB values between 0 and 1 obtained from $(\mathbf{n/||n||}+[1\quad1\quad1]')/2$ (which first normalizes $\mathbf{n}$, yielding entries guaranteed to lie in [-1,1], and then maps [-1,1] entries to [0,1] entries). This is pretty simple and seems to work, but may have non-obvious blindspots; I am particularly worried about whether the simple normalizations lead to poor coverage of color space and thus poor contrast. A major goal, as with all color-coding, is to provide visual contrast. Is there a standard solution to this problem? If not, suggestions to improve this one? Updated: the intended application is to allow automatic and informative coloring of items outside of a scatterplot or other quantitative format. An example of such a format is shown below; each row is a protein sequence, and each colored cylinder is a region of the protein sharing certain characteristics, with the same color used to indicate repeated instances of a type of region. The limitation is that the similarities or differences in colors, in this example, have no meaning and are chosen for graphical design reasons.
