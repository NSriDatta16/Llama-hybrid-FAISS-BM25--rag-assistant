Is JPG really only acceptable for use in Android?

Android supports three image formats with this rating: PNG (preferred), JPG (acceptable) and GIF (discouraged). Source: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#Bitmap Why is JPG only listed as acceptable? Isn't JPG a better format for images without transparency because they take less space than PNG:s? Or does PNG behave so much better during runtime that it is worth storing full screen background images etc. as PNG:s even if they tend to make the APK much bigger? I'm not very satisfied with many apps containing a lot of graphics eating the space on my Internal storage so it's getting full all the time. And my guess is that they are badly optimized in that sense by using PNG when they could use JPG because the developer guide says PNG is preferred without explaining why. Can anyone tell if I'm correct when saying JPG should be used for non-transparent images?
