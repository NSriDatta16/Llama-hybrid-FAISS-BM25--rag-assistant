I'm the guy who shared the libs on http:// ;-) I did some good progress on easing the integration of spatialite for iOS. Now I'm able to build a fully standalone static library of spatialite (2.3.1 that embeds the required GEOS and PROJ so that don't have to take car of them). Just download the zip http://lionel.gueganton.free.fr/spatialite/spatialite2.3.1.zip and you'll get the .a for x86 and arm + headers so that you can use directly the spatialite interface from those headers. Once you've drag n drop the .a (both are required to work in the simulator AND on the real hardware), you can initialize spatialite by just invoking spatialite_init(1) . The following should be displayed on your console log: SpatiaLite version ..: 2.3.1 Supported Extensions: - 'VirtualShape' [direct Shapefile access] - 'VirtualText [direct CSV/TXT access] - 'VirtualNetwork [Dijkstra shortest path] - 'RTree' [Spatial Index - R*Tree] - 'MbrCache' [Spatial Index - MBR cache] - 'VirtualFDO' [FDO-OGR interoperability] - 'SpatiaLite' [Spatial SQL - OGC] PROJ.4 version ......: Rel. 4.6.1, 21 August 2008 GEOS version ........: 3.1.1-CAPI-1.6.0
