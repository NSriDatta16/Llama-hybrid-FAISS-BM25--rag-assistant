As Tim said, jQuery 1.4 has added support for submit handlers in the live function. His code should work for you. If you can't use jQuery 1.4 for whatever reason, you'll need to reapply your handlers: function applyHandlers(query) { $(query).submit(function() { alert('foo'); return false; }); } applyHandlers('form'); $('.popup-container').load(url, function() { applyHandlers($('form', this)); }); There's much more elegant ways to do this, but you get the basic idea.
