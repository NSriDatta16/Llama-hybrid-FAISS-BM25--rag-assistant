You are using some nonstandard terminology, but you seem to mean simply the principal components in pca. For terminology see What exactly is called "principal component" in PCA? Then the answer is NO . The principal components are constructed as to be uncorrelated, in the sense of the usual product-moment correlation. If you should mean some other kind of correlation, for example rank correlation (you did not specify), then the principal components could well be correlated.
