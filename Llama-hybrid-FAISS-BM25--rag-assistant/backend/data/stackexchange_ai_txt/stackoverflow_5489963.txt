Listening for onScrollStateChanged and keeping state in your subclass is the officially Google-blessed way to do this (see API List demo 13 , which loads data in a list only if the list is done scrolling/flinging). Like most Android views, I think it's intended that apps use event-driven code rather than polling of view state, and giving access to the internal scroll state outside of that would encourage bad polling-type behavior from developers.
