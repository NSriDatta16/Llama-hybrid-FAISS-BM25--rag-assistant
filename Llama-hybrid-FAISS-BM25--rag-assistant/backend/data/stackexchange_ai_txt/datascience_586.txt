What are the main types of NLP annotators?

I'm new to the world of text mining and have been reading up on annotators at places like the UIMA website . I'm encountering many new terms like named entity recognition, tokenizer, lemmatizer, gazetteer, etc. Coming from a layman background, this is all very confusing so can anyone tell me or link to resources that can explain what the main categories of annotators are and what they do?
