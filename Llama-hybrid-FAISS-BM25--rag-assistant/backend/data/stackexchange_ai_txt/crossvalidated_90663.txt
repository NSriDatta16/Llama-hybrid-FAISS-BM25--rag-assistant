You should be able to work with only one row of data for each group : With these two bits of information: "The data tracks what proportion of people made a decision" , and "I also know how big each group is" , you can turn the data into a count of success and trials (or fails): simply multiply the size of the group by the proportion in each group to get the number of successes, and subtract from the group size to get the number of fails. You can then fit a logistic regression. R, SAS, and (I assume) other packages can fit a logistic model with data specified as counts of successes and fails or trials. For example in R the response variable can be "a two-column matrix with the columns giving the numbers of successes and failures" (quoting the documentation for the glm() function). Alternately, in R you can just fit the model with the response variable as a proportion and use the weights vector to specify the number of trials (group size). "I am also concerned that treating the input as numbers, when they really represent binary values." You could tell the software that these are categorical variables (e.g. converting them into factors in R or using a class statement in SAS), but with binary variables this is not strictly neccessary (categories get converted into binary dummy variables "under the hood" anyway). It might make the code clearer though.
