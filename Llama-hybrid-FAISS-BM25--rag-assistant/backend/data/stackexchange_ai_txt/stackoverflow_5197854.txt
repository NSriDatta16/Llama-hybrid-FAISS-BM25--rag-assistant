How do I count how many files deleted from GIT repo?

I am new to GIT. In BK, when user "bk rm" files, they are sitting in the deleted area. I can count how many files have been deleted by users. How do I count the user-deleted files in GIT? I did "git status": =>> git status On branch master nothing to commit (working directory clean) Thanks. Albert
