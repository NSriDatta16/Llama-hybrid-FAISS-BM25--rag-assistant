Optimization of a drone given a cost function

Currently, I have a drone that has 6 motors. Each motor takes a different amount of power to run. The objective of the drone is to travel at a constant desired velocity, with the minimum amount of electricity. I built 2 models (linear and neural network) predicting the velocity as a function of the different currents to the motors. I have another model to calculate for the total cost of the current strategy. I am wondering what kind of optimization I can perform to find the optimal current for each of the motors. Mathematically: $Velocity = \alpha \times Motor_1 + \beta \times Motor_2 +... + \gamma \times Motor_6$ $Cost = 0.25 \times Motor_1 + 0.35 \times Motor_2 ... 1.3 \times Motor_6$ As seen from above, the cost to running different motors is different; some motors cost more, some cost less. Which optimization algorithms can I use to find the optimal amount of current to send to each motor, while ensuring a given velocity is satisfied? I know things like genetic algorithm would work, but is there any other better algorithms?
