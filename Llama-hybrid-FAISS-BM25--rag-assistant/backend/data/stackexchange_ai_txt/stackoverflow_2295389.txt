How does software development compare with statistical programming/analysis?

Statistical analysis/programming, is writing code. Whether for descriptive or inferential, You write code to: import data, to clean it, to analyse it and to compile a report. Analyzing the data can involve many twists and turns of statistical procedures, and angles from which you look at your data. At the end, you have many files, with many lines of code, performing tasks on your data. Some of which is reusable and you capsulate it as a "good to have" function. This process of "Statistical analysis" feels to me like "programming" But I am not sure it feels the same to everyone. From the Wikipedia article on Software development : The term software development is often used to refer to the activity of computer programming, which is the process of writing and maintaining the source code, whereas the broader sense of the term includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software. Therefore, software development may include research, new development, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products. For larger software systems, usually developed by a team of people, some form of process is typically followed to guide the stages of production of the software. According to this simplistic definition (and my humble opinion), this sounds very much like building a statistical analysis. But I imagine it is not that simple. Which leads me to my question: what differences can you outline between the two activities? It can be in terms of the technical aspects, the different strategies or work styles, and what ever else you think is relevant. This question came to me from the following threads: How do you combine "Revision Control" with "Workflow" for R? How to organize large R programs?
