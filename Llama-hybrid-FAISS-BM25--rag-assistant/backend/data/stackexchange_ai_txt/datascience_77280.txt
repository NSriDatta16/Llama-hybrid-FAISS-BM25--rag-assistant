What probability distribution would be more appropriate for monthly rate of going to the store?

Part of a model I am making includes the frequency with which people go shopping for a given good (e.g. people on average go to the supermarket some n times a month). I am trying to figure out what probability distribution is most appropriate for the task. I think that this can be modeled by a poisson process, because it involves a rate across time, but am unsure if occurrences of shopping are independent of each other in this case. I considered a normal distribution with the mean centered around some rate but am also unsure about that.
