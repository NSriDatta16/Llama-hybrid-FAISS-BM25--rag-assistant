GDI+ does not generate very good exception messages. The exception you got is flaky, this one will generate it reliably on my machine: private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { var bmp = new Bitmap(20000, 20000); } What's really going on is that this bitmap requires too much contiguous unmanaged memory to store the bitmap bits, more than is available in your process. On a 32-bit operating system, you can only ever hope to allocate a chunk of memory around 550 megabytes. That goes quickly down-hill from there. The issue is address space fragmentation, the virtual memory of your program stores a mix of code and data at various addresses. Total memory space is around 2 gigabytes but the biggest hole is much smaller than that. You can only consume all memory with lots of small allocations, big ones fail much quicker. Long story short: it is trying to tell you that the size you requested cannot be supported. A 64-bit operating system doesn't have this problem. Be sure to take advantage of it with Project > Properties > Build tab, Platform target = AnyCPU and Prefer 32-bit = unticked. Also, WPF relies on WIC, an imaging library that's a lot smarter about allocating buffers for bitmaps.
