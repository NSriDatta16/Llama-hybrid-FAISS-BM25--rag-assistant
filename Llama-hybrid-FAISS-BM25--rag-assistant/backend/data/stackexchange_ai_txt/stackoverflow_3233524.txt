Operator Associativity Question

Most binary arithmetic operators are left-associative in most programming languages. However, most compilers are free to evaluate the operands of a binary operator in either order. Are these statements contradictory? Why or why not? EDIT This comes from the book I am reading "Programming Language Pragmatics" Chapter 6, Exercise 6.1, I saw this book get a good recommendation on Steve Yegge's Blog. So I decided to check it out. http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ten-challenges
