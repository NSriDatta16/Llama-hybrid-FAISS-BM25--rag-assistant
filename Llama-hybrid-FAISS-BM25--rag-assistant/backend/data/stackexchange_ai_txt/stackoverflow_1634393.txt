Some thoughts, in no particular order: Separate out the various layers: persistent storage vs authentication. PHP sessions are quite robust and are the recommended way to maintain persistent storage. You can have a valid session, but not a valid login. Avoid multiple cookies. One is enough. PHP sessions work with one cookie. You can set sub-domains and paths on cookies, but there's really little point unless you set lots, which is not recommended (see above). Put everything you think you might want in a cookie in the session instead. You should have some common code that all your pages include. That is where you initialize your session. Then everything will Just Work. It can also verify the login is valid, too. Have one place that does the login authentication and everything associated with that. Don't forget a logout screen!
