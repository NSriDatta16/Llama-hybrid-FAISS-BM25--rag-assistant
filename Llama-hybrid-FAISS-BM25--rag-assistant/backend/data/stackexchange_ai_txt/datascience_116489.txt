ColumnTransformer comes with an option called remainder , by default it's set to 'drop' which means columns that aren't used by a transformer are dropped from the dataframe. Setting this option to remainder='passthrough' will let the unused columns pass through the function and join the returned dataframe unchanged. The implementation in code looks like this: ColumnTransformer(transformers=YOUR_TRANSFORMER_LIST_HERE, remainder='passthrough')
