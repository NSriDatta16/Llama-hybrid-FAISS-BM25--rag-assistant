Changing the ArrayList or adapter should have the same effect, since the adapter is just looking at the ArrayList. In either case you need to announce the change via notifyDatasetChanged . As f20k mentioned, lots of options for storing data are explained in the data storage guide. It doesn't make sense to talk about storing an adapter or array list, you would be storing the data within that list.
