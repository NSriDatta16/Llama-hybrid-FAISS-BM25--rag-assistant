Calculating normalized karma

How could I calculate a normalized value of karma (value between 0 and 1), from the karma of users in my system? The normalized value should reflect the value of the user's karma relative to all other users. I think I would probably have to include the average and standard deviations of all karma's somehow, but I can't seem to come up with the right formula. Any help?
