You should change the user agent parameter in the HTTP header to the one the iPhone's using. It's something like Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3 When you're using this parameter in the header, you'll always get the iPhone version of Gmail. You could do this manually, or you could download an add-on to accomplish the same; the User Agent Switcher add-on for Firefox is one.
