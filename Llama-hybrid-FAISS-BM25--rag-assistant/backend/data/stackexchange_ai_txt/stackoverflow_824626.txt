.Net Regular Expression Crashes aspnet_wp.exe

I'm having the following problem and wondered whether anyone could see why this is crashing my .net worker process (aspnet_wp.exe): Dim pattern As String = "\{\{IF\(((?!\)}})(.))+,,,((\s)*(?!\)}})(.))+\)}}" Dim mc As RegularExpressions.MatchCollection = Regex.Matches(txtContent.Text, pattern) Works absolutely fine if a match is found, e.g Title Top paragraph. {{IF(1=2,,, )}} But if no match is found it seems to nail my cpu and run for quite a while, e.g if the last bracket is missing before the final two curly brakcets: Title Top paragraph. {{IF(1=2,,, }} Is it too greedy that it searches forever!? Thanks!
