JavaScript API design examples

I'm designing a JavaScript API and am looking for outstanding examples. Please point out libraries whose API you like, one answer per library. If you don't mind, a comment explaining why you think it's good would be useful. Also, please upvote existing answers if you agree that some library that's already posted is good. Update: I'm looking for APIs which do their job well (though that job could be niche), which are a pleasure to use, involved a good learning curve, had great documentation/test coverage, result in simple client code for common cases, or similar. I'm not necessarily looking for an API that does some inconceivably awesome thing like Cappuccino or JS/UIX.
