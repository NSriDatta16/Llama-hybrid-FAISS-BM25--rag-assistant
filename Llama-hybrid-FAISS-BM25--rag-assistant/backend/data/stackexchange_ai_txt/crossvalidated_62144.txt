Ridge is a regularization technique. In simple words, adding ridge to Logistic Regression means that you want to make a model that is not overfitting with the training data and hopefully generalizes well in the test data. It is done by adding penalty on weights learned. This way, the learner will try to find the weights that are close to zero and not the weights that try to fit every training points. Binomial is a special case of Multinomial distribution (when N=2). So, your multinomial logistic regression can also handle the binary case well.
