Do I only need to check the users machine for the version of the MSVCR90.dll that was installed with my python installation?

I was working on an update to my application and before I began I migrated to 2.62 because it seemed to be the time to. I walked right into the issue of having problems building my application using py2exe because of the MSVCR90.dlls. There seems to be a fair amount of information on how to solve this issue, including some good answers here on SO. I am deploying to users that more likely than not have 32 bit XP or Vista machines. Some of my users will be migrated to 64 bit Vista in the near future. My understanding of these issues is that I have to make sure they have the correct dlls that relate to the version of python that exists on the application development computer. Since I have an x86 processor then they need the x86 version of the dlls. The configuration of their computer is irrelevant. Is this correct or do I have to account for their architecture if I am going to deliver the dlls as private assemblies? Thanks for any responses
