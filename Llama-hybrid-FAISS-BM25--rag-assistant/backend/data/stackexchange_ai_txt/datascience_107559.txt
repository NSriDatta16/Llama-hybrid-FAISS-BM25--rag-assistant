It can be complex to one-hot encode features for a neural network. Often categories are feature hashed instead. Each category value is assigned a numeric value: orange: 1 apple: 2 banana: 3 lemon: 4 grape: 5 â€¦ The sequence then becomes: 1, 2, 3, 4 -> 5 A neural network is then able learn the sequence of numbers which represents the categories.
