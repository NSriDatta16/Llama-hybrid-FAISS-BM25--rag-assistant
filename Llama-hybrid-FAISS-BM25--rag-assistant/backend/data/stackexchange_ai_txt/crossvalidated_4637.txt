I'd suggest several Qs along these lines: Which is the one coffee house you go to most often? What other coffee houses do you visit more than once a month (say)? [Probe to negative, i.e. keep asking ".. and which others do you visit more than once a month?" ".. and which others?" until interviewee answers "none"/"that's it" / "no others" ] What other coffee houses can you recall having ever visited? [Probe to negative] [For each coffee house mentioned in (1) or (2)]: "How many times have you visited Cafe Y in the last month?" Tabulating responses to (1) gives "X% of people said they go to Cafe Y most often" for each Y, with sum Combining responses to (1) & (2) gives "X% of people go to Cafe Y more than once a month" for each Y, with sum > 100% but still with denominator N for each coffee house, where N is number of respondents. Similarly combining (1), (2) & (3) gives "X% report ever having visited Cafe Y". Taking the mean of (4) for each coffee house gives you "Cafe Y was visited an average of m times in the preceeding month". Denominator is N again (remember to include those respondents who didn't mention Cafe Y as zeroes). In principle you could refine things further, but asking more Qs that this may increase your respondent quit rate.
