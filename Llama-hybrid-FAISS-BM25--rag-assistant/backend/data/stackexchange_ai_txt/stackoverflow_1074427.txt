I run Subversion on Dreamhost for less than $10/month. Most of my projects are pretty small so far--I know they don't always appreciate large amounts data as non-web-accessible storage. It is first a web host, not a file host. However, its pretty easy to set up SVN repositories in their admin interface and then you have an easy svn+ssh connection. Of course, since it is a web host it's easy to install Trac (they even have a 1-click install for it) or some other piece of software as well.
