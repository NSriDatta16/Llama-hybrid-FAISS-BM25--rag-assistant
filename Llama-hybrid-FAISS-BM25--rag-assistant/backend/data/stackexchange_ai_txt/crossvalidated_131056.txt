Statistical test for multiple comparison of groups of animals with Yes or No outcome

In my experiment (pre-clinical vaccine testing) I want to know what kind of statistical test to be used to compare between 9 groups of animals (72 animals randomly divided into 9 groups). Each group consists of 8 or 7 animals each. After administering different experimental vaccines (n=9 for 9 groups of animals), each animal is evaluated for a continuous response ( log10Titer ) on unequal interval for about 1 year (0--day of vaccination, 7, 14, 21, 28, days, 1 , 3, 6, 9, 12 months after vaccination). After one year the animals are assessed for protection status (result is Yes or No for each animal). So there are 72 observations (yes or no). I have used linear mixed model with Tukey's multiple comparison test to find out significant group differences for time series data. Now I want only to use yes or no data from each animal to find out which group is best. What kind of statistical significance tests need to be carried out? p value for multiple comparison of percentage of protection of each group (calculated from Number of animals protected / Total Number of animals). Confidence interval of percentage of protection in each group. To asses which treatment group is best based on combined protection data and continuous time series data of one year. I have SAS 9.3 and can work in R also (R Studio). I searched Google and found people suggesting different methods such as PROC MULTTEST PROC GENMOD / LOGISTICS . Some suggest Fisher's exact test and the chi-squared test. But in my opinion logistic regression / generalized linear model requires more data than it is used here. My data look like this: data animal; input Animal No Treatment Protection; cards; 3 T-01 0 53 T-01 0 58 T-01 0 59 T-01 0 66 T-01 0 8 T-02 1 23 T-02 0 40 T-02 1 44 T-02 1 49 T-02 1 55 T-02 1 57 T-02 1 11 T-03 0 18 T-03 1 20 T-03 0 32 T-03 1 41 T-03 1 43 T-03 1 67 T-03 1 74 T-03 1 19 T-04 1 21 T-04 1 22 T-04 1 24 T-04 1 38 T-04 0 45 T-04 1 51 T-04 0 69 T-04 0 10 T-05 1 30 T-05 1 31 T-05 1 47 T-05 1 50 T-05 1 56 T-05 1 70 T-05 1 72 T-05 1 2 T-06 1 4 T-06 0 6 T-06 0 9 T-06 1 15 T-06 0 48 T-06 0 64 T-06 0 79 T-06 0 5 T-07 1 7 T-07 1 14 T-07 0 28 T-07 1 33 T-07 1 37 T-07 1 68 T-07 1 12 T-08 0 16 T-08 1 27 T-08 0 36 T-08 0 39 T-08 0 42 T-08 1 60 T-08 0 1 T-09 0 25 T-09 1 26 T-09 0 52 T-09 1 54 T-09 1 63 T-09 1 71 T-09 1 75 T-09 0 ; run;
