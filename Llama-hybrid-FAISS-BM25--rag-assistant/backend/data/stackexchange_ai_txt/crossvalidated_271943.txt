The other answers are overthinking what's going on. Suppose there is one product and two customers. One bought the product (once) and one didn't. The average number of products bought is 0.5, but if you look only at the customer who bought the product, the average rises to 1. This doesn't seem like a paradox or counterintuitive to me; conditioning on buying a product will generally raise the average number of products bought.
