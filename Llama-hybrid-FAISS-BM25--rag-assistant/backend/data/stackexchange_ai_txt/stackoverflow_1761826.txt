If you don't mind getting your hands a little dirty (and your regex is simple enough, or perhaps you have a strong desire for speed and don't mind suffering a bit), you can use Ragel . It can target C#, though the site doesn't mention it. You'll need to wrap a FileStream to provide a buffered indexer or use a memory mapped file (with unsafe pointers) in a 64 bit process to use this with large files though.
