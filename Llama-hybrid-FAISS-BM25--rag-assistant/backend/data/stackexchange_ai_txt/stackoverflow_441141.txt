WCF Service to Create Video Thumbnails

I am trying create a WCF service that leverages the WPF MediaPlayer on the server to generate thumbnails for a video that a user uploads. I found a lot oif info on how to render a frame and save it to a file. But the problem is the key event MediaOpened (actually none of the events) I need to tie into doesn't - EDIT fire. Does anyone know if the WPF MediaPlayer events do not fire if used ion the context of a WCF service? thanks Michael
