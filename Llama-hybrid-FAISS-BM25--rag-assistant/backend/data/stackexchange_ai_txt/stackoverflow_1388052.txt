Resource from assembly as a stream

I have an image in a C# WPF app whose build action is set to 'Resource'. It's just a file in the source directory, it hasn't been added to the app's resource collection through the drag/drop properties dialog. I'm trying to write it as a stream, but I can't open it despite trying quite a few variations of dots, slashes, namespaces and seemingly everything else. I can access it to use elsewhere either in xaml with "pack://application:,,,/Resources/images/flags/tr.png", but I can't get at a stream containing it. Most places seem to say use using(BinaryReader reader = new BinaryReader(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream("ResourceBlenderExpress.Resources.images.flags.tr.png"))) { using(BinaryWriter writer = new BinaryWriter(File.OpenWrite(imageFile))) { while((read = reader.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0) { writer.Write(buffer, 0, read); } writer.Close(); } reader.Close(); } Which I haven't had any luck with.
