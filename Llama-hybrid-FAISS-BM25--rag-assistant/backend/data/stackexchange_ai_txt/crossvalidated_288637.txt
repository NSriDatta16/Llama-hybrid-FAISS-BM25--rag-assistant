Yes, averaging reduces the noise. As you already stated $$Std[\bar X_n] = Std[X_1]/\sqrt{n}$$ where $Std[X_1]$ is the standard deviation and the mean is defined as $$\bar X_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$ However, you should be careful, because shifts in the mean could broaden your averaged signal. Another approach is an experimental one: If you are interested in a periodic signal, maybe you could use a lock-in amplifier to reduce the noise.
