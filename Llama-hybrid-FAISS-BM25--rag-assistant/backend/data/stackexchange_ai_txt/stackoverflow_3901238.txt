I don't know OSX well enough to predict this is definitely the answer, but f_blocks and f_bfree actually refer to "fundamental blocks", or "fragments" (which are of size buf.f_frsize bytes), not the "filesystem block size" (which is buf.f_bsize bytes): http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/sys/statvfs.h.html f_bsize is just a hint what the preferred size is for I/O operations, it's not necessarily anything to do with how the filesystem is divided.
