Bounding "an average"?

I'm doing a practice problem that is about processing orders. The assumptions are: "On average 40 orders are received" "50 orders per day can be processed" The task is to formulate notions about the probability of the shop being able to fulfill the processing of orders. But what does "on average" mean here? It cannot mean that "every day 40 orders are processed" since then the probability to succeed in managing those would always be 1. Perhaps there's some "standard" way of finding out what the "mean deviation" can be? Or the variance? Specifically I need to find an "upper bound".
