Departmental restriction against unsafePerformIO

There has been some talk at work about making it a department-wide policy of prohibiting the use of unsafePerformIO and its ilk. Personally, I don't really mind as I've always maintained that if I found myself wanting to use it, it usually meant that I need to rethink my approach. Does this restriction sound reasonable? I seem to remember reading somewhere that it was included mainly for FFI, but I can't remember where I read that at the moment. edit: Ok, that's my fault. It wouldn't be restricted where it's reasonably needed, ie. FFI. The point of the policy is more to discourage laziness and code smells.
