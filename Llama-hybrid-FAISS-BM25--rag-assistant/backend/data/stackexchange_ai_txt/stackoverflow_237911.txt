Parsing Techniques - A Practical Guide By Dick Grune and Ceriel J.H. Jacobs This book (freely available as PDF) gives an extensive overview of different parsing techniques/algorithms. If you really want to understand the different parsing algorithms, this IMO is a better reference than the Dragon Book (as Parsing Techniques focuses entirely on parsing, while the Dragon Book covers parsing only as one - although important - part of the compiler construction process).
