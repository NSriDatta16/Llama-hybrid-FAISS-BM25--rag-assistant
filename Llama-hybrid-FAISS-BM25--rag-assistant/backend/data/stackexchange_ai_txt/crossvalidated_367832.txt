I recommend Time Series: Theory and Methods by Brockwell & Davis . They have a strong focus on ARIMA models and related topics (stationarity, autocorrelation etc.), and they are as rigorous as you would expect from a book that appeared in the Springer Series in Statistics . They include exercises for self-study - without solutions, though.
