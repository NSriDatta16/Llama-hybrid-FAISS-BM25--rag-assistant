Erlang: how to embed inets:httpd?

What is the proper way to embed the inets:httpd module inside an existing application? I would like an example / guidelines to achieving this, please. Updated : I want to be able to start an inets:httpd service dynamically from within an existing application. I do not want a solution which leverages a boot script as using this method doesn't allow to specify a port dynamically.
