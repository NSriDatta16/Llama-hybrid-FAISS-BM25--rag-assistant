sample data for training neural networks for self-driving cars

If I ask the question in the wrong forum, let me know, I will delete it. I want see sample data for training neural networks for self-driving cars. I understand that there will be geodata and image recognition.I canâ€™t find on the Internet a real example of how neural networks are trained for unmanned vehicles.I'm still new, but this topic is interesting to me. Can anybody prompt resources where i can look at the data for learning this type of neural networks.
