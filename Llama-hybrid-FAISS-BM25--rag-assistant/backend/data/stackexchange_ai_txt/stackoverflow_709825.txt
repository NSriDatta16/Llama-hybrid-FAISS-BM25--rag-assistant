Creating a drag and drop application in ASP.NET 3.5

I need to make a client able to drag and drop images into category-folders in an ASP.NET 3.5 web-app. I was hoping that an option existed, that was almost as easy to use as the Reorderlist from Ajax Control Toolkit, and where I did not have to look into JQuery or similar handcoding. What are your recommendations? Similar questions have been asked before, like this 6 months ago...: ASP.net AJAX Drag/Drop? where MooTools is recommended, but 6 months is a long time in the ASP.NET/Ajax world, so maybe a better and even simpler option exists now? Commercial components are also an option - well up to 200$ anyway.
