basic scripting question... dynamically modify div content?

I'm wondering what might be the simplest approach to dynamically changing the contents of a "caption" div to reflect the info corresponding to a specific thumbnail/link in an image gallery. To be more specific, if you visit this link -- which shows off the awesome Seadragon zoom script btw-- I would like to have a small caption under the image that changes (text) content when a user clicks the different links above; perhaps pulling text from an alt or title attribute and placing in an empty div? In my case, I'll be using thumbnails instead of text links, so upon clicking these images the user will both initiate the "switchTo" Seadragon event and fill the empty div with corresponding content. thanks for any guidance here.
