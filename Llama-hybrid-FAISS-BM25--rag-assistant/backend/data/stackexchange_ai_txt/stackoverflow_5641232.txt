matlab rescale matrix data to -1 to 1

Possible Duplicate: MATLAB: how to normalize/denormalize a vector to range [-1;1] Hi, just started using Matlab and I would like to know how to rescale the data in a matrix. I have a matrix of N rows by M columns and want to rescale the data in the columns to be between -1 and 1. Each column contains values that vary in scale from say 0 - 10,000 to some that are between 0 and 1, the reason I want to normalise to between -1 and 1 as these values will be used in a Neural Network as input values for a transform function that is sine based.
