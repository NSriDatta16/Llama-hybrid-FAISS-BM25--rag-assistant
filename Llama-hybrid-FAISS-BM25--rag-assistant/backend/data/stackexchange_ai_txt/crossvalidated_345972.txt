Neural network non binary output?

So Im trying to make a neural network that learns a pattern and outputs another number from the sequence. for example : My first test was with factorials. I had an array of numbers as my input, with labels that were the factorials of those numbers. I was doing this off of code from a tutorial. However, I realised this tutorial was for classification with binary output. What kind of neural network supports non binary classification?
