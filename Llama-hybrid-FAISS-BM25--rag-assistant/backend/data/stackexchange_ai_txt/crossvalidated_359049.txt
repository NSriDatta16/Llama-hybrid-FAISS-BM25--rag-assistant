How to test this kind of hypothesis? (Differences of risk preferences of a "gender" x "treatment type" 4 cell design)

I have a dataset of an experiment that had the following design: N=80 (40 male, 40 female) 2 treatments ("control treatment" (CT) and "sensitized treatment" (ST)) Each treatment consisted of 20 males and 20 females All subjects had to answer a question considering their risk preference (ordinal scale) Now I have the risk preference values for each of the four cells: 1. males in CT, 2. females in CT, 3. males in ST, 4. females in ST. I want to test if there is a difference between genders in terms of the effect of sensitization on the average value of the stated risk preferences. For example: Women were more prone to be affected of the sensitization and thus had a higher/lower average stated risk preference. How do I do that? Thanks in advance!
