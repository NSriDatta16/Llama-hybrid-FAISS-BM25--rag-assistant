It is seldom a good strategy to bin a continuous variable, see Why should binning be avoided at all costs? . Since you have the original income variable, you could represent it with a spline in a logistic regression model. That ought to give more effective estimation and inference. For example, in R you could do something like library(splines) mod , family=binomial, data=your_data_frame, ) maybe replacing binomial with quasibinomial or some other family function. There are alternatives like gam's (generalized additive models). A plot of estimated probability of Agree against Income (or of the estimated spline function) would be instructive. I am less sure about formal inference.
