I suspect that you're measuring the micro-averages of precision, recall and accuracy for your two classes. If you're doing so instead of considering one class "positive" and the other "negative", you'll always get equal values for Recall and Accuracy, because the values of FP and FN will be always the same (you can check with more details here: http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/8284/does-precision-equal-to-recall-for-micro-averaging )
