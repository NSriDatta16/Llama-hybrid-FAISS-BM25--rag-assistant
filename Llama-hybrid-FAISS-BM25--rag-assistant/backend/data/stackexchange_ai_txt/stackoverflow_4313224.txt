Server-side Performance Testing of a php Web Application

Before I get marked as dupe of articles like: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/635123/what-is-a-good-tool-or-site-to-use-to-performance-test-a-web-page-site][1] Most of the answers on pages like that indicate performance testing of the html, using firebug, YSlow and so on. Loadrunner is cited, which is good, but what I'd like is a set of tools for performance testing the php itself to identify bottlenecks in the code. It's a LAMP setup. So, maybe: Code coverage testing Lint for php? Something like valgrind for c, but for php any other tool to really hammer the php code and look for flaws or inefficiencies Currently the best one I've found for it may be JMeter, but I'm only just starting to explore it. All suggestions appreciated!
