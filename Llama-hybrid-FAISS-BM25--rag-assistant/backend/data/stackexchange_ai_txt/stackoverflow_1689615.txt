Try adding "return false" after your trackPageView() call, so... onClick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/event4.php'); return false"> Our Analytics rep recommended this to me and it worked like a charm. "return false" usually says, "hey don't pay attention to the href" (I thought, anyway), but my implementation is working just fine. Hope this helps!
