The most straightforward approach is, I think, to engineer features per customer. To your "sum number of installments paid", something like "average percent of installments paid" might fix the heterogeneity. In the extreme/limiting case where each customer either repays or defaults on all debts, you have a "multiple instance learning" problem. The wikipedia article for that subject might give some inspiration for ways to adapt to this setting.
