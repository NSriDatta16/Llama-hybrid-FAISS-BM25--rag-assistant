Just a few thoughts: SQL is a query language for (maybe arbitrary complex) accessing to (relational) data, it's not a programming language. Even if treat SQL as programming language - it's not Turing complete. I can hardly imagine sql query returning sum of 1 to 100 (for example). SQL is language for accessing/manipulating (DML) to data bases, where Prolog is a language for working with knowledge bases (& rule resolution engine, of cause). Virtually Prolog is no more then simply unification & backtracking . This is not saying about the application domains of SQL & Prolog, which are of cause totally different - efficient (regular) data storage & AI/symbolic computations/parsing/expert systems/constraint solvers/.../much more.
