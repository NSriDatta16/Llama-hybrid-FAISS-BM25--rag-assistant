Don't, don't, don't try to make a viewcontroller that works with and without a nib. It will be a nightmare because nibloading uses some of the normal entry points and provides new ones, and it will be fragile with respect to OS revisions. What you can do is it make the view controller always load from a nib, then give yourself a convenience initializer to go through the nib: - (id) init { return [[[self class] alloc] initWithNibNamed:@"MyNibName" bundle:nil]; } Then you can reference it through other nibs the normal way, and just call the convenience init method when you don't want to explicitly deal with the nib.
