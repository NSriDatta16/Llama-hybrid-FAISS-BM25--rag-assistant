How to trigger windows Print dialog from server side (asp.net)?

I want to generate a PDF file on server side, and then in response want to send that file (buffer,fileName- whatever may work) and show a print dialog to ask user to print the generated PDF file. I tried something like below. But it does not trigger window.print() dialog. public static void ForcedPrint(HttpResponse response, byte[] buffer, string fileName, string fileExtension) { response.Clear(); response.Buffer=true; response.Write(" window.print(); "); response.Charset=""; response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); response.ContentType="application/pdf"; response.BinaryWrite(buffer); response.Flush(); response.End(); } Can someone please help me with this? The feature i am looking for is that i should be able to create PDF file on server, and in response user should get a dialog to print the generated file. Thanks in advance.
