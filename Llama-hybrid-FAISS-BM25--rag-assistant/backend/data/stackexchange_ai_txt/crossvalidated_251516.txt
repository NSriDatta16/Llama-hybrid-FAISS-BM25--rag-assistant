@GabyLP in previous comments. Based on my experience you can split such clients in two parts and assign weights for both of the splits according to probability. For example if a rejected client has 10% PD you can make two clients out of this one. First having target variable 1 and weight 0.1 and second having target variable 0 and weight 0.9. The whole accepted sample of clients will have weights == 1. While this works with logistic regression, it does not work with tree based models.
