Why model trains slower on GCP than on my local machine?

I'm using tensorflow-cloud and train a 3D voxel CNN. My local machine: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 11GB, Intel Core i7 3GhZ, 32 GB RAM This is my machine config on tfc: tfc.MachineConfig(cpu_cores=8, memory=30, accelerator_type=tfc.AcceleratorType.NVIDIA_TESLA_T4, accelerator_count=1), To me this looks comparable. However, the training job takes 2-3 times as long as on my local machine. Do I share the cloud machine with other training jobs? Also the the job might be IO limited, on my local machine my training set (12GB) is stored on a SSD. Any idea or suggestion?
