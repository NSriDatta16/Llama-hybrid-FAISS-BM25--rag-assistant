Also your widget has some security issues going on, namely SQL Injection. Dim SelectString As String = "select ListingNumber, ListingSearchHitCount, ListingDetailHitCount, VirtualTourHitCount from FNIS.dbo.ListingHitCountCurrent, RAN.dbo.Heartland_Residential where Heartland_Residential.LIST_AGENT_1_ID = '" & Request("agentname") & "' and Heartland_Residential.MLS_Number = FNIS.dbo.ListingHitCountCurrent.ListingNumber and Heartland_Residential.Status = 'A'" This inline SQL statement is not parameterizing the Request("agentname") field.
