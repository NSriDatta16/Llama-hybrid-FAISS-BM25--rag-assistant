I'm a dev mgr with responsibility over multiple products. I have my dev teams produce builds of deployment artifacts, such as .war files, that can be simply deployed to Tomcat web server using it's manager interface or web service API. The configuration for the app is all set and self-contained within the .war file. Hence it is straightforward for the person doing deployment to just take it and "drop it in", so to speak. If we don't get this level of ease of deployment to where deployment can be completely decoupled from the development team, then I view that as a failure on the dev team's part to adequately do their job. The person doing deployment proceeds to release a given product to numerous customer sites - that's not a productive activity for me to let developers be doing - they have products to design and create as that is their specialization expertise. In our organization the deployment responsibility also overlaps with the first tier production support responsibility. We practice some scrum methodology but I've never viewed this issue as tied to software development process methodology, per se.
