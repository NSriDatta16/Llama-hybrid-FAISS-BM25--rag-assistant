This looks like a geometric version of the Maximum Coverage Problem which is closely related to the Set Cover Problem , and those two are NP-Complete. From what I could find, it looks like the Geometric version of Set Cover is also NP-Complete and the paper here has a fast approximation algorithm which exploits the fact that it is geometric: Link . The fact the the geometric version of Set Cover is NP-Complete implies that the geometric version of the Maximum Coverage problem is also NP-Complete. Of course, your special case of the sets being rectangles might still lend itself to exact polynomial time algorithms, but I doubt it. Perhaps the references in the above paper might lead you to a good solution. Hope that helps!
