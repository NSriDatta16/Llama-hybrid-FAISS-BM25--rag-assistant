How to move an SVN repository to a new server

We would like to merge two of our servers together and in order to do that we would need to install SVN on the "new" server and then move over all of our repositories that we have set up on our "old" server. Is this an easy operation to do? Possibly using the "Relocate" option that TortoiseSVN provides? What is the best way to do it? Would this be a good time to re-organize how the repository is set up as well?
