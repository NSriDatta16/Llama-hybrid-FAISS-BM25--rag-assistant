Indeed, with any sort of regression, you are violating the basic assumption of needing 10 records (samples, objects) for each feature or predictor you have in the model. Thus, for mRNA expression of 10 transcripts, you need 100 samples. Why don't you consider "discretizing" or splitting the proportion of tumor into a low/high (0,1) value based on a median cut, as well as splitting expression into or low/high (0,1) using a median cut, and then run a 2x2 chi-squared test for each transcript. This approach removes a gradient-based view on what's going on biologically over the dose-response relationship between tumor percentage and expression level - something that you or anyone else may know little about if your data are exploratory (novel). An alternative is given below. At the very least I would probably recode the tumor percent values into low/high (0,1) based on using a median cut, and then run a Mann-Whitney test for each transcript. I wouldn't use t-test, because at this level of analysis you haven't screened for the presence of extreme outlier expression values - which would strongly bias the t-test (which is based on averages). Mann-Whitney is based on ranks, so outliers are recoded to much lower integer values.
