What you're doing is not quite classification but ordinal regression. There is no issue with this when you work with an ordinal logistic regression such as rms::orm in R. Your CNN is just an extension of that idea, same as how a CNN for MNIST digit classification is an extension of (multinomial) logistic regression. Consequently, treat your problem as an ordinal regression. There do see to be some ideas to shoehorn your model into the usual classification framework, though I have not thought about this enough to decide if this is statistically sound or just an interesting trick. Or you can just consider this a regression problem and use one of the usual regression loss functions like MSE or MAE.
