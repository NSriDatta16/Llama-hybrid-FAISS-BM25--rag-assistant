The detail coefficients, cD, are the terms with the higher frequency components that are more likely to be considered noise. One thing you didn't mention is that there are multiple levels of the decomposition, each separating the detail (cD) from the approximation (cA) at a certain scale. So you'll have to choose a level of granularity to go down to and then work with that scale's cA. Your new time series will have a different length than the original, and you'll have to map it back to the original scale (which may or many not be exactly a factor of 2 depending on the wavelet). There's no inherent link to a regression model so you're starting from scratch with the de-noised series. Hopefully the wavelet you chose didn't add any weird artifacts. Wavelets are a cool idea and I know they're useful in compression algorithms, but for smoothing and forecasting I would suggest other more accessible methods, like Simple Exponential Smoothing.
