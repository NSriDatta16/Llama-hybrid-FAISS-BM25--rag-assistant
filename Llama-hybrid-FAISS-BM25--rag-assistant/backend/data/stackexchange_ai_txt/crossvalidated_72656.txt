I think there are a few options for showing this type of data: The first option would be to conduct an "Empirical Orthogonal Functions Analysis" (EOF) (also referred to as "Principal Component Analysis" (PCA) in non-climate circles). For your case, this should be conducted on a correlation matrix of your data locations. For example, your data matrix dat would be your spatial locations in the column dimension, and the measured parameter in the rows; So, your data matrix will consist of time series for each location. The prcomp() function will allow you to obtain the principal components, or dominant modes of correlation, relating to this field: res The second option would be to create maps that show correlation relative to an individual location of interest: C EDIT: additional example While the following example doesn't use gappy data, you could apply the same analysis to a data field following interpolation with DINEOF ( http://menugget.blogspot.de/2012/10/dineof-data-interpolating-empirical.html ). The example below uses a subset of monthly anomaly sea level pressure data from the following data set ( http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/gcos_wgsp/Gridded/data.hadslp2.html ): library(sinkr) # https://github.com/marchtaylor/sinkr # load data data(slp) grd Map the leading EOF mode # make interpolation require(akima) require(maps) eof.num Create correlation map loc
