CSS to prevent text wrapping on specific words?

I have product models that look like: EF 200 That appear in paragraphs of text. I want to prevent the model from being wrapped between two lines due to the space. What method can be used to prevent the wrap? Do I need to enclose it in a span tag and, if so, what CSS property prevents the wrap?
