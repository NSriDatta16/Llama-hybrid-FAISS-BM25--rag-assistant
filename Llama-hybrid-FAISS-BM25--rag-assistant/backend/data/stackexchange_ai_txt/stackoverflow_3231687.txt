The recommender portion actually began life as a separate project which had nothing to do with Hadoop. It is still alive an well in Mahout. Look at everything under org.apache.mahout.cf.taste except what's in .hadoop . This is the non-distributed, non-Hadoop code. You can create a Recommender using this code, and have the framework wrap it in a ready-to-deploy .war file which exposes the recommender as a web service, via JWS. This is the key documentation: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAHOUT/Recommender+Documentation You might also be interested in the book Mahout in Action .
