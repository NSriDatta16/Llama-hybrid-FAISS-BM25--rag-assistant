How to test PO assumption in complex survey data (svyolr) in R?

I need to test the proportional odds assumption of an ordinal logistic regression of complex survey data. The model is estimated using survey::svyolr() . How can I use test the PO assumption of this svyolr model? I've found several options for non-survey weighted data (for example those estimated using MASS::polr() , but I haven't been able to figure out how to implement them for complex survey data estimated with svyolr() . Examples of PO tests for ordinal logistic regression models that are not complex-survey adjusted : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brant/brant.pdf https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/166205/ThomasA_TheProportionalOddsModel.pdf?sequence=1
