default resoultion for android launcher icon

Android icon guidelines says to use icon of size 36*36pixels for ldpi and 48*48 for mdpi 72*72pixels for hdpi (http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html). What is value that i should give as pixels per inch while creating the icon?(Photoshop shows 72 pixels/inch as default value while creating a new icon)
