Add custom attribute to category list in Magento

Can you add a custom product item to the category list view by using the category's "Custom layout update" ? (not to product attribute) Or is this not possible? And if it's not: how IS it possible? I find it very strange that this isn't a basic functionality, or that there are no extensions dealing with this as it seems to me like this is quite important. You want to give your user the necessary information of a product, but I don't think you want to repeat everything you put in an attribute also in the product title. Seems very redundant.
