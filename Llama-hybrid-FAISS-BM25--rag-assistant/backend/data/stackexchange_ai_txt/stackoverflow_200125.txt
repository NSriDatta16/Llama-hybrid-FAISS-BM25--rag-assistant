You guys could create something along the lines of Buxfer or Mint or Quicken Online . I am working on one such project for the desktop myself (hobby). All you have to do is parse OFX statements, store them in a database. Allow user to tag the transactions and set budgets. Allow for more than one bank/credit card accounts. Display pretty reports with pie charts which help in meaningfully visualizing data. Do some basic analysis on the numbers ("On an average, you spend $500 every 6 months on electronics you do not need"). Once the database design is finalized, you can work in parallel on lot of these features.
