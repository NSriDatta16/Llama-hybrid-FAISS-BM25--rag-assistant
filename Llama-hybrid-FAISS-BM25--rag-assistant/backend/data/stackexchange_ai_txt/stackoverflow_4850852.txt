You need to have your JNLP reference the additional jars you have. Yes this will take slightly longer to download, but as long as you are not including a bunch of jars that you don't need this should not take very long. Web Start is smart enough to not re-download jars that have not changed on subsequent start ups of the same application. I have Java Web Start applications that have several large jars and this works just fine. As far as putting the extra jars on the user's machine, I would not advise this. If you are going to do that, then there is not much of a point to use Web Start and you might as well install the entire program on the desktop.
