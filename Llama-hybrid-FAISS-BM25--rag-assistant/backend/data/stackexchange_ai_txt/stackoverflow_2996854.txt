Cant add events for controls in WPF IronPython VS2010

I installed VS2010 and IronPython tools. When I start a VB.NET WPFProject everything works fine. But when I start a WPF IronPython project, it creates a button by default which fills all the window, and when you try to add an event to that control or another control dragged from the toolbox, you just cant do it. You double click on them, but the event is never added to the sourcecode. Anyone had this problem?
