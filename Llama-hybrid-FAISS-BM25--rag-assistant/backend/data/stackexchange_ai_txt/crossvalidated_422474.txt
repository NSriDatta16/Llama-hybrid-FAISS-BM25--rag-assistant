What calculation does XGBoost use for feature importances?

Does anyone know what the actual calculation behind the feature importance (importance type='gain') method in the xgboost library is? I looked through the documentation and also consulted some other pages but I couldn't find an exact reference on what the actual calculation behind the measures is. I would be glad for any kind of scientific references of the calculation method as I'd like to cite it.
