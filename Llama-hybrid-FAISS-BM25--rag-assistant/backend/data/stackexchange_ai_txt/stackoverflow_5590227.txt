Ask the user, somehow, where they want to save data to, or use the current directory (simple relative paths) and provide appropriate instructions for set up. One means of "asking" is having a property that can be set via the command line. Don't just pollute the user's home directory with your application's stuff - how do you know how they like their document tree organized? I am absolutely fed up with *nix oriented programs dropping their little config files and data folders into the root of my documents folder.
