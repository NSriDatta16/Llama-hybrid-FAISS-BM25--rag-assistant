The answer is problem-dependent and cannot be given without additional context. Typically, the answer would go as follows. Bayesian Optimization is more suitable for low-dimensional problems with the computational budget up to say 10x-100x the number of variables. PSO can be quite efficient for much larger budgets but is not state-of-the-art in its niche.
