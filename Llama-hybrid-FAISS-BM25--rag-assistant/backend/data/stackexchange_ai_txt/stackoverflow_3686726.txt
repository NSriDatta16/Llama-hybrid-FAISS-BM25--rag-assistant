This is in response to your second question disquised an answer: JAXB: How to marshal objects in lists? Both approaches will generate the same XML. My recommendation is go with the model that is best for your application. For me that is generally using @XmlElementWrapper/@XmlElement. Since "records" is just there to organize the "data" elements it doesn't really deserve its own class. I lead the MOXy JAXB implementation and we offer an XPath-based mapping extension to go beyond what is capable with @XmlElementWrapper: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/xpath-based-mapping.html http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/09/xpath-based-mapping-geocode-example.html
