I would encourage you to do compile time weaving for aspectj. You can do that in your build with ant or maven and in development in Eclipse with the AJDT plugin. Load time weaving works in tomcat. I had a production system running for some months but switching to compile time weaving made configuration and maintenance a lot easier.
