Depending on the number of candidate predictors, the sample size needed for a single tree method to be reliable is in the range of n=100,000. You also seem to be doing forced-choice classification which means that you are applying a hidden utility function that will likely lead to poor decisions and ignoring gray zones. Methods that use an ensemble of trees (bagging, boosting, random forest) exist because single tree methods are not competitive for prediction.
