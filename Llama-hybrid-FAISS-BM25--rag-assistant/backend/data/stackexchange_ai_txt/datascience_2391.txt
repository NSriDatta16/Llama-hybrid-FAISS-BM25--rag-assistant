Anomaly detection in multiple parameters

I am a newbie to data science with a typical problem. I have a data set with metric1, metric2 and metric3. All these metrics are interdependent on each other. I want to detect anomalies in metric3. Currently, I am using Nupic from numenta.org for my analysis and it doesn't seem to be effective. Is there any ML library which can detect anomalies in multiple parameters?
