I find the difficult thing is translating the required design for a site into a series of rules. If the site’s design is clear and rules-based, then your class names and CSS structure can flow from that. But if people are, over time, randomly adding little bits to the site that don’t make much sense, there’s not a lot you can do about that in the CSS. I tend to organise my CSS files roughly like this: CSS reset, based on Eric Meyer’s . (Because otherwise I find that, for most elements, I’ve got at least one or two rules that are just resetting default browser styles — most of my lists don’t look like the default HTML style for lists, for example.) Grid system CSS, if the site calls for it. (I base mine on 960.gs ) Styles for components that appear on every page (headers, footers, etc) Styles for components that are used in various places across the site Styles that are only relevant on individual pages As you can see, most of that depends on the design for the site. If the design’s clear and organised, your CSS can be. If not, you’re screwed.
