OK I think I've answered my own question but it doesn't seem very elegant. I can write a new stored proc to return the data I need to display in the list that will return ID and DESCRIPTION. However, description will be the description plus TRUE or FALSE (depending on the flag IsUsed in the table). Then in RenderContents I can split the description string, parse the bool and add a style attribute making the text bold if the bool is true...
