How do I check if the weights of my perceptron/step activation function are correct

I am new to stack overflow and deep learning so I hope I am doing this the right way. I tried to find the solution myself but it has not been successful so I am seeking some help. This is the situation: You train a perception with a step activation function to learn the function in this table input1 input2 output 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 The following weights approximate the function: Weight input1 = -1 Weight input2 = 1.3 Bias = -1.0 My question is how do I calculate that this is true? I don't really understand how I can know that these are the correct weights for the numbers in the table. Thank you in advance!
