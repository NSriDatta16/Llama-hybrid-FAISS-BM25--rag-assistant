Best Resource to learn about internal working of ML algorithms for an absolute beginner?

My previous question was about looking for pseudocodes for Boosting algorithms like XGB, Random Forests and LGBM. I figured it would be better if i had some resources to refer to, which would detail the internal working of such algorithms. I feel it would help out a beginner like me in understand the 'under-the-hood' stuff. If anyone is aware of any relevant resources, especially those which are beginner-friendly, please kindly cite them in your answers. The answers would be helpful to other beginners too, in the future
