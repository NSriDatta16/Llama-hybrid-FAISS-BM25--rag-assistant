It's hard to say what is state-of-the-art in general without breaking aspect-level sentiment analysis down into its subtasks: 1) Aspect extraction 2) Sentiment classification As you've probably read in Liu's book, aspect extraction can be done relatively well by extracting the most common noun phrases and adding some heuristics. This works particularly well when you are dealing with texts that revolve around a few topics. Topic-model based techniques (LDA etc) are better, but more complicated to implement. As for classification, all current state-of-the-art approaches use neural networks (Recurrent NNs or Convolutional NNs). At sentence-level Kim (2014) is still soa on several datasets. There was a paper by Wang et al. about attention-based LSTMs for aspect-level sentiment analysis in EMNLP last year. I'd suggest looking at the recent SemEval tasks (2014 task 4, 2015 task 12, 2016 task 5) on aspect-based sentiment analysis. There's a lot of good ideas that you could pick up on there.
