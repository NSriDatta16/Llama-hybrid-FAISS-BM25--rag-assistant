Fastest way to parse regex in R

I need to parse around 1.6k REGEX expressions such as the pair I am writing below. I have also around 7k documents (1/2 page long each in average) that need to be parsed according to the REGEX expressions. Right now I am using library(rebus) library(stringr) regex_exp to found matches, but it takes approx. 3.5 minutes per file, which is of course not scalable. Is there a more efficient library/method to parse regex expression in R? I am also naive about whether using reticulate to parse in Python and go back to R could be faster.
