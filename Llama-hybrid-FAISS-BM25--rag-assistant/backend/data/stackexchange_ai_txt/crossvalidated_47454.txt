Creating fuzzy values for binary data

I am doing a logistic regression where my dependent variable is whether or not a person owns a particular product. Among the variables in the model is an indicator of marital status, 1 for married, 0 for not married. This is reliable data taken directly from an application the client filled out, for example. In many cases, the data is missing (maybe the person never filled out an application) but there is a second data source which is somewhat accurate, but not completely so. Would it make sense to fill in the missing values - not with 0 or 1, but something in between? Like if they are probably married, based on the second data source, I give them 0.8 or else a 0.2 if they probably are not married.
