Relative links inside jquery tabs

see Fix Broken Links with Jquery I think this is just a chaining/find issue but if I have: tab1 - loads /rootdir/dir1/page1.htm with link "page1b.htm" tab2 - loads /rootdir/dir2/page2.htm with link "page2b.htm" and the page with the tabs on it is /rootdir/tabpage.htm" So since jquery loads all of the pages (fragements) into html into one page and apparently page1.htm and page2.htm aren't even supposed to haev a tag for that reason, how do I fix the broken link problem? (Since it affects about 50 more pages potentially) Thanks a bunch
