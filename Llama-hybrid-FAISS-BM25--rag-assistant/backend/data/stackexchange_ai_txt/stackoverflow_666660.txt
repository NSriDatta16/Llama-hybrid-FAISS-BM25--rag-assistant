Rails opted for REST over SOAP : It’ll probably come as no surprise that Rails has picked a side in the SOAP vs REST debate. Unless you absolutely have to use SOAP for integration purposes, we strongly discourage you from doing so. As a naturally extension of that, we’ve pulled ActionWebService from the default bundle. It’s only a gem install actionwebservice away, but it sends an important message none the less. Still, if you must use SOAP, there's always soap4r , but it only supports SOAP 1.1. A better option might be WSF/Ruby . Mark Thomas has an example controller to help you get up and running.
