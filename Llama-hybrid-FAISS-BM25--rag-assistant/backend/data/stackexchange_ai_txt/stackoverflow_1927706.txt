Here, I could come with a Pythonic idiom that can look "pertty". Although, most likely I'd use the form you suggested in asking the question, just for the code to remain more obvious, though less elegant. def copy_iter(): yield root.copy while True: yield somewhereElse.copy for member, copy in zip(something.get(), copy_iter()): copy(member) foo(member) (sorry - the first I posted, before editing, form would not work, I had forgotten to actually get an iterator for the 'copy' object)
