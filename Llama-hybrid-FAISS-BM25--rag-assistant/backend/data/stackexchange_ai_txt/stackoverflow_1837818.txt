If you've profiled and optimized your form, you might have to use a wait cursor, a splash screen or a progress bar. If you have NOT profiled, I strongly recommend you do so. There may be a few methods that eat up a lot of time. If you have a lot of controls (800 you say?) in your form, you might consider modifying the form's initialization to use a backgroundworker - essentially you load your controls in a separate thread. This may or may not be possible, given your specific requirements. Edit: I assumed in my answer that your 800 controls were necessary - it's very likely that you can reorganize your code to load controls only when needed. If you're not immediately able to reorganize your code, profiling to find the worst culprits is a good second choice.
