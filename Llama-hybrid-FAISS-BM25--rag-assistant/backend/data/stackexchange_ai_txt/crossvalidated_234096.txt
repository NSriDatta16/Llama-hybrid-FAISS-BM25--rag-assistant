What is the BIC prior for Bayesian linear regression?

Is there a prior probability distribution associated with BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)? I ask this because in the R package BAS there is a linear modeling function that can be called as follows: bas.lm(y ~ x, data = my_dataframe, prior = 'BIC') and the documentation is not clear on how the priors are set given the 'BIC' argument. The posterior distributions come out to be normal looking (student-T actually I think). They could for example look something like this: In summary, I am wondering what prior distributions are being used for the parameters?
