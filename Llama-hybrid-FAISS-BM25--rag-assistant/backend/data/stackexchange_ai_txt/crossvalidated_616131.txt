Even when you combine your multiple Likert items into Likert scales after the items/questions "are grouped around themes," you are unlikely to have data that can be considered continuous interval-scaled data appropriate for classic ANOVA. If you have ordinal data, why not use ordinal regression ? As Frank Harrell explains in Chapter 13 of Regression Modeling Strategies , a proportional-odds logistic regression is a "generalization of Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-Kruskal-Wallis-Spearman" that allows for incorporating more complex designs with covariates. If all you have for each individual is 1 pre-lession set of answers and 1 post-session set of answers, then it seems that you could model the post-pre differences in your Likert scales, in a generalization of a paired t -test. You could include the theme as a predictor of the Likert-scale post-pre differences, allowing for a combined analysis of all data (which is generally preferable). One way to think about the within-individual correlations among responses to the various themes is to recognize that corresponding multivariate (in the sense of multiple-outcome) ANOVA designs end up with the same point estimates as for modeling each outcome separately; it's the standard errors of the estimates that need adjustment for correlations. In your situation, after you fit the proportional-odds model, you could generate a corrected variance-covariance matrix for the coefficient estimates by bootstrap resampling of the data by individual and using the empirical variance-covariance matrix of coefficient estimates over the multiple resamples.
