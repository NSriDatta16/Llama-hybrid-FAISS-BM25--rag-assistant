Have you checked the latest version of UC? The release note states: The biggest change, though, is that order invoice templates now use the theme system to allow customizations. Instead of altering the module files directly, it is now correct to override them in the theme, just like node and page templates. ...and if I am not mistaken (a few months have passed by since I worked with UC), the invoice IS the page displayed by the URL you provided. If my memory failed me (I haven't a UC installation handy to verify myself), a possible workaround (admittedly far from elegant, but still allowing you not to change the module's code) would be to alter the HTML with jQuery once the page has been loaded. A more hack-ish workaround would be to maintain your own page callback for that URL, and just alter the menu definition in the UC code [yes, it's still hacking the code, but in this case you just need to modify one line in the UC code, and can maintain your code in a separate module]. HTH, Mac.
