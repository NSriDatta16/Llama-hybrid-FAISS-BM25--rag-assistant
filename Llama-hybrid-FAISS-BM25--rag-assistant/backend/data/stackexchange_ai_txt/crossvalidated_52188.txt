Ordinal dependent variable with continuous independent variables

I have an ordinal dependent variable, named D, which varies from very small, small, medium, big, to very big. This variable depends on the independent variables X, V, which are continuous variables. Could I perform an ordinal logistic regression analysis in the former data in order to obtain the relationship between D and X, V? Could I obtain in this way the D variable as percentages?
