If you are using jQuery, I would strongly suggest using ThickBox http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/ We use it in every single projects we do and it work very weel and it's easy to modify to have it do what you want. You can use it to load another aspx page where your login code would reside and then pay particual attention to function tb_remove() { Which is called on close. This is where we added our code to return data to the page.
