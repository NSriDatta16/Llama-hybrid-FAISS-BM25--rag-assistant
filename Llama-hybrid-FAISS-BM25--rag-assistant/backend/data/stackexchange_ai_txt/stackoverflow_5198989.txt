Use FusionCharts in sandbox solution

Has anyone been successfully rendering charts using fusion charts in a sandboxed solution? How would you get the SWF file onto SharePoint? I included it and deployed it via feature and the Elements.xml looks like the following: When the sandbox solution is deployed, you can access the SWF file from http://sharepointsite/FusionCharts/FCF_Gantt.swf , the browser will attempt to open/save the file. If this file is deployed via farm solution, and be deployed to _layouts folder, which I can access via http://sharepointsite/_layouts/FusionCharts/FCF_Gantt.swf , it renders with error message "invalid xml data". The farm solution deployment is correct because MIME type is properly set to "application/x-shockwave-flash" and thus my custom web part which renders chart using this SWF file works. But if my sandboxed web part is to use the SWF file deployed as site pages, it does not work. Any idea? Thanks in advance. Sean
