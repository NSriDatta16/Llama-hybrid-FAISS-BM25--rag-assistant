I have somewhat similar problem. I am using Infragistics GroupBox on a user control which I inherited and now want to change its look and feel in the derived class. I have made it protected in base class -- so it does allow me changing properties in derived class. But it does not save it. Every time I open it -- I get same old values of base class back. Any idea? Edit: I figured it out. Trying various value for one of the above given answers. Using [DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content)] instead of [DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden)] generates code for changed properties - and things work as desired.
