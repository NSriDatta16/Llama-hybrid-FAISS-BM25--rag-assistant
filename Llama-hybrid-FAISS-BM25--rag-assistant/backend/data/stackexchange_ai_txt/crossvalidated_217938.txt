Good examples/books/resources to learn about applied machine learning (not just ML itself)

I've taken an ML course previously, but now that I am working with ML related projects at my job, I am struggling quite a bit to actually apply it. I'm sure the stuff I'm doing has been researched/dealt with before, but I can't find specific topics. All the machine learning examples I find online are very simple (e.g. how to use a KMeans model in Python and look at the predictions). I am looking for good resources on how to actually apply these, and maybe code examples of large scale machine learning implementations and model trainings. I want to learn about how to effectively process and create new data that can make the ML algorithms much more effective.
