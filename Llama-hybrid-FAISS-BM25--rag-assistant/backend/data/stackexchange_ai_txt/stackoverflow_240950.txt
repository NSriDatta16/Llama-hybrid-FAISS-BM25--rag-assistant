I second the 'good idea' part, although for a project of reasonable size you might want to make it part of an automated build, like one of the CI Servers (Bamboo, Contiuum). You might also consider a code coverage tool to see how your test coverage is going. This will ensure the reports get run on a regular basis, could give you somewhere to publish them and won't slow down the developer's quick turnaround development cycle.
