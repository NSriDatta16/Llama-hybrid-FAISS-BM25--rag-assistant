Namespace HTML 5 local storage keys

I'm using the HTML 5 local storage API to store a user's access token. The requests then appends this token to access my server side API. I'm wondering if I need to namespace the keys I use. Does the browser take care of this or do I need to call the key something like 'my-awesome-app-token'? I noticed Twitter does this for some search params. BTW, I know it's not secure to store the token there but security is not important here, the question is about namespacing keys. Thanks!
