I also use TODO: comments. I understand the criticism that they rarely actually get fixed, and that they'd be better off reported as bugs. However, I think that misses a couple points: I use them most during heavy development, when I'm constantly refactoring and redesigning things. So I'm looking at them all the time. In situations like that, most of them actually do get addressed. Plus it's easy to do a search for TODO: to make sure I didn't miss anything. It can be very helpful for people reading your code, to know the spots that you think were poorly written or hacked together. If I'm reading unfamiliar code, I tend to look for organizational patterns, naming conventions, consistent logic, etc.. If that consistency had to be violated one or two times for expediency, I'd rather see a note to that effect. That way I don't waste time trying to find logic where there is none.
