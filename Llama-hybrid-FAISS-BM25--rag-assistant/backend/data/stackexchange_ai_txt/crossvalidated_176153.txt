I have never worked with recurrent networks, but from what I know, in practice, some RNN and TDNN can be used for the same purpose that you want: Predict time series values. However, they work different. It is possible with TDNN: Predict process' values Find a relationship between two processes. Some RNN, like NARX also allow you to do that, and it is also used to predict financial time series, usually better than TDNN. A TDNN looks more like a feedforward network, because time aspect is only inserted through its inputs, unlike NARX that also needs the predicted/real future value as input. This characteristic makes TDNN less robust than NARX for predicting values, but requires less processing and is easier to train. If you are trying to find a relationship between a process $X(t)$ and a process $Y(t)$, NARX requires you to have past values of $Y$, while TDNN does not. I recommend reading Simon Haykin's Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation (2nd Edition) and this FAQ . There are lots of neural networks architectures and variations. Sometimes they have many names or there is no consensus about their classification.
