How do I interrupt an ASP.NET button postback with BlockUI and Jquery

I have an ASP.NET page with a number of ASP:Button instances on it. For some, I need to show a confirmation prompt and, should the user choose yes, the original postback method is called. Otherwise, the overall process is cancelled. I've got an example running but I get inconsistent results, mainly in FF3 where I get an exception thrown: [Exception... "Illegal operation on WrappedNative prototype object" nsresult: "0x8057000c (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_OP_ON_WN_PROTO)" location: "JS frame :: I've looked this error up but I'm drawing a loss as to where I'm going wrong. Here's my example case. Note, for now I'm just using the css class as a lookup. Longer term I can embed the clientID of the control into my JS if it proves necessary :). Html fragment: Javascript: $(".startbutton").each(function(){ $(document).data("startclick", $(this).get()[0].click); $(this).unbind("click"); }).click(function(){ var oldclick = $(document).data("startclick"); alert("hello"); try { oldclick(); } catch(err) { alert(err); alert(err.description); } return false; }); My code behind is relatively simple, the OnStart method simply executes a Response.Write I've only just started looking into bind, unbind and trigger so my usage here is pretty much 'first time'. Thanks for any help or advice. S EDIT: This describes what I'm trying to do and also gives a run down of the kind of pitfalls: http://www.nabble.com/onClick-prepend-td15194791s27240.html
