Split parameters from ExecutionLog in SSRS (String Functions)

"Yet another string function" question for TSQL. The ExecutionLogStorage table in the ReportServer$InstanceName database for SSRS 2008 puts all parameters called to the report in a single column - FullName=LastName, FirstName&CalledBy=Lastname, FirstName&DateSelected=MM/DD/YY&CheeseorFries=Fries Some are null values, so the user could just have DateSelect or FullName, or CalledBy... etc.I need to be able to parse out the 'CalledBy=Lastname, FirstName' value; but between the LOWER and LTRIM and Lefts and Substrings and Charindexes.... I'm not getting anywhere. Any ideas? =/ The intent is to be able to retrieve a list of who called which report at which time.... The SSRS execution log has a username column, but due to the reports being called from a DNN portal, using linked servers, the managers decided the whole network-delegation thing was easier bypassed by just using a domain service account - so all 'username' fields are filled by the service account instead of the individual. thank you!
