Those two are my favorite questions about the subject: Weakly informative prior distributions for scale parameters What is an "uninformative prior"? Can we ever have one with truly no information? Also, it might help taking a look at section 2.9 of: Gelman, Carlin, Stern and Rubin (2004), Bayesian Data Analysis . And also Gelman's paper mentioned in @Michael Chernick answer: A. Gelman (2006), Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models , Bayesian Analysis , vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 515â€“533.
