One thing you could try is to have a separate module class for hosted mode testing that is a subclass of your actual module. In the hosted mode version of the module, you could have some JSNI that resizes the window: public class MyModule implements EntryPoint { //... } public class HostedModeMyModule extends MyModule { private native void resizeWindow() /*-{ $wnd.resizeTo(800, 600); }-*/; public void onModuleLoad() { resizeWindow(); super.onModuleLoad(); } } You'll have to have two gwt.xml file of course, one for testing and one for compilation. This isn't the most elegant approach, but is all I can come up with.
