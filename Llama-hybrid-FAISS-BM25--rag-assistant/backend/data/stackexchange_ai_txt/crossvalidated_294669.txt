Estimating parameters of random exp. independent variable based on desired distribution properties of dependent variable in logistic regression model

I have a logistic regression model describing the behaviour of customers of a call centre - relation between waiting time in a queue (independent variable $W$) and probability of hanging up before answer or abandonment rate (dependent variable $A$). Waiting time $W$ is distributed exponentially: $W\sim Exp(\lambda)$. Now, I want to find such $\lambda$ (with a confidence 95%) that it would result in $A$ for the entire population below some threshold (let's say $A Does it mean that we need to: Find how $A$ would be distributed (i. e. what happens with exponentially distributed random variable when it is "fed" into logit function?) Find $min(\lambda)$ that makes $\int_0^1 {PDF(A)*A\, dA} = 10\%$? Does it make sense at all? And what about confidence interval then? I understand that applying the logistic regression model to a single waiting time value I'm getting a confidence interval for probability of abandonment for this specific data point. But if I apply the model to a sample of $N$ values, I would need to be $\sqrt[N] {0.95}$ confident in each value to achieve 95% confidence for the entire sample? And if it's not a finite sample of $N$ values, but random variable $W$, then how can confidence interval be calculated? So many questions...
