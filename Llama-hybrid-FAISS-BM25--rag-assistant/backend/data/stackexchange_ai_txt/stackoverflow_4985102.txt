Redirect website with htaccess

RewriteEngine on RewriteRule (.+) http://newdomain.com/$1 [R=301,L] I am using Wordpress and this is my htaccess configuration file, everything seems to be working except this one. This URL: http://olddomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/abc-1-thumb.jpg Redirects to: http://newdomain.com/403.shtml Instead of: http://newdomain.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/abc-1-thumb.jpg Examples: http://mister-gan.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/simple-and-clean-2.png http://ganchinhock.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/simple-and-clean-2.png May I know why?
