Reliability and robustness are two different attributes of a sytem: Reliability The IEEE defines it as ". . . the ability of a system or component to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time." Robustness is robust if it continues to operate despite abnormalities in input, calculations, etc. So a reliable system performs its functions as it was designed to within constraints; A robust system continues to operate if the unexpected/unanticipated occurs. If you have access to any history of the software you're evaluating, some idea of reliability can be inferred from reported defects, number of 'patch' releases over time, even churn in the code base. Does the product have automated test processes? Test coverage can be another indication of confidence. Some projects using agile methods may not fit these criteria well - frequent releases and a lot of refactoring are expected Check with current users of the software/product for real world information.
