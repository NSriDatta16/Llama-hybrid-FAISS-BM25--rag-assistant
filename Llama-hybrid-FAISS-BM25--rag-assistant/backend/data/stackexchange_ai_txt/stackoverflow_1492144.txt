CSS Best Practices: Classes for all elements or styling by parent class?

So, I was wondering about the following: I have some main content div and a sidebar div and the CSS looks as follows: .main{ width: 400px; height: 300px } .sidebar{ width: 100px; height: 300px; } I will not include now all the floating properties, since I am only interested in the following: If I have a p element in both of them and I want them to have different styles, shall I give the paragraphs different classes or shall I define the style for them like this: .main p{ color: blue; text-align: right; font-family: ... } And then for .sidebar p I would define something else... The alternative would be to define a class p.myclass and define the style there. I am trying to understand what a better practice is. Obviously I need less markup if I have 30 p elements in one of the elements with the first method, since I would have to give them all a class. On the other hand, I create CSS that I can only "use" for that parent element, instead of having a general definition that I can apply in more places in the site... I noticed that in a lot of "big" websites, almost every single html element has its own class... Any ideas?
