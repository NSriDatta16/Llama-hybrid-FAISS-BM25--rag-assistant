JSR 292: Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages on the JavaTM Platform? You've lost me on that one. Is your question about how to communicate between widgets or build frameworks and organise code? If your talking about organising code then you don't need a framework, you organise it into logical areas just like you would in any swing application. In terms of inter-widget communication are these widgets different GWT projects on the same page, or all part of one GWT project? If they are one project, then there's always Observer/Observable. It works well in Swing, and just as well in GWT. If they are different GWT projects (modules) on the same page, then you can hook them up using JSNI quite easily. You can still use the observer/observable thing or just have them call each other directly.
