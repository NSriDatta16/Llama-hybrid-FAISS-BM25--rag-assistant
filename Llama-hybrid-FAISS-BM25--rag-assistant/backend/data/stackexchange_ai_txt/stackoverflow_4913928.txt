It all depends on your application. Redis is a Key-Value store. If your data stored in a relational format and does not lend itself well to key retrieval then it is not really the solution for you. Also, Redis has the best performance when it is stored in memory. If transactions are important for you, it is not really a good solution too. I use Redis and love it, but it seems many people are trying to shoehorn in applications that Redis is not suited for. If you are storing things like webpages, comments, tweets etc I would also consider a document store like MongoDB. You would have to add more details about your implementation.
