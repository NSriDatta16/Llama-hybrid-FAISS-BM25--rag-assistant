What machine learning algorithms are used for internet advertising?

I.e. based on stats of site visiting, clicks, classifying visitors based on what they are interested in, time, day of week etc. Any frameworks/resources you can recommend? For example: we have a lot of advertisements with different prices. Task is to build a set of advertisements in a block to achieve the best CTR (in other words we need to show what people click)
