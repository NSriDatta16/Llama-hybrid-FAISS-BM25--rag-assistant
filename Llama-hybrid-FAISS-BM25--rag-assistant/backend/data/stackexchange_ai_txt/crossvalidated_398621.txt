random effect variance as pseudo-rsquared in GLMM

Suppose I have data on the abundance of a species across multiple sites that differ in some covariate of interest. Suppose that the logarithm of the abundance (logAbun) meets assumptions for linear regression, with homoskedastic normal residuals. We could then write the model logAbun ~ normal(mu, sigma) mu = alpha + beta*covariate We can analyze this model in the standard way, and we might report R-squared as (among other things) a measure of the percent variance in logAbun explained by the covariate. Now suppose that instead of measuring the true abundance, we instead have samples (counts) that are Poisson variates with means governed by the true abundance. It would be quite natural to extend our model as follows: count ~ Poisson(abundance) log(abundance) ~ normal(mu, sigma) mu = alpha + beta*covariate This is a hierarchical model where abundance (and logAbun) is latent. Note that this model is precisely a Poisson GLMM with the canonical log link and a random effect of observation. So here's the question: It seems natural that we could still ask what percentage of the variation in the latent logAbun is explained by the covariate. And it seems that all we'd need to do is re-fit the model without the covariate (but still including the random effect of observation), and compare the random-effect variance of the "null" model with no covariate to the model with the covariate. Moreover, it seems we can use an analogous procedure to analyze many or most GLMs--as long as we're willing to fit a random effect of observation. That is, we just fit a hierarchical model so that the top level looks like a standard linear regression on a latent parameter, and we calculate an r-squared value for this standard (but latent) regression. Yet I've never seen anybody do this! Am I just missing that people do this regularly? Is this a Very Bad Idea for some reason (i.e. is it likely to fail to provide a correct/useful picture of how much variation in logAbun is explained by the covariate)? Note: if we can avoid it, let's not get hung up on potential difficulties of estimating the correct random-effect variance (or its uncertainty). Assuming we have a valid estimation procedure that we trust (if nothing else, Bayesian estimation with a good choice of prior), is there some reason why this analysis is likely to fail to provide a correct/useful picture of how much variation in abundance is explained by the covariate?
