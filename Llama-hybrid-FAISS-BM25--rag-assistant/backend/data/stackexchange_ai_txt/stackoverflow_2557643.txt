Fedrik, check carefully. Is jRQL a rest based XML service (basically URLs you can get/post XML) or a SOAP based XML service (one URL and a soap wrapper). In the later case you can just use a web service client, in the first case you would write a Java agent (a java class expanding a certain interface). What would make sense is to have a composite application in Lotus Notes (you use the free Domino Designer for that) that retrieves the list of entries in Reddot to be approved. It would show a list of them and in a panel the actual site in a browser when you click on the list item. The list (in Notes lingo: view) can have approve/reject/revise this buttons which would a) document the decision in Notes b) send an XML to Reddot to approve/reject this. You could go even further :-) The web container in Lotus Notes would allow you to submit web forms dynamically using code, so you could get away with the XML stuff.
