Grails Package Structure

I am picking up an existing codebase that is Groovy and Grails, but the package structure seems very odd to me. For a domain class they put it in the following package com.company.domain then for the controller of that class it is com.company.controller That structure seems very off to me since the domain and controller classes are already organized under their own folders in the grails-app folder. My plan is to redo the packages and group based on actual use such as com.company.billing and com.company.util . Are there any disadvantages to my plan? Is there anything good about the current package structure that I'm missing?
