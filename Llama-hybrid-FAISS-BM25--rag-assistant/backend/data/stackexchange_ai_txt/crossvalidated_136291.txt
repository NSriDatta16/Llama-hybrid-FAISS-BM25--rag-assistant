How do you simulate two correlated AR(p) time series?

I would be interested in the mathematical framework plus code in R if possible. Basically I want to find out the parameters of the two AR(p) models if I already specificed a certain cross-correlation value between the two time series plus their respective autocorrelations. Thanks in advance!
