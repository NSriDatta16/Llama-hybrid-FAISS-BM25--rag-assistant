Comparing growth of rates for small time series measurements before and after intervention in R

I have 2 small time series where I calculate success rates before and after intervention. Experiment 1 df $P N / df$Total * 100 Experiment 2: df $P N / df$Total * 100 Question: What would be the appropriate statistical analysis in this case to estimate if the intervention played a significant role in performance change rate? Is it possible to make any reasonable conclusion with these many data points?
