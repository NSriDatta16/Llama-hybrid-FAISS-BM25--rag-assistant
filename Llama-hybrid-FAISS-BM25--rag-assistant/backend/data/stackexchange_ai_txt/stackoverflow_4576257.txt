Good question mfloryan - I was doing the testing manually, i.e. not as part of a unit or integration test. Thanks very much for the help hvgotcodes . I made the changes to my code as you have suggested, but unfortunately to no avail. Interestingly, if I print request.JSON I get {} , whereas if I print request.json I get null . EDIT: By 'printing' I mean using: request.JSON.toString() EDIT: Thank you all so much for the help. Once I'd made the final change John Wagenleitne suggested the code began working properly. I'm very grateful indeed for all your help.
