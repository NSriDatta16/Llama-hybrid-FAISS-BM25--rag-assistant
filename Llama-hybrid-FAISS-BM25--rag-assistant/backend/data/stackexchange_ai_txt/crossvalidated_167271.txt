Can the Breusch-Pagan test be applied to GLM?

I have developed a model to test if a relationship is unimodal by using a Gaussian GLM. In an effort to diagnose the various assumptions of linear models I used the Breusch-Pagan test to determine heteroscedasticity from the lmtest package in R. Does the Breusch-Pagan test lend itself to be used with glm or is it strictly just an lm function? If not is there a Breusch-Pagan test function that can be used with glm ?
