Variational Inference with intractable score function

Is it possible to do ELBO maximization using stochastic gradient estimates (i.e. iteratively apply variational updates using (3) in http://proceedings.mlr.press/v33/ranganath14.pdf ), when it's cheap to sample from the variational posterior $ q(z|\mathbf{\lambda})$ , however $ q(z|\mathbf{\lambda})$ and the score function $ \nabla_{\mathbf{\lambda}}\log q(z|\mathbf{\lambda}) $ are analytically intractable? I know that the motivation for applying VI is exactly relying on $q$ s with easy to compute statistics, however let's say we are interested in an application where our variational approximation should live in a constrained family of distributions.
