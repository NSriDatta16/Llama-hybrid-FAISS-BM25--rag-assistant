Cannot run unit tests for an application developed with Compact Framework for Windows CE 6.0 platform

I'm developing a solution for Windows CE 6.0 using GuD_AtomKit X86 Device emulator. I'm not able to run any unit tests, because I get following error message: The test adapter ('Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.TestTypes.Unit.UnitTestAdapter, Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.Tips.UnitTest.Adapter, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a') required to execute this test could not be loaded. Check that the test adapter is installed properly. Exception of type 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.SmartDevice.TestHostAdapter.DeviceAgent.TestAlreadyRunningException' was thrown. But there's no unit test running on the device. I would really appreciate your help.
