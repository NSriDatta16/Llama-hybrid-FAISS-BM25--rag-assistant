I pretty sure there is a security "feature" in IE that stops JS being called too many times from Flash, to stop it crashing the browser. Is there a reason why you have to call it every frame? I'd suggest against this at all costs as it's putting a LOT of extra stress on the browser. ***** EDIT ***** If you want to call an ExternalInterface method from JS -> Flash in IE you have to reference the object slightly differently, like this: function thisMovie(movieName) { if (navigator.appName.indexOf("Microsoft") != -1) { return window[movieName]; } else { return document[movieName]; } } Then once you're sure the string you want to pass is constructed correctly you can call it like this from the JS: thisMovie( "theFlashElementID" ).giveMeMyStringAlready(); Then in your Flash you would have something like this: if( ExternalInterface.available ) { ExternalInterface.addCallback( "giveMeMyStringAlready", handleTheStringFromJS ); } else { handleTheFactIDontHaveExternalInterfaceAvailable(); // the only reason this would be is if container that // is embedding the swf isn't fully loaded by the browser } The standout line from the AS3 docs regarding ExternalInterface is this: Note: When using the External API with HTML, always check that the HTML has finished loading before you attempt to call any JavaScript methods.
