There is no built-in implementation of the Clojure-style Agent. I also at one point worked up a quick and dirty F# implementation similar to yours, but did not take the time to consider all the correctness issues involved; in particular, is it not true that 'T may be a value type (a struct ) larger than 64 bits (or 32 bits as the case may be) which could cause a tear (I presume that Clojure like Java doesn't have structs to worry about here). Perhaps an F# generic type constraint ( 'T when 'T : not struct ) would be needed?
