Check out the Pragmatic Programmers' Pragmatic Starter Kit . It schools you on the important basics of software development that universities/etc. seem to pass up, like version control, unit testing, and project automation (in that order), and does it in a very approachable manner. It will give you a solid base to keep going from there.
