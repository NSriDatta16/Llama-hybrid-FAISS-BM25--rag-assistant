At a first approximation, every algorithm trades off storage for speed. You have hit a boundary trying to preallocate your fully enumerated combination matrix. So maybe you should try not to preallocate this matrix but to try, say, If you think you need the combinations, calculate them somewhere else and store them in a simple db (or, heck, flat file) and look them up -- 9 gb saved Take advantage of open source, read the code to combn() and modify it into a client-server thingy: given a call with index number N , it will loop and return the Nth entry. Not efficient, but possibly more easily feasible .
