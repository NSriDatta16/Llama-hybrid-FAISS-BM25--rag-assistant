Am I doing this right? Why does it take 20 secs to load? Shouldn't it be very fast after I added index? -> I think you are doing just fine but I would also see the data selectivity in your query. How many records will by returned in your typical query out of 100,000,000? If your resultset is small(3~5% of entire table), indexing is good resolution. What is Sql server doing with my RAM? Do I need more RAM because I have a big table? -> DBMS is moving data(block by block) from physical storage to your RAM to execute your query. Also your query needs to parsing and it would consume some memory.
