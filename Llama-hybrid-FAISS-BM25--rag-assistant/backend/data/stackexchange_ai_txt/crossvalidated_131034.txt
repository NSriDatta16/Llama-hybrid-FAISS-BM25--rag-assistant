Basic - Modelling Two Series, one is an index

I'm trying to model two time series. One is a seasonally adjusted # of new jobs number against and index of business development. Its been a long time since I took econometrics, so I'm hoping someone can jump start my brain... Here is a plot of the two series, but I've divided the blue line (jobs number) by 10 just so it looks somewhat similar to the orange number. I tried an OLS, but it didn't make much sense. FYI - I'm using MATLAB. I hope this makes some sense. Should I be doing an polynomial fit? Or is there some time series thing that makes more sense? Or simply divide things until they look more similar? Thanks a lot!
