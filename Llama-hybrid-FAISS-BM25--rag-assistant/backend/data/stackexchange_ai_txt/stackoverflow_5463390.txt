Hold temporary information in gridview before post-back

I have a Dialog (Modal), where I'll register one (or several) contact. the contact goes to a gridview, where they may be edited or deleted. the data in the Gridview, can only be saved in the database at the end of the process. How can I achieve this? Modal code $(function () { $(".ModalBox").dialog({ autoOpen: false, height: 400, resizable: false, draggable: false, width: 602, modal: true, open: function (type, data) { $(this).parent().appendTo($("form:first")); } }); }); OBS.: I don't have a good sample of CSharp or html code, 'cuz i don't know how to achieve this. All my code look messy atm (trying a lot of things already) My GridView is an ascx, and the modal is in the same ascx. I belive some temporary table, or something like this will help, but i never did something like it (looks like a shop cart software), and i don't even know how look for it. Thank you. if you can do some code sample, it will be GREAT. EDIT: i did this code: CSharp code: [Serializable] public class TabelaTempContato { public int IDCliente { get; set; } public string Nome { get; set; } public string Email { get; set; } public string Telefone { get; set; } public string Cpf { get; set; } public string Rg { get; set; } public string Departamento { get; set; } public string Cargo { get; set; } } protected List ListaTabelaTemp { get { if (this.ViewState["TabelaTemp"] == null) { this.ViewState["TabelaTemp"] = new List(); } return (List)this.ViewState["TabelaTemp"]; } } protected void AddItem() { this.ListaTabelaTemp.Add(new TabelaTempContato()); this.gvContato.DataSource = this.ListaTabelaTemp; this.gvContato.DataBind(); } protected void btnTest_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { this.AddItem(); } i create one temporary gridview, but the data is empty, i tried pull it from my text in the modal, but i was not able to, i'm i'm not familiar in how i'll get the data from gridview to my database. (i believe this is the easier part, then i not focused at it in the moment) EDIT: I create the answer with my solution.
