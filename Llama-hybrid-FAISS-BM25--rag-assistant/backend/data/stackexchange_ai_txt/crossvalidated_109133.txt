How to evaluate fit of a logistic regression

I have a set of data points, which exhibit a solid linear correlation $r\approx 0.9$. I am basically plotting population in certain areas against the number of occurrences of a certain phenomenon (so in other words, I think the number of people should predict the number of occurrences of this phenomenon). I don't like the linear regression though, because a linear model can take on negative or huge values. In my case the values need to be positive, and there is an upper bound (which I don't know; but logically, the values can only get so large). Unfortunately one of the inputs for which I need a predicted output is far larger than the inputs which I used to make a regression. This made me choose a logistic model instead, $$y=\frac{A}{1+Be^{-Cx}}$$ because I am familiar with its shape (always positive, and approaching a limiting value) from basic differential equations, and it seems to be what I want for this situation. Also the data has a slight "point of inflection", so the curvature of the logistic regression (visually to me) is even a little better fit for the data points than the line was. So finally my question(s): I keep reading on the internet that logistic models are meant for probabilities, which take values between $0$ and $1$. I would like, in addition to having a high $r$, to try and reason why this type of model "makes sense" for my situation: am I going the completely wrong direction here? How can I measure the "goodness of fit" of my curve to the data points? I have read Wikipedia but it is too vague for me to understand. An explicit formula - must be computable by hand calculator - would be helpful. I have done my research but absolutely nothing I have found on the internet has been accessible to me, since I know virtually nothing about stats. An introductory/easy explanation would be so nice... and my math background is far stronger than my stats background, so use all the math you want but assume I'm a beginner at stats. I want it to be somewhat rigorous too - like if I could plug a number into a t-Test for example, that would be good to get an "objective" value.
