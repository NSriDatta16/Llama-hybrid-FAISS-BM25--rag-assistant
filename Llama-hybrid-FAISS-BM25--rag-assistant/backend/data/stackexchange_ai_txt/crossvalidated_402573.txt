I am guessing that the AUC is low for one or two folds and this brings the average down. The example below shows how low discrimination in one fold can generate a difference between 1. and 2. like you are seeing. #generate binary data correlated to x x The difference shown below (~0.03) is less than what you report. #method 1 mean(unlist(l.aucs)) #[1] 0.8389421 #method 2 roc.all I recommend plotting ROCs like below to compare. The first 5 plots are individual folds, the upper-left is random guessing and the bottom right is method 2.
