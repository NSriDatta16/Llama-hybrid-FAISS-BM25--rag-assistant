Adding a category to my own class

My AppDelegate class has quite a few methods. In my attempt to organize these methods I'm trying to group some of these methods in a category. So now I have these files: AppDelegate.h AppDelegate.m AppDelegate+GameCenter.h AppDelegate+GameCenter.m My category is ofcourse defined like this: @interface AppDelegate (GameCenter) // methods @end When I compile I get this error: 'Cannot find interface declaration for 'AppDelegate'. I think that means I have to import a file somewhere. But what file do I have to import and where? My first thought was to import AppDelegate+GameCenter.h in AppDelegate.m. But that doesn't work. Any tips? What is the best way to handle this?
