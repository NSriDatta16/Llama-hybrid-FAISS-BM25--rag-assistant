If you are doing a one-way sync to AD, I agree with Aaron that you should simply have a Trigger in SQL server. Note that this solution may suffer from some problems, like the user accounts already created, user name or password doesn't meet the AD complexity rule. You need to then find some ways to log the error. You may also need a tool to do initial provisioning of your database accounts. If you want to do two-way sync, I suggest you to read up DirSync . You probably need to write a NT service to do it. I hope you don't store password in your database. I highly suggest you to use Windows authentication. If you do need to sync up the password, you may need to write your own passwordsync and install it in all the domain controllers in your machine. If you are developing a solution for enterprise, you should look up the existing meta-directory solution products from Microsoft, MIIS , ILM , FIM . They are all the same thing except with the names different. Many enterprise has adopted this as their meta directory solution. You just need to write up an extension to leverage on its provided infrastructures to do the identity synchronization.
