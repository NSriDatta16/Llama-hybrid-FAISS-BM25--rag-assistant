What is the connection between credible regions and Bayesian hypothesis tests?

In frequentist statistics, there is a close connection between confidence intervals and tests. Using inference about $\mu$ in the $\rm N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ distribution as an example, the $1-\alpha$ confidence interval $$\bar{x}\pm t_{\alpha/2}(n-1)\cdot s/\sqrt{n}$$ contains all values of $\mu$ that aren't rejected by the $t$-test at the significance level $\alpha$. Frequentist confidence intervals are in this sense inverted tests. (Incidentally, this means that we can interpret the $p$-value as the smallest value of $\alpha$ for which the null value of the parameter would be included in the $1-\alpha$ confidence interval. I find that this can be a useful way to explain what $p$-values really are to people who know a bit of statistics.) Reading about the decision-theoretic foundation of Bayesian credible regions , I started to wonder whether there is a similar connection/equivalence between credible regions and Bayesian tests. Is there a general connection? If there is no general connection, are there examples where there is a connection? If there is no general connection, how can we see this?
