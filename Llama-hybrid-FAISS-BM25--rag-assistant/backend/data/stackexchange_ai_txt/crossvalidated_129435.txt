Interpreting high P-Value in ordinal rank correlation measures

I'm currently evaluating a machine-learned ranking task. Two (among other) performance measures are Spearman's Rho and Kendall's Tau (rank or concordance correlation). I'm basically comparing a ground-truth with my prediction results, represented by a 5-point vector, e.g. [1 2 3 4 5] and [1 3 2 4 5]. Now, my adviser told me to take the P-Values into account. As far as I understood (please correct me if I'm wrong), small P-values ( Unfortunately I got high P-values, approximately 0.23 in average. Now, my basic question is: What can I conclude? Are P-values even relevant to my task? Is concordance correlation maybe not the correct performance measure in this case? Thanks for your help.
