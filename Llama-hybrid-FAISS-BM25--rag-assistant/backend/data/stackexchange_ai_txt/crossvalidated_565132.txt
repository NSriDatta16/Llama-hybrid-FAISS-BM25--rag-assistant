If you are thinking about Location as a ordinal variable, you should probably treat it that way in the analysis. One classic test of association that would be applicable here is the Cochran–Armitage test. I believe this test doesn't actually treat the one variable as truly ordinal, but you have to assume the spacing between the categories. However, since you have labeled Location as "Predictor" and Drug as "Outcome", you would want to use a model that explicitly treats one variable as the independent variable and one variable as the dependent variable. In this case, logistic regression, using Location as on ordinal independent variable would work. I tried both if these approaches with your data. Each brings the p -value down to The upshot: You do have a little bit of a trend over location, but whether or not you got a low p -value, and for whichever statistical approach you took, the question is really, Is a difference between 42% and 44% for Drug A important in this context? I have R code for these analyses below. I have more information on the Cochran–Armitage test at the following link, with the caveat that I wrote it. rcompanion.org/handbook/H_09.html Input =( "Drug A B Location Urban 1412 1792 Middle 885 1167 Rural 485 662 ") Tabla = as.table(read.ftable(textConnection(Input))) Tabla prop.table(Tabla, margin = 1) library(coin) spineplot(Tabla) library(coin) chisq_test(Tabla, scores = list("Location" = c(-1, 0, 1))) ########################################## Data = read.table(header=TRUE, text=" Location Drug Count Urban A 1412 Middle A 885 Rural A 485 Urban B 1792 Middle B 1167 Rural B 662 ") Data $Location = factor(Data$ Location, levels = c("Urban", "Middle", "Rural"), ordered=TRUE) Data $Drug = factor(Data$ Drug) library(tidyr) Long = uncount(Data, Count) xtabs(~ Location + Drug, data=Long) model = glm(Drug ~ Location, data=Long, family=binomial()) summary(model)
