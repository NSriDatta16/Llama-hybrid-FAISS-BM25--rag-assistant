Using Git in a TFS shop

Using Git at home has spoiled me - I now find using TFS at work to be a bit of a drag and want to explore the possibility of using Git locally and syncing somehow with TFS. I figure there are a few different ways this can be done and would like to hear from people that have attempted it. I've found a blog post that describes a relatively manual workflow, but I'm hoping for something with better automation, and history support. Jim Deville appears to be writing a series on how the IronRuby team keeps their github repository in sync with TFS but it is not yet complete and I must admit I had a little trouble following what Jim has written so far. I briefly attempted to use a combination of SvnBridge and git-svn but I got stuck on an error quite quickly (perhaps this one?). I do intend to explore this further... Update: It looks like some people have had some success with the SvnBridge git-svn combo. See here . Finally, perhaps GitSharp will make it easier to develop a useful solution to this problem? Not because GitSharp has anything to do with TFS per se, but simply because it exposes git automation to .NET developers. Related Question - Git and Team Foundation Server
