Magento - how to include javascript file on a page by page basis

In magento I know how to include js files in the page layout file. How though, do i include specific javascript files only on certain pages with my custom module. For example i am writing a custom module that will work with the product view and list pages. I therfore want to have some sort of layout update that i can use with my module that will include my javascript file only on the product view and list pages.
