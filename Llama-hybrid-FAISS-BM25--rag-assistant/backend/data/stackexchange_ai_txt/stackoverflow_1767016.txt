Try setting your cache to readOnly="false" -- From the documentation: The framework supports both read-only and read/write caches. Read-only caches are shared among all users and therefore offer greater performance benefit. However, objects read from a read-only cache should not be modified. Instead, a new object should be read from the database (or a read/write cache) for updating. On the other hand, if there is an intention to use objects for retrieval and modification, a read/write cache is recommended (i.e. required). To use a read-only cache, set readOnly=”true” on the cache model element. To use a read/write cache, set readOnly=”false”. The default is read-only (true).
