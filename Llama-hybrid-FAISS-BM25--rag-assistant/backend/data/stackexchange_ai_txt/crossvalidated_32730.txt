How to include an interaction term in GAM?

The following code evaluates the similarity between two time series: set.seed(10) RandData Here, gam is used to evaluate how the temperature at New York and Miami vary from the mean temperature (of both locations) at different times of the day. The problem that I now have is that I need to include an interaction term which shows how the temperature of each location varies throughout at the day for different days of the year. I eventually hope to display all of this information on one graph (for each location). So, for Miami I hope to have one graph that shows how the temperature varies from the mean during different times of the day and different times of the year (3d plot?)
