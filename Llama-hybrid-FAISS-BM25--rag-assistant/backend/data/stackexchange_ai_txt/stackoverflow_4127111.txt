It depends on the data structure they're stored in. Radix sort beats N-log-N sort on fairly small problem sizes if the input is in a linked list, because it doesn't need to allocate any scratch memory, and if you can afford to allocate a scratch buffer the size of the input at the beginning of the sort, the same is true for arrays. It's really only the wrong choice (for integer keys) when you have very limited additional storage space and your input is in an array. I would expect the crossover point to be well below a million regardless.
