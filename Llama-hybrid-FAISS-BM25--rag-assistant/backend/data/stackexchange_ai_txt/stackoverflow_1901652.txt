Is there a lightweight library to do draggable+sortable lists inside greasemonkey scripts?

I'm writing a GreaseMonkey script, as part of which I'd like to sort a list by dragging its items. I'm using mootools, but the component for sortable lists doesn't work in the GM sandboxed environment. Can you recommend a smallish library/piece of code to do list sorting in the most lightweight fashion? I want it to be independant of any large framework and don't feel like implementing it myself.
