What you used to be doing sounds fine, and you should not be confused and led astray by what you are reading about principal component analysis. PCA does not use a dependent variable at all, and therefore can tell you nothing about the importance of your individual predictors. All these issues have been discussed here before, and I can particularly recommend you to study the following threads: Using principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection Detecting significant predictors out of many independent variables Importance of predictors in multiple regression: Partial $R^2$ vs. standardized coefficients The last thread can initially appear quite confusing, but scroll down to my answer and look at its second part for a short summary of various existing measures of "predictor importance" in regression.
