I was trying to do the same thing. While background-color and background-image exist on separate layers within an object -- meaning they can co-exist -- CSS gradients seem to co-opt the background-image layer. From what I can tell, border-image seems to have wider support than multiple backgrounds, so maybe that's an alternative approach. http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/css3-border-images UPDATE: A bit more research. Seems Petra Gregorova has something working here --> http://petragregorova.com/demos/css-gradient-and-bg-image-final.html
