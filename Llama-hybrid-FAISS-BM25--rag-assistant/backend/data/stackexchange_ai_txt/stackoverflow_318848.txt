If these programs are just for your productivity, whatever works! Build in as much error handling as you think you need. Reading in a whole file if it's large may not be the best way long-term to do things, so you may want to process lines as they come in rather than load them up in an array. One tip I got from one of the chapters in The Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt & Thomas) is that you might want to have the script save a backup of the file for you before it goes to work slicing and dicing.
