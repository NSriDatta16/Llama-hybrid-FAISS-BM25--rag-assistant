Anonymous Parallel Task Timers?

Maybe my brain is a bit fried so I'm missing some nice way to do the following... I want to be able to launch a timer though a Task that runs on a certain interval and checks some condition on each interval whether it should cancel itself, what's the most elegant solution? Optimally I'd like something like: Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { Timer.Do(TimeSpan.FromMilliSeconds(200),() => ShouldCancel(), ()=> { //DoStuff }); }); using a while/thread-sleep loop doesn't seem optimal. I guess I could define and use a ordinary timer but it seems a bit clunky...
