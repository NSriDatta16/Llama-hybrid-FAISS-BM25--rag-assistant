How to estimate the prediction power for a combination of MARS and CART model?

I am trying to find a good model for my data to predict new values. My idea was to combine a MARS and a CART model (averaging the outcomes of both models). This method fits the Training data well. Now I want to get some statistics which show how good this combined model is concerning prediction. How can I estimate the predictive power in this case? Is cross-validation useful?
