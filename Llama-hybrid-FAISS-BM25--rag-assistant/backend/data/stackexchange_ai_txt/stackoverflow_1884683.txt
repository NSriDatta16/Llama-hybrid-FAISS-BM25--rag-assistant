You can pass a Regexp to expire_fragment: expire_fragment(r%{/posts/index/\d+}) But be warned that only works when your cache store is capable of iterating over all keys. For example, it doesn't work with memcached . Edit: I see this is page caching, not fragment caching. It seems expire_page does not accept a Regexp. Hmm.
