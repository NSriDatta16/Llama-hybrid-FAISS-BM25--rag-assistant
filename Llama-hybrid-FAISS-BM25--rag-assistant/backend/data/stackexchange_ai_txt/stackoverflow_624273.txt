You have to design two differents sites to do this? Yes How can I know if the site is accessed by a mobile browser? Your programming language has probably some way of looking through the client's information. PHP, for example, has a superglobal variable $_SERVER that has all kinds of information of both the serving server, and the visiting client. In this case, you would be interested in the value of $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] , which would give the following result, should I visit a page: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/528.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/528.16 This tells you that I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.6, using Safari 4.0. There are known keywords for various mobile browsers. One version of iPhone's browser, for example, has the following user agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A543a Safari/419.3 the "iPhone" already gives it away, but is further confirmed by the keywords "Mobile" and "Safari"
