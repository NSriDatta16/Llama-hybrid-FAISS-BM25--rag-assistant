It's a misclassified point. What you're looking is a SVM that has a soft margin, which can let a couple of instances on the wrong side of the hyperplane. If a SVM were trained on this dataset it would continuously iterate until it gets a separating hyperplane, but these points can't be linearly separated, so training wouldn't stop. To fix this we add in a soft margin variable which adds in a little slack and will let it have a few instances on the wrong side of it's hyperplane. Just a word - if the soft margin variable (slack penalty C) is equal to 0 it will ignore the data entirely. https://martin-thoma.com/svm-with-sklearn/
