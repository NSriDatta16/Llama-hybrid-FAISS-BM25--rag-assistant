PHP Array extracting object

Suppose I have an array of a objects of user defined class. Wanted to know how do I extract the elements of the array in PHP. // class definition class User { public $fname; public $lname; } // array of objects of the class defined above $objUser1 = new User(): $objUser2 = new User(): $objUser3 = new User(): $objUser4 = new User(): $alUser = array(); $alUser[] = $objUser1; $alUser[] = $objUser2; $alUser[] = $objUser3; $alUser[] = $objUser4; // trying to iterate and extract values using typcasting - this does not work, what is the alternative. foreach($alUser as $user) { $obj = (User) $user; // gives error - unexpected $user; } Thats how I used to do in java while extracting objects from the Java ArrayList, hence thought the PHP way might be similar. Can anyone explain it.
