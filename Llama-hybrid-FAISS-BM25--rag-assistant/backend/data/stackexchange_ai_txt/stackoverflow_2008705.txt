To be honest, I am not sure what you mean by most of these terms. If you are talking about design patterns then I believe the Gang of Four book ( Design Patterns ) has diagrams of each of the patterns that they use. If you are talking about something else, you might be overcomplicating things. Also, where would you expect to get an "official" definition on terms that are not themselves official?
