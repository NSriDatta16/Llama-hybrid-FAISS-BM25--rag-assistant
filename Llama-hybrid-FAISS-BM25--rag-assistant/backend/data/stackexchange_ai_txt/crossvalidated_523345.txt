Equivalent of "lm" for irregular time series forecasting in R

I have a two column data frame corresponding to time series of the form (Date, Value). I want to predict future values of Value based on this data. I don't need anything fancy, just a quick and dirty one-liner to give me a rough sense of what is going on. For linear models, there is a version of this in R: The lm function. It handles missing values gracefully and always returns something useful. I have been searching high and low for an "equivalent" of this for general (i.e. possibly irregular / missing values) time series, and have come up short. (For example, forecast::auto.arima requires regular spaced time series.) While I have found some complex solutions that are tailored to special cases and specific models, I just want a quick and dirty one-liner version of lm for time series that will work out of the box (see below). If there is no such function, is there a short explanation for why? This seems like a problem that should have a famously simple R solution. Example use of lm for comparison: df
