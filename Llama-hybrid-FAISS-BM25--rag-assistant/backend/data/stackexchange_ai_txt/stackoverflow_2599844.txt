ideas for a distributed cache proxy server

I am implementing, a distributed cache proxy server.I have an idea of the HTTP and related stuff, so i am rather concentrating on the sub part "Distributed data storage". From some search on web i found that this could be done using Distributed Hash Tables(DHT). I was wondering if there exists some kind of library for this preferably in C/C++. Any better suggestions for the same will also be appreciated.
