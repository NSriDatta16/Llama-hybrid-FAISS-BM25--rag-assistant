The reasons that neural networks are such a hot topic right now is partially because of NN successes in image tasks, such as object recognition, facial recognition and other tasks. Trees simply don't do these tasks very well. So, if you're willing to accept that images of ordinary objects are one type of data distribution, then you'll find that trees do not do very well against this distribution. Therefore, there is no contradiction with the NFL because another method (CNNs) outperforms trees. See: What are the current state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks?
