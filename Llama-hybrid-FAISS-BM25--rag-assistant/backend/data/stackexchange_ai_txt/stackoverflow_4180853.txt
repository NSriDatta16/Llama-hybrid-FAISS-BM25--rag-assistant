How to skip next statements and jump to the other statement in debugging visual studio 2010

Visual studio 2003, 2008 show a red dot on the left at line where we set a break, When the process stops at the break line, I can hoover and drag the yellow high lighted to skip some statements. I don't see it in visual studio 2010. In 2010, I have to right click and set break, there is no cursor or thing to grab and move it to next statement. How to skip a statement and jump to other statements. Thanks in advance
