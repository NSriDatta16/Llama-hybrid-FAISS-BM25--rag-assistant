From your post, you are trying to answer: "whether that experiment causes the average number of posts per students increases or not" Put differently, you want to assess whether the mean of 2 distributions, i.e. posts by students in the test condition (your experiment) and posts by students in the control condition are significantly different. With this formulation, you should apply the t-Test for the Significance of the Difference between the Means of Two Independent Samples (assuming that these are different classes). In R you should do the following: First perform f-test to check if the variances of the 2 distributions are equal. var.test(a,b) Now perform the t-Test, the var.equal will be TRUE or FALSE based on the results on the F-test. t.test(a,b, var.equal=TRUE, paired=FALSE) Sharing a few good links on this problem: http://vassarstats.net/textbook/ch11pt1.html http://www.r-bloggers.com/two-sample-students-t-test-1/
