Some thoughts, quite naive perhaps. Use or modify as you see fit. If you have information on which regions are built and which are not, you can make use of simulation. Compute a suitable statistic of clustering structure (average distance between impact points or average distance of each impact to its (k) nearest neighbours seem sensible to me). Repeatedly "bomb" the region with a random number generator, uniform over the area. Discard impacts over non-built area, and retain simulated sets with the same number of "valid" impacts than the real data set. For each of these randomly generated bombings, compute the value of the test statistic, to obtain an approximation of its distribution under the null distribution. Assess the value of your test statistic in 1) using said approximated distribution. 1)-4) provide a way of conducting a test for "clusterness" against the null of uniform distribution over built areas. I would think that the null is quite unrealistic, because: The israelis are likely to have some intelligence on targets, rather than just pound the region at random. Even if the targets were uniformly distributed over built area, it is likely that more than one impact is needed to destroy a target, which would by itself lead to a concentration of impacts around points thought to be targets.
