On the assumption that you're coding in ASP.NET (including MVC), calling a JavaScript function would mean embedding the call in JavaScript into your ASPX code, like so: doSomething(); You do have the opportunity to pass information from your C# to the JS call, just as you would have any other code alter the results of your ASPX: doSomething(" "); This is really stretching the definition of "calling JavaScript from C#" though. What you're doing is having your C#/ASPX code generate HTML/JavaScript, which the browser then interprets as it would any other HTML/JS (regardless of how it was generated). Perhaps you could explain what you're trying to do a bit more.
