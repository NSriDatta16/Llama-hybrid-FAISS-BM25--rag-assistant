Matching loss function for tanh units in a neural net

There's not much more I can add to the question. Googling has mostly turned up research papers on springerlink and other sites I don't have access to. Given a neural network model with $tanh(x)$ as the output non-linearity, what is the appropriate matching loss function to use? -Brian
