I'm the creator of bayes-scala toolbox you are referring to. Last year I implemented the EM in discrete bayesian network for learning from incomplete data (including latent variables), that looks like the use case you are asking about. Some tutorial for a sprinkler bayesian network is here . And, "Learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks with latent variables" is given here .
