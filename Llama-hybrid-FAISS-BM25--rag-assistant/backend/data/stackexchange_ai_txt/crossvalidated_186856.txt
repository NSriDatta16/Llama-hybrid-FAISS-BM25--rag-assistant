Population vs sample

When we think of linear regression, the implicit assumption is that we only observe a small fraction of a possibly infinite large population. Thinking of simple averages, imagine a fair die. The expected value of this die is 3.5. This is the population average, because we actually observe the entire population in a sense. My question is the following: how and when can we distinguish between sample averages and population expected values?
