The original question needs to be clarified: What happens with BValue and CValue in the original question? Is there a reason why they shouldn't be part of the flattened structure? Do all of the elements in the XML doc have 2 attributes or is this completely arbitrary? Are there only 3 types of elements and are they always nested as shown in the example? Can your element1 be repeated itself or is this the root element of your doc? In XSLT it is possible to write very generic transformers but it is often much easier to write a stylesheet to transform a document when you can take any known restrictions into account.
