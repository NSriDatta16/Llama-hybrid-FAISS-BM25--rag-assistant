Railroad balking on application model & admin level controllers

I've just installed railroad and tried to run a couple simple example runs. I have an application model and controller that are causing it some heartburn. There is no real application table - the model is used to load (include) things like the authenication system. The controller sets up the helper_methods, etc. I also have many controllers which are in a subdir admin for many of the models. When I run: railroad -o models.dot -M I get: /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activerecord-2.2.2/lib/active_record/base.rb:1833:in method_missing': undefined method helper_method' for Application(Table doesn't exist):Class (NoMethodError) When I run: railroad -o controllers.dot -C I get /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/activesupport-2.2.2/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:445:in `load_missing_constant': uninitialized constant CoverageAmountsController (NameError) The coverage_amounts.rb controller (class Admin::CoverageAmountsController What can I do to resolve these issues? Is there something I can do within railroad or my app to make it work? I'd like to use something like this to see if it will work for my needs.
