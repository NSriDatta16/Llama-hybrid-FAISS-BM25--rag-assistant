A couple options come to mind: Create invisible buttons and place them to receive these clicks Subclass UISlider and intercept the touchesBegan, etc methods. Determine if you want to respond to the hit based on its location, or call the super's function. You may need to expand the frame to include where you're touching. I'm not sure that creating a non standard (especially invisible!) implementation is a great idea, however - I'd recommend you add visible buttons for fine-tuning. A simple up-arrow / down arrow to the side might help. Also consider if a UISlider is what you want at all, given that it doesn't work well enough for you.
