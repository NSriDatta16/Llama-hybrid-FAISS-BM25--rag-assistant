How to organise data and run nerlovian model

I am trying to estimate the price elasticity of supply for small scale farmers in Malawi and I have time series data for 34 years. I have two problems: First, the prices are very low such that when I take their logs am getting negative values, as a remedy i added 1 to each value and i got positive logs but i don't know how to interprete the result with the 1 that I added. Second i want to find out the specific way of estimating the model in Stata , I just used regress. I will appreciate your help
