Can't get shake events on iPhone

I am not being able to get shake events on iPhone. I have followed other questions here with no result. I also tried following the GLPaint example from Apple, but it seems exactly like my source code, with a small diference. GLPaint's source code /works/, mine /doesn't/. So, here it is what I have: Controller.m - (void)awakeFromNib { [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(shakeEnded) name:@"shake" object:nil]; } ShakingEnabledWindow.m - (void)shakeEnded { NSLog(@"Shaking ended."); } - (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake ) { // User was shaking the device. Post a notification named "shake". [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@"shake" object:self]; NSLog(@"Shaken!"); } } - (void)motionCancelled:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } My XIB has a window, which is a ShakingEnabledWindow and an object, my Controller. I am running out of ideas here, hope someone can give me a hand. :)
