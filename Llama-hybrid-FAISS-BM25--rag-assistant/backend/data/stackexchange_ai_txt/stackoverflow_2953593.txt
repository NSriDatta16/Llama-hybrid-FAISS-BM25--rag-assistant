For random-access iterators you can just use subtraction: size_t index = some_iterator - some_deque.begin() Obviously this doesn't work for all iterators (eg. for std::list or whatever) but I'd submit that there's a certain elegance in that you can only use this technique when it'll take constant time. If your container doesn't have random access iterators then it very probably isn't sensible to try to find the index of them anyway.
