Magento: getting an attribute of a nav filter item

So I'm getting more and more familiar with the layered navigation Magento employs, and I do notice that it's possible to get various attributes of the items, like Name or a string Value, however there's one attribute I cannot get easily from the model I'm using ('catalog/layer_filter_item'): position. Does anyone know how to get the position of the attribute filtering option, like say there's a color Magenta with a position of 2 -- how can I get that 2? The question could also be -- how do I get the sort_order out of the table eav_attribute_option... if that helps. Thanks for any help :)
