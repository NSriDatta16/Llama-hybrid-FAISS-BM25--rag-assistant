This is an open area of research and it certainly depends on the way you frame the problem. If you're talking about multi-document summarization then the problem is slightly different than if you were talking about single-document summarization. It's worth briefly reviewing the literature. The link provided by u/Society Of Data Scientists is great and it's useful for the abstractive summarization task across a single document. There's also work done on extractive summarizations, which identifies important sentences to extract. Rush et. al has a nice paper on the abstractive summarization with Attention , which is based on deep learning. For an extractive summarization, you could use an LSTM to build your classifier and use standard TensorFlow/Torch libraries but there doesn't seem to be any current publications on using deep learning for this approach. Here are some additional GitHub repos: The Original Rush et. al repo. A TensorFlow implementation of the same paper
