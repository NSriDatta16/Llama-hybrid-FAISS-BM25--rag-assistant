See documentation on Grails+Spring integration . When you have gotten Spring working inside Grails, next steps should already be standard Spring. As you have not detailed, how your existing Struts and Spring MVC applications " pull in applicationContext and services " I cannot comment on the details. However, it should be similar to the way your existing applications do it. EDIT : check also answers to this question on how to organize your Spring beans.
