Which is the best, standard (and hopefully free) C++ compiler?

Saludos a todos en stackoverflow.com!! So... I'm a C++ newbie currently taking the subject of Data Structures, and I want to consult something with you guys: Since I started studying Systems Engineering, I've been using the last version of Dev-C++ for all my programming projects. It has done it's job well so far, but it has a FATAL flaw... trying to debug your code in it it's just... awfully painful!! Everytime you activate the debug mode you have to cross your fingers and hope it doesn't crash in your face just before the variable you are watching even changes. Then, I though about using Visual-C++ from Microsoft, as it is free too; however, I asked my teacher and told me not to use it in the course, as it is not standard (compiled programs in it will only work for Windows); we are required to make code that can be compiled both in a Windows and Linux environment, and once compiled in any, being able to use the application on both environments. So people, I want you to please give me advice: Which C++ compiling software out there has a strong and/or stable debugging mode, implements the standard compiler (is it called g++, by the way??), and it's hopefully free??? Thanks for your attention. Gracias y hasta luego ^_^ (BTW, happy first post!!! ^o^)
