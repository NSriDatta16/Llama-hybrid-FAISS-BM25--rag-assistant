Best way to detect newly incoming anomalies in two timeseries?

I have two devices that both send data (let's say temperature). I need to be able to detect if one of the devices reports an unusual/anomalous reading. The case if both of the devices report a "weird" value doesn't need to be handled. So, for example: Device 1 reports: [1,2,2,4,6,6,7,8,10,10,11] Device 2 reports: [2,2,3,4,5,6,6,7,9,11,11] Then, a new reading comes in and for Device 1 it's 12 but for Device 2 it's 7 . What's the best way (if there is any) to flag such a case? I would usually only be looking 24h into the past and the measurements are hourly averages.
