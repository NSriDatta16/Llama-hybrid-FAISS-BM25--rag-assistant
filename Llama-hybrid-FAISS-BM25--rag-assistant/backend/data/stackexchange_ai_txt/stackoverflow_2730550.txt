Embed SQL Password into Crystal Reports RPT file?

We are experimenting with Crystal Reports viewers such as this one: http://www.thereportviewer.com/ ... which can actually re-connect to the data source and re-run a Crystal Reports RPT file with live data. However when running the report the viewer asks for a password to connect to the data source (in this case SQL Server). Does Crystal Reports have some way of embedding a connection password into a RPT file to avoid this? Or should I be using a System DSN from the Control Panel/ODBC thing to get around this? I figure someone else must have had this problem.
