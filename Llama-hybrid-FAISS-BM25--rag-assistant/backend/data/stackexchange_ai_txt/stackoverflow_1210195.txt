It's actually pretty common for games to allocate one huge chunk of memory from the system and then provide custom allocators via overloaded new and delete. One big reason is that consoles have a fixed memory size, making both leaks and fragmentation large problems. Usually (at least on a closed platform) the default heap operations come with a lack of control and a lack of introspection. For many applications this doesn't matter, but for games to run stably in fixed-memory situations the added control and introspection are both extremely important.
