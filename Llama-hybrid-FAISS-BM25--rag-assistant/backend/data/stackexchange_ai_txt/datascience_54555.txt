Got your email... Built this example repository for ya: https://github.com/dancrew32/resume_classifer/ If you go through the notebook, I outlined the process of setting up labels, different folders for different kinds of resumes, loading them up, vectorizing text, classifying using logistic regression. https://github.com/dancrew32/resume_classifer/blob/master/Resume%20Doc%20Classifier.ipynb Let me know if you have any questions. P.S. Never adding a skip button ;)
