Log-likelihood function for a filtered Fourier spectrum

I have time series data from which I am trying to infer parameters using MCMC. I normally infer parameters about the data in the time domain, using a Normal log-likelihood. However, I now have to infer parameters using a filtered FFT of the time-series. The data looks like this, with the current plotted against time on the right, and the current plotted against the input potential on the left This is because the "noise" process has a linear effect on the time-series whilst the signal process is non-linear. Below is the FFT of the current data Each peak in the spectrum represents a harmonic of the input voltage frequency. There is more "signal" in the higher harmonics than noise (which is apparent if you individually inverse FFT each peak, like so). The harmonic number is on the right of the plot I do not think the log-likelihood function I am using is valid for complex numbers, as it is returning infinite values. Is there an alternative log-likelihood that is valid for complex numbers?
