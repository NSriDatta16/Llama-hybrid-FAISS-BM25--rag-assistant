Just out of curiousity, in the DragDrop method, have you tried testing whether you can get the bitmap image out of the DragEventArgs at all? Without doing the sender cast? I'm wondering whether the picturebox object isn't serializable, which causes the issue when you try to use the sender in a different app domain...
