Do I need Sargan test with equal numbers of instruments and endogenous variables when one instrument can affect more than one endogenous variables?

I have a instrumental variable logistic regression I run with three instruments (z1, z2, z3) and three endogenous variables (k1, k2, k3). Therefore, since the number of instruments "3" equals the number of endogenous variables "3", the statistics says I do not need to run the Sargan test to check over-identification. My model also shows strong instruments (passing Instrument relevance test) and endogeneity tests (by passing the tests for exogeneity) with these three instruments and endogenous variables. However, my economic interpretation says z1 may not only affect k1 but also k2. Does this mean I am still having over-identification problem? But even though I do so, I will still have zero degrees of freedom that won't make me run the Sargan test at all. Shall I assume I still do not need over-identification test in this case? May I also have some literature support for the arguments as well please? Also, if I interpret that z1 may not only affect k1 but also k2, is this acceptable in general as part of the instrumental variable regression result interpretation? If not, is there a way to make this interpretation acceptable? I need a clear answer without disregarding the last sentence above in bold texts please.
