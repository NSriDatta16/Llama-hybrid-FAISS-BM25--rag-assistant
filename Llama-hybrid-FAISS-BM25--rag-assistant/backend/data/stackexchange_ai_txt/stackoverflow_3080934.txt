If you are using UIWebView to host your html+javascript you can use the stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString: method to evaluate a javascript fragment (and call your JS functions from that). Calling ObjC code from javascript would be complicated: for what I know you can only call JS code from ObjC, but not viceversa. You could periodically call a certain JS function from ObjC and use the returned string to select some action to perform in ObjC. Kind of hackish, I think, but I have no other ideas.
