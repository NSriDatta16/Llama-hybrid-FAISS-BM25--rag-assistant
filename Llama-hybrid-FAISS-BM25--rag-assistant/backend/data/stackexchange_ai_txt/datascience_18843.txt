R tutorial for multitask regression tree for missing value prediction?

I have a dataframe with 20 columns. Data is integrated from five different data sources. I have shown 4 columns from each dataset. 4/5 sources have discrete data (either 1 or 0). The last section has continuous values which is my target (Contains NA). I intend to implement Random Forest algorithm to predict the missing values. I have seen tutorials which predict only one Y variable. Is this a regression tree for missing value prediction task for continuous multioutput Y? kindly share some tutorial links which could provide some reference code in R.
