Here's how I would try to implement it : Add a MouseListener and MouseMotionListener to your JList. When the mouser enters in the list, start a thread waiting for a certain delay (half a second). When the mouse is moved or dragged, restart waiting for the delay. When the mouse exits the JList, cancel the thread. Use these listeners to track the mouse position as well. Once the delay has been met (which should thus mean that the mouse has stayed on the list, without moving, for the whole delay), then use SwingUtilities.invokeLater to show the information box. You can use JList's locationToIndex to determine which row the mouse is hovering on.
