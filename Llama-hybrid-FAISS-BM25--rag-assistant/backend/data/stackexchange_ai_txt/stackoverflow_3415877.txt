I think you would have to set them back to their default values, as set by the specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ For color, I don't believe there is a default value set; it looks to the user agent (browser) to define that. So, once a color is set in CSS, I don't believe it can be "unset" later - you would have to manually remove that style from your reset.
