Maximum Entropy: another name for Maximum Likelihood or a legit Bayes procedure?

In some more recent works (like this and this for instance), MaxEnt is unequivocally bound to Maximum Likelihood ( ergo Classical Inference). In some other older works (like Jaynes article ), MaxEnt and Bayesian methods are shown unavoidably intertwined. What am I missing here? Did the long time foes Maximum Likelihood Inference and Bayesian Inference somehow end up belonging to the same class of equivalence because of their equivalence to MaxEnt?!?
