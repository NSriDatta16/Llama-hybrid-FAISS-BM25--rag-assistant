I am working my way through Elements of Statistical Learning . This book covers an incredible range of techniques (so is 700+ pages) but each approach is explained clearly in a very practical, rather than highly theoretical way. It doesn't explicitly contain anything about R, however the plots and graphs are all clearly made with R and there are packages on CRAN for all the topics discussed. The authors have all been involved with the development of R (as well as a fair chunk of modern machine learning techniques).
