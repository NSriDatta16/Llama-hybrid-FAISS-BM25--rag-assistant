The simplest solution is to have your processing done on a background thread using the BackgroundWorker component. You can drag it in from the VS toolbox. It allows you to update the UI thread with progress notifications so you can update your progress bar to show realistic values (something much more user-friendly than having a "marquee" style progress bar).
