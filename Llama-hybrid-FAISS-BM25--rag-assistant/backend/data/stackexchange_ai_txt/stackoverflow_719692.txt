Without the ending space here printf("%d %d",a,b); you get into trouble the first time you do printf("%d ", n); The most elegant thing you could do would be to change the printf in the loop to prepend the needed space like this: printf(" %d", n); That way you're not left with a hanging space at the end... You get "too many" elements displayed because you haven't counted the one written in first printf ...
