You need to add an OnlyAtBOL specification to your macro. Try this: ( { Identifier = objc.hello; BasedOn = objc; OnlyAtBOL = YES; IsMenuItem = YES; Name = "Hello"; TextString = "Hello, Xcode!"; CompletionPrefix = "hello"; IncludeContexts = ("xcode.lang.objc"); } ) I am pretty new at text macros, but as far as i understand OnlyAtBOL means that this text macro will complete only when it is at the beggining of the line ( YES ) or not ( NO ). It seems weird that it does not work without this specification, i don' t know if it' s a bug or feature :) You might want to check this topic, since its probably the same thing you are trying to do: http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/104/topics/3334
