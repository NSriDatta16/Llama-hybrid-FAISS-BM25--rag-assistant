Get current domain in ASMX

In C# in an asmx web service how do I get the current domain that the webservice was called on? HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.Host returns kindof what I want but instead of http://mydomain.com/Folder/Mywebservice.asmx I just need http://mydomain.com . I know i could just cut that string up but it seems really in-elegant. Thanks
