Logistic regression after a 3 year follow up where successful people can leave the sample

I have data tracking the outcomes of young people participating in an intervention project (between the ages of 12-16). In 2016, data was taken of all young people who had joined the project that year. These included children of a range of ages. On a 3 year follow up, we then recorded who had dropped out of the project. I want to run a logistic regression to measure what variables predict the probability of a young person dropping out of the project. Those who had dropped out were coded as a 1 for failure. Anyone who was still in the study was coded as a 0 (success). These cases are technically right censored. However, at age 16 people must leave the project, but this is called a successful outcome as they stayed in the scheme during secondary school. These are described as 'graduates'. These people could have turned 16 before the 3 year follow up (for instance in 2017). My question is, am I ok to code graduates as a 0 also, as they are not deemed a failed outcome? My hypothesis is simply to test the probability of failure occurring. Or would it be more appropriate to use a multinomial regression, coding graduates as a 2? If possible, I would prefer to use a logistic regression to keep my model as simple as possible. For further context, I am running this analysis alongside a competing risk regression (CRR) (survival analysis). The motivation is for the CRR to determine variables which lead to individuals dropping out more quickly. The logistic regression will define which variables best predict drop out. Thanks in advance for your help!
