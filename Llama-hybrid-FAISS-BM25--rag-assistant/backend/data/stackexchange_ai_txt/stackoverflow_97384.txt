Take a look at when the drag panel extender and popup control extender actually extend your panel. Chances are those extenders work on an initialization event of the page. When the update panel fires and updates your page the original DOM element that was extended was replaced by the result of the update panel. Which means that you now have a control that is no longer extended. I don't really know of an easy solution to this problem. What will probably work is if you can hook into an event after the update panel has updated the page and extend the panel again.
