LSTM (as well as all recurrent neural networks) process one input vector, in this case corresponding to one word, at a time. In each step, the RNN cell reads the input vector and updates its hidden and output states accordingly (LSTM distinguishes hidden state $c_t$ and output state $h_t$ , other RNN types typically don't). Depending on the attributes of the LSTM calls, it either returns one state vector (if return_sequences is set to True ) per input or the last hidden after reading the entire input sequence. In this code snippet, it is the last output state of dimension 50.
