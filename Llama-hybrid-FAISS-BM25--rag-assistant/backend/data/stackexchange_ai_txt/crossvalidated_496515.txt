To add a separate dimension to my previous answer - there are two aspects which can impact the evaluation speed for prediction. The number of support vectors - this gives the number of kernel evaluations you need to do. The cost of evaluating the kernel function - which in this case is directly tied to the dimensionality of the problem, and the performance of the operations. My previous answer focused on how to reduce the number of kernel evaluations. The other part that you can try to improve upon is to reduce the cost. There are numerous approaches to speed the evaluation of the RBF. This paper evaluates Taylor and Random Fourier approximation methods - the latter was also used in a highly scalable approach in terms of number of samples. One can also look to leverage dimensionality reduction - there are well known results in this space for e.g. using Random projection which could be relevant - in particular if the Euclidean distances are well approximated after the projection, then the RBF would also be well approximated. Note that this would generally be a pre-processing step, before training.
