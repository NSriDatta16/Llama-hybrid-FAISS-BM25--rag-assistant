Neural Network Hidden Layers an data Dimensionality

In multi-Linear regression where we have a model of $y=X_1+X_2$ it's a common practice (as I studied in my Master's) to increase the dimensionality and try to use a model of $y=X_1+X_2+X_1 X_2$ . Can we say the same about increasing the nodes and the hidden layers in neural networks? I'm a beginner and English is not my first language so sorry If I made a mistake or if it's a stupid question.
