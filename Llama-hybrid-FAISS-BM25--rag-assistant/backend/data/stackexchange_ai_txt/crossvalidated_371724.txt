SPSS - Binary logistic regression: classification cutoff

Let's say I want to evaluate the predictive value of a continuous variable in the prediction of malignancy (event/status) of a tumour. Malignant = 1 Nonmalignant = 0 In SPSS, I can run a binary logistic regression model to do so. It allows me to set a cutoff value for classification. My question is: SPSS assumes equal pretest chances and odds in both groups, and proposes a cutoff value of 0.5. However, research has shown that malignant tumours are 70 % of all tumours, and nonmalignant tumours are 30 % of all tumours. Hence, a priori, there is a chance of 70 % for a tumour to be malignant. There is, however, no way to include an a priori chance in SPSS (at least, not by my knowledge). Am I instead allowed to change the cutoff value to 0.5/(0.7/0.5)? The rationale is that the probability for malignancy is 0.7/0.5 times larger than 0.5, and thus that, instead of changing pretest probabilities, the posttest probability could be reduced by a factor 0.7/0.5. Is this correct, or not?
