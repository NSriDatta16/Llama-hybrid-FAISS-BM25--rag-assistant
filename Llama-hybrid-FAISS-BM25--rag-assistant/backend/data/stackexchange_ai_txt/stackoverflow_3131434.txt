It's very easy to hide content that's going to be processed by JavaScript. You just need to generate the content itself with JavaScript or set its style to display: none . The problems is accessibility. You normally want the content to be available for tools that do not support all the advanced features, including old browsers, search engines, mobiles phones, screen readers... That's what prevents you from doing what I mentioned in the first paragraph. My advice is to alter your CSS so the content looks good even with JavaScript disabled. (As for your latest requirement, you can use the jQuery.ipanema-girl.js plugin .)
