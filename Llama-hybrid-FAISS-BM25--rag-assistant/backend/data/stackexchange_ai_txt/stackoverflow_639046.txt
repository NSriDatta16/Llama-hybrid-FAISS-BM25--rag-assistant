Although you're also a .Net developer, the Java implementation reference of the cargo app from DDD by Eric Evans and Citerus is a good resource. In the doc'd code, you can see the DDD-organization into bounded contexts and aggregates in action, right in the Java packages. Additionally, you might consider Billy McCafferty's Sharp Architecture . It's an ASP.Net MVC, NHibernate/Fluent NHibernate implementation that is built with DDD in mind. Admittedly, you will still need to apply a folder/namespace solution to provide the contexts. But, couple the Evans approach with #Arch and you should be well on your way. Let us know what you are going with. I am on the same path as well, and not far from you! Happy coding, Kurt Johnson
