Like others have said, this is a matter of style, not a hard and fast rule. For instance, I don't like four spaces for indentation. I am a real tab for block level indentation/spaces for lining things up sort of programmer, so I ignore that section of perlstyle . I also require a reason for style. If you cannot clearly state why you prefer a given style then the rule is pointless. In this case the reason is fairly easy to see. Whitespace that is not required is used to call attention to something or make something easier to read. So, does a semicolon deserve extra attention? Every expression (barring control structures) will end with a semicolon, and most expressions fit on one line. So calling attention to the expected case seems to be a waste of a programmers time and attention. This is why most programmers indent a line that is a continuation of an expression to call attention to the fact that it didn't end on one line: open my $fh, " Now, the second reason we use whitespace is make something easier to read. Is foo("bar") ; easier to read than foo("bar"); I would make the claim that is harder to read because it is calling my attention to the semicolon, and I, for the most part, don't care about semicolons if the file is formatted correctly. Sure Perl cares, and if I am missing one it will tell me about it.
