I would have something that looks like the following: Players Roster +---------------+ +---------------+ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +---------------+ +---------------+ Filter: --------- With list elements in the Players list having (maybe) a picture, name, and other information about the Player. The Filter text box would allow the user to type a partial name and filter the list to make finding the desired player easier. Each element is draggable to the Roster column at which point the player would be added to the roster. I have intentionally left this platform agnostic since you didn't mention if this was for a Desktop or Web app. Since this is for a web app, I would suggest making each player in the list its own seperate div, using jQuery Draggable to enable the drag/drop functionality, and using jQuery's AJAX functionality for posting back to the server to make sure the player gets added to the roster.
