Bayesian Experiment Design Resources

I'm interested in exploring experiment design and analysis therein through the Bayesian lens. I haven't seen much content here; it would seem that Bayesians are more concentrated in analysis of observation studies rather than RCT. Could any books, courses, YT playlists be recommended that discuss experiment design through the Bayesian lens?
