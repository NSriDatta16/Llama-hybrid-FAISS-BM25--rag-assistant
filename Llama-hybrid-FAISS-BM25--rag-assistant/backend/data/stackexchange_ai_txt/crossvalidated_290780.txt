This seems to be a perfect case for Survival Analysis. I think Cox regression without any censor would be a perfect match. The crux of survival analysis is hazard function (or survival function) which is exponential function indicating average probability of survival/deaths for a group. Refer this paper for implementing Cox regression in R.
