Choosing a test

Let's say you run a restaurant and you want to work out which ingredients result in the best feedback (unhappy, neutral, happy, somewhat unhappy, somewhat happy) of the restaurant. Your data might look like this: Recipe Feedback Apples Sugar Beef Egg Sauce Omelette Happy 0 0 0 1 0 Apple pie Unhappy 1 1 0 0 0 Nachos Neutral 0 0 1 0 1 Fish pie Unhappy 0 0 0 0 0 ... The questions I want to answer are along the lines of: 'We can say with 76% confidence that beef will have a happy rating' or 'dishes with egg have a 26% higher chance of being unhappy than dishes with apple' Is there a relevant test for data in this format (perhaps logistic regression?) or would it be better off determining the counts of each feedback per ingredient and doing a different approach? Feedback Tomato Apples Sugar Beef Egg Sauce Happy 5 7 11 1 0 3 Unhappy 1 1 4 0 0 4 Neutral 2 6 1 11 1 7 Unhappy 2 0 0 19 0 1 ...
