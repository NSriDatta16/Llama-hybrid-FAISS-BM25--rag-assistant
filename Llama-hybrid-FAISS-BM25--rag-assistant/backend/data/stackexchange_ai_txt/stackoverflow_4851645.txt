Preventing Visual Studio 2010 from embedding resources (images) into exe file

I add new image file into project by clicking Add Resource -> Add Existing File... After that i change Persistence to "Linked at compile time" from Properties. My problem is that all of those files getting embedded into final exe file. I wish to create small exe file that load those images during execution from Resource folder. How can I do that?
