Swing: Adding listener to a component and ALL its decoration?

Can I add a listener (let's say MouseAdapter ) to a Swing component and all it's internal decoration components ? So that when a JInternalFrame is moved by the mouse (by dragging its window title bar) , it would give me following events: mousePressed event, mouseDragged event, mouseReleased event. Currently, I receive none of the above events when dragging JInternalFrame. I hope there is some standardized solution, but I couldn't find any. EDIT: Some people suggest using ComponentListener , but that wouldn't do for me. I need to know, when the user stops dragging (mouseReleasedEvent), not when the component moves.
