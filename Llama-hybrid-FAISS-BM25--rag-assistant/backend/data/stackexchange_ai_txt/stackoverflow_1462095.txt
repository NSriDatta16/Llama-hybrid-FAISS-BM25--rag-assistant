Question on scala compiler syntax hacking

I am looking to write a system which allows a syntax like the following: a b/c With a being a class, b being a specific term (not any arbitrary string) and c being an Int. I realize you can do a b c which becomes a.b(c) However, the first syntax would be more elegant and any solution would help me expand my scala knowledge :)
