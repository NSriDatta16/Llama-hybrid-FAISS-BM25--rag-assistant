Can you describe simply what are these features ? If the features come from some complex data, like images or audio files, the size of your dataset allows you to use a classifier which learn itself the intermediate representation, for example deep neural networks . I don't know if R provides good ressources for deep learning, you can start for example with RBM , as shown in this question . I don't think the common libraries implement Autoencoder . See these lecture notes and Baldi, 2010 for an introduction.
