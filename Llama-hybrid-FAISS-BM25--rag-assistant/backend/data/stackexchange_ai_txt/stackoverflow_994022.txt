Storing the IP is a fragile approach -- many universities and other large suppliers use NAT (network address translation) so all requests (maybe from many thousands of actual users) might look like they're coming from the same IP. I strongly suggest you use a cookie instead, maybe with a fall-back to IP only if the cookie just isn't coming back. Once you have identified a repeat visitor, thresholds on max visits per day or the like seem fine. Or, if you identify a cookie-less visitor from the same IP as many other cookie-less visitors, similarly you may want to "throttle" (rate-limit) them.
