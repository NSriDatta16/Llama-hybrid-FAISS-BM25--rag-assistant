Types of averages when analyzing sentences

I have a list of words and their frequencies in a text corpus. So there are words like "a", "what", "some" that have really high frequencies, and other like "neurodegenerative" that are less popular. I want to analyze sentences by assigning to each word its score and then determine if one sentence is more "technical", or more specific to a domain than others. For example: "I have a dog and a cat." vs. "Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell." I was thinking of just calculating the average of these frequencies, but sometimes I have a sentence like: "Migraine is a serious headache." , with average 640, and "Typical examples of continuous functions which are not holomorphic are complex conjugation and taking the real part." , with average 600, because of the many short, very common words. Is there any better way of evaluating such sentences to give a more realistic score, or average, that would indicate how "niche" they are?
