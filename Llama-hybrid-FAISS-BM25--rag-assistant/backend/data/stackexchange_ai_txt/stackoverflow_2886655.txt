You can create as many windows as you want using CreateWindow/CreateWindowEx, with the relationship between them as you desire (owner/child). You can make a window "owned" by other with: SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, GWLP_HWNDPARENT, (LONG_PTR) hwndParent); To convert a window to child, use SetParent . Note that the SetWindowLongPtr call with GWLP_HWNDPARENT does not behave as SetParent (MSDN is wrong on this I think). GWLP_HWNDPARENT does not convert a window to "child", but to "owned".
