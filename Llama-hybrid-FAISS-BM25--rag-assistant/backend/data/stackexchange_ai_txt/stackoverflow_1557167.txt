Along with what's been said already, I think it's worth mentioning that MySQL isn't restricted to a single set of characteristics in this regard -- there are several different storage engines you can use with MySQL, and each has a different set of performance characteristics. MySQL with MyISAM acts quite a bit different from MySQL with InnodDB, and MySQL with Infobright is quite a bit different from either one (and, of course, there are others as well).
