How do I learn enough about AJAX so that I know how AJAX-enabled controls are working, such that I can debug them when necessary?

I use AJAX controls a lot - AJAX update panels, AJAX-enabled grids, etc. (mostly from Infragistics), and most of the time, things work great. But sometimes they don't, and I have no idea where to start with debugging etc. The AJAX part of it is a black box (seemingly), and I really don't like that. I want to know enough about AJAX and javascript such that I have confidence to work with these controls instead of just praying that they work. I want to be able to debug them, and also have confidence that I am using them properly (because I don't feel I can possibly use them really properly and appropriately if I don't know what they are doing). What do I need to know to get this comfort? Where can I learn about this? How should I go about tackling learning about this?
