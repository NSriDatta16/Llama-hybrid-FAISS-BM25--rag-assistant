JMX - MBean automated registration on application deployment

I need some direction with JMX and Java EE. I am aware (after few weeks of research) that the JMX specification is missing as far as deployment is concerned. There are few vendor specific implementations for what I am looking for but none are cross vendor. I would like to automate the deployment of MBeans and registration with the Server. I need the server to load and register my MBeand when the application is deployed and remove when the application is un-deployed. I develop with: NetBean 6.7.1, GlassFish 2.1, Java EE 5, EJB 3 More specific, I need a way to manage timer service runs. My application need to run different archiving agents and batch reporting. I was hoping the JMX will give me remote access to create and manage the timer services and enable the user to create his own schedule. If the JMX is auto registered on application deployment the user can immediately connect and manage the schedule. On the other hand, how can an EJB connect/access an MBean? Many thanks in advance.
