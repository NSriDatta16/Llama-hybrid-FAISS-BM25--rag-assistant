Have you come across O'Reilly's RTF Pocket Guide , by Sean M. Burke ? On page 13, it says Here are some rules of thumb for putting linebreaks in RTF: Put a newline before every \pard or \ (commands that are explained in the "Paragraphs" section. Put a newline before and after the RTF font-table, stylesheet, and other similar constructs (like the color table, decribed later). You can put a newline after every N th space, {, or }. (Alternatively: put a newline after every space, {, or } that's after the 60th column.) Or were you thinking of extracting the plaintext as lines, and doing it whatever the language of the plaintext?
