jQuery: Removing HTML-element while keeping it's children

I want to add HTML like this: &nbsp; Hello but in some cases I need to get rid of the wrapping a-element, so it looks like this: &nbsp; Hello This a-element could be anywhere in arbitrary HTML-fragments. I grab it by a[href="#"]. This HTML is not part of the DOM, it get's added to the DOM after the a-element was removed. I went to all kind of stuff jQuery offers for this, but didn't make it. My main problem is, that there seems to be no way to apply a selector to HTML created by jQuery like this: $("html code from above"); I tried to get the a-element replacing it with it's inner HTML, but all my constructs with find() and replaceWith() fail, mostly just the Hello is left :( How does a jQuery-pro solve this?
