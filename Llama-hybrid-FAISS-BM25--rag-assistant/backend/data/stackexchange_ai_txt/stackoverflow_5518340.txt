Xwiki - Error with Apostrophe in Space Title or Page Title

I have installed a fresh install of XWiki on a Windows platform. The XWiki instance was installed using hsql for data storage. The XWiki instance is hosted on Apache Tomcat. Some of my users entered an apostrophe into the title of a page as well as the page content. I received the following error: http://jira.xwiki.org/jira/browse/XE-767 What is my next step to fix my broken XWiki instance? Is there a way to upgrade a XWiki instance to a version that works? How do I save my existing content? From reviewing the developers comments, it appears that issue has been corrected. I, however, do not have enough background in Java or XWiki to know how I can move forward. Thank you in advance for your help.
