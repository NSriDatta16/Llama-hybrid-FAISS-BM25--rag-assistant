Machine Learning Exercise Linear Regression

This is a school exercise and I just don't get on the right track. Data description: +- 1000 Samples test data. 1 Y column. 15 X columns. Y mean: ~6 max: 341 min: -221 X: mean of each column around +- 1 (0.9, 1.05, 0.99 etc.). max over all X: 4.7 min over all X: -2.7 The target rsme should be around 15 but I just can't get below 20. I used every tool every library there is. Things I tried with sklearn: Models: LinearRegression,KernelRegression, KernelRidge, BayesianRidge. Feature selection: PolynomialFeatures up to degree 5 but everything over 2 mostly the rsme gets worse. from 1 to degree 2 is the most significant reduction in rsme visible. A few plots: The one below is sorted for Y I tried to post more pictures below of the x y relations but I can't here because I'm only allowed to post 2. I should mention that we had only linear regression already and it should be kinda solvable with that they told.
