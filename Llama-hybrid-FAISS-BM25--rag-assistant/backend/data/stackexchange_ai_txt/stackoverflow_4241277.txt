The simplest way to do this is to override the styles on the page. First, wrap your paragraph in a P tag with a special id. Show this input inline. Then you can add a CSS selector to your page that makes sure the DIV tag added by Ext JS displays inline (note that "x-form-field-wrap" is the class of the inserted DIV wrapper, you can see this if you use chrome developer tools to browse the DOM). #my-inline-override div.x-form-field-wrap { display: inline; }
