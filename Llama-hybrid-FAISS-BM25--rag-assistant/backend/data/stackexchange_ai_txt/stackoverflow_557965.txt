Postgres comes with excellent command-line tools, and they're the focus of the core developer team. I personally leverage those via custom site-specific scripts for db admin, upgrade, replication. For monitoring I use nagios to script psql to query vitals. That said, there are some other options on the GUI-side beyond pgAdmin: SQL Maestro phppgadmin I don't think any of these have all of the features you listed, but they might be a good jumping off point. I doubt you will find an open source tool that really competes head-to-head with Oracle Enterprise Manager. On the commercial-side, there are also additional options: Navicat RazorSQL MS SQL Manager for PostgreSQL This wiki page also has links to many other postgres tools: Community Guide to PostgreSQL GUI Tools Being a CLI-zealot myself I cannot given any specific recommendations but hopefully this is helpful.
