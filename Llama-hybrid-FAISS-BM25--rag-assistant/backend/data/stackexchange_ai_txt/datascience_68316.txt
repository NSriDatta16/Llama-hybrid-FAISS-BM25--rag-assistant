Does produced data fall under the "data collection" category?

I am not sure whether data governance and policy is covered by this community. I'm giving it a try and let me know if I need to adjust. While surveying all the data of my current employer, and developing a data governance policy, I am able to categorize two different sets of data on our customers: data we collect on customers data we produce about customers Example in the context of my organisation (the data producer and data collector) being a school: Collected Data: the student's parent's names and date of birth Produced Data: the student's grades. However, from the general definition of data collection, it seems that the data produced also falls under the "data collection" term. Is there a generally accepted term to dissociate these two categories?
