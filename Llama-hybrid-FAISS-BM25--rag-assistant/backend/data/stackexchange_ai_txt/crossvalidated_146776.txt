How would you interpret the Ljung-Box statistics in the following AR-GARCH output? The Ljung-Box statistics indicate quite significant autocorrelations in standardized residuals since p-values for R are all below 0.06. This result should be perceived as negative (in a well specified model you would expect the p-values to be high). What is the difference between the $R^2$ and $R$ Ljung-Box statistics? My guess is that R stands for standardized residuals (residuals from the conditional mean model divided by the fitted standard deviations from the GARCH model), while R^2 stands for squared standardized residuals. Does the GARCH model seem to be effective, based on these figures? The low p-values of the Ljung-Box statistics for R indicate that the model is performing poorly. The high p-values of the Ljung-Box statistics for R^2 and of the ARCH-LM test for R are encouraging. However, formally neither the Ljung-Box nor the ARCH-LM test is valid for standardized GARCH model residuals. These tests are suited for raw data, not for output from a model targeted to remove the conditional heteroskedasticty. Li-Mak test should be used instead. Also, should ARMA-GARCH model normally predict security prices better than an ARMA model, all else held equal? I doubt any of the models would be successful due to the "no free lunch" argument. However, an ARMA-GARCH is more likely to correctly capture the features of financial returns than a pure ARMA model. Since conditional heteroskedasticity is characteristic to financial returns, neglecting it would mean a misspecified model. So even if neither model would predict well, you may still prefer the model that is more likely to be well specified, which is the ARMA-GARCH model.
