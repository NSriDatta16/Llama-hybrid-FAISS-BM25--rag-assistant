Model fitting to data by using machine learning algorithms?

I am trying to fit an equation to data. I know the form of the equation but I need to know constants parameters in the equation. I used non-linear fitting and optimization techniques but I could not get promising results. This can be a dump question but I wonder if it is possible to fit an equation to data by using machine learning algorithms such as guassion process, neural network and so. For example, I have data and I wanna fit this equation: a*sin(x) +b*cos(x). Is it possible to find the constants of "a" and "b"?
