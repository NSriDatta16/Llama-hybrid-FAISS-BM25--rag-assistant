Caveat: I'm away from my compiler, so I can't check this. I can't think of a simple way either, but ... This is an article about extending a text control to support dragging. http://www.code-magazine.com/article.aspx?quickid=0407031&page=5 Yes, it's the exact opposite of what you want. But consider that it's about detecting the mouse messages that indicate that you want to initiate a drag action. If your subclass did this, and then just didn't let the CRichEditCtrl get the window message(s) that triggers the drag, the drag wouldn't start. Might work.
