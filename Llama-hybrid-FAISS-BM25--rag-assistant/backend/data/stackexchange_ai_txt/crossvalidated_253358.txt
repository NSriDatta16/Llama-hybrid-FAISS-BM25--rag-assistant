dynamic time warping (DTW): unexpected results

on the wave of the suggestions given to me on this topic I started ( time series similarities: which techniques for each transformation? ) I decided to give another try at Dynamic Time Warping but I newly found myself at "en empasse" due to the fact that DTW is unable to capture basic structures in the data. Example : I am comparing 2 time series that were built by adding to a linear component (b x) a trigonometric fluctuation (sin(a x)). the two series only differ by a,b assigned, the underlying function does NOT change. visually, PROBLEM : as the image suggets, by construction, the DTW tranformation should assign as end point a much further point thus casting serious doubts on the method viability when inserting a trend (essentially rendering it useless for my purposes) my code in R : library(dtw) query QUESTION: I am doing something wrong (parametrization, etc) or the model is unable to capture some features by hypothesis?
