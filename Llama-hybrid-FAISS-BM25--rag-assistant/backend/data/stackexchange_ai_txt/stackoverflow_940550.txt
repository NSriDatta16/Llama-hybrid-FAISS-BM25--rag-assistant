Computing average values over sections of date/time

Problem: I have a database of sensor readings with a timestamp for the time the sensor was read. Basically it looks like this: Sensor | Timestamp | Value Now I want to make a graph out of this data and I want to make several different graphs. Say I want one for the last day, one for the last week and one for the last month. The resolution of each graph will be different so for the day-graph the resolution would be 1 minute. For the week graph it would be one hour and for the month graph it would be one day, or quarter of a day. So I would like an output that is the average of each resolution (eg. Day = Average over the minute, Week = Average over the hour and so on) Ex: Sensor | Start | End | Average How do I do this easily and quickly in mySQL? I suspect it invoves creating a temporary table or sorts and joining the sensor data with that to get the average values of the sensor? But my knowledge of mySQL is limited at best. Is there a really clever way to do this?
