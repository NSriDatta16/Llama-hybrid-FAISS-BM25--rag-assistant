cancel the drag operation on UISlider based on slider value

I have n number of sliders on a page representing percentage values. obviously the percentage should not be allowed to exceed a total of 100% across the n sliders. so if the current totat of n-1 sliders is 90, then when the nth slider is being dragged, I would like to stop it at 10. any ideas ?
