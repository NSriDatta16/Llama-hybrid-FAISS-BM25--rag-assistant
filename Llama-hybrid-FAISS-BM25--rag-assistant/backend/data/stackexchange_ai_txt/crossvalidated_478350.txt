It is hard to answer this precisely without seeing what you actually typed in Stata (both your logit specification and your margins command, and do note the correct spelling). From the verbal description, it sounds like you are taking the sample used in the estimation of the logit, predicting Pr(Seizure) as if everyone in that sample had a cancer values of 1, 2, 3, and then 4 (instead of their actual observed values), using the logit coefficients from a model where cancer size is broken up into 3 dummy variables and an intercept. This model says that you can expect 1 in 4 people with a cancer size of 2 to have a seizure. The predictions are on on a scale of [0,1], so 1 in 4 is 0.25. Here's an reproducible example demonstrating this calculation, where we will model probability of a low weight birth given quartile of mother's age: . webuse lbw, clear (Hosmer & Lemeshow data) . xtile age_qrt = age, nq(4) . table age_qrt, c(min age max age) ---------------------------------- 4 | quantiles | of age | min(age) max(age) ----------+----------------------- 1 | 14 19 2 | 20 23 3 | 24 26 4 | 27 45 ---------------------------------- . logit low i.age_qrt, nolog Logistic regression Number of obs = 189 LR chi2(3) = 5.50 Prob > chi2 = 0.1383 Log likelihood = -114.58352 Pseudo R2 = 0.0235 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ low | Coef.

Stata is calculating $$AM_k =\sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \hat p(x=k) \right].$$ What you are describing sounds more like marginal effects, which involve comparing how probabilities change as you alter cancer size. These can be calculated like this: margins, dydx(age_qrt) /* margins, dydx() by by hand */ replace age_qrt = 1 predict phat1 replace age_qrt = 3 predict phat3 gen finite_diff3vs1 = phat3 - phat1 sum phat3 phat1 finite_diff3vs1 The output of the first command is: . margins, dydx(age_qrt) Conditional marginal effects Number of obs = 189 Model VCE : OIM Expression : Pr(low), predict() dy/dx w.r.t. : 2.age_qrt 3.age_qrt 4.age_qrt ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | dy/dx Std.

This says that the expected change in probability associated with going from the lowest to the second highest age quartile (from 1 to 3 of 4) is 0.122549, so giving birth to a low weight baby is becomes more somewhat likely. This is 12 percentage point increase, which is a 42% increase. The note explains that this is a finite difference, and not really a derivative: $$AME_k =\sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \hat p(x=k)-\hat p(x=baseline) \right],$$ where $\hat p(.)$ is the predicted probability from the logit model.
