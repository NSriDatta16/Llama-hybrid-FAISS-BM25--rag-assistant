flash surely pays more because less people can code it. Freelance wise, if you are an expert in flash you can get away will easily billing 100+ a hour because companies who expect highly flash intense sites usually expect from the start to pay bigger bucks. PHP on the other hand usually averages anywhere from 30-60 a hour depending on your experience and ability to sell yourself / company. PHP is nice to know but Flash is really growing, especially with AIR exe's / etc. I personally suggest a .NET platform though. With .net you can code anything from smart phones, to web page, desktop applications, intense Flash like web apps with silverlight, and even iPhone apps with mono. Best of all, unlike PHP, you coding is compiled and thus your intellectual property is better protected.
