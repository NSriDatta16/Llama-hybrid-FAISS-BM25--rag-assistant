You could try to compute an Elo rating for each player, and for each pair of players playing as a team, and see whether the ratings for the teams agrees with the average of the ratings for the players. Typically, in team games, the rating for the team is assumed to be the average of the ratings of the players for the purpose of handicapping matches to see how much you should adjust each player's rating on a win or loss. You might have enough data to test whether the assumption is generally accurate for your teams. This would only use the wins or losses, not the scores.
