The basic requirements and CLT for one sample t-test

I am having trouble learning the relevant concepts of t-test. Even if you search the web or books, the explanation is slightly different, it causes confusion. (Please understand that I am not a statistics or math major) [On the requirements of t-test] (assume we are interested in the mean value of something) Someone say that the population should normally distributed. Someone say that the distribution of sampling mean (for multiple trial of sampling) should be normally distributed. On the other hand, someone say that the each value of samples shoud be normally distributed. Over many explanations on web, above explanations are mixed, and in some cases the normality test was performed on each sample value prior to performing the t-test, and in other cases, the normality test was performed on the sampling mean (average of samples). [My Questions] (1) I think the normal distribution of sampling mean is required to evaluate the possibility of certain t-value appears. (Here, I think that the mean value could explain t-statistic) Which statement among the above is correct? (2) If the statement:"the normal distribution of sampling mean is required" is true, isn't it always normal distributed as CLT says? Since the distribution of the sampling mean is an imaginary distribution(In practice, we only do one set of sampling), regardless of what n(sample size) and population distribution is , we can imagine infinite trials of sampling, which leads to normal distribution of sampling means. Then we are conducting our t-test, which evaluates the possibility of our sample t-statistic within that imaginary distribution of t-values. Is this wrong statement? (3) I am dealing with one-sample t-test. Is there any requirements differences between one-sample and other t-tests? Please advise an appropriate concept, and every answer would be appreciated.
