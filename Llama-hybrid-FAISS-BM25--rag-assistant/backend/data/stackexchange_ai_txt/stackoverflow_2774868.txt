Error when retrieving office 2007 files from sql server 2005 blob

I have a simple document storage database that allows people to upload various types of documents and then do a full-text search on them. It works just fine for all documents except office 2007 documents. My retrevial code uses content type "application/octet-stream", the server has the MIMETypes registered as does my computer. I can open the file just fine on my system, but uploading it and then redownloading it gives an error: "This error can be caused by some of the following conditions: Your hard drive or floppy drive has a corrupt section (damaged track or sector). A temporary operating system or network failure has occurred. Your network is unavailable, slow, or is corrupting data packets (failure of a router, network card, or noise on the network transmission line). If the network is experiencing problems, it is usually a temporary condition and if you wait a short period of time and try again, you can usually save the file. If the problem persists, consult your network administrator"
