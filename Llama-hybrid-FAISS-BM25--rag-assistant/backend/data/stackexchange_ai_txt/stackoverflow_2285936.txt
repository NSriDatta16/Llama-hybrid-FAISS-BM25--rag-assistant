Easiest way to rotate a rectangle

I'm using rectangles defined in terms of their x y coordinates and their width and height. I figured out how to rotate them in terms of coordinates ( x = cos(deg) * x - sin(deg) * y y = sin(deg) * x + cos(deg) * y ) but I'm stuck on the height and width. I'm sure there's an obvious solution that I'm missing. If it matters, I'm using Python. edit Sorry for the confusing description. My intention is to get the width and height either reversed or negated due to whatever the angle is. For example, in a 90 degree rotation the values would switch. In a 180 degree rotation the width would be negative. Also, I only intend to use multiples of 90 in my script. I could just use if statements, but I assumed there would be a more "elegant" method.
