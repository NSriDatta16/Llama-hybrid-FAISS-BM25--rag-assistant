Thanks to the great post at OranLooney.com I was able to get a java/icefaces web-app to resize nicely on the ipad. the donnothing(); in the window.orientationchange is there as it seems sometimes without it the resize will (sometimes) not work, in your case though i imagine this is where you want to put the code to launch a new view. // a function to parse the user agent string; useful for // detecting lots of browsers, not just the iPad. function checkUserAgent(vs) { var pattern = new RegExp(vs, 'i'); return !!pattern.test(navigator.userAgent); } if ( checkUserAgent('iPad') ) { // iPad specific stuff here window.onorientationchange = function() { donnothing(); }; } also if you figure out how to allow double click let us know !!
