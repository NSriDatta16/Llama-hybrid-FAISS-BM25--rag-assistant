Can I use glib to make some portable http GET request and how?

Was just wondering if any of you already coded a http get request using glib? Is it possible and how ? I just want to call an simple urls with parameters, and the code must be working on gnu/linux, windows and mac. If it is not possible with glib, have you any suggestion about what to use for that purpose (in a portable perspective). I want to avoid if possible 3rd party libs to minimize my project dependencies. So in that case of glib is not the right way, any code fragment will be welcome ! Thanks Sinn'
