for me when dealing with categorical data and interactions in linear models it is easier if I look at it as a piecewise model. Meaning that for every possible label of your categorical regressor you will generate a linear model. To see this let's rename your variables to: \begin{eqnarray*} mpg = y\\ am = x_1\\ wt = x_2\\ qsec = x_3\\ \end{eqnarray*} So the model you built in R would be $ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 $. Given that you only have to possible values for $x_1$ you would have two linear models: \begin{eqnarray*} y = \left\lbrace \begin{array}{ccccccr} (\beta_0 + \beta_1) &+& (\beta_2 + \beta_4 )x_2 &+& \beta_3 x_3 & \text{, if } x_1 =1 \\ \beta_0 &+& \beta_2 x_2 &+& \beta_3 x_3 & \text{, if } x_1 =0. \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*} You can see that you have two different linear models for the response $y$, depending on the value of $x_1$ (the transmission of the car). So, concerning your questions here are some insights: From the piecewise model above and given that cars with automatic transmission are the control group, we can interpret the coefficients as follows: a. $\beta_0$ is the average $mpg$ for automatics, while $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ is the average $mpg$ for manuals. b. $\beta_2$ is the change in $mpg$ for every unit of change in weight for automatic cars, while $\beta_2 + \beta_4$ is the change in $mpg$ given a unitary change in weight for cars with a stick. c. However, in both models we have that for every unitary change in $qsec$ the $mpg$ changes $\beta_3$ units. This is for any given car, not considering if it is automatic or not. Hope this answers your question! A.
