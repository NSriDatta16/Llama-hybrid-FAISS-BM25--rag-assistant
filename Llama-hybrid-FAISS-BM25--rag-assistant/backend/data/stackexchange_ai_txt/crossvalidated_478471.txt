Definition of a support vector (SVM)

I have a question regarding the definition of support vectors. It is usually stated that support vectors are those vectors which lie on the hyperplanes and hence define them. But how is the green point, which lies on the hyperplane H1, spanned for sperating the red points, termed? Is it also a support vector since it lies on a hyperplane or is it simply a misclassified point which does not support the hyperplane H1? (The purple circles shall represent the support vectors)
