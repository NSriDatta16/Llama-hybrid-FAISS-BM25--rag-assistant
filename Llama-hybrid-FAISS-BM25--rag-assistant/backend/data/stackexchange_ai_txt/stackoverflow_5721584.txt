If you are planning on storing the tags for future use you could use something like this: JQuery-Powered cloud with PHP and JSON That would give you the storage you want and it wouldn't take much more code to add a input box and a insert mysql query to add more. The other alternative is to use something more like this: DynaCloud DynaCloud works by taking the id's and classes from elements on the webpage you have selected for "tagging" and then adds them to the cloud container Hope that helps with finding your answer
