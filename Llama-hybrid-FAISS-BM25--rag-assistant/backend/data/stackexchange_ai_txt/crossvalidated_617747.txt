Embeddings encode the data but do nothing to encrypt it and give no guarantees of security. If you want to encrypt the data but be able to do mathematical operations you can use something like homomorphic encryption . With embeddings used for this purpose, the attacker could backward engineer them and deduce the encoded text. If you want to know more on why this is a bad idea and how homomorphic encryption helps, https://crypto.stackexchange.com/ would be a better place to ask.
