Nice experiment. The blue lines will be at $\mu \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sigma/\sqrt{n}$ where $\alpha = 0.05$ and $\alpha \mapsto z_\alpha$ is the upper quantile function of the standard normal and $n$ is sample_size_ . In this case, this is exact since you are generating from the normal distribution and the sample mean will have the distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2/n)$ . In general, it holds approximately based on the CLT for large $n$ . If you are trying to interpret the CI, that would be a bit different. Putting a CI around each of the points vertically, for each sample_size_ , roughly 95% of those intervals will cross the dotted red line (you cover the true mean $\approx$ 95% of the time, hence the coverage probability is 0.95). Since your replication size is small (10), this is not that accurate. Try increasing sample_number_ to say 1000 to see it better. What you will observe is that although the length of the CIs will be smaller as you increase $n$ , still $\approx$ 95% of them keep covering the red line no matter what $n$ is. PS. I am assuming that instead of these two lines: population you would do something like this: sample_ That is, sample from the normal distribution, not a finite population drawn from the normal distribution as you are doing here, although the results will be close in your case (unless your sample size starts approaching 10000000).
