In Java all collections from java.util package in effect hold equivalent of void* pointer ( the Object ). Yes, generics ( introduced in 1.5 ) add syntactic sugar and prevent you from coding unsafe assignments, however the storage type remains Object . So, I think there is no OO crime commited when you use void* for generic framework type. I would also add type-specific inlines or macro wrappers that assign/retrieve data from the generic structures if you do this often in your code. P.S. The one thing that you should NOT do is to use void** to return allocated/reallocated generic types. If you check the signatures of malloc/realloc you will see that you can achieve correct memory allocations without dreaded void** pointer. I am only telling this because I've seen this in some open-source project, that I do not wish to name here.
