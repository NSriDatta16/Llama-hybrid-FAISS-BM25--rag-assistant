Is it possible to explicitly tell a script when to execute, when the page is open dynamically?

I have a page which dynamically opens each page based upon the tags. I am attempting to execute a script, which is to run when the dynamic page is run from the div id="CreateVids" tag. I'm totally new to this so i'm not too sure what is the problem. I have been looking to see if there is a property of the that I can set but I cannot seem to find it. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks a lot! Sorry Treffynnmon, yes I do have some code Developed by Jacob Bowe Close Demonstration Video Home Create your own film! Home Put the film clips in any order! Click on proceed to view The pages are loaded dynamically, so the first loads "about" and the second loads "CreateVids" The page is being run from a JQuery function $('#pageevents'). bind('pageAnimationStart', function(e, info){ $(this).find('.info').append('Started animating ' + info.direction + '&hellip; '); }). bind('pageAnimationEnd', function(e, info){ $(this).find('.info').append(' finished animating ' + info.direction + '. '); I want to load the script when the "CreateVids" is loaded into the browser. The idea is that I can select the "draggable" class on the video tags and drag them using JQuery. Any ideas will really be appreciated, Thanks again
