How do I read static files in a PIG UDF

I am new to PIG and Hadoop. I have written a PIG UDF which operates on String and returns a string. I actually use a class from an already existing jar which contains the business logic in the udf. The class constructor takes 2 filenames as input which it uses for building some dictionary used for processing the input. How to get it working in mapreduce mode I tried passing the filenames in pig local mode it works fine. But I dont know how to make it work in mapreduce mode? Can distributed cache solve the problem? Here is my code REGISTER tokenParser.jar REGISTER sampleudf.jar; DEFINE TOKENPARSER com.yahoo.sample.ParseToken('conf/input1.txt','conf/input2.xml'); A = LOAD './inputHOP.txt' USING PigStorage() AS (tok:chararray); B = FOREACH A GENERATE TOKENPARSER(tok); STORE B into 'newTokout' USING PigStorage(); From what I understand is tokenParser.jar must be using some sort of BufferedInputReader. Is it possible to make it work without changing tokenParser.jar
