SQL Server Storage of Data: 4 gb Raw, how much in SQL Server?

I have a SQL Server 2005 database and I have 4 GB of text files that I need to import into it. The question is, if these 4 GB of text files are 1.2 GB when they are zipped, how big would the database be if they are imported? Does SQL Server shrink data by default, or how would I set this (think create a database as a detached item, to be attached to another DB later).
