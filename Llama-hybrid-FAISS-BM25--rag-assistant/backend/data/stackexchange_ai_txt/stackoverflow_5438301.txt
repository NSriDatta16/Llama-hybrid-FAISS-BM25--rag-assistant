Common uses of AI techniques

I am a build engineer in my current position but I dabble in applying AI techniques to improve our capabilities. What I am interested in is how your teams use AI Techniques (Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Bayesian Classification, or Neural Networks) in real life. I am looking for ideas on other ways of improving our processes and fun projects to start. Examples of things I have tried: Naive bayesian classifier for automatically assigning class labels (misdemeanor, felony, traffic violation) to free form text entered by court reporters. Generated team schedule for the year using a genetic algorithm using a fitness function that assigned demerits for any scheduling conflicts, over / under allocation of team members, holidays, personal time off. Binary associative memory for quickly querying environment configuration information for all applications deployed to all environments; including URLs, ports, source control location, environment, server, os, etc
