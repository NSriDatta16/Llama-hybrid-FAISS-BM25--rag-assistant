Developing a predictive model using only cross-sectional data

Let us assume I am trying to develop a predictive model that will give an indication of the progression of the percentage crack area on bridge decks. Engineering knowledge indicates that the crack area will be zero up to a point (crack initiation time) after which the crack area will grow (typically an S-curve) is assumed. I do not have any longitudinal data. I only have cross-sectional data representing the bridge condition at present. Below is a simplified example of the type of data (randomly created example) I have: Notice that there are lots of zeros in the crack area column. Also, I have simplified the regressors to only two â€“ in reality there may be more information such as traffic loading, rainfall etc. My data sets may contain anything from several hundred to several thousand observations. My Question : What approaches, if any, are viable to build a predictive model based on a single cross sectional set as shown above. I realize the limitations of cross-sectional data in this context, but intuitively I feel there is useful information in the data I have. I expect that the model will be of the form: Notice that for making predictions, I WILL know what the crack area at present is. I want to know either what the crack area will be one year from now, or the probability of the crack area exceeding certain thresholds, conditional on the values for the predictors. Approaches I have considered: Combining multiple Survivor Analysis models with endpoints such as Crack Area = 0%, Crack Area = 3%, Crack Area = 10% etc. The problem with this approach is that I will only have left and right censored data available (no uncensored data where I actually observe when the endpoint is reached). Bayesian/Markov approaches in which I predict the probability of the crack area being Y (or less/more than Y) in year (i+1) given that the crack are in year Y is M, and the predictors have values a, b, c etc. I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions on how this type of data can be approached to provide some sort of evidence based predictive model.
