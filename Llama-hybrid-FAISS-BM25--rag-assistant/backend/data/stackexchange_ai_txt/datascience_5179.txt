I have dealt with similar problems with very large synthetic biology datasets, where we have many, many GB of flow cytometry data spread across many, many thousands of files, and need to maintain them consistently between collaborating groups at (multiple) different institutions. Typical version control like svn and git is not practical for this circumstance, because it's just not designed for this type of dataset. Instead, we have fallen to using "cloud storage" solutions, particularly DropBox and Bittorrent Sync . DropBox has the advantage that it does do at least some primitive logging and version control and manages the servers for you, but the disadvantage that it's a commercial service, you have to pay for large storage, and you're putting your unpublished data on a commercial storage; you don't have to pay much, though, so it's a viable option. Bittorrent Sync has a very similar interface, but you run it yourself on your own storage servers and it doesn't have any version control. Both of them hurt my programmer soul, but they're the best solutions my collaborators and I have found so far.
