Is the multilayer perceptron only able to accept 1d vector of input data? If yes, why is this so?

I am going through the tutorial at the link below which uses MNIST handwritten digit database. https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/ The 28x28 sized image data has to be reshaped into a 1D vector of 784 pixels. 28x28=784. Why does the multilayer perceptron insist on only a 1D vector of input data? There are no problems with convolutional and recurrent neural networks accepting input shape of higher dimensions.
