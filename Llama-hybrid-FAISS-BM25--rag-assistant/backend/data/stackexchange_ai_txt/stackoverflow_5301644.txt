SQL query with average subquery

I am making a SQL query towards a weather database, i need the wind_direction and windspeed. This is my currect query: SELECT wind_direction, windspeed FROM weather WHERE time >= curdate() and time 0 ORDER BY wind_direction ASC This will remove all values where windspeed = 0 and will only show data for today. Query output: wind_direction windspeed 0 10.1 0 11.2 23 7.6 23 1.4 As you can see i get duplicate values which is understandable, but my graphing system does not support this, it does not know which value to use. What i need is one unique wind_direction and the avg() windspeed for that direction.
