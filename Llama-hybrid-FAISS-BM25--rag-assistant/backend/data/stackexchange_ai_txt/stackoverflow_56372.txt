@Simon: The project is a Web Application. Websites are then slower to startup (I had no idea it had an incidence, beside the different code organization)? I checked, and while I edit the web.config after aspnet_compiler is called, I don't touch the debug value (I will however check the website is not faster to startup if I don't touch the web.config, just to make sure) (And I will definitely have a look at ngen, I was not aware of that tool.)
