Best CMS to use on Windows Azure

I've just started a new software consultancy business and I'm currently putting together designs for my website. We will be at a stage very soon to start converting these into a template for a CMS. I have used http://n2cms.com before, but my designer has built many sites using WordPress, we recently built a site which worked very well and I was very impressed by the WordPress admin. So I might be a bit risque and build my site in WordPress, host on Azure, even though my consultancy specialises in Azure & Silverlight :) What's your thoughts? Can you suggest any other great .NET CMS's that would sway me away from WordPress? Any suggestions much appreciated. Cheers, Ash. P.S. Anything that uses Table Storage would be cool, and would be much cheaper!
