It appears that there are two tests called Bartlett's test . The one you referenced (1937) determines whether your samples are from populations with equal variances. Another appears to test whether the correlation matrix for a set of data is the identity matrix (1951). It makes more sense that you wouldn't run PCA on data with an identity correlation matrix, since you will just get back your original variables as they are already uncorrelated. Compare, e.g., http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett's_test to https://personality-project.org/r/html/cortest.bartlett.html .
