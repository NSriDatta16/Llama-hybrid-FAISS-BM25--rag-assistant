how to deal with ordinal variables for machine learning?

I have a data set that contains an ordinal variable. The variable is in ranking. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th ... 30th I was pre-processing the data set and thinking 'if 1st rank is the best rank (highest rank), I should not give it 1 but the highest number among the 30 rankings?' So what I did was I gave 1st rank 30, and 2nd rank 29 ... 30th rank 1. Is my approach fine? Could someone please explain me how to deal with ordinal data in such case for machine learning?
