Why do we need to create a model when creating a ROC curve?

I do not have strong background in statistics but I believe I know the basics to understand what a ROC curve means. I have a table, first column with probabilities (from 0 to 1) from a predictive test and second with true outcomes with 1 and 0 (1 when the prediction was correct and 0 when failed). I consider the predicted test fails when the sample is pathogenic and shows 0.5 and sample is pathogenic the test is correct. With this criteria I have created the following table. below. Samples predicted_test experimentally_validated Comments 1 0.6 1 Pathogenic, test correct. 2 0.8 0 Benign, test incorrect 3 0.2 1 Benign, test correct 4 0.3 0 Pathogenic test incorrect From this data I can to compute sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NVP. Finally I want to create a ROC curve. Looking at tutorials on the internet, they always develop a model (e.g. Logistic Regression ) with train and. My question is why.
