Not much if you mean in terms of performance or storage efficiency. However, it's just good practice to push as many of your low-level constraints into the database layer. For one thing, it guarantees that a subtle bug in Rails isn't going to lead to some randomly NULL data in a not-null field. Likewise, if you ever run another app against the same database, it will be extremely helpful to have the constraints in a central place for maintenance and to avoid duplication.
