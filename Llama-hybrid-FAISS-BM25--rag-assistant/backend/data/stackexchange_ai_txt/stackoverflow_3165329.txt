I know this is a really old question, but I thought I might be able to do a bit better expanding for those who are finding the answers from Google. As recommended above, you really want to configure your web server to load a module. The hard part of shibboleth is the configuration file, but assuming some one else in your organization has utilized shibboleth you can use theirs as a template and its fairly easy. For .NET based authentication, you'll need to configure Shibboleth in IIS . The default configuration for IIS creates a directory called /secure, and anything put under there will require shibboleth authentication (i.e. it will redirect to the identity provider). You can configure it to cover other directories or even do lazy authentication. Once you have the authentication piece in place, you can check headers to "read" the information the identity provider is passing to you. IIS handles things a bit differently then Apache, but its still pretty easy. If you just want username you could use HTTP_REMOTEUSER although there could be better options; i.e. Ohio State University recommends using the eduPersonPrincipalName .
