Android custom tabs

I want 4 tabs in my app but I don't want to show default tabs. I want to have something like dragging tabs. When I click on first tab and does not pick my finger up and drags to next tab and so on. The tab bar like this above. When I press on one tab I can move to another tab as well by this moving of finger.
