Depends what you mean by "this" (and "more elegant") I'm not sure why you think you need tmp AND myObject, but there's no way to avoid having one of those declarations outside the try block IF you want to access it in the catch block. What's wrong with Object myObject = null; try { myObject = somethingThatCanFail(); } catch (Fail f) { // do nothing because we can deal with myObject being null just fine }
