Looking for a decent implementation of a jquery drag-and-drop tree plugin

I've built a recursive menu using PHP and MySQL and I'm looking for a decent Jquery plugin (or tutorial) - to implement re-ordering the menu based on drag and drop. Does anyone know of any? BTW. I can do the relevant PHP, I just need something that can send drag and drop elements in a nested set of s and send ajax requests. P.S. I've had a little look around and there seem to be many links to plugins that don't work... not quite sure if this is my bad luck or just incompetence in looking...
