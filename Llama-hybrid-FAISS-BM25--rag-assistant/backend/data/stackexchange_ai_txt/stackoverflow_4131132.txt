... I wanted to know if there were very common mistakes that could be avoided with a bit more of attention when coding. For Sun's HotSpot JVMs, the only mistake that you can make in the general sense is to try to do things in tricky ways (possibly) in the belief that it makes your code faster. It is best to just write simple code. I've seen this advice from someone senior in the HotSpot team. Best practice is to leave optimization to the JIT compiler, and only attempt to micro-optimize if the profiler tells you that you have a problem. (There are well know things you should avoid, like using exceptions for flow control, doing string concatenation in a loop, or trying to do your own memory management. But these are probably higher level than you are interested in.)
