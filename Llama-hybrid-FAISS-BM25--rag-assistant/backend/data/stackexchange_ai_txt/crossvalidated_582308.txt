Choosing best modelling practices

I am modelling some behavioural data in R to determine the best parameters for explaining foraging success of marine animals. I have both fine scale parameters relating to the direct individual (e.g. dive depth, trip length) and broad-scale parameters (e.g. temperature, wind, chlorophyll a). To avoid overfitting, I currently have 2 models, one modelling fine-scale and one modelling broad-scale predictor variables and I am using model averaging to determine the best set of predictors for each model. My question is: Can I use the broad and the fine-scale models as initial testing of the best parameters to include, and then put all the best parameters together in a single model? I've tried this out and it provides a good model with a higher predictive capacity but would this be considered bad practice? I haven't seen this done in other work (and certainly never done it myself). Thanks!
