Opacity in IE8 works on but not on

I have a problem with IE8 where I cannot make elements transparent. I've found these related SO questions but I haven't had any luck with the answers provided there: Opacity CSS not working in IE8 Opacity in web pages? I've tried " giving layout ", by using zoom: 1; , but it hasn't helped. Here is my test CSS, lifted from the example on this page : .test { background-color: #6374AB; width: 100%; color: #ffffff; zoom: 1; } .opaque1 { opacity: .5; } .opaque2 { filter: alpha(opacity=50); } .opaque3 { -ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=50)"; } .opaque4 { -ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=50)"; filter: alpha(opacity=50); } And the test HTML: Test paragraph without opacity. Test paragraph with opacity Test paragraph with filter Test paragraph with -ms-filter Test paragraph with compatibility note Test anchor without opacity. Test anchor with opacity Test anchor with filter Test anchor with -ms-filter Test anchor with compatibility note In IE8, the opaque2 , opaque3 , and opaque4 paragraphs are transparent, but none of the anchors are. In IE6, the opaque2 and opaque4 paragraph and anchor both have transpareny.
