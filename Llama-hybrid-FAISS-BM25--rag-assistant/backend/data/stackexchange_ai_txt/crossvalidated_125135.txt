Data transformation using copulas

I've heard about the use of copulas to transform data. For instance, supposedly it's applied to data that is non-normal to make it look more normal. However, I don't quite understand how this is done. I've read introductions to copula's (e.g. Nelsen's "An Introduction to Copula's", among others), and although I understand the concept (at least I think I do), I only see copula's being used as a measure of dependence between two or more random variables. I also read questions such as this one and this one , but I still don't see it. To give my problem a more concrete setting, I have a dataset consisting of multivariate time series, $\{X_t\}_{t=1}^{T}$ where $X_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$. I want to fit a model to this dataset that assumes that $$X_t | X_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\Gamma X_{t-1},\Omega)$$ (where $\Gamma$ is a $d \times d$ matrix) but my data does not seem to adhere to this assumption (at least, not according to multivariate normality tests in R). Can I use copulas to transform this dataset into a dataset that is more normal than the original one?
