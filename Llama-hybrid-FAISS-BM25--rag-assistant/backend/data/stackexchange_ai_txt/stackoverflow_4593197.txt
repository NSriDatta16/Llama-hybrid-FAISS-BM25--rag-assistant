You can store arbitrary strings in cookie elements, so a serialized array should work. Example: // To store: $ids = array(1, 2, 3, 4); setcookie('ids', serialize($ids)); // To retrieve: $serialized = $_COOKIE['ids']; $ids = unserialize($serialized); // sanity check: $ids needs to be an array. assert(is_array($ids)); // Now let's check: if (in_array(4, $ids)) { // Yes, it's here. } A few caveats though: The cookie is completely in the hands of the client, and cookie values should never be trusted. Treat them just like you would treat query string parameters or POST data. Cookies offer very limited storage (IIRC, the standard gives you 4096 bytes to work with). With these in mind, it might be a better idea to store the array in $_SESSION instead - this will give you virtually unlimited storage, and the only way for the client application to fiddle with the values is through your code.
