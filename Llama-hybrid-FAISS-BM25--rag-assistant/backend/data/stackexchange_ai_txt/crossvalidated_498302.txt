an option that I know is available to you is to fit a Bayesian model in brms Bürkner (2017). This uses an lme4-style syntax. This package has zero-inflated poission models with a log-link, as listed here: https://rdrr.io/cran/brms/man/brmsfamily.html It also allows for the fitting of smooth terms using similar syntax to mgcv . Here is an example tutorial: https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2018/04/21/fitting-gams-with-brms/ The only downside will be if you are completely unfamiliar with Bayesian methods, this will require some reading up, fortunately, the brms and Stan documentation is very detailed and helpful. You will probably need to specify non-flat priors for the sampling to run properly. Bürkner, P. C. (2017). brms: An R package for Bayesian multilevel models using Stan. Journal of statistical software, 80(1), 1-28.
