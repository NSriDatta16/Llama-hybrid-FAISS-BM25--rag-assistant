PACF is usually defined in terms of linear projections. Suppose we have random variable $Y$, and a set of random variables $X_1,...,X_n$. Then the linear projection of $Y$ on $X_1,...,X_n$ is a random variable $P_{X_1,...,X_n}Y=\alpha_1X_1+...+\alpha_nX_n$, where coefficients $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n$ minimize the expression: $$E(Y-\alpha_1X_1-...-\alpha_nX_n)^2.$$ It is not hard to see that the coefficients satisfy the following system of linear equations: \begin{align} \begin{bmatrix} EX_1^2 & EX_1X_2 & ...&EX_1X_n\\ ... & ... & ... & ...\\ EX_nX_1 & EX_nX_2 & ...& EX_n^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1\\ ...\\ \alpha_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} EYX_1\\ ...\\ EYX_n \end{bmatrix} \end{align} Now the partial correlation coefficient is defined for stationary time series $X_t$ as $$\alpha(k)=corr(X_{k+1}-P_{X_2,...,X_k}X_{k+1}, X_1-P_{X_2,...,X_k}X_{1}).$$ Now try writing the corresponding systems of linear equations for projections $P_{X_2,...X_k}X_{k+1}$ and $P_{X_2,...,X_k}X_1$. Notice that the matrix is the same, because we project on the same set of variables. Also the right hand side vectors will contain the same values but these values will be in a reversed order for different system of equations. Since the matrix is symmetric the solutions will have the same values, but again in a reversed order for different system.
