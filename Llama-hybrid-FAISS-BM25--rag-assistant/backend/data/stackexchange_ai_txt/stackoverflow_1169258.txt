accessing windows taskbar icons in c++

I am looking for a way to programmatically get the current taskbar icons (not the system tray) for each program that is in the taskbar. I haven't had much luck with MSDN or Google, because all of the results relate to the system tray. Any suggestions or pointers would be helpful. EDIT: I tried Keegan Hernandez's idea but I think I might have done something wrong. The code is below (c++). #include #include #include #include using namespace std; vector xxx; bool EnumWindowsProc(HWND hwnd,int ll) { if(ll=0) { //... if(IsWindowVisible(hwnd)==true){ char tyty[129]; GetWindowText(hwnd,tyty,128); stringstream lmlm; lmlm ::iterator it; for(it=xxx.begin();it >empty; }
