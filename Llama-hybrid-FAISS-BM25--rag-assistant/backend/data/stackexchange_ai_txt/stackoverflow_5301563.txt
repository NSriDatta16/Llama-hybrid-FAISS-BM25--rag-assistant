Build JVMTI Agent with Qt/qmake

After I successfully implemented my first JVMTI agent and the building completes with the g++ compiler I want to go over integrate the building process into my Qt project. However I am facing some build process configuration issues: The parameters I would run with the g++ compiler looks like this: g++ -fPIC -shared agent.cpp -o libagent.so -I /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include -I /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/include/linux This works very well. Now to qmake: I am aware of the parameter CXXFLAGS to add further parameters to the C++ compiler used by qmake, but how can I convert this parametrized compiler call into qmake?
