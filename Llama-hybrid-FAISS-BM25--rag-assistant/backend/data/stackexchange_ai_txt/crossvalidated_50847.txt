Parameter learning of Markov random field

Given a Markov random field $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, the corresponding density function to which is expressed by $f(x) \propto \prod_{x\in\mathcal{V}} \psi_u(x) \prod_{(x_i,x_j)\in\mathcal{E}} \psi_p(x_i,x_j; \theta)$ where $\psi_u$ is the unary potential and $\psi_p$ is the pairwise potential. Now assume $\psi_u$ is known, the structure of the MRF and the functional form of $\psi_p$ (which is Gaussian) are also given, is there any efficient method to estimate the common hyper-parameter $\theta$ for all the pairwise potentials? MCMC is a good option, however, it's too costly in my case. I prefer some methods of computing the point-estimate of $\theta$.
