This paper does not appear to use $L^p$ norms in any essential way--every one of the results references the $L^1$ norm explicitly. The problem itself determines which norm to use. In this case interest focuses on the cardinality of multisets. A multiset is represented as a vector of counts of its elements, whence its cardinality happens to be the same as its $L^1$ norm. Often results proven for one norm may hold without any change needed in the proof for a wide range of $p$ (typically $1 \le p \le \infty$). The opportunity for greater generality at no cost will lead many papers like this to talk about $L^p$ norms. $L^p$ norms come into their own in discussions of duality in Hilbert and Banach space theory. Advanced, but introductory (it's not a contradiction!) books on analysis usually cover this material thoroughly. For an introduction to some of the relationships among these norms, read about the Holder Inequality and the Minkowski Inequality .
