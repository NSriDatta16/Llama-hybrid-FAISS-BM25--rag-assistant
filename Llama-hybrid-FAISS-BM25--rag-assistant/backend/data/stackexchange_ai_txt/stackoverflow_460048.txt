Try using the Live HTTP Headers plugin for Firefox to examine the headers the server sends back to you. If Live HTTP Headers reports a 301 redirect, try capturing the user agent on the server side and change your Firefox to use that user agent . If you still get a 301 redirect, you will have to examine the server more closely to see if the request from SEO Consultants is reaching the code around the redirect. You can also try using IIS and adding a bunch of redirection websites that respond to the w, ww, and wwww subdomains instead of using global.asax and redirection there.
