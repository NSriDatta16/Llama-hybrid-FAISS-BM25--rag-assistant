From where term $\left(\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}\right)$ came in estimated variance of $\bar x - \bar y$

I encountered such a formula for pooled variance: $$\frac{(n-1)s_x^2+(m-1)s_y^2}{n+m-2}\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{m}\right)$$ Here we have two samples of the following sizes $n$ and $m$. $s_x, s_y$ are the sample variances. I understand that the first term is a weighted average, but from the second term comes?
