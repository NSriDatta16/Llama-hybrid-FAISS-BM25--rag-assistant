How can I prove mathematically that the mean of a distribution is the measure that minimizes the variance?

According to the Page 87 in Kruschke: Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, the author says that the mean of a distribution is a value that minimizes the variance of a probability distribution, for example, a normal distribution. The following is what is mentioned in the page: It turns out that the value of $ M $ that minimizes $ ∫dx p(x)(x−M)^2$ is $E[X] $ . In other words, the mean of the distribution is the value that minimizes the expected squared deviation. In this way, the mean is a central tendency of the distribution. I have read the paragraph and kind of understood what the author is trying to say but I wonder how this can be written mathematically using the above equation or any other ways.
