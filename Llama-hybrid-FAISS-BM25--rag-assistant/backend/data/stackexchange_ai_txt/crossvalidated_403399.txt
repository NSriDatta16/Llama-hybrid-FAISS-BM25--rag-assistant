What does the pmf of a discrete random variable look like if it can take on the value $\infty$?

What does the pmf of a discrete random variable look like if it can take on the value $\infty$ ? Consider a stopping time $\tau$ of a Markov chain, which is a random variable that takes values in the set $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ . Often it is easy to find the individual probabilities $P(\tau = k)$ for specific $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ . I have always written this without really pausing to think, but is it always correct to say $$ P(\tau If so, how do we come up with $P(\tau = \infty)$ ? Is it always equal to $1 - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P(\tau = k)$ ? Are there any measure-theoretic concerns here?
