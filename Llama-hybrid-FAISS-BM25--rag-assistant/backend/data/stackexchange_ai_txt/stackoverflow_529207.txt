Best way to organize a subversion repository of many small projects

To start out, I have looked at the following pages and don't quite have my answer: how-would-you-organize-a-subversion-repository-for-in-house-software-projects and how-do-you-organize-your-version-control-repository I have also looked at chapter 8 of Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion . They all have good advice, but I'm having a hard time relating it to my needs. Basically, I want to organize the code for our web server. We have a $WEBROOT/htdocs and $WEBROOT/cgi-bin. Under our htdocs dir we have $WEBROOT/htdocs/js and $WEBROOT/htdocs/css for java script and style sheets. Our "projects" are not really projects, but small bits of code - maybe a Perl script, java script file, and a style sheet. We have maybe a hundred or so of these small "projects" that are all pretty much independent of each other, but all live under the same $WEBROOT on the same webserver. Our code is not in subversion yet, but I want it to be - I am just having trouble organizing it efficiently. We can have multiple svn repositories if needed, but if each repository was only 3-10 elements, that seems like a waste to me. What I thought could work is something like this: If I write a script to count the running processes on the webserver (for the sake of an example). Let's say I have a perl script, a js file, and a css file. I could name the "project" webserver_processes, and check it into the repository as: /svnrepo/webserver_processes/trunk Under trunk, I could have: htdocs/html/webserver_processes htdocs/js/webserver_processes htdocs/css/webserver_processes cgi-bin/webserver_processes I don't have any static html docs in this "project" but if i did, they would go in the "html" directory. The benefit I see in this structure is that I can checkout one "project" at a time without really affecting anything else on the web server. The disadvantage (and maybe it isn't really a disadvantage) is deploying. I would have to deploy 1 project at a time from the repository. I don't see how it would be possible to create a working copy with my structure of $WEBROOT/htdocs and $WEBROOT/cgi-bin using this method. Another option: I could create a svn repository like this: /svnrepo/webcode/trunk Under trunk would be all of the code on my web server, in these two directories: htdocs cgi-bin The huge disadvantage would be, for a small code change to 1 element, I would have to checkout every piece of code in my web environment. The benefit (somewhat) would be I could do an "svn update" on our web server to pick up any changes committed to the repository. Maybe I am just making this more complex than it should be, but does anyone have any advice on how I could efficiently organize my code in subversion? Many thanks in advance! Brian
