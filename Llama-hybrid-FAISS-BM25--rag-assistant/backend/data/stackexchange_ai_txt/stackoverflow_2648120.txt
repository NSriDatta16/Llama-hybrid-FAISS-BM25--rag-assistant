Only devices in the Made for iPod program can communicate to the iPhone via the 30-pin dock connector. These devices also need to publish a protocol for applications to access them via the External Accessory framework. Generic USB storage devices will not satisfy this, and I know of no Made for iPod accessories that either are USB storage devices or allow access to them.
