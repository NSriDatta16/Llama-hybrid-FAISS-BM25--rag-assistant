How can I drag a imagebutton in android

I'm using ImageButton 's in my application. By using onTouch event and onTouchListener I'm responding to the touch events. Once the touch event was completed I'm just displaying the ImageButton at target location. Instead I wanted it to look like dragging of ImageButton . Can anyone point me in the right direction.
