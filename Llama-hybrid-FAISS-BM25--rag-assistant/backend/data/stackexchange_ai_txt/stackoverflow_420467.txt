I don't get any MX records returned for that particular domain name when using 'dig' from here either. The 'nslookup' results that you're quoting there are from the domain's SOA record and don't include any MX records. The SOA record is returned in the "authority" section of the DNS response, even if there's no records for the specific question you asked. In the absence of MX records, mail transfer agents (MTAs) will treat the A record for the host as an MX record with priority 0 and attempt to make an SMTP connection to that address instead. See section 5.1 of RFC 5321 . Note that although this is a very recent RFC, this behaviour also existed in previous versions of the SMTP specification.
