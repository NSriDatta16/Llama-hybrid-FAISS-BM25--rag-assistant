With the pointer you have more control, but also more responsibilities. You have more control in the sense that you can decide the lifetime of the object more precisely, while without the pointer the lifetime is essentially equal to the lifetime of the containing object. Also, with the pointer the member could actually be an instance of a subclass of the pointer type. Performance-wise, using the pointer does mean more memory usage, more memory fragmentation, and dereferencing does take amount of time. For all but the most performance critical code none of this is really worth worrying about, however.
