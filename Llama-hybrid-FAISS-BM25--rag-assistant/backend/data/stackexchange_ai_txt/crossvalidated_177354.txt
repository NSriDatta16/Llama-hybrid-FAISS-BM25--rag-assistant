Along @ Mark's answer, The answer is $\infty$ unless $A =0$. If $A=0$ the answer is $||b||_{\infty}$. The reason is because, I can drag $Ax$ to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ along any singular vector of A. To see why write $A$ using the SVD as $\Sigma \sigma_{i}u_{i}v_{i}^{T}$. Multiply by $x$ and set $x = tv_{i}$ and let $t \rightarrow \infty$. Try and see if you can work it out from here
