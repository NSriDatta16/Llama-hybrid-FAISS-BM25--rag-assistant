In my nn classes in school we used matlab and then I used java for my thesis. I would suggest java or matlab. Matlab because it probably already has alot of what you might need. And java because it is quick to implement what might be missing in open source projects. And besided since besides implementing the neural networks you might need some way to visualize them. And for that I personally believe that java or matlab is quite easy.
