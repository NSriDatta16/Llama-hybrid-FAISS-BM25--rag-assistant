List of android application categories and permissions

Just wondering, is there a list anywhere on the internet that has a list of all the permissions that are generally associated with certain application category types? eg. Media Applications generally have the following permissions: android.permission.ACCESS_DOWNLOAD_MANAGER android.permission.ASEC_ACCESS android.permission.ASEC_CREATE android.permission.ASEC_DESTROY android.permission.ASEC_MOUNT_UNMOUNT android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE android.permission.ACCESS_CACHE_FILESYSTEM Thanks
