There is no hard-and-fast rule for something like this. Some purists would say you should inject the dependency, while others would go for a more pragmatic approach. Since the VO itself doesn't have any dependencies itself, I would probably invoke the KISS principle and say it's totally fine to "new" it up in the object. This is especially true the VO resides in the same module (in DDD terms.) Moreover, instantiating the VO in the object doesn't make it any less testable.
