Is there a software package to fit grouped (aggregated) logistic panel regression models?

I have a dataset that looks like the following id | time | trial | success | other covariates 1 0 10 4 1 1 23 10 1 2 100 29 2 0 5 1 etc this is basically a panel aggregated logistic regression. Can someone point me towards a package I can use for grouped logistic PANEL regression? I am aware of PGLM package in R I tried to use stata with xtlogit but it wouldn't take grouped logistic with fweight options. What I am looking for is something like blogit in stata but something that can take panel data. I'd presume the function would be called xtblogit but it doesn't exist. Thank you!
