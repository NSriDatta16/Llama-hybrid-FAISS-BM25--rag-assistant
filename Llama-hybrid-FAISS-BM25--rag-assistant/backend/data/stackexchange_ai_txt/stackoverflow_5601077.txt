With recent builds of mongodb community edition, this is straightforward. When you install via brew, it tells you what exactly to do. There is no need to create a new launch control file. $ brew install mongodb ==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/mongodb-3.0.6.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz ### 100.0% ==> Pouring mongodb-3.0.6.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz ==> Caveats To have launchd start mongodb at login: ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents Then to load mongodb now: launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run: mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf ==> Summary /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/3.0.6: 17 files, 159M
