Minimum length of training data?

I want to obtain a prediction model using support vector regression on a time series data set. In literature, I have read that the break up ratio for training/testing/validation of data should be around 60/20/20 percent. But the length of my data set is very large, so if I use 60% of it for training, it takes a lot of time. Instead of taking the ratio as said above, is there a minimum length of training sequence that if used is less time consuming and still ensures statistical reliability of the proposed model?
