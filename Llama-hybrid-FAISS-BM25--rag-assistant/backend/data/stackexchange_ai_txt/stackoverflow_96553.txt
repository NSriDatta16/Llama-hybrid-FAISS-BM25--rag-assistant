Practical limit to length of SQL query (specifically MySQL)

Is it particularly bad to have a very, very large SQL query with lots of (potentially redundant) WHERE clauses? For example, here's a query I've generated from my web application with everything turned off, which should be the largest possible query for this program to generate: SELECT * FROM 4e_magic_items INNER JOIN 4e_magic_item_levels ON 4e_magic_items.id = 4e_magic_item_levels.itemid INNER JOIN 4e_monster_sources ON 4e_magic_items.source = 4e_monster_sources.id WHERE (itemlevel BETWEEN 1 AND 30) AND source!=16 AND source!=2 AND source!=5 AND source!=13 AND source!=15 AND source!=3 AND source!=4 AND source!=12 AND source!=7 AND source!=14 AND source!=11 AND source!=10 AND source!=8 AND source!=1 AND source!=6 AND source!=9 AND type!='Arms' AND type!='Feet' AND type!='Hands' AND type!='Head' AND type!='Neck' AND type!='Orb' AND type!='Potion' AND type!='Ring' AND type!='Rod' AND type!='Staff' AND type!='Symbol' AND type!='Waist' AND type!='Wand' AND type!='Wondrous Item' AND type!='Alchemical Item' AND type!='Elixir' AND type!='Reagent' AND type!='Whetstone' AND type!='Other Consumable' AND type!='Companion' AND type!='Mount' AND (type!='Armor' OR (false )) AND (type!='Weapon' OR (false )) ORDER BY type ASC, itemlevel ASC, name ASC It seems to work well enough, but it's also not particularly high traffic (a few hundred hits a day or so), and I wonder if it would be worth the effort to try and optimize the queries to remove redundancies and such.
