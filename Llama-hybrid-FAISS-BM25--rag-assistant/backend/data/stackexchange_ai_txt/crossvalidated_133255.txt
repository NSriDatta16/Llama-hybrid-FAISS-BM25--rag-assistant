Marginal Likelihood in PYMC

I am using the PYMC toolbox in python in order to carry out a model selection problem using MCMC. What I would like to have for each model is the marginal log-likelihood (i.e. model evidence). The question: After I've run my sampler on the model, like mc = MCMC(myModel) does the following command return the marginal log-likelihood? myModel.logp Thanks very much in advance!
