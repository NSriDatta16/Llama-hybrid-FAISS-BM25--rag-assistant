Magento API: Rebuild Indexes after adding new products

I am currently writing a script that lets me import multiple products in magento. $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product'); $product->setSku($data['sku']); //etc etc $product->save(); The product gets created perfectly but it won't show up in my frontend until I either save it in the backend (without changing anything!) OR I rebuild the indexes in the backend. I did a diff on the relevant database tables to see what's changing when I save the product and added those fields to my import script, but it did not have any effect. The imported product has to be OK since it shows up when I rebuild the indexes via the backend manually. Caching is completely disabled. Now my question is: How can I rebuild the indexes after importing my products?
