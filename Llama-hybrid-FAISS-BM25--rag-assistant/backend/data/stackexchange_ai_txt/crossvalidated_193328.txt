Any solution that involves choosing arbitrary cutpoints, other than for computing knot locations for spline functions, is to be avoided. The direct use of cutpoints as you suggest will result in discontinuities and lack of fit. It is far better to spend time learning to interpret interaction effects. You didn't state the frequency of $Y=0$ and $Y=1$ which will be crucial in deciding what to do next. When sufficiently large frequencies you can avoid linearity (in the logit) assumptions and use things like restricted cubic splines for main effects and tensor spline products of them for interaction effects. This allows you to create a 3-D surface as well as a series of curves for showing the estimates, and you can form specific contrasts to estimate any effect you want (e.g., effect of change $X_{1}$ from $a$ to $b$ when $X_{2}=c$. [Follow-up: you have a very large absolute number of events and non-events so you can fit as complex a model as you desire. Imbalance in the number of events and non-events is not a significant problem.] My course notes at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/rms under Materials go into great detail. See the long example in the logistic regression chapter where interaction surfaces for age and cholesterol are derived. It is important to note that percentiles are population characteristics and not characteristics of individuals. Percentiles are useful in picking spline knot locations because in restricted cubic splines the locations don't matter much and we want to typically put knots where data are dense. Using percentiles to directly code predictors ignores the fact that predictors affect individual outcomes in a physical way regardless of the distribution of covariates in the particular sample you've drawn.
