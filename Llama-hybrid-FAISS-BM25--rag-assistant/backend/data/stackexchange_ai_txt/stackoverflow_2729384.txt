Using the pre-installed Google Maps instead of an own activity by using Intents?

I just wanted to know whether it is possible to pass geocoords to the google maps app bis intents or something similar. I wrote an app for displaying route, coordinations and so on by myself, but wouldn't it be more elegant to ask google maps itself for displaying this? I don't know if this is possible, but maybe, one of you can answer this question. IF THIS IS POSSIBLE, is it also possible to ask google maps to calculate the route by my CURRENT POSITION? It would be great if one of you can show me a skeleton/dummy code. I have no idea how the intents would have to look like.
