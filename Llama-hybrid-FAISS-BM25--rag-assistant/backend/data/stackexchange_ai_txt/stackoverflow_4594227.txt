Google maps button replace

I'd like to replace the default google maps interface. It is not a big deal, i just want to replace the buttons in the top (Map, Satellite, Hibryd, Terrain) So in the 1st step i have to hide the originals. How can i do this in V3? (i can hide them with css, but its not an elegant method :) I can put 3 buttons with z-index:9999 to the top of the maps. How can I make them work such as the original ones? Thanks for the help. R
