mixing binary and real-valued features with SGD

I'm going to be using a logistic regression model and using SGD to determine the feature weights. Is it OK for me to use a mix of binary and real features, without doing anything like scaling or normalization, and just leave it to SGD to give me a model with weights that will work? Thanks
