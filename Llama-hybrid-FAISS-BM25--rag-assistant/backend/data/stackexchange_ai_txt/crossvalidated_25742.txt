There isn't necessarily an optimal case-control study ratio, otherwise it would be the one we all used. Generally, I is argued that a higher ratio of controls to cases results in greater study power, though at the cost of a more expensive study. I once did an analysis of a series of case-control studies nested within a cohort study. The precision of the estimates increased dramatically using 2 or 3 controls per cases, but then the payoff began to level out. It may be something worth evaluating in the study planning stage via simulation.
