silverlight. Wait end async method in sync method

I've got strange issue. I want wait end async call at sync function call. At other projects I successfully use ResetEvents, but in sl it don't seem to be working. //Sync call save some value in storage public static void SaveValue(string key, object value, bool encrypted) { if (encrypted) { isEncrypting = true; var Registrator = new RegistratorClient(); Registrator.EncryptCompleted +=Registrator_EncryptCompleted; Registrator.EncryptAsync(obj); //async call while (isEncrypting) Thread.Sleep(10); return; } ... } static void Registrator_EncryptCompleted(object sender, EncryptCompletedEventArgs e) { if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(fieldToSave)) return; App Appvars = Application.Current as App; if (Appvars.Settings.Contains(fieldToSave)) Appvars.Settings[fieldToSave] = e.Result; else Appvars.Settings.Add(fieldToSave, e.Result); isEncrypting = false; } This method isn't work too:( Help please. What's wrong?
