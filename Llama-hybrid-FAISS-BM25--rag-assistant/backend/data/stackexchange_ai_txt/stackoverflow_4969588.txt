Magento saves wrong date when generating or updating products in backend

i've got the problem that sometimes when i add or update a product with a certain attributeset, the date-value in one of the attributes changes after saving. It seems, that this problem only occurs on our live-system. In another forum i've read something about Magentos way handling the date() function is kinda unusual . I don't know whether there is a connection or not. I would would really appreciate your help.
