Logistic regression performs better on validation data

Recently I've been building a model using logistic regression. To my suprisise LIFT chart looks better on the validation data than on the training data, the same is with ROC. All variables in the model are statistically significant. The question is: Is this really a serious problem? If so, what are the methods to detect what cause it? Does this problem have a name? I've tried to solve it by building all possible models without a single variable, but the problem still occured in each model. Additional Info The size of the sample is about 20000, the proportions are: Training 70%, Validation 30%, I don't have results in front of my eyes, but as I recall the lift in second percentil in training data was about 8 and in validation was about 9, the a priori is 4.2%.
