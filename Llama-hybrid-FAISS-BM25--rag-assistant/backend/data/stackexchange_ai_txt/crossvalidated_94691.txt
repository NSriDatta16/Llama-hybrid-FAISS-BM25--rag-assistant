Problem with PCA

I am trying to do some PC analysis on my data coming from lipids measurements in different samples. I only have one factor: if samples are diabetic or non-dibetic. Here is the PCA graph I get: As you can see, data are not clustered at all! What should I do for that? Is there any other clustration analysis I can use instead of PCA?
