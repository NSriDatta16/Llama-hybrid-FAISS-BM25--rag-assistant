It really depends on the context, ie. what does non-signifigance imply. If you model, as an example, says that in fact average age of the population does not impact the level of health care expenditure - that you have some serious explanation to do - because it goes against all well established results. On the other hand, if it is a borderline (non)-important variable that you included then, perhaps, it does not really matter. The point I am trying to get at is this: the readers want some form of explanation/story as to why these results makes sense (or why they don't) and you need to supply that. As for what you should write, I suggest following the advice of @George - the only thing this particular signifigance level tells you is that you cannot reject the null hypothesis.
