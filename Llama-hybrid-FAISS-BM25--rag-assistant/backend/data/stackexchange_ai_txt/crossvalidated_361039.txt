By elements you mean samples/examples right? If your dataset consists of 213 samples of 25000 features each you have a much more serious problem to solve than the selection of your SVM hyper-parameters. In short 213 samples provide are very few for the dimensionality of your problem. In high dimensional spaces you typically need lots of data have a sufficient representation of the space (and this is just one of the problems associated with high-dimensional data). The main issue you have to deal with is feature selection , in order to reduce the number of features. Now to answer your question: If I were to choose, I'd take a linear kernel in such a problem. The last thing you need is to project the data to an even higher dimensional space.
