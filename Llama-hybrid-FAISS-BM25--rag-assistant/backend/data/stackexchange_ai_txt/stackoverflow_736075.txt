I am myself wary of triggers and check constraints, mostly because I've developed most of my apps without them (Access/Jet and MySQL/MyISAM). I agree with BobClegg that this sounds like a supertype/subtype situation. In that case you'd use a join table with a unique index on the foreign key and a column indicating which type of measurement it was. The unique index on the FK would prevent the addition of a second type. It would also mean you wouldn't have empty fields in your main record. Certainly one empty numeric field is not a storage problem, but two fields that are exclusive always looks like a design error to me.
