I've considered this off and on, myself. I the answer starts with being conservative when computing the current (and thus, future) transfer rate, and includes averaging over longer periods, to get more stable estimates. Perhaps low-pass filtering the time that is displayed, so that one doesn't get jumps between 2 minutes and 2 days. I don't think a confidence interval is going to be helpful. Most people wouldn't be able to interpret it, and it would just be displaying more stuff that is a guess.
