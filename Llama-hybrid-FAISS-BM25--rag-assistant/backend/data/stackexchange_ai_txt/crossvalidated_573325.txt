Extending my comment into an answer: There are several natural extensions to handle multiple classes, and two are built into scikit-learn . Multinomial logistic regression is still logistic regression. And one-versus-rest classification is another common way to extend a binary classifier to multiple classes. See the scikit-learn LogisticRegression documentation for how multi-class prediction is handled in the software you’re using. In the multiclass case, the training algorithm uses the one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘ovr’, and uses the cross-entropy loss if the ‘multi_class’ option is set to ‘multinomial’.
