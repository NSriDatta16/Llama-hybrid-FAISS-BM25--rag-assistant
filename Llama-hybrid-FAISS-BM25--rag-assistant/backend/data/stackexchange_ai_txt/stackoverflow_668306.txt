Well, it seems like the a workable solution would be to digest the error logs. Every nite have a process go through the error logs and roll up the error/warning/etc for the day and put those into an email. You could even group them by severity and/or application if you so desired. In the end you get just one email a day with all the info right there at your fingertips. Not a "quick" or even elegant solution but could be very workable in the long run. This also doesn't afford any real-time options. But from this you could grow it into a more real-time solution. It wouldn't be that hard to write a process that monitors log files for changes and then fires off some rules based on the last error message. It is the parsing that gets tricky. ;) Good luck.
