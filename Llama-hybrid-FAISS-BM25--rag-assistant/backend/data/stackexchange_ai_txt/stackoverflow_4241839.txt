As neither myself or any of my colleagues could think of a way to make this serialization work directly, we worked around the issue in the end by wrapping our object in a custom object, which converts the Dictionary to a Dictionary , which has a special serialization case defined for string arrays. We then changed the application to be aware of this. Not particularly elegant, but simple enough, and seems to work.
