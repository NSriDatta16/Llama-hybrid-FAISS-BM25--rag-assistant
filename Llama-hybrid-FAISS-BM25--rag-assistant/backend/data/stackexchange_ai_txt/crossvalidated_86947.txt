libsvm_linear kernel_increasing C value

I'm using libsvm in C-SVC mode (-s= 0) with linear kernel (-t= 0), and I'm required to train multiple SVMs( I have four classes). My training and test sets have the same number of instances and features, they have 32768 instances (rows) and 128 features(columns). I used five different C values which are: 1, 8, 64, 256, 2048. During the training, I got this warning message: "Warning: reaching max number of iterations" "Optimisation finished, tier = ******". The problem is: logically, I know that each time I increase C value, the accuracy of classification should be getting better than before or at least it should stay as before "nothing change". But in my case: after the C value = 256, the accuracy of classification is getting worse, and I don't know why I got this result and how to solve this problem. By the way, I scaled my dataset, but I got the same result.
