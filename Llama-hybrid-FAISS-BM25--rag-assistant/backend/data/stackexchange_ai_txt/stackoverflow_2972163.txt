This is a weird warning. You only really need to pay attention to precedence when you're using different operators and those operators have different precedences. For instance, in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition. But in this case you're using only one operator multiple times. Bitwise or is associative and commutative ( (A | B) | C == A | (B | C) and A | B == B | A ) so there's really no reason for the warning.
