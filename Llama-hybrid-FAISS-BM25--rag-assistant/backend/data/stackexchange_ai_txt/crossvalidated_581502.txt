Is it always possible to find a joint distribution $p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ consistent with these local conditional distributions?

I am currently studying Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning by David Barber , the 4th chapter exercise 4.1 (p 79). The exercise is the following: Exercise 4.1 Consider the pairwise Markov network, $$p(x) = \phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)\phi(x_4,x_1)$$ Express in terms of $\phi$ the following: $$p(x_1|x_2,x_4), p(x_2|x_1,x_3),p(x_3|x_2,x_4),p(x_4|x_1,x_3)$$ For a set of local distributions defined as $$p(x_1|x_2,x_4), p(x_2|x_1,x_3),p(x_3|x_2,x_4),p(x_4|x_1,x_3)$$ is it always possible to find a joint distribution $p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ consistent with these local conditional distributions? Now, I've done the whole first part. I have a solution manual and checked my derivations are correct. Here's the first expression: $$p(x_1|x_2,x_4) = \frac{\sum_3\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)\phi(x_4,x_1)}{\sum_{1,3}\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)\phi(x_4,x_1)} \\ = \frac{\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_4,x_1)\sum_3\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)}{\sum_1\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_4,x_1)\sum_3\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)}\\ = \frac{\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_4,x_1)}{\sum_1\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_4,x_1)}$$ What I don't understand is the manual's answer to the second question, in particular how their equation is correct. I also don't understand the question itself. Here's their answer: It is not always possible to do this. One way to see this is to consider for example $$p_1(x_1|x_2,x_4)\sum_{x_1,x_3}p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$$ What does $p_1$ mean? How is this correct? Since as I've shown before $$p(x_1|x_2,x_4) = \frac{\sum_3\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)\phi(x_4,x_1)}{\sum_{1,3}\phi(x_1,x_2)\phi(x_2,x_3)\phi(x_3,x_4)\phi(x_4,x_1)} \\ \Leftrightarrow \\ p(x_1|x_2,x_4) = \frac{\sum_3 p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)}{\sum_{1,3} p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)} \\ \Leftrightarrow \\ p(x_1|x_2,x_4) \sum_{1,3} p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)= \sum_3 p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$$ So how is that correct? Also, what does it mean for a distribution to be consistent exactly?
