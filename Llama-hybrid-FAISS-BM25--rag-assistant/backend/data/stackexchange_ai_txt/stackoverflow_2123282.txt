The trick is to use post instead of get, when using get / gets erased but when using post complete thing is passed so the autocomplete needs some adjustments(extra one line) here it is : $.ajax({ type: "post", // This is the new line // try to leverage ajaxQueue plugin to abort previous requests mode: "abort", // limit abortion to this input Everything worked like a charm now..
