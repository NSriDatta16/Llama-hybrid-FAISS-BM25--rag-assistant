Bindings in XCode 3.2.3

I'm trying to follow step 1 of this tutorial , which was made for an older version of XCode than the one I'm using. I'm supposed to drag a connection from a green NSObjectController icon to a blue object icon, and select the "content" outlet. However when I try to do this, no outlets are showing. How can this be done?
