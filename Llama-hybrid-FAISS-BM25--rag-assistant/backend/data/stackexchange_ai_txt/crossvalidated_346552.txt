Maybe regime switching models are what you are looking for. As for the trends in a time series, you can put breakpoints on the regime switching points (e.g. reversals) and calculate the trend coefficients in a straightforward manner. Then, you could look into the relation between your factors and the sign and magnitude of the trends. Be cautious in using non-detrended time-series directly though. The problem with that is that it tends to show spurious relationships.
