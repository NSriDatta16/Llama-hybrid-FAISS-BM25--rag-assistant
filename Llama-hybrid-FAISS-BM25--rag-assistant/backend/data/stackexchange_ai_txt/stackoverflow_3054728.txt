How about defining your own command file for gdb and then just sourcing it during debug? That would help reduce a fair bit of typing. Try this: Create a file, let's call it mydef and here's its contents: define cmd b function-where-you-want-to-break r b +2 c end Once you load the executable in gdb, type in source mydef in gdb prompt followed by cmd Now you are into the 2nd line from where function began. :) Hope this helps!
