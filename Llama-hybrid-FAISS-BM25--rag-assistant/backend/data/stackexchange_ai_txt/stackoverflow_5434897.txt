Passing data from SQLite db into specific components

I have an sqlite db in an application and am stuck on how to pass the data that is retrieved from the db into multiple textboxes. I can get the first selection passed into the components just fine, but my problem comes in when I try to pass a second data selection into a different textbox while keeping the data from the previous selection the same in the first textbox. Basically, the user selects a recipe and that recipe is passed into textbox 1. Then another recipe is selected and that recipe is passed into textbox 2. *The recipes are selected from a different view, if that adds anything to the problem. After being selected, the view is returned to where the textboxes are. I'm not looking for someone to code this for me, but rather on how I would do it. I should be able to do that. =) Thank you so much for any and all advice. My Text Components Upon clicking "make the recipe" button - pushes recipe data back to main view protected function viewRecipeButton_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void // make recipe button pushed { if(recipeList.selectedItem != null) navigator.pushView(views.Timer_view, recipeList.selectedItem); } How I'm getting the SQlite data protected function getAllRecipes():void // get all the recipes from the DB { var stmt:SQLStatement = new SQLStatement(); var conn:SQLConnection = new SQLConnection(); stmt.sqlConnection = conn; conn.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("Recipes.db")); stmt.text = "SELECT * FROM kItems WHERE kTitle IS NOT NULL"; stmt.execute(); recipeList.dataProvider = new ArrayCollection(stmt.getResult().data); conn.close(); }
