Yes, I will provide a reference and a quick intuition. In Lutkepohls "New introduction to multiple time series Analysis" (2005, p.248) he explains that full rank of $\Pi$ in equation (2) actually implies that $X$ is stationary. The rank of a matrix is directly related to its invertibility, full rank matrices are invertible and matrices of lower rank are singular. This is obvious if you think of the determinant as the product of the diagonal elements of the reduced matrix, when it is not full rank at least one element in this product is zero making the determinant zero. The invertibility of $\Pi$ has to do with the stability of $\Pi$ , which in turn implies stationarity.
