As regular expression engines in actual browsers are going nuts in terms of speed, how about doing it that way? Instead of an array pass a gigantic string and separate the words with an identifer. Example: String "flipping burgers""pumping gas""delivering mail" Regex: "([^"]*ping[^"]*)" With the switch /g for global you get all the matches. Make sure the user does not search for your string separator. You can even add an id into the string with something like: String "11 flipping burgers""12 pumping gas""13 delivering mail" Regex: "(\d+) ([^"]*ping[^"]*)" Example: http://jsfiddle.net/RnabN/4/ (30000 strings, limit results to 100)
