How do I get the instance name of a user control?

I have a user control in .NET 2010. I dragged it on to a page twice. Obviously, both have the same functions. But, depending on which instance was clicked, I want to run the function diffenetly. How can I tell which user control was clicked? .... Let me add to this. It is a user control with a datalist in it. The data list contains numerous clickable images. When the image is clicked, I am trying to grab the name of the instance to use in the code of the user control itself.
