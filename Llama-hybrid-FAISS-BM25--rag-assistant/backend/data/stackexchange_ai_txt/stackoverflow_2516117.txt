How to scale an image (in data URI format) in JavaScript (real scaling, not using styling)

We are capturing a visible tab in a Chrome browser (by using the extensions API chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab) and receiving a snapshot in the data URI scheme (Base64 encoded string). Is there a JavaScript library that can be used to scale down an image to a certain size? Currently we are styling it via CSS, but have to pay performance penalties as pictures are mostly 100 times bigger than required. Additional concern is also the load on the localStorage we use to save our snapshots. Does anyone know of a way to process this data URI scheme formatted pictures and reduce their size by scaling them down?
