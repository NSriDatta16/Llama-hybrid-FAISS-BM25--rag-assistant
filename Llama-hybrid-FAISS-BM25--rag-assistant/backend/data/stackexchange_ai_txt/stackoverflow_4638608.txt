You can specify separate horizontal and vertical overflow behaviors: overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: scroll; Your CSS reference material should have told you that. This will of course make a complete mess of any submenus that try to pop out along the x-axis. Scrollbars in a menu will also make your users hate you and possibly win you a place in the User Interface Hall of Shame or a post on http://thedailywtf.com/ . If you're thinking about doing something like this in the real world, don't do it. Think of a less irritating way to organize your navigation.
