OU stands for "Organizational Unit" ,and is a hangover from LDAP, which is what Active Directory is based on. Also, ADSTYPE_OCTET_STRING means that it is a character string data type. Be aware that ActiveDirectory, like LDAP, is hierarchical, so you could have a tree cn=people,ou=Managers, and then place multiple items under this.
