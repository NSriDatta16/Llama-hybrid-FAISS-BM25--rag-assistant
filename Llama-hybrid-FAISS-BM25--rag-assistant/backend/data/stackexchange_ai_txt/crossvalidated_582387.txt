TL;DR: you can't run seasonal models with a seasonality of 365 days in ETS . Use stlf instead. The best approach would be to specify your original time series (in your case, precipitacaoTotal ) as seasonal. This is what you could do for monthly seasonality: library(fable) set.seed(1) foo % model(ETS(value~season(method="A"))) %>% forecast(h="3 years") %>% autoplot(foo) Since I forced seasonality using season(method="A") , we get a (pedagogically useful, but of course nonsensical) seasonal forecast. If we let ETS decide on a model on white noise, it would of course not choose a seasonal one. However, this will not work for longer periods. If we use the same idea with frequency=365 , set.seed(1) as_tsibble(ts(rnorm(1000),frequency=365)) %>% model(ETS(value)) we get a rather unhelpful error message (formatted): # A mable: 1 x 1 `ETS(value)` 1 Warning message: 1 error encountered for ETS(value) [1] .data contains implicit gaps in time. You should check your data and convert implicit gaps into explicit missing values using `tsibble::fill_gaps()` if required. I don't quite see where ETS sees implicit gaps, and have pinged the maintainers of fable . However, the underlying reason is probably that ETS does not support seasonal periods longer than 24 periods: running set.seed(1) as_tsibble(ts(rnorm(1000))) %>% model(ETS(value~season(period=365))) yields the much more informative warning message # A mable: 1 x 1 `ETS(value ~ season(period = 365))` 1 Warning message: Seasonal periods (`period`) of length greather than 24 are not supported by ETS. Seasonality will be ignored. This is actually the same behavior as in the older forecast package. Running library(forecast) set.seed(1) ets(ts(rnorm(1000),frequency=365)) yielded (among other outputs): I can't handle data with frequency greater than 24. Seasonality will be ignored. Try stlf() if you need seasonal forecasts. And this actually makes a lot of sense. In exponential smoothing (whether in a state space framework or otherwise), having a seasonality of $k$ periods means you need to estimate $k$ initial conditions. 365 initial conditions is a lot . You would overfit massively. So go with stlf instead.
