What do the authors mean by this, regarding estimation of mutual information

I found the following while reading a paper [1] and got confused: Replacing $k_{ij}$ , $k{i.}$ , respectively $k_{.j}$ , by $k_{i,j}$ , $k_{i.}$ and $k_{.j}$ provides us with estimates of entropy and mutual information. This is on page 235, right after equation 2.9. The authors seemed to write about replacing the set of variables with another, but there seems to be a typo. It might not be a big deal but I don't want to miss something important here. Does anyone know what might be going on that paragraph?
