1) Do you call this from only one place? If so, you may gain a small amount of performance by moving the code out of that function and just putting it right where you would normally have called the Sigmoid function. I don't like this idea in terms of code readability and organization but when you need to get every last performance gain, this might help because I think function calls require a push/pop of registers on the stack, which could be avoided if your code was all inline. 2) I have no idea if this might help but try making your function parameter a ref parameter. See if it's faster. I would have suggested making it const (which would have been an optimization if this were in c++) but c# doesn't support const parameters.
