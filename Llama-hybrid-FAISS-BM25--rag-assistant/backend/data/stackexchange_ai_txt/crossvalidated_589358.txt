Is the term “latent effect” in statistics has the same meaning as “latent variable”?

Is the term “latent effect” in statistics has the same meaning as “latent variable”? If not, then what would be its substantive interpretation? UPDATE: There is a whole class of models called “Latent Gaussian models”, and that is where my confusion comes from. Basically, any article/book on Bayesian-hierarchical regression modeling mentions “latent effects”. Below I have attached the picture of one article where this term is kind of introduced. The link to the whole article is here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07844.pdf (hope it opens).
