Standardization (z-score) across the “Samples” or across the “variables”?

I found in literature that one of the most common way of standardization data is to compute z-scores (mean subtraction and division by standard deviation). Can anybody tell me if it is ok to compute z-scores for each sample instead of each variable? I have a data set of 12x200 (12 Subjects and 200 Attributes) where all the variables/attributes are measured on the same unit but do have different ranges. Literature says, z-score has to be computed for each attribute (i.e, standardizing each column). My question is what if I standardize subjects (i.e, standardizing each row)? Is that acceptable from statistical point of view? Basically I am training an SVM classier. I got 75% classification accuracy on raw data, 83% on column standardization (z-score of each individual attribute across all samples) and 100% with row standardization (z-score of individual samples). I would like to go with standardizing each subject instead of attribute as it gives me better classification accuracy. Also, in case if I have just 1 subject for independent testing of my SVM classifier, I can do that by standardization it this way. In other case, if I train SVM with attribute standardization than I can not perform independent testing while having just 1 subject (because I can not z-score attributes of 1 subject independently). I need advice if this is something viable in statistics?
