First, the if/else block in your function will return the warning: Warning message: In if (1:2 > 2:3) TRUE else FALSE : the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used which explains why it all the rows are the same. Second, you should allocate your data.frame and fill in the elements rather than repeatedly combining objects together. I imagine this is causing your long run-times. EDIT: My shared code. I'd love for someone to provide a more elegant solution. Mydf = 1 & Mydf$Clicks >= 1, "HasClicks", Mydf$Type) Mydf$Type = 1 & Mydf$Clicks == 0, "NoClicks", Mydf$Type)
