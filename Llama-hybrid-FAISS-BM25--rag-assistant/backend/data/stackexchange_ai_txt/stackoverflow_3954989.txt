I've been using the mechanize gem (http://mechanize.rubyforge.org/mechanize/) with good results. Performance is always a problem because HTTP response times can vary, but there is nothing inherently slow about mechanize. I was looking to gain optimal performance by adding concurrency where the order of retrieval was not important. It can take quite a bit of tweaking to get the receive buffers isolated so the buffer from one does not get corrupted by a response from another thread. Good luck with this.
