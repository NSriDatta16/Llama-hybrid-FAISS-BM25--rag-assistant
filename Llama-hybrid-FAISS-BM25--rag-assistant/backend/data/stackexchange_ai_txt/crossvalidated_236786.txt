Does it make sense to add the principal components together to produce a single index?

I want to build an index from, say, 13 variables. I run a PCA for these 13 variables to produce 13 principal components, 5 of which have an Eigenvalue of more than 1. While some researchers use only the first principal component as their index, this does not seem advisable here since PC1 only has a proportion of variance explained of 23%. So, does it make sense to sum PC = PC1 + PC2 + ... + PC5 as my index?
