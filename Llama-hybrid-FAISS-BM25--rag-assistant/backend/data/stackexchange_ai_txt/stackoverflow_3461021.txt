Drag and Drop Element Into Textbox

In the latest project I'm undertaking, I need to be able to drag a div element from a list and drop it into a textbox. The project itself has a strong messaging component and I'd like to have the functionality to drag contacts from a contact list and place them in a "recipient" textbox containing one or more recipients, comma delimited. I've figured out dragging and dropping from here , but I can't for the life of me figure out a way to populate a textbox by dropping a div item onto it. I'd appreciate any assistance.
