Newer version of "... or die(..."

A long time ago I used to use "or die" in my PHP code. Especially like this: $q = mysql_query('......') or die(mysql_error()); Obviously, that's pretty shameful these days, but the X or Y principle still speaks to me. So I though I'd try this: $r = $this->exec($query) or throw new Exception('FAIL'); but that results in a parse error! What's the best practice for such statements. It has to look nice as well (obviously!)... I don't like if ( !($r = $this->exec($query)) ) throw new ... or $r = $this->exec($query) if ( !$r ) throw new .... Any favourites? Discouragements? Best practices? Speed is always nice.
