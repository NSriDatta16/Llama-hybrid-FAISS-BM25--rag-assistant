This doesn't solve all the problems, but changing dropMimeData() to the following will at least allow moving leaf items. self.beginInsertRows(parentIndex, row, row) parentIndex.internalPointer().add_child_obj(Branch(item.get_name(), item.get_value(), parent), row) self.endInsertRows() A drag-drop operation is effectively two steps, an insert (done in dropMimeData) and a remove (done automatically by the Move drag operation). The changes above insert a new item rather than trying to insert an item which is already in the model and which will be removed from the old location after the insert occurs.
