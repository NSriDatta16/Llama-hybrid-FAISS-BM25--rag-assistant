Caveat: haven't tried this myself, but last year AMD announced ROCm 5.7 support for Pytorch on a couple of their graphics cards running Ubuntu: https://pytorch.org/blog/amd-extends-support-for-pt-ml/ "Researchers and developers working with Machine Learning (ML) models and algorithms using PyTorch can now use AMD ROCm 5.7 on Ubuntu® Linux® to tap into the parallel computing power of the Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon™ PRO W7900 graphics cards which are based on the AMD RDNA™ 3 GPU architecture." Given that their Radeon 7900 XTX 24GB cards are about 1K cheaper than an RTX4090, would be great to hear how well these work in practice.
