Should I include a variable in a model for predicting the target variable, if I find the relationship between them is not significant?

I came across the fact that there is a difference between, predictor variables and target variables. Using bi-variate analysis I found that an independent variable(say X) does not have a significant relationship with dependent variable(target variable - say Y). I want to do prediction for Y. Should I include X in the model? This may be a basic question. As I am new to data science, I am asking this. Please also tell me the difference between independent variables and predictors.
