You can't reassign constants in method definitions using Constant = value . You can however reassign them using const_set . Basically it's meant to discourage, but not disallow, dynamic constant reassignment. As to why it works with it : Yes, it is a method, but you're not defining, you're calling it. The reassignment takes place inside the block which you pass as an argument to it . Blocks inherit the type of the context in which they are created. This means that inside the block, self.class.name would be the name of your test class. Therefore, when you define a constant inside the block passed to the it method, you're actually defining a constant on your test class.
