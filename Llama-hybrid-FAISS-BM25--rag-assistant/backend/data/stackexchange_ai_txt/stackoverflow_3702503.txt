Java is a very organized language which prevents in many situations the unexperient user from missing something relevant or of importance, at least so that errors can be displayed later with a good hint or explanation for what is missing. Forcing you to mention the exceptions on a function/method declaration is a way to keep with that politics and at the same time a way to allow you to define your own specific exceptions and putting them to use.
