I suggest using two list boxes, one with the available ones, and one with the selected ones. Clicking or double-clicking an item in one of the lists should move the item into the other list. For convenience, I'd also include two "Move" buttons to do the same. This approach works surprisingly well with average users, in web applications as well as desktop applications.
