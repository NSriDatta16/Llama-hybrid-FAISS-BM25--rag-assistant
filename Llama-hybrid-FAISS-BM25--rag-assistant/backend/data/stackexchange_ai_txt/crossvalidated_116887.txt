Predictors do change their signs in the presence of others in a model. I think you are seeing a special case of "suppression". Let me explain using correlations (this principle should be applicable to logistic regression). Say you are trying to predict the extent of fire damage done to a house ($Y$) from the severity of the fire ($X_1$) and the number of fire fighters sent to put out the fire ($X_2$). Assume $r_{YX_1}=0.65, \: r_{YX_2}=0.25, \: r_{X_1X_2}=0.70$. Then, if you compute semi-partial correlations, $r_{Y(X_1X_2)} = \displaystyle\frac{0.65-0.25*0.70}{\sqrt{1-0.70^2}} = 0.67, \: r_{Y(X_2X_1)} = \displaystyle\frac{0.25-0.65*0.70}{\sqrt{1-0.70^2}} = -0.29$ This is a case of suppression (albeit very slight) because $X_2$ suppressed the variance unaccounted for by $X_1$, resulting in $r_{Y(X_1X_2)} > r_{YX_1}$. Also, $X_2$'s semi-partial correlation ($r_{Y(X_2X_1)}$) switched its sign because its positive correlation with Y was mainly through its large positive correlation with $X_1$. Conceptually this make sense: if fire severity is held constant, sending more firefighters should result in less damage to a house (Messick & Van de Geer, 1981). In your case, you need to think whether it makes sense that, while holding the time variable constant, location distance of an amenity be negatively related to the dependent variable. I also suggest some great posts on this issue in Cross Validated Answering your other questions, I do not believe your data are suffering from multicollinearity; otherwise, all predictors should show inflated standard errors and lower p-values. Finally, of course you can add the travel-distance variable to the model since it seems its true relationship was masked by irrelevant variance (which was 'suppressed' by other predictors). It is really up to the original questions you were trying to answer by designing your study. Reference Messick, D.M. & Van de Geer, J.P. "A reversal paradox."
