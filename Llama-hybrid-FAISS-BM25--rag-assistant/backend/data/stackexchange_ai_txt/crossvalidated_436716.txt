SelectKBest in just a wrapper, you may want to refer to this question: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/10773/85516 Personally when I am talking of feature selection, I am generally also implying feature engineering under the hood as I see it as the selection of the features that will be used to train the model (but maybe I'm wrong to do so). In this sense, SelectKBest does not provide ways to implement feature engineering.
