SPCache vs. HttpRuntime.Cache

I have a SharePoint 2010 Farm and want to use object caching for my own custom objects. Since it's an ASP.net Application at it's core, I could use HttpRuntime.Cache . On the other hand, SharePoint 2010 offers it's own SPCache . Why would I choose SPCache over the HttpRuntime.Cache one?
