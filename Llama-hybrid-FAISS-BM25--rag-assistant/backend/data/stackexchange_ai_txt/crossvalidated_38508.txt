A biplot only works if the first two principal components account for most of the variance in your data. Otherwise, you won't get useful results. You might not be able to plot your data in two dimensions. If I'm looking at your data set correctly, you'd only have two points on your biplot - one point for violent and one point for non violent. Are there only two rows in your data set? If so, you're not going to get anything out of a biplot or PCA in general. All I can think of for count data like that would be some barplots, particularly the stacked bar plots seen here: http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/bar.html
