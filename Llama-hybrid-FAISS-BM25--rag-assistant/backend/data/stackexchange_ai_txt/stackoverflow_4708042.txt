implementing jlabel by codes in an automated jFrame in netbeans 6.9

Hi i'm new with java swing,i try a lot and do a lot of search but in vain.i want to display a jlabel(not by drag n drop but with codes) on an automated jFrame that i have already.well my code for my JLabel is as follows: private JLabel la=new JLabel("Display label"); codes that i got during my search to dispaly in a jpanel was like follows: jPanel1.add(jLabel1); but it does not work.My jPanel1 was built by drag n drop with the name Jpanel1. i even try this piece of code: this.add(jLabel1)-- this.getContentPane().add(jLabel1) but still not working. Please help me,it must be a simple line of code or i'm missing something somewhere ,please..thank you
