To build on Karmen Blake's answer and KandadaBoggu's answer , the first method definition makes it so when this line is executed: @blog.req = request It's like doing this instead: @blog.user_ip = request.remote_ip @blog.user_agent = request.env['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] @blog.referrer = request.env['HTTP_REFERER'] It basically sets up a shortcut. It looks like you're just assigning a variable's value, but you're actually calling a method named req= , and the request object is the first (and only) parameter. This works because, in Ruby, functions can be used with or without parentheses.
