Are you sure that you have edited the correct .htaccess file. I had a lot of trouble with Joomla SEF only to discover after a lot of wasted time that I was editing an .htaccess file in the wrong location. Apache installations differe a lot as to how they organise configuation files. The rewrite could well be working for Apache but turned off for the subdirectory corresponding to one of the sites.
