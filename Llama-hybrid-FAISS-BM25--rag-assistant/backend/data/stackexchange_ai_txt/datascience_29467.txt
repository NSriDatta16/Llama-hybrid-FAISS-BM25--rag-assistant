The sum of probabilities is more than 1

I have CNN architecture for object detection ( one object in image ) in KERAS. It has 22 Convolutional layers ( layer includes max pool , LeakyRelu and Batchnorm ) The last layes are following model.add(Flatten()) model.add(Dense(6)) Basicly i want to output vector that reresents ( probability that is is ObjECT , probability that it isnt , x , y , xmax, ymax ) I am feeding it data that has one object in it and labels ( 1, 0, xmin , ymin , xmax , ymax ) This has around 0.60% accuracy. However the sum of (isOBject + isntObject ) is greater than 1. [[ 1.02664185 0.34075582 231.69602966 241.59547424 280.6262207 266.35855103]] Hos is this possible. Also when i feed network another data that does NOT have object in it and labl them ( 0, 1 , 0, 0, 0, 0 ). I get 10% accuracy. How can it be? It has more data to learn from and added false data on top of that. I appreciate all tips and tricks / explanation, basicly all help. Thanks
