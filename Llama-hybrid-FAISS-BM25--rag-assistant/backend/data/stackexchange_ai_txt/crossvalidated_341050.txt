Scaled vs non-scaled PCA, which is more accurate?

So in this post: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/16335/78575 The author explains a difference of scaling vs not scaling PCA. The two results differ quite a bit on the same data. Which one then is more accurate and how to infer the accuracy and the need for scaling or not?
