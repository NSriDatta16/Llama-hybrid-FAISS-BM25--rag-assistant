You fit your model (e.g., Exponential Smoothing) to the training sample , which is 1980Q1-2014Q4. Then you use it to forecast into the holdout sample , i.e., 2015Q1-2019Q4. Finally, you assess the accuracy of your forecast on the holdout sample, e.g., using the MSE, where you take the average of the squared errors between your forecast and the holdout actuals. You will usually do this when you face a choice between different forecasting models. If method A performs better on the holdout sample than method B, the you hope that this will also be true when you use both methods on "real" data and forecast into the "true" future. It is important to compare forecast accuracy out of sample , not in sample (also known as fit ). Any method will try to fit its training data as closely as possible, and more complex methods can usually fit better. But that does not mean that they forecast better, because they may be overfitting. So: always assess forecasts out of sample. You may want to take a look at Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman or Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman , in particular the section on forecast accuracy measurement .
