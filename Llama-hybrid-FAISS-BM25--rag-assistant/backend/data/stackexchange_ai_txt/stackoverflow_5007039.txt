There are a few different things that could be going on here Try setting some credentials myRequest.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials; // if we have a proxy set its creds as well if( myRequest.Proxy != null ) { myRequest.Proxy.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials; } And make sure you're setting a UserAgent and Accpet settings as well. myRequest.UserAgent = "Foo"; myRequest.Accept = "*/*"; If you add these I don't think you will have any issues.
