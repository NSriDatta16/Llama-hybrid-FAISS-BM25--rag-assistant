Logon identified -- any backend storage of this number?

When you log on to an ASP.NET app you are issued with a logon cookie (I think it's called ASPX_AUTH or similar). What is the structure of this cookie? Does the server actually maintain any logon state, or is it purely what's within the cookie (in which case, can I force a very long logon state by chaning the cookie expiry?) Tx, AJ.
