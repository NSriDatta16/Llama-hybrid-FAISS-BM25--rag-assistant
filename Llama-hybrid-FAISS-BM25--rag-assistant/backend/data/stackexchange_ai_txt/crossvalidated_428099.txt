OK, now we know you're interested in MLEs for normal data. But your goal in finding these estimates of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ might be. Maybe if I give a couple of examples, that might help you to refine your question. Suppose you know that scores on the ABC college entrance exam for this year are normally distributed with mean $\mu = 350$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 50.$ You have 100 early applications for your college with sample mean $\bar X = 360$ and sample SD $S = 56.$ These sample statistics are based on MLEs. Estimating average scores. You want to know whether the applicants so far might be better than the population mean. So you do a one-sample t test of the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = 350$ against $H_a: \mu > 350.$ The procedure for one-sample t tests is explained in most elementary statistics texts. Output from Minitab statistical software for such a test on your data is as follows: One-Sample T Test of Î¼ = 350 vs > 350 N Mean StDev SE Mean 95% Lower Bound T P 100 360.00 56.00 5.60 350.70 1.79 0.039 Because the P-value is below 0.05, we say that the sample mean $\bar X = 360$ is significantly larger than the population mean $\mu = 350$ at the 5% level of significance. Estimating proportion of qualifying scores. Maybe your college only admits students with ABC scores of 410 or above. Among the 100 applications at hand, how many have sufficiently high scores? You may find that there are 15 of them, and estimate that you are on track for 15% of applicants to qualify. But the fraction of sufficiently high scores among the 100 is not based on MLEs. So this is not the best way to estimate this year's proportion of qualified students. [We see below that this estimate is to low. Using the number of qualifying scores among the 100 at hand might just as well have given an estimate that is too high.] Using the MLEs, we ask what proportion of a normal population with mean 360 and SD 56 would have qualifying scores. According to a quick computation in R statistical software, that turns out to be about 19%. This is a better estimate because the MLEs carry more information about your applications on hand than does the actual count of qualifying applications. 1-pnorm(409.4, 360, 56) [1] 0.1888498 Note: it would also be a mistake to look at the proportion of qualifying ABC scores nationwide because that would be only about 12%. 1 - pnorm(409.5, 350, 50) [1] 0.1170232 Addendum. A million samples of size $n=100$ were taken from $\mathsf{Norm}(350, 50).$ The population 88th percentile is 408.75. For each sample of 100 the 88th percentile was estimated by taking the 88th sample percentile ( sp.88 ). Also, the 88th population percentile ( pp.88 ) was found for the distribution estimated using MLEs $\mathsf{Norm}(\bar X, S).$ The histograms show that the MLE method is nearly unbiased and has smaller variance than the sample percentile method. R code for the simulation (but not the histogram) is shown below. set.seed(920) mu = 350; sg = 50; n = 100 m = 10^6; sp.88 = pp.88 = numeric(m) for(i in 1:m) { x = rnorm(n,mu,sg) sp.88[i] = quantile(x,.88) pp.88[i] = qnorm(.88,mean(x),sd(x)) } mean(sp.88); sd(sp.88) [1] 407.65 [1] 7.979684 ## larger SD mean(pp.88); sd(pp.88) [1] 408.5956 ## closer to 408.75 [1] 6.509124 ## smaller SD
