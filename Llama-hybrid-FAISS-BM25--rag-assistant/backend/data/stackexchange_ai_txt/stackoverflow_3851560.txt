How to use SharedPreferences

I'm new to android development - using a book called Sams Teach Yourself Android Application Development in 24 hours. Followed it so far but got stuck trying to use SharedPreferences. In the folder src/com.androidbook.triviaquiz I've got a file called QuizActivity, in it I've got the following: package com.androidbook.triviaquiz; import android.app.Activity; import android.os.Bundle; import android.content.SharedPreferences; public class QuizActivity extends Activity { public static final String GAME_PREFERENCES = "GamePrefs"; SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences(GAME_PREFERENCES, MODE_PRIVATE); SharedPreferences.Editor prefEditor = settings.edit(); prefEditor.putString("UserName", "JaneDoe"); prefEditor.putInt("UserAge", 22); prefEditor.commit(); } This is what the book tells me to use, but it returns errors at the following points: under the "." after the first 2 prefEditor statements, under ("UserName", "JaneDoe") under ("UserAge", 22); and under "commit" I've looked on loads of websites for help but all seem to use the same code. What am I doing wrong?
