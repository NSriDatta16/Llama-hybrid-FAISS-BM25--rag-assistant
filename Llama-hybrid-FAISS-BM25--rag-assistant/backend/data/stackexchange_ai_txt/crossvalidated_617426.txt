Where does the uncertainty of the "true" $p_{*}(y|x)$ come from?

You'll often see the goal of a statistical estimation problem as being to fit a model such that it $\approx p_{*}(y|x)$ where $p_{*}(y|x)$ is the "true distribution of the data". My question is : what uncertainty is possessed in this "true distribution of the data"? Does it assume infinite training data...in which case it only possesses "aleatoric" uncertainty? Put another way...assuming correct model specification, if we have little data but we fit a Bayesian model such that the model uncertainty is perfectly accounted for, does that model's posterior predictive $p(y|x, \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ closely approximate $p_{*}(y|x)$ ?
