Finding best $\lambda$ from Ridge Regression and using it in logistic regression is not a good idea. Optimisation objectives significantly differ between the two models. You need to find the best $\lambda$ for the penalised logreg. The error in your code is actually a good warning. You want to do a cross-validation but there is nothing to cross-validate it says.
