Simulate from the prior, calculate the likelihood for a fixed dataset (your expression is a function of chosen $y_1,\ldots,y_n$), and then store the resulting number. Do that over and over again and calculate the average of your numbers. Pick a number $B$ for how many times you want to simulate. For $k=1,\ldots,B$, draw $\mu^k, \lambda^k, p^k$ evaluate and store $g(\mu^k, \lambda^k, p^k) = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} \big[p^k \phi(y_{i}-\mu^k)+(1-p^k)\phi(y_{i}-\lambda^k)\big]$ report $B^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^Bg(\mu^k, \lambda^k, p^k)$. This works for any choice of $y_1,\ldots,y_n$.
