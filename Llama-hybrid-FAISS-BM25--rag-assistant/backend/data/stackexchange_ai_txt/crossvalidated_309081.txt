What is the variance of a time series that is the change of another time series?

If a time series variable $y_{t+1}$ is measuring the change of another time series variable so that $y_{t+1}=x_{t+1}-x_t$, I want to know how to compute the Variance of $y_{t+1}$ as a function of the variance of $x_t$. Is it the following? $Var(y_{t+1})=Var(x_{t+1})+Var(x_t) - 2Cov(x_{t+1},x_t)$ (Note the covariance would have a plus sign if it was $y_{t+1}=x_{t+1}+x_t$ instead)
