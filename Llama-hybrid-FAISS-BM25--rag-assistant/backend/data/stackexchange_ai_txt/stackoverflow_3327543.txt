"matt b" has already posted the answer that is the most maven way of doing it. It is the way I'd recommend doing it 99% of the time. However, occasionally, your configuration file might be quite complicated, and it doesn't make much sense to duplicate the whole file for each environment when only one XML stanza differs. In these cases, you can abuse property filtering to accomplish your goal. Warning, a very duct-tape-y solution follows, and will not be for the faint of heart: In your pom.xml: Attention StackOverflow Editors!!!! The html entity escaping is a part of the solution. The solution will NOT work if you replace it all with greater-than and less-than signs. Please leave the answer as is... &lt;security-constraint&gt; &lt;web-resource-collection&gt; &lt;web-resource-name&gt;protected&lt;/web-resource-name&gt; &lt;url-pattern&gt;/pages/*.xhtml&lt;/url-pattern&gt; &lt;url-pattern&gt;/pages/*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt; &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt; &lt;auth-constraint&gt; &lt;role-name&gt;*&lt;/role-name&gt; &lt;/auth-constraint&gt; &lt;/security-constraint&gt; &lt;login-config&gt; &lt;auth-method&gt;${web.modules.auth.type}&lt;/auth-method&gt; &lt;realm-name&gt;MyRealm&lt;/realm-name&gt; &lt;/login-config&gt; &lt;security-constraint&gt; in your web.xml .... ${test.security.config} .... Because non-existent properties evaluate to an empty string, your configurations which do not have this property set (or the property is an empty xml tag) will evaluate to a blank line here. It's ugly, and the xml is hard to modify in this form. However, if your web.xml is complex and you pose a greater risk of 4-5 copies of the web.xml getting out of sync, this may be an approach that will work for you.
