I've tried out Copy Handler and it works very well. It has some cool features where you can control buffering depending on the type of media and with file queuing support so you can setup your copy and move operations and forget about them and minimize disk fragmentation at the same time. So it won't copy multiple file simultaneously from a single CD or DVD as it would make the drive seek too much. Best of all its Open Source.
