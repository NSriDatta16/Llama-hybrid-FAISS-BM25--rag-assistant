WebServer for existing app

We have an existing windows desktop app written in C# 6 that uses an MDB MS access database for its storage. I need to write a web interface that can read that php webpage and maybe write to it later on. This web interface will be included with our current installer for the application or as a simple addon. The user should only have to click start server and it should just work serving the php pages from the installation directory. I was playing with gwan, nginx, quickphp. Only the last one seems simple enough to work. So my question is what do or would you use to achieve this? Are there alternatives to quickPHP? Distribution. I'd also like to have something we can include in the installer. I dont want the user to have to do and download any additional apps.
