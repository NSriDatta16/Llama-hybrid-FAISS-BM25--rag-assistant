Reversibility in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

When I read the paper by Neal, 'MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1901.pdf In page 4, final paragraph, it says ' The reversibility of Hamiltonian dynamics is important for showing that MCMC updates that use the dynamics leave the desired distribution invariant, since this is most easily proved by showing reversibility of the Markov chain transitions, which requires reversibility of the dynamics used to propose a state. ' My understanding is that the Metropolis Hasting algorithm has guaranteed the Markov chain to be reversible, then why we still need the property of reversibility of Hamiltonian dynamics?
