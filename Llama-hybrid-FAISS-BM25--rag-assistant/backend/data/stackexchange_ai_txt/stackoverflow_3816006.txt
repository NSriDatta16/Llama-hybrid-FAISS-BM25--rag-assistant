Reportlab - how to introduce line break if the paragraph is too long for a line

I have a list of text to be added to a reportlab frame style = getSampleStyleSheet()['Normal'] style.wordWrap = 'LTR' style.leading = 12 for legend in legends: elements.append(Paragraph(str(legend),style)) If the legend is too long, the text at the end is not visible at all. How to introduce line breaks in this situation.
