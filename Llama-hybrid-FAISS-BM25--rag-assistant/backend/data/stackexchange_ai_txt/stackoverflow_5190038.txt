I say its not possible as GExperts write: Data storage files other than configuration settings are stored in the GExperts storage directory you have defined in the GExperts Configuration dialog. This includes data storage for things like Favorite Files, Macro Templates, Code Proofreader, Clipboard History, Macro Library, and Code Librarian snippets. And there is no way to configure the way FavoriteFiles.xml is saved , so it seems to work only with absolute Paths.
