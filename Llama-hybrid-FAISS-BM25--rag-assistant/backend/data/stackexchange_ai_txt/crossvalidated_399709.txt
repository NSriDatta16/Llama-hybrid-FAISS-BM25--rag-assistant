I am not 100% sure about this approach, but I think it works. 2500 is the quantile 0.679 of your distribution. The same quantile in the standard normal is at 0.465 3000 is the quantile 0.9979 (=1-0.0021). The corresponding quantile in the standard normal is 2.863 Now you need an affine mapping $f(x)=\sigma x + \mu$ such that $f(0.465) = 2500$ and $f(2.863) = 3000$ We get the following two equation system: $0.465 \sigma + \mu = 2500$ $2.863 \sigma + \mu = 3000$ Now we solve, so that $\sigma = 209.2$ and $\mu=2401.6$ (with a lot of rounding errors, since I am doing this by hand) Anyway, pay close attention to the comments posted, as the normality assumption may be way off from reality
