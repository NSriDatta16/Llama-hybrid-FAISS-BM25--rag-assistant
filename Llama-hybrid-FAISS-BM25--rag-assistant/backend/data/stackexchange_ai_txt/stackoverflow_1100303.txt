I would not use unit testing for performance tests for a couple of reasons. First, unit tests should not have dependencies to the surrounding system/code. Performance tests depend heavily on the hardware/OS, so it is hard to get uniform measures that will be usable on both developer workstations, build server etc. Second, unit tests should execute really fast. When you do performance tests, you usually want to have quite large data sets and repeat the number of runs a couple of times in order average numbers/get rid of overhead and so forth. These all work against the idea of fast tests.
