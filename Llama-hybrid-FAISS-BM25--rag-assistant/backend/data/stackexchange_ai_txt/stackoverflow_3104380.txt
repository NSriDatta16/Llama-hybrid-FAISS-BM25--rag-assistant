Date format - Excel and C#

My C# application send a formatted date (ex: 9/6/2010 - dd/mm/yyyy) to an excel spreadsheet... but then... it comes to 6/9/2010! (mm/dd/yyyy) I just use the following code to send the date: VarRowColumnWhatever = _MyList.MyObject.MyDateTime.Date.ToString(); Debbuging it, i can see that the value are correct! But not in the spreadsheet =( I began to think that is something to do with Excel... Someone please can help me? Thanks!
