I use tabs often, and use them to logically group files. For instance, I'll open views or HTML in one tab, in another have the associated controllers and another has the associated models. Then I'll save out the layout using :mksession! and reload it later with the -S flag. Other times I'll use tabs to keep one of vim's help pages open just so it's immediately available. I think the main thing is tabs allow you to organize your buffers in a different way than using split windows and that flexibility allows vim to work with more people's brains, because we all think differently. This answer to a related question might help: Using Vim's tabs like buffers I normally use the -O flag to open files in split windows, but if you insist on opening them in separate tabs you can use -p . I prefer splits because I can easily see two separate files side by side, something you can't do with tabs. And finally, here's some key defs I use to make it easy to move between splits: " Switch between window splits using big J or K and expand the split to its " full size. " " Move vertically in the window through the horizontal splits... map j _ map k _ " Move horizontally in the window through the vertical splits... map h \| map l \|
