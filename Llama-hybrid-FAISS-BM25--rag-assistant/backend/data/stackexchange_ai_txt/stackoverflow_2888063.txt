I would recommend doing the Project Euler exercises: http://projecteuler.net/ Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. Because many programmers are solving Project Euler exercises, you can compare the solutions to other (non-functional) programming languages, but also Clojure solutions are available: http://clojure-euler.wikispaces.com/ , so you can contrast imperative vs. functional/idiomatic Clojure. Of course you will learn the most by first doing the exercises yourself, without consulting any of the solutions.
