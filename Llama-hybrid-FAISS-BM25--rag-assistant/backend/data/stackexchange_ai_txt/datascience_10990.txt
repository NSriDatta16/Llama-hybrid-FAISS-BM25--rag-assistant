Maybe I'm being a bit too simplistic, but I would build a set of training data that looks like this (Good=1 means patient showed up for appt and is good by your definition, 0 = bad ) Recid, PatId, SurgeryId, DrId, DateAppt, TimeAppt, Gender, Age, Good 1, 1, 100, 10, 01jan16, 10:30, M, 31, 1 2, 1, 100, 12, 05jan16, 15:20, M, 31, 1 3, 1, 100, 10, 06mar16, 11:45, M, 31, 0 4, 2, 101, 15, 02Feb16, 12:35, F, 75, 1 .... I would then use one of the machine learning tools in R - there are a variety of them, to train a model of your data. Then with another set of data, I would test the model you have just built to see how correct it is. If you don't have a second set of data, then randomly partition your original training set and only train with half of the data. Some further suggestions to make your model more powerful, is create additional variables with the following information a Flag to indicate if a person has missed a previous appointment with any doctor. a Flag to indicate if a person has missed a previous appointment with the particular doctor they are going to be visiting - I know from person experience there are some doctors in my surgery that I have a preference to see. The number of days since the last appointment Day of week of appointment Sounds like a nice dataset to be working with!
