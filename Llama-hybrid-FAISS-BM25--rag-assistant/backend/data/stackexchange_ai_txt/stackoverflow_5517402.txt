As far as I know, there is not a built-in way to filter dropped files. However, in your NATIVE_DRAG_ENTER handler, you could loop through the list of files and choose not accept the drag based on their file types. Or, you could merely ignore the unsupported types when you are processing the NATIVE_DRAG_DROP. var validTypes:Object = {png : true, jpg : true, gif : true}; function nativeDragEnter(event:NativeDragEvent):void { var files:Array = event.clipboard.getData(ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT) as Array for each(var file:File in files) { if(!validTypes[file.extension.toLowerCase()]) // Don't accept drag if any of the dropped files aren't supported. return; } DragManager.acceptDrag(InteractiveObject(event.target)); } function nativeDragDrop(event:NativeDragEvent):void { var files:Array = event.clipboard.getData(ClipboardFormats.FILE_LIST_FORMAT) as Array for each(var file:File in files) { if(validTypes[file.extension]) //accept only certain files processFile(file); } } As a side note, I assumed you are working on an AIR app here, but if you aren't, you'll have to use the FileReference class instead of File.
