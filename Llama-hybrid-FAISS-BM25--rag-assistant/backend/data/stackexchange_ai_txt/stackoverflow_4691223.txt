To my knowledge when you use one of the choosers, like the Photo gallery or the camera, when your application is activating it will take it back to the page you left it. I don't think there is a way to get around this itself. What you would have to do is catch the Activating event in your main page code and Navigate to the desired page from there. Now I am not completely sure how you would pass the image from the MainPage to the target page. It does not look like there is a property in the Navigation service to store this value. But you could either set it in an application wide variable, ModelView or even store it in the Isolated Storage area.
