Why does one want the measure of discrepancy to be a true metric? There is a huge literature on axiomatic characterizations of I-divergence as measure of distance. It is neither symmetric nor satisfies triangle inequality. I hope by 'transition matrix' you mean 'probability transition matrix'. Never mind, as long as the entries are non negative, I-divergence is considered to be the "best" measure of discrimination. See for example http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/10/3/261/ . In fact certain axioms which any one would feel desirable lead to measures which are nonsymmetric in general.
