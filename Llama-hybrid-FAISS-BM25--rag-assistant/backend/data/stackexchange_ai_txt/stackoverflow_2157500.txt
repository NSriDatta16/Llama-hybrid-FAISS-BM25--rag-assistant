as far as I can tell io.Source is still broken in 2.8 (connections are leaked etc), so people should be discouraged from using it. As David suggested above, until the replacement lib http://github.com/scala-incubator/scala-io gets merged (probably after 2.8) the best choice is to relay on pure java libs like apache commons-io etc.
