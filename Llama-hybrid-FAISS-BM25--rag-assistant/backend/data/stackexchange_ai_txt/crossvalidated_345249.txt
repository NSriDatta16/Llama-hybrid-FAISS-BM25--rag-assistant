Example 37.1 Logistic Regression In an experiment comparing the effects of five different drugs, each drug is tested on a number of different subjects. The outcome of each experiment is the presence or absence of a positive response in a subject. The following artificial data represent the number of responses r in the n subjects for the five different drugs, labeled A through E. The response is measured for different levels of a continuous covariate x for each drug. The drug type and the continuous covariate x are explanatory variables in this experiment. The number of responses r is modeled as a binomial random variable for each combination of the explanatory variable values, with the binomial number of trials parameter equal to the number of subjects n and the binomial probability equal to the probability of a response. The following DATA step creates the data set: data drug; input drug$ x r n @@; datalines; A .1 1 10 A .23 2 12 A .67 1 9 B .2 3 13 B .3 4 15 B .45 5 16 B .78 5 13 C .04 0 10 C .15 0 11 C .56 1 12 C .7 2 12 D .34 5 10 D .6 5 9 D .7 8 10 E .2 12 20 E .34 15 20 E .56 13 15 E .8 17 20 ; run; A logistic regression for these data is a generalized linear model with response equal to the binomial proportion r/n. The probability distribution is binomial, and the link function is logit. For these data, drug and x are explanatory variables. The probit and the complementary log-log link functions are also appropriate for binomial data. PROC GENMOD performs a logistic regression on the data in the following SAS statements: proc genmod data=drug; class drug; model r/n = x drug / dist = bin link = logit lrci; run;
