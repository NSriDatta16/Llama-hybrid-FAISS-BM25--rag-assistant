You can define Bean1 in it's own application context file. Include this file in the main application context like this: Now, create two almost identical files named "applicationContext-bean1.xml". Store one in your main application directory, and the other one in a test directory. Don't put depends-on in the file in the test directory. Then, when you run your test, make sure the classpath include the test directory before the main directory. I don't know if this is a more elegant solution, but it is another way of addressing the problem. :)
