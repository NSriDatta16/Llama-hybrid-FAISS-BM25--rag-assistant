How to identify an object is big or not? Depends on your compiler/platform combo. There is no One True limit. Compilers often allow you to tune this. What will be the stack maximum size? Each OS will have different stack size? Depends mostly as above. Only thing you have less control of tuning. I have a wrapper class which wraps vector. It will have around 100 items. Will it make a stack overflow if I allocate this class to a stack? I tried this, but it worked perfectly. Not sure I am doing something wrong. Will work as long as the total memory requirement of this wrapper and other objects in that block does not exceed your stack frame size. Which in turn depends on the average string sie. A good idea is to step through a debugger and see the stack addresses -- that'll give you a start of the width to some extent. And the documentation.
