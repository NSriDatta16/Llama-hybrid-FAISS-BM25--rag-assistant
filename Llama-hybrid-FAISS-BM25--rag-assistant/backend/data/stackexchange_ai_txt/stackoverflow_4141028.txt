The Description of ?duplicated indicates that it works on rows of data.frames and the fourth paragraph of the Details section says: The data frame method works by pasting together a character representation of the rows separated by ‘\r’, so may be imperfect if the data frame has characters with embedded carriage returns or columns which do not reliably map to characters. How did you come to understand that it only works on single columns? Assuming TreeNumber is unique within Stand , Plot , and StumpNumber you just need to exclude it from the call to duplicated . > duplicated(sample[,1:3]) [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE > duplicated(sample[,1:3], fromLast=TRUE) [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE Update - If you would like all the duplicated rows, you could do something like: > allDups sample[allDups,] Stand Plot StumpNumber TreeNumber 3 MY 12 3 3 4 MY 12 3 4
