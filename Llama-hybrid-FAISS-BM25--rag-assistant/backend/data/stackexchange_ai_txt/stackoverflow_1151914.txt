It's hard to work out exactly what you mean. If you are finding database access too slow, then you should use caching to store the results received from the database into files or memory. If you are storing to memory, then the memcached server is very popular. Zend Framework provides the Zend_Cache component to help you manage storing, retreiving and expiring cached data. It also allows you to easily change the "back end" storage system from file to memcached so that you can compare performance.
