I'm not sure where your difficulty lies. If you understand this for a linear model, then understanding it for a logistic model depends on understanding the nature of logistic regression. Rather than being linear in the dependent variable itself (as in linear regression) it is linear in the logit. The random intercept and slope would be related to the logit, just as (in a linear model) they are related to the DV. But you have a nominal IV. Random intercept still makes sense - it's sort of the base level of a person - but random slope becomes an odd terminology. You can have random effects of the IV, but I would hesitate to call it a slope since the IV has no order; in fact, "slope" sort of requires an interval or ratio level IV.
