You can use modern browsers HTML5 functionalities to do so. A detailed explanation here: http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/01/10/cross-browser-html5-drag-and-drop/ There is also the jQuery plugin: https://github.com/weixiyen/jquery-filedrop This one is a bit bogus (truncates files with accents like in french, doesn't handle correctly several drop areas in the same page, ...), but are easy to fix (I sent a fixed version to the author weeks ago, but didn't get any feedback...) With some Ajax and the correct server-side solution, it works like a charm. I don't know any .NET solution, though. Best,
