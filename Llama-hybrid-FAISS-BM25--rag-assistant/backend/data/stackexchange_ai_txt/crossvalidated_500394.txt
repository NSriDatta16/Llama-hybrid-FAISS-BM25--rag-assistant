Even after putting a bounty on the question, I see no answers. So here's my current evaluation of the situation. I could not find articles discussing feature dynamics. However, as I said in the question, there are plenty of articles discussing time series dynamics more broadly. And there is a connection. Let us calculate a feature $f$ from data $x(t)$ with varying history lengths $h$ . The resulting series $f(x(t), h)$ is in itself a time series. To examine the stability of $f(h)$ we can use the same techniques that could be applied to $x(t)$ . At least this is a way to go forward.
