How does Zend_Auth storage work?

This is very simple. I write $auth->getStorage()->write($user); And then I want, in a separate process to load this $user, but I can't because $user = $auth->getIdentity(); is empty. Didn't I just... SET it? Why does it not work? Halp? [EDIT 2011-04-13] This has been asked almost two years ago. Fact is, though, that I repeated the question in July 2010 and got a fantastic answer that I back then simply did not understand. Link: Zend_Auth fails to write to storage I have since built a very nice litte class that I use (sometimes with extra tweaking) in all my projects using the same storage engine as Zend_Auth but circumventing all the bad. data = $data; return true; } public function load($name = 'default', $part = null) { $session = new Zend_Session_Namespace($name); if (!isset($session->data)) return null; $data = $session->data; if ($part && isset($data[$part])) return $data[$part]; return $data; } public function clear($name = 'default') { $session = new Zend_Session_Namespace($name); if (isset($session->data)) unset($session->data); return true; } } ?>
