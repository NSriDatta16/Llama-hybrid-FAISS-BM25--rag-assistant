A code coverage tool, which others describe, leverages the ability to profile code. The underpinnings of a code coverage tool are that it uses an application profiler , and is programmed to perform source code matching and line hit counts as part of its profiling. In the case of .NET, code coverage and other profiling tools will be leveraging the .NET Profiling API . Even NCover. Other tools exist which may provide you more of a log-activity that you are looking for, rather than line-hit-counts. You can even work on programming your own profiling application which might log to a special XML file, and then digitally sign it, timestamp it, and upload it to a server process. AQtime seems to have the flow-of-control and logging capabilities you might be looking for. Enterprise Architect from Sparx Systems includes a profiling application called SSProfiler75.exe, which is behind its ability to "reverse engineer" source code into sequence diagrams. Consider looking for code profiling tools, not simply code coverage tools, which are one use case for a profiler.
