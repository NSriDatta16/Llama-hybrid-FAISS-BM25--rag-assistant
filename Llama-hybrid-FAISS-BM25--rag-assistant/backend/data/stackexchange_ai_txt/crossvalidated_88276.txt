Standard error of regression coefficients without an assumption of homoscedastic normal noise

I have a time series that is affected by two (or more) kinds of events. When event $A$ happens, some signal is linearly added to the time series (the signal lasts, for example, for 100 time points). When event $B$ happens, another signal (also of 100 time points length) is linearly added to the time series. The noise is not completely normal - there are some very strong outliers here and there. My goal is to model the two signals. If the responses to the two events didn't overlap in time, I could simply average all the time points delayed t time points after each event kind. The standard deviation of the values in this subset of time points divided by $\sqrt{n}$ (n is the number of event occurrences) performs well enough in estimating the error: if in one of event $A$'s occurrences there was a strong outlier at time $x$, it will increase the local estimate of error for that particular delay. My problem is that the two events do overlap in time. Therefor, I have to use regression in order to deconvolve the two responses. This is done by creating a set of pulse predictors of 100 delays from the occurrences of each event type (a Finite Impulse Response model). By OLS I can get a good estimation of the shapes of the two signals. However, I can't get a good estimate of the error: the standard OLS error estimator is assuming homoscedastic error. Hence, a time point at time $t_1$ that was distorted by a strong outlier has the same error estimation as time point $t_2$, which wasn't noised so much. This makes the error estimator useless in telling a true increase in the signal from a momentary noise. As a crude approximation, I thought about estimating the error for each delay $t$ (and each event kind) by the standard deviation of the particular residuals at that specific delay, divided by $\sqrt{n}$ (n is the number of event occurrences, not total time points as in the usual OLS SE). I'd appreciate any help with this problem. And in particular, answering these two questions: Is the latter solution biased? And if it is, in what way? Is there a better way to estimate the noise in this case? Due to the limitations of my scientific field, it should not involve rich parametric assumptions.
