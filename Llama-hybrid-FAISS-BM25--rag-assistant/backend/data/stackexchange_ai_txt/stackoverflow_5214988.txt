Unexpected results from XSLT in Chrome

In a program im writing, parts of the web interface are sent to the client as XML, and transformed into HTML fragments using Javascript and an XSLT. This works fine in Firefox (4.0b12) and Opera (10.63) but in Chrome (9.0.597.107) the results arn't as expected. The XSLT ui-state-error ui-icon ui-icon-alert ui-state-highlight ui-icon ui-icon-refresh downloadComplete ui-icon ui-icon-circle-check The XML test downloadQueue /xslt/downloadQueue.xslt suspended manual C:\Users\William\Programming\SCRAMDownloader\Trunk\bin\ test.zip 0.00% - - downloadSuspended 119.68 MB 8976170e-1f4b-4b79-8901-5a4191e2c07d Expected Results (Firefox) test.zip - 119.68 MB - Results in Chrome test.zip - 119.68 MB - Note the missing and tags Any ideas what im doing wrong?
