to address your question about: It is not clear that why Conv1(3)->Conv1(3)->Pool1(2) is better than Conv1(3)->Pool1 ..lot of neural network design is a trial and error process and more art than science. So one experiments with your suggestion of Conv1(3)->Pool1 and fails to get the accuracy needed and experiments some more to end up with Conv1(3)->Conv1(3)->Pool1(2) that gives them the accuracy that they need. There is seldom a real scientific explanation of why Conv1(3)->Conv1(3)->Pool1(2) is better than Conv1(3)->Pool1, but generally speaking, we need as many weights as possible to capture all the variability in data as possible, but not more (otherwise we overfit.)
