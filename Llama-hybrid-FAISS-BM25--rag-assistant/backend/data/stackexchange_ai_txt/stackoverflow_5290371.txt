jQuery set value

Update: This was a bug which has been fixed by now (Chrome 18). I have a and I'm trying to set its value by jQuery. That basically doesn't do anything. Then, I tried hiding/showing as I thought it would be a drawing problem, but to no avail did I so. Lastly, I hid the and showed it using show(1) , which would mean a fading-in of 1ms. This did set the value, however after doing so the isn't draggable anymore. I made this fiddle up: http://jsfiddle.net/MhDf7/2/ . Does anybody have an idea of what's going on here? I'm using Chrome 10.
