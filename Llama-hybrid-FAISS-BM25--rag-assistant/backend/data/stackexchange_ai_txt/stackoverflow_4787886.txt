I had the same problem and didn't pay attention to the portion BEFORE creating the Setup project. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zt39148a(v=VS.100).aspx To create the installers for your service In Solution Explorer, right-click Service1.vb or Service1.cs and select View Designer. Click the background of the designer to select the service itself, instead of any of its contents. With the designer in focus, right-click, and then click Add Installer. By default, a component class that contains two installers is added to your project. The component is named ProjectInstaller, and the installers it contains are the installer for your service and the installer for the service's associated process. In Design view for ProjectInstaller, click ServiceInstaller1 or serviceInstaller1. In the Properties window, make sure the ServiceName property is set to MyNewService. Set the StartType property to Automatic. In the designer, click ServiceProcessInstaller1 (for a Visual Basic project), or serviceProcessInstaller1 (for a Visual C# project). Set the Account property to LocalSystem. This will cause the service to be installed and to run on a local service account.
