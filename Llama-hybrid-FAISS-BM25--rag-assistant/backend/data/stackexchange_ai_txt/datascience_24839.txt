How do you get an RNN to learn in real time?

In order to train a recurrent neural network, you have to unfold it say 50 times and treat it like a chain of RNN cells. Now if you are using this RNN to train in realtime, then it seems you may as well just have a chain of 50 cells. Maybe fix their weights to all be the same as in a convolutional neural network. So are RNN's any use in learning in realtime for temporal data?
