Is your server so slow that it cannot handle all of the movement? Especially in a 2-d game? Typically when I make little 2d games the server gives me back all of my movements, so no calculation is required on the client. If the server begins to lag, I simply freeze up a bit, which is what one would typically expect anyway (although this almost never happens). In any case, I would definitely see how the performance is without the client making any actual calculations itself. If the performance isn't good enough, see if looping through player movements on the server is causing the delay (and start using a different thread for each client). If there is indeed a real restriction in bandwidth (movements themselves pass very little data), then certainly you need to find the average delay of that particular user and calculate that into the algorithm. However, to continuously keep finding the average (for precision), you'll have to continue to ping the server to find the round-trip time, which shouldn't be all that costly.
