ncurses-like bindings in interpreted languages

Are there any bindings for ncurses or a similar menuing framework in interpreted languages that make the process of creating console menus and interacting with options absurdly simple? I want to quickly prototype out a terminal-only configuration utility that runs on a Linux machine, in order to leverage some local resources previously installed.
