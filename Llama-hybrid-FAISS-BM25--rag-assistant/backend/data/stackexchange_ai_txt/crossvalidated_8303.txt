How to do logistic regression subset selection?

I am fitting a binomial family glm in R, and I have a whole troupe of explanatory variables, and I need to find the best (R-squared as a measure is fine). Short of writing a script to loop through random different combinations of the explanatory variables and then recording which performs the best, I really don't know what to do. And the leaps function from package leaps does not seem to do logistic regression. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
