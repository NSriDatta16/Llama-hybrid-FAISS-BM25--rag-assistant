Say you naively wrote a student creation method like this: void createStudent(String name) { database.execute("INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('" + name + "')"); } And someone enters the name Robert'); DROP TABLE STUDENTS; -- What gets run on the database is this query: INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('Robert'); DROP TABLE STUDENTS --') The semicolon ends the insert command and starts another; the -- comments out the rest of the line. The DROP TABLE command is executed... This is why bind parameters are a good thing.
