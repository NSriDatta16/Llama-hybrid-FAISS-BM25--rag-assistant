Phsr already mentioned the EQATEC Profiler . One feature it has that I like is that, even without reading any documentation or paying any attention at all to what I am doing, I was able to successfully, from start to finish, profile an application. Usability is a wonderful thing. Please be careful about how you add all those fancy options...don't kill usability in the process.
