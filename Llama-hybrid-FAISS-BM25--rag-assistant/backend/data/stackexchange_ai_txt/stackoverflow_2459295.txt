Invertible STFT and ISTFT in Python

Is there any general-purpose form of short-time Fourier transform with corresponding inverse transform built into SciPy or NumPy or whatever? There's the pyplot specgram function in matplotlib, which calls ax.specgram() , which calls mlab.specgram() , which calls _spectral_helper() : #The checks for if y is x are so that we can use the same function to #implement the core of psd(), csd(), and spectrogram() without doing #extra calculations. We return the unaveraged Pxy, freqs, and t. but This is a helper function that implements the commonality between the 204 #psd, csd, and spectrogram. It is NOT meant to be used outside of mlab I'm not sure if this can be used to do an STFT and ISTFT, though. Is there anything else, or should I translate something like these MATLAB functions ? I know how to write my own ad-hoc implementation; I'm just looking for something full-featured, which can handle different windowing functions (but has a sane default), is fully invertible with COLA windows ( istft(stft(x))==x ), tested by multiple people, no off-by-one errors, handles the ends and zero padding well, fast RFFT implementation for real input, etc.
