MPMoviePlayerViewController / MPMoviePlayerController will not play the same movie twice?

Steps to replicate: 1. Call playMovieAtURL. Use this url: ( http://nov8rixstorage.blob.core.windows.net/searchpad/tutorial_portrait.mov ) 2. Let the movie start then press Done. 3. Call playMovieAtURL again using the same URL. Result: MPMoviePlayerViewController animates in; flashes a few times; and closes with error in notification object. ("Server is not correctly configured.") This is very strange. Making things stranger; the movie player will not play anything again until the app is deleted from the device (simulator or iphone). Upon re-deployment it will play the movie perfectly once again; but alas on the second play it will repeat the above behavior. What am I doing wrong? Can anyone reproduce this? - (void) playMovieAtURL: (NSURL*) theURL { [theURL retain]; MPMoviePlayerViewController *mp = [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:theURL]; if (mp) { [self presentMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated:mp]; [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector: @selector(playbackDidFinish:) name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification object:mp.moviePlayer]; [mp release]; } [theURL release]; } -(void) playbackDidFinish:(NSNotification*)aNotification { MPMoviePlayerController *player = [aNotification object]; [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification object:player]; [player stop]; [self dismissMoviePlayerViewControllerAnimated]; } Edit: Can anyone replicate this? Anyone?
