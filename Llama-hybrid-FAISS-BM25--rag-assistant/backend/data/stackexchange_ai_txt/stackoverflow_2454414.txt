From the details you provided I agree the only way is to use if (despite the fact if is not recommended generally). Try this: location /forum/index.php { if ($arg_topic != "") { rewrite ^ /forum/vbseo301.php?action=thread&oldid=$arg_topic? break; } } I shall leave my previous answer as it might be of help for someone else. Simpler example to make sure this works I've put a simpler example to show this works. Here it is the Nginx configuration fragment: location /index.html { if ($arg_topic != '') { rewrite ^ /vv.html?t=$arg_topic? break; } ssi on; root /home/alaz; } location /vv.html { ssi on; root /home/alaz; } index.html contents: index topic: vv.html contents: vv topic: t: Now reload Nginx and point your browser to http://hostname/index.html at the first and http://hostname/index.html?topic=11 after that.
