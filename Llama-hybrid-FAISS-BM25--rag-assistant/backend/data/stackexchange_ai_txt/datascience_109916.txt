How are the confidence intervals of a model interpreted?

I am doing some work with R and after obtaining the confusion matrix I have obtained the following metrics corresponding to a logistic regression: Accuracy : 0.7763 95% CI : (0.6662, 0.864) No Information Rate : 0.5395 P-Value [Acc > NIR] : 1.629e-05 And it is not clear to me how CI would be interpreted. Maybe it would be that the Accuracy can take values between 0.666 and 0.864? What does it mean that the CI are so large? If someone could clarify it to me I would appreciate it. Best regards.
