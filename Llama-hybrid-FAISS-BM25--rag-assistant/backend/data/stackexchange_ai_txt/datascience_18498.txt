Machine Learning at its core is unsupervised learning. Its about making sense of unknown data. Unsupervised learning cropped up because, essentially many real world problems always have some priors associated with them. At its core, data mining is about determining making sense of data. Simple data (2D) can be plotted, but what about 10,000 dimensions (sure there are means there these days but they themselves have their cons)? How would you go about it? You dont have any labels, someone just gave you a million point dataset and asked you to give them a report, what do you do then? Would you pick up each sample and manually look at the values or would you like to use a tried and tested solution of partitioning it somehow and then looking at the classes? In a way you could say that unsupervised learning, although being the core, has these days become a pre-processor for its supervised counterpart.
