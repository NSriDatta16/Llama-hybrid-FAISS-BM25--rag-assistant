As long as your database schema is adequet, you should be able to do what in need in SQL and JasperReports. With PostgreSQL, you can do things like string manipulation , grouping, aggregate functions, etc. With JasperReports, you can manipulate your data with Java, use subreports, etc. The specific example can be done like this: Use this query to get the data, using only the part before the space ('Lead'): select split_part(measurement_type, ' ', 1), measurement_statistic_type, value Use a PivotTable in JasperReports - it would automatically aggregate the data the way you wanted it. There are also pure SQL ways to get this done. Note: Make sure you design your database schema to support your reporting needs (for example, instead of spliting measurenet_type , why not have two columns - measurement_name / measurement_id ?) You can't really aggregate stddev. The average of stddev is not the same as stddev of the entire population.
