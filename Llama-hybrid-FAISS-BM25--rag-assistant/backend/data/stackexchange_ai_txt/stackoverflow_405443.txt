See McIlroy's "Development of a Spelling List" at his pubs page . Classic old paper on spellchecking on a minicomputer, which constraints map surprisingly well onto the ones you listed. Detailed analysis of affix stripping and two different compression methods: Bloom filters and a related scheme Huffman-coding a sparse bitset; I'd go with Bloom filters probably in preference to the method he picked, which squeezes a few more kB out at significant cost in speed. ( Programming Pearls has a short chapter about this paper.) See also the methods used to store the lexicon in full-text search systems, e.g. Introduction to Information Retrieval . Unlike the above methods this has no false positives.
