I think the "Best" method is subjective. However, there's nothing wrong with the way you did it. It's how I would have done it. If you plan on providing updates, you could also look at ClickOnce (which is the "Publish" option you mentioned), but I like the way you did it better. With ClickOnce, you'd probably need to purchase a certificate from a CA and sign your code. If you fail to do this, then anyone who tries to use your app gets a scary security warning. They can bypass it, but it would discourage anyone who is not familiar with it.
