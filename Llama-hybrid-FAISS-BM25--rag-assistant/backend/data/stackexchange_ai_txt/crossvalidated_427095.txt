The partial likelihood ratio test is asymptotically $\chi^2_q$ as well, under conditions that guarantee consistency and asymptotic normality of the partial maximum likelihood estimators. This is a standard result in several textbooks. See for instance these lecture notes: https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~dzhang2/st745/chap6.pdf or the book ANDERSEN, P.K., Borgan, Ã˜., Gill, R.D., and Keiding, N., Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes , Springer, 1993.
