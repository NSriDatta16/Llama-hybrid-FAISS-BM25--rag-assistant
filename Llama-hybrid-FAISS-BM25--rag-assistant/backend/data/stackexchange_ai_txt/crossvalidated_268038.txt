Though there can be many more reasons but AFAIK p=2 is preferred because of the following reasons : Measure of similarity/dissimilarity : For p=2, the Euclidean norm gives a measure of similarity or dissimilarity between two vectors which can then further be used for getting a better insight about the data. More detailed answers on this can be found here . Regularization : L2 norm is used for regularization in machine learning and is preferred because of two reasons- 1) It is easily differentiable 2) With L2 regularization, the weights tends to reduce in proportional to weights. Hence L2 regularization penalizes the bigger weights more as compared to the smaller weights.
