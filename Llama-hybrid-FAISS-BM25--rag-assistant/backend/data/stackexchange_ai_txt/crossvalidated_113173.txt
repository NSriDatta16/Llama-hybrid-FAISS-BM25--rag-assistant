Principal component (PC) as a substitute for colinear covariates?

I am working on a spatial linear regression and I can tell there is collinearity between covariates. Can I use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) images instead of original covariates to estimate the dependent variable? I am assuming PC1=Variable 1, PC2=Variable 2, etc. Or are there any other methods to solve the collinearity problem?
