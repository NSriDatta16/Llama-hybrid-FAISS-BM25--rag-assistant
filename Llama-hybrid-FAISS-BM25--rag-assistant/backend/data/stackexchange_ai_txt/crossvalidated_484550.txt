It really depends on your problem! In the typical problem of using machine learning to determine if a tumor is malign: would you trust a model that would have a high number of false negatives? Probably in that case, you would prefer to have false positives. However, you would still need a very high accuracy: you wouldn't want to tell a patient they had cancer, when they didn't, maybe you would need an accuracy of 90/95% or higher. However, in some other model with other outputs, maybe you would prefer to have a higher rate of false negatives; in some models, you could even be satisfied with a lower accuracy. It all depends on your data, and most importantly, on your objective!
