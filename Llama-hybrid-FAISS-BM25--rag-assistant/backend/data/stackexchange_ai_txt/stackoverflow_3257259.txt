Heavily fragmented Indexes - SQL Server 2005

I recently inherited a poorly maintained production database with heavily fragmented indexes (most of the indexes with more than 80% fragmented). I requested downtime with my manager to perform Index rebuild, but unfortunately downtime is not allowed at the moment. If online Index reorganize too is not option, can I do the following? Restore a fresh production copy to a test instance Rebuild Indexes, update statistics Overwrite the prod database from test instance Apply transaction logs to get the database. Though the above method too requires downtime, but its relatively less. I wanted to know whether one can do this or I am just being stupid :) Please advise RK
