Do you intend to model $x_t$ as an ARIMAX process where the exogenous regressors are distributed lags of $x_t$? That sounds peculiar. Why not stick to either a pure ARIMA model or a pure distributed lag model for $x_t$? Yes, iterative prediction which you suggest in the last paragraph seems a reasonable solution given your setting. It is quite commonly used in ARIMA and VAR type of models, for example. Note that predicting 365 days ahead using iterative forecasting with ARIMA type of models may be quite disastrous; forecast errors will compound and get way out of hand. While the first few forecasts may be fine, do not expect high forecast accuracy beyond that; actually, some naive forecast (sample mean, last observed value or the like) will likely do better than iterated ARIMA for distant forecast horizons. Note also that functions arima or auto.arima with exogenous regressors implement regression with ARMA errors rather than the ARIMAX model; see more here . (I had some trouble reading your text, so let me know if I misunderstood something.)
