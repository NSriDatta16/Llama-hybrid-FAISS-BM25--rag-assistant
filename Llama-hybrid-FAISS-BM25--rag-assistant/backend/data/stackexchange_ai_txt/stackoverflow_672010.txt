Cloud Computing and SOA are both loosely-defined terms, and as you note there's a lot of overlap. However, I think that reasonable definitions for each would include features that don't intersect with the other. For example, I see no reason why a SOA application can't be provided on a single, earth-based (i.e., not Cloud :-) server. Conversely, network storage architectures may or may not use SOA under the hood, but they would not be the first thing that comes to mind when SOA is discussed.
