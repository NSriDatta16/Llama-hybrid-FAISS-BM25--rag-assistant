gmm (Generalized Method of Moment) versus pgmm (Generalized Method of Moment for Panel Data) in R programming

I would like to know when I should apply gmm (generalized method of moment from 'gmm' package) or pgmm (generalized method of moment from 'plm' package) in R programming for each of the following case: 1.My data is panel data that there are several different firm names (or IDs) with several time varying variables. I also have lags for the variables as well. --> In this case, it is obvious to use pgmm 2.My data is panel data that there are several different firm names (or IDs) with several time varying variables. I also have lags for the variables as well. However, I do not have any lags at all in any of my variables. --> I tried using pgmm but seems like it is not working because I do not have any lags in my model at all. 3.My data is time series data with only one firm with several time varying variables. I also have lags for the variables as well. --> I tried using pgmm but seems like not working because I do not have any difference in firm names or IDs. --> So I tried gmm instead but gmm does not seem to take lags at all. 4.My data is time series data with only one firm with several time varying variables. I do not have lags at all in the variables. --> This may be obvious to use gmm but would like to check whether I can also use pgmm. May I get answers for the above four questions? Any help will be appreciated!
