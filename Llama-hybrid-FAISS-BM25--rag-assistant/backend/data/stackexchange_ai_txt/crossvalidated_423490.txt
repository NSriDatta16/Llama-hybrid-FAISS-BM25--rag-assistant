Clustering won't help you much there, because what patterns would it find, and how would you use them? You better approach it with some math. A gap early on means you'll need to do everything below about 9 times. A digit early on means you'll need to consider only one option. A gap in the last cell likely is cheap - 8 of the 9 options can easily be ruled out. Now on average it won't be 9:1 in cost difference, but you could experimentally or empirically assign a cost factor to gaps. Then check which ordering has the largest cost. If you consider your data to be 81 points of (x,y) where x = order positions 1 to 81 and y=1 if a gap, and 0 if filled, you could easily train a predictive model of the form sum(a x y)+c to estimate your cost at least to de degree of predicting which order is best. In addition to the rotations, you'll also need to consider the flipped versions, with rows and columns swapped! And in fact, you may also permute rows and columns within each group of 3 and the three groups. So there is likely 6*6*6*6*2 equivalent versions of the same sudoku, not just 4. On a more advanced level - can't you reorder the cells arbitrarily in your processing order? Put all filled cells first, then order the gaps by the number of filled neighbors they have (row+column+block) descending.
