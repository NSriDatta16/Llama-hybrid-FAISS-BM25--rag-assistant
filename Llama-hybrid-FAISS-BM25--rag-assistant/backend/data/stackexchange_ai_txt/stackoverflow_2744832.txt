I don't know JavaScript, so I can't help you with the DOM. I agree 100% that it's a bad idea to try and parse XML with regex. There might be a quick, very dirty, and very brittle workaround, though: If indentation is consistent throughout the file, and elements are always at the same level of indentation, you could use that fact as a guide for the regex. In your example /^ {2} ([^ /m (= two spaces after start-of-line) might just work. Use this at your own risk. Here be dragons etc.
