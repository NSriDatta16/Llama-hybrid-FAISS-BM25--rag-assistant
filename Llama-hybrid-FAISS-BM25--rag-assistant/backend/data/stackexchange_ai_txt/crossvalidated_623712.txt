From the description, I understand that there are a total of 45 participants; each participants practices 52 items in Training A and 52 items in Training B; you are interested in comparing the effect of Training A vs. the effect of Training B on the practice success of the participants. What I don't understand, is what "Success_trials" is supposed to describe; how the practice performance of each participant per item is measured; whether the participants were randomly sampled from some population of interest. This additional information would be needed for an answer to the question of what test can be applied. Still, some things can be said: Yes, the data violate the assumption of independence. Intuitively, you can see the problem arising from this violation by noting that, in theory, all the observations in "Success_trials" 0 to 3 could come from as few as 3 people (ceiling((57+22+66)/45)) in Training A and from as few as 13 people (ceiling((426 + 94 + 135)/45)) in Training B. You could of course still perform a statistical test, for example by using the approach you suggest and calculate the average success rate of each participant in both Training A and Training B and then perfom a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (as you have a pair of success rates for each participant in Training A and B). However, note that in the absence of random sampling of the study participants you are just drawing an inference on whether the effect of Training A is different from the effect of Training B in this particular group of people . In short, you are testing the null that there is no difference in effect between the two training regimes and that any differences your are observing are just the result of the natural variability within the 45 people practicing your items.
