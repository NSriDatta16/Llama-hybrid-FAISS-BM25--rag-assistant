No. For instance, long variables in Java are not atomic on 32-bit machines. In addition, there's a "thread caching" issue - unless your variable is volatile or inside synchronized block, another thread may not see the change to variable value. This is true for all types of variables, not just long. Read here: http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpj/jmm.html , especially "atomicity" and "visibility" paragraphs.
