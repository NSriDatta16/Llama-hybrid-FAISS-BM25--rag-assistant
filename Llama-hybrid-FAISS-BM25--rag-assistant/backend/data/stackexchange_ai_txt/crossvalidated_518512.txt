Pinheiro and Bates are comparing a logistic growth model to a linear combination of polynomials. Not a logistic regression. A logistic regression involves a single parameter p, which is then broken up into betas which are constants and are multiplied with x and all added together. That is a linear function. This logistic growth model has three parameters and the y is related to x (or t in this case) via a function that is nonlinear. Of course, in logistic regression or all GLMs, there is a brief detour of requiring a link function to make the relationship between y and x linear. So strictly speaking, some function of y equals XB, but most people focus on the beta and because that is linear, or, to put it another way, x is linear in the logit scale so they call logistic regression linear. So, in that sense, I think you’re right it is just a matter of semantics, but I don’t think this precludes what Pinheiro and Bates are talking about. If you read further down the book, they start talking about non-linear regression and again the expected value of y is equal to some non-linear function of x (equation 6.2 for example). Not y equals XB, or some function of y equals XB.
