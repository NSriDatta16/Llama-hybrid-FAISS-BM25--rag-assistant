Store the last run date, and whenever the system date is before that, expire the trial. The only fail-safe method is to validate the app against a service that you host, assuming no one cracked your connection code ;) As long as they can clear the registry value/isolated storage file/saved settings: they can just restart the trial. There's not much you can do about that. That's why people opt for reduced functionality in trial software, in addition to a time-based trial period.
