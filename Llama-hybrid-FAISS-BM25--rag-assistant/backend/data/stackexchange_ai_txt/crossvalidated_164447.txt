Treemapping is an information visualization method displaying hierarchical data by using nested rectangles. It has origins in mosaic plots (left) or Marimekko charts (right), adding nesting or embedding to the standard mosaic structure. The one you displayed is well-balanced, without elongated, skinny rectangles, that degrade the appearance of some treemaps generated by the "slice-and-dice" tiling algorithm . So it belongs to the subspecies of "squarified treemaps", that can be decorated with colors or shading in cushion treemaps. A description is given in Mark Bruls et al. (2000) Squarified Treemaps , Proceedings of the Joint EUROGRAPHICS and IEEE TCVG Symposium on Visualization in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, May 29â€“30, 2000. Apparently, the idea of squarifying, i. e. constraining rectangles to low aspect ratio, was already present in M. Zizi M. and M. Beaudouin-Lafon (1994).
