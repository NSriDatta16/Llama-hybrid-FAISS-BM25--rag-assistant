How to approximate (log-)likelihood from model specification using particle filters

In Calvet et al., "Robust Filtering" (JASA, 2015) , the authors obtain (pseudo?) maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a time series model of the trading volume of a futures contract. The model is specified by $$V_t = e^{x_t+\epsilon_t}, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(-\sigma^2_y/2,\sigma^2_y);$$ $$x_t = a + bx_{t-1} + \sigma_x|x_{t-1}|w_t, w \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1);$$ $$y_t = \log(V_t).$$ Here $V$ is trading volume, $x$ is the system state, and $y$ is the observation. The parameters to be estimated are $a$, $b$, $\sigma_x$, and $\sigma_y$. I am familiar with basic closed-form maximum likelihood estimation, but the likelihood is in this case not available in closed form. How can I go about approximating the likelihood to numerically estimate the parameters? The authors indicate that they employ the downhill simplex algorithm for the actual estimation (once the likelihood approximation has been computed), which I believe I could figure out how to use, but I struggle with the step of simulating a numerical approximation to the likelihood in the first place. Neither the paper nor the online appendix gives any more details about the simulation process itself. The paper is about particle filters, and the authors obtain different likelihoods for different particle filters. Below are their simulated likelihoods. My understanding is that these likelihoods are the result of simulations of the particle filter (state trajectories for each parameter value). But this simulation requires some parameter values to be run in the first place, so it seems circular. How these initial parameters are obtained is central to my question. Do they just start with random parameters and then compute the likelihoods in order to determine which parameters give a bitter fit? Wouldn't this introduce a dependence of the estimates on the initial conditions? Any hints as to how to obtain these likelihood approximations and the role played in the process by the particle filter would be much appreciated.
