First of all, you never "know" the distribution. You make assumptions about distributions. If people say things like "height follows normal distribution" they do not mean that there's some force in the universe that makes the height be exactly consistent with some made up mathematical function. They mean that they've chosen normal distribution as an approximation of the real distribution of height. Moreover, if you knew the distribution, then you'd be using Bayes classifier , "the best you can get", and wouldn't even need to use the data, you'd just make decisions based on the known distribution. If you use black-box machine learning models (say, random forest) then you don't really care about defining the distributions in mathematical terms. It makes a difference when you use statistical/machine learning models that are destined in terms of some distributions, i.e. they assume that your data follows some distribution, so if the assumption is not met, you don't have the guarantees that the authors gave for optimality of the results.
