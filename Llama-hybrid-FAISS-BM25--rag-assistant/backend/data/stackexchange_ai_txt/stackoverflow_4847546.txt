As you intimated in your post, this is not something that is possible with a vanilla installation of Magento. Having (attempted) to implement this feature repeatedly in the past, I can also say that it is highly complex and difficult to accomplish. Hopefully, one of those modules will work well for you. Ask to see a live customer site with the module installed to get an idea of whether it will work. If not, you will be in for a significant implementation effort. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
