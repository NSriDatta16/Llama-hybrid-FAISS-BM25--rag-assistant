Corrected: SQLite supports foreign key constraints, but they're off by default. You have to enable them at run time with this statement. (That means you can't set this once, and expect it to stick. If you forget to set it just once, you can delete rows from the parent and leave orphans in the child table.) sqlite> PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON; Details are at Enabling Foreign Key Support SQLite can be compiled with foreign key support entirely disabled. That's something to keep in mind.
