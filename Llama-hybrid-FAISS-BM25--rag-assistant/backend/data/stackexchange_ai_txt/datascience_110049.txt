Super Resolution GAN with different input image size

I am trying to train a Super Resolution GAN. Following some materials on the web I managed to train the first SRGAN model. To do that I took some high-resolution images (128x128 pixels) and downscale them to 32x32 to train the model. Once I finished the training of the model, I tested it using some new images that I didn't use for the training. Everything works fine if I used a 32x32 image, while the model does not work if I try to use a low-resolution image with a different shape with respect to 32 x32. Does anyone know if it is possible to use a model trained on a 32x32 low-resolution image to predict other images of arbitrary shape?
