bind multiple rows to a textbox for edit + update

I have created a Windows form using Visual C# - this contains a rich textbox. I have an Access database containing text in 2 cells (rows) of 1 column. What I want to be able to do is: Concatenate the contents of rows within my Access table Display the concatenated rows in the rich textbox on my form Be able to edit the contents of the rich textbox and save the changes back to the table So far I have bound the table to the rich textbox, though only 1 cell (row) is being displayed - the data that I will be concatenating is text, each cell in the table won't have a unique value - each cell simply holds a section of a paragraph. I have read the Update command & Retrieve command of ADO.Net, though it seems that data must have a specific value i.e. Select Name from People where value = Peter Is there a chance of me achieving what I want to achieve here?
