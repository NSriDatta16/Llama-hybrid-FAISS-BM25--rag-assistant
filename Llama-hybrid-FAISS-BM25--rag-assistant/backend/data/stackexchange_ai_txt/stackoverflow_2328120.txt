I think you are over looking the fact that nobody actually coded the output you see with a system like Google Buzz, or Gmail. They depend on a very very sophisticated system that have built on Python and C to compile the source and make it very friendly to there homegrown "push" system they have. I dont think you should be as concerned with the output as being multiple requests, I think that issue is totally secondary to being able to build and deploy your app. Later focus on plopping all your JS and CSS in the head, as this can be done pragmatically when you deploy.
