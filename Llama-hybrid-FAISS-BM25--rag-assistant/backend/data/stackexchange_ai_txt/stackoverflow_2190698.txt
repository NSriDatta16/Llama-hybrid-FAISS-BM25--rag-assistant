I think your requirements are pretty much mutually exclusive unless there's an obvious flaw of some kind (which is all profiling is really good for finding). Things that really change performance require a lot of effort, and your basic data structures are the most important thing. Reducing memory fragm., aligned memory management, SIMD, data structures that are small as possible and allocated all in one block as much as possible, multithreading, reducing code size from templates, redeclaring parameters as local variables so the optimizer can know they are same to optimize. None of those can be tacked on at the end without a lot of cost. Many times you can't even easily measure the things that really affect performance because they only become costly as the program runs or as its code size grows.
