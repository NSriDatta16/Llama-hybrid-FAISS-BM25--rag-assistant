Where can I learn web programming from start to mastery?

I tried doing tutorials but it is unorganized and unstructured, where can I learn PHP from beginner to master? I'm looking for a site like www.w3chools.com , but somehow I feel it is incomplete, specially when it comes to more advanced functions. I know some basics but I wouldn't be able to for example make a secure online webstore, and I seem to be stuck at this point, how / where should I proceed?
