Fetching Core Data entities, but not sub-entities

Say I have entities organized in a hierarchy with Parent being the root entity and Child being a subclass of Parent . I'd like to setup an NSArrayController to fetch only entities of Parent , but not Child . If you set the Entity Name of the array controller in Interface Builder to Parent , it fetches all Parent and Child entities. I originally tried setting the array controller's fetch predicate in Interface Builder to: entity.name == "Parent" This worked for an XML store, but when I switched to a SQLite store, it no longer worked. I get the following error: keypath entity.name not found in entity As a work around, I am setting up a filter predicate (with the same entity.name predicate as above) in my awakeFromNib to filter only Parent entities. Apparently, that predicate is valid once the entities are in memory, but you can't use it in a SQL-backed fetch predicate. Is there a way to fetch only Parent entities, but not Child entities using a fetch predicate that works with a SQLite store? It seems wasteful to pull in entities that you're only going to ignore with the filter predicate.
