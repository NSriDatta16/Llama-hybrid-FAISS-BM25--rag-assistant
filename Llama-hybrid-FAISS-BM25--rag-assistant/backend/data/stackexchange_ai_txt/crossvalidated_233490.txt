R random Forest: sampsize has too many elements

This is the exact error: Error in randomForest.default(m, y, ...) : sampsize has too many elements. Here is part of my code for classification (not regression) using compiled 3rd party data for prediction: library(randomForest) library(ROCR) table(train_hc$RESPONSE) 0 1 243697 6303 table(test_hc$RESPONSE) 0 1 243566 6434 Train & test were both created from the same randomly sorted file using different records. rfm_hc From what I found so far it was suggested that the issue is the dependent variable levels but what I included above shows there is only two levels and response is a factor. I also was using 500k each for train & test then changed this to 250k each. This didn't help. Any ideas?
