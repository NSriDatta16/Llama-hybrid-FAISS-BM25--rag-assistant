GlassFish 3.1 Netbeanz 7 and REST web services

I tried to run example here http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gipzz.html and didnt work... There is a bug at netbeans site but i couldnt understand what they are talking about. It seems that wadl file isnt created.... However a workaround for this was to use the servlet com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer and seems to work... Does anyone knows whats wrong ??
