Something watcom has in favor if your a 'haxxor' is the fact you can define out of the ordinary calling conventions using #pragma aux . Other than that, I see no reason to even attempt to use such a dated compiler unless you had horrible hardware restrictions. Imo, there are only 3 to worry about, GCC, ICC and MSVC
