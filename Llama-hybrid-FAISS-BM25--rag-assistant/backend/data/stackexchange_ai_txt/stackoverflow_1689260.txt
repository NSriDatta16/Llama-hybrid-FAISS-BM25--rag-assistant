Slider and Label/Textblock control interaction - WPF

I have a slider and a label control. The text is displayed in the label (few paragraphs). I need to show only 3 words at a time.Every 1 second, move to the next set of 3 words. The slider is used to select the number of words that can be seen at once. So a user can increase it to say 10 and now every 1 second, a set of 10 words need to be displayed. How would I achieve this behavior in WPF? I know I need to do some kind of databinding between the slider and a label, but not sure how to get the effect of (1) or (2). Any help is appreciated!
