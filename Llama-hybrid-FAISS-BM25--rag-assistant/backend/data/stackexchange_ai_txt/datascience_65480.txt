Train MAE is "generally" lower than Test MAE but not always. Now coming to your questions. Q1 Why does this happen? A1. Train MAE is generally lower than Test MAE because the model has already seen the training set during training. So its easier to score high accuracy on training set. Test set on the other hand is unseen so we generally expect Test MAE to be higher as it more difficult to perform well on unseen data. However, it is not always necessary for Train MAE to be lower than Test MAE. It might happen "by chance" that the test set is relatively easier (than the training set) for the model to score higher accuracy hence leading to lower Test MAE! Q2. Is this true only for DecisionTreeRegressor? A2. No, this plot is not specifical for DecisionTreeRegressor. If you notice that in my explanation I haven't made any assumption on the model! Q3. Is the graph incorrect? A3. No, the graph is not wrong. We speak of the general case of what we are expecting on an average. If you were to draw a graph only for a particular/current instance of the model running you can have Train MAE above Test MAE.
