I'm not sure which features in FP you would like a framework to utilize, but I think Yesod uses some features to great benefit. (Happstack does as well, but I'm just not as familiar with it.) Type-safe URLs eliminate an entire class of typo-generated bugs, plus automatically deal with input validation. Proper typing practically eliminates XSS attacks. Depending on the scope of data you're dealing with, using either STM or MVars for your storage needs make it easy to avoid race conditions and deadlocks in multi-threaded applications. I'm sure there's a lot more that I'm not thinking of, but I hope that makes the point. But perhaps what you're looking for is something like a continuation-based framework. I personally think they're a bad idea (I'm a believer in REST), but I suppose it might seem more "functional."
