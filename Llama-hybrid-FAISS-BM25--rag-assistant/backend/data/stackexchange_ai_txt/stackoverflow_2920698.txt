I want to create multiple thumbnails using GD library in php, which is better creating on the fly or creating physical one?

I want to create multiple thumbnails using GD library in php, and I already have a script to do this, the question is what is better for me .. is it better to create thumbnail on the fly? or create a physical file on my server each time I want a thumb?? and Why? Please, consider time consuming and storage capacity and other disadvantages for both
