Web or windows? Assume web, since you mention PHP. Budget or no budget? There are various web editors out there. Telerik makes a nice AJAX control, for example, that allows using AJAX to spell check. It is fully customizable. I am sure some of the other vendors (Infragistics, Synfusion, ComponentOne, etc) have similar editors. If you need to head to Open Source, there are editors out there. Not sure which support customization of lists, however. As the third party controls are relatively inexpensive (a few hundred dollars or less) and easy to customize (Telerik's is), I find it a better option to coding yourself or ending up with an open source implementation that is hard to customize. It is worth looking at open source, however.
