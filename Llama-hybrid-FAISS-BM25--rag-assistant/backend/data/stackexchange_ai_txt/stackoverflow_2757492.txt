Display using QtWebKit, whilst parsing xml

I wish to use QtWebKit to load a url for display, but, that's the easy part, I can do that. What I wish to do is record / log xml as I go. My attention here is to record and database certain details on the fly, by recording those details. My problem is, how to do this all on the fly, without requesting the same url from the server twice, once for the xml, and the second time to view the url. My hope here, is to implement a very fast way of recording set data as the user passes over it. Take for example, rather then have to type out details displayed by a website, I wish to have those details chucked into a database as I the user views the website. Now, I am using QtWebKit, and I have everything pretty much solved viewing wise. I have a loadUrl() routine which calls load(url) inside the qwebview.h The problem is, how do I piggyback xml parsing on top of this?
