WSS 2.0 - Creating SPSite with a user token

I am developing an application that uploads documents to sharepoint document library using the object model. My application runs as a windows service under the LocalSystem user. Here, while uploading I need to set the context to another user. I have the user name with me. In MOSS 2007 I have an option to specify the user token while initializing a SPSite object. I am looking out for a similar stuff for WSS 2.0 but couldn't find one. How can I set the user context for WSS 2.0? Please help. Thanks, Jagannath
