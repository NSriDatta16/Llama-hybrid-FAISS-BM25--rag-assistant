How can I effectively summarize and visualize time series of employee activities?

I am managing many people entering data into a database. I have a log of user, date, time, table, and action that each person makes: records For a non-trivial example, the actual records dataframe with 10,000 entries can be downloaded as an .Rdata file here , and then: load('records.Rdata') library(ggplot2) qplot(date, table, data = records, color = user, geom='jitter') How can I visualize, overall and for each table: the amount of time each person works per week the type and number or frequency of actions that they made. ?
