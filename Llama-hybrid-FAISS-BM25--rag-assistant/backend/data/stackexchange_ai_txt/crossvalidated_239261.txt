How are bayesian probabilities represented in a probability space?

Given that bayesian probabilites are updated over time, how is this represented in a probability space? More specifically, how do we interpret the probability measure of such a space? That is, presumably such a probability measure is not preserved over time, whereas in frequentist statistics this is assumed to be invariant, so is a bayesian probability measure 'time-varying'?
