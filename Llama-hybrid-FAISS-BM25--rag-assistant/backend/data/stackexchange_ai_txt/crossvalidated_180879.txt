There are occasions where you can use frequentist inferential methods as you have used when you are envisioning a possible repetition of the experiment somewhere. But for this case there is not repetition to envision nor possible error in estimates so I would not do a significance test and just report the existing small difference in the two proportions. The difference you have will be judged by most to not be very relevant. You might do better with a covariate-adjusted analysis where the covariate is the year in which the city was founded. With binary logistic regression you could estimate the odds of a UK name, holding age constant. You can compare that to the raw (marginal) odds ratio with the data already in hand.
