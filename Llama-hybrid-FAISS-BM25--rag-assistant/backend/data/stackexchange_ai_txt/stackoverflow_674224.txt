You could define your own class which stores the data in a 2d array which would be closer to sqrt(n) by sqrt(n). Then use an index function to determine the two indices of the array. This can be extended to more dimensions, as needed. The main problem you will run into is running out of RAM. If you approach this limit, you'll need to rethink your algorithm or consider external storage (ie a file or database).
