I initially answered using logistic regression, but there is little value over just doing pairwise comparisons, in my opinion. Assuming your experiment was designed so that users experience 1 of 3 variants (Red, Green, or control. If they are experiencing a third when the experiment was not designed to, then you have a different problem) then we can set this up as a logistic regression. Here might be some of the data you see. # A tibble: 3 x 3 version clicks total 1 _Control 389 3418 2 _Green 513 3289 3 _Red 468 3293 Using R's pairwise functions... pairwise.prop.test(d $clicks, d$ total) Pairwise comparisons using Pairwise comparison of proportions data: d $clicks out of d$ total 1 2 2 1.5e-06 - 3 0.0012 0.1227 P value adjustment method: holm So in this case, both versions do better as compared to the control (first column, both entries are 0.05).
