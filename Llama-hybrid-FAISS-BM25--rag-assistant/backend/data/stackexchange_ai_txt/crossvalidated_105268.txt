Instead of a bar chart, you could just plot all of your data points on an X,Y (scatter) plot to visually see if you have the kind of distribution you describe. You could also look at the mean and standard deviation of each time to see if they're similar. Once you've determined whether the spread is the same (or similar enough) for each time, you can use the average or max for each time stamp to decide if the procedure is random.
