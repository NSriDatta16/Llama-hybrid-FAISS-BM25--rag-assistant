How to interpret $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$?

I see $$ x \in \mathbb{R} ^n$$ in texts a lot for machine learning. Can someone give me a good interpretation of it? Specifically, is $n$ equal to the number of observations or number of predictors? And also, does it suggest that all values within $x$ are real?
