Two-Way Fixed Effects Model in R - Error - Multicollinearity

I am trying to build a two way fixed effects model (entity-specific and time-specific fixed effects). However, when I run the fixed effects code in R, I get the following error message: Error in solve.default(vcov(x)[names.coefs_wo_int, names.coefs_wo_int], : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 8.60051e-32 For context, this is my model using the plm package in R: model For some context, within my model, both log(sales) and log(price) are numerical variables, while product_cat and promo_type are categorical variables. It has come to my attention that the error I'm facing suggests that the matrix may not be invertible, possibly due to multicollinearity. Any suggestions on how can I solve the multicollinearity problem?
