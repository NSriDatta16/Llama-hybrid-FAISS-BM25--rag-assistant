HTML/jQuery: Semantically tagging glossary-enabled terms in body copy

All, I'm working on adding a glossary to an existing site. I'm planning to set up individual .html fragments with individual definitions, then use a jQuery Tooltip plugin attached to individual terms in the copy that will pull the .html fragment and render it. This avoids having to pre-load many definitions into each page's HTML (I don't have a server-side dynamic language at my disposal - long story - so this is the best way I've thought of to do this). My initial thought is to use tags around terms that have definitions, and then have jQuery attach the tooltip to each term. So my markup would remain very clean and simple: Lorem ipsum dolor amet This is nice because I am not using the dt/dl/dd tags anywhere else on the site, nor do I plan to. Is this a reasonable solution? Or is it incorrect to use a when it is not inside a ?
