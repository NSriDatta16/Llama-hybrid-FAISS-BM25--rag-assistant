UIScrollView has already implemented that behavior for you. If the user is quick enough to drag, your touchesBegan:withEvent: method will simply never be called. If, on the other hand, the user is slow and the scroll view forwards the touch to your UIImageView subclass, but then only realizes the user meant to scroll, it will call your custom class' -(void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event method. Just implement it, and you'll be notified of cancelled touches.
