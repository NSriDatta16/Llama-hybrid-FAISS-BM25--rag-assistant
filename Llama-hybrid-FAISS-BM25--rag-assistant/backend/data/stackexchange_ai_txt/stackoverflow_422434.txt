Most likely, the CSS file is not choking the site quite so much as trips to the server, complex calc, etc. might. But if it is: There's an art to writing a lightweight-but-effective css file system that is ever-evolving, to say the least. Effectively using classes and IDs to take advantage of the cascade, for example, can be tough, especially when the project evolves over time, or if the GUI writing it gets swapped out several times over the course of the lifecycle. For every legacy browser you have to support, it adds a performance hit, especially if you're using hacks to get it done. Those can be tricky, especially if layered upon one another. Conditional comments are similar - the browser has to decipher which rules it follows, and read through everything before it renders. Going full-size image when you could tile or set a color on a background is a drag on siteload, as well. (Gratuitous shot) IE can take a long time to misrender your styles and elements.
