Why is cross domain AJAX prevented *if* you have no intention of evaluating the response as a script?

Let's say I want to use AJAX to retrieve a json file from an untrusted different domain. I then parse the response as a javascript object without any script evaluation. (A cookie is not sent with my request.) I don't understand why the browser prevents me from doing this. I understand that if I were to evaluate the response as a script then that would be a security issue. I understand that there are work-arounds to achieve the above. Is there a reason that my specific scenario should be prevented, or has it just got accidentally caught up in the same-origin dragnet? Thanks. (assuming the server does not support CORS)
