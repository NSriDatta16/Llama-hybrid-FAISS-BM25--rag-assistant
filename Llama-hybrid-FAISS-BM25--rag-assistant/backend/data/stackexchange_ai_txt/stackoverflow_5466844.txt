Magento API returns dates in what timezone

I have been trying to find the answer to this for several hours... what timezone does the Magento API use? I am assuming that the Magento API returns all date values as GMT time because they do not append the timezone string at the end of the data. Is this correct? I am wanting to use filters and want to make sure that the dates are being correctly interpreted in my offsite client.
