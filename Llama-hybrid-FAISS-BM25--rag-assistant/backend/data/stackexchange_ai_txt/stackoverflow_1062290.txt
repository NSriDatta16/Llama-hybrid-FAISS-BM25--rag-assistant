Yes. And No. If you want multiple RC files you are going to have to leverage off the Operating systems support to have multiple resources in one file. In the resource editor, for each resource, you can set its locale AND the resource editor will allow you to have multiple resources with the same ID, as long as their locale is different. So, your first step would be to edit each of the RC files to ensure that the resources in one are English/US, another contains French etc. Next, get the main RC file to #include the others. Lastly, and this is the problem, you need to rely on the Operating systems logic to load the correct resources. If you are happy to let the locale of the PC determine what UI language is used you have done enough. If you want to provide a menu option allowing users to change languages: SetThreadLocale used to be an easy way to switch the Locale of loaded resources on the current thread. Since Windows 2000 some unfortunate overloaded usage of the API has caused MS to deprecate its usage in favor of requiring App Developers to always use FindResourceEx - which really doesn't help you if you want, for example, to load a string from a string table. If you really want an easy way to have a user selectable UI language, then you need to place each of your .rc files into a seperate dll. and then LoadLibrary on the appropriate language resource dll.
