Exercise in testing a difference of means

A random sample of 49 Kwakiutl native Americans reported that they went fishing an average of 68 days each year. Information from a non-native local population showed that they fished an average of 66 days per year (sd = 14). Do the Kwakiutls fish more than the non-Kwakiutls and if so is it a big difference?
