I would definitely use the Background Worker process. You can drag it onto your form and use the DoWork sub routine to actually do the work that is freezing your GUI thread. You can also use the ReportProgress event to actually provide progress back to your form. As for your question regarding two separate threads, If both steps take a long time to complete I would run them in the same thread one after the other. The one thing that could bite you with using the thread is cross-threading. In the context of your problem this means not having your second thread update form controls. A really good resource for how to implement this code along with dealing with cross-threading is this PDF . I also should point out that if you are using .net 1.0/1.1 you can still do the multi-threading, but don't have the luxary of having a background worker control. You'd just have to create a new thread from the System.Threading Namespace.
