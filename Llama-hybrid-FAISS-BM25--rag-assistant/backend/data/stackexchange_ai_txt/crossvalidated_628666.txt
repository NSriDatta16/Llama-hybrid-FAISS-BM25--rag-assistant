The OP hasn't made clear exactly what's being said to students to prompt the given pushback. But there's a linguistic wrinkle that I think has a chance trigger this: a statement like, "The average person has 1.5 children". Well, the average person isn't really a person . This is shorthand for, "The average number of children for all people is 1.5". If necessary, this bit of shorthand should be clarified; I think taken completely literally, as if it were a singular person instead of an average for many, it is legitimately a weird bit of specialized grammar.
