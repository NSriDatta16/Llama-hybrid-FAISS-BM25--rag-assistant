The Durbin-Watson test detects autocorrelation in residuals from a model - specifically, autocorrelation at lag 1. If your data are not sequential, such as time series, they cannot be autocorrelated, so the Durbin-Watson test would give you an answer to an irrelevant question. (Actually, without a sequential ordering in observations, you would not be able to calculate the test statistic in the first place.)
