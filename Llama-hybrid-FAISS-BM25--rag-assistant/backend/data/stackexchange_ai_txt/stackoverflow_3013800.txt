emma not generating reports but cobertura does?

basic reason to put the comparison question between these 2 is I am able to generate the reports in site directory(for cobertura ) after putting the following plug in information in build section of my pom. But same would not happening with emma . I checked documentation in codehause mojo its almost same for both. My configuration is : org.codehaus.mojo emma-maven-plugin 1.0-alpha-2 process-classes emma but it dont generate reports as expected in site directory but I can see coverage.em generated and classes instrumented every time. am I missing any configuration ?
