ALTER TABLE in Magento setup script without using SQL

Jonathon Day says "updates SHOULD NOT be in the form of SQL commands". I haven't come across any DDL or DML statments that cannot be executed via Magento's config structures. (In the question How can I migrate configuration changes from development to production environment? ) I would like to know how best to add/modify/remove a column or index to/from a table in this manner, but without relying on SQL? Is it even possible? Furthermore, what other actions can only be done in SQL?
