how bidirectional neural networks can be applied on time series while we do not know the future data?

I have read about bidirectional neural networks. It seems that they need input from both past and future. so lets say we are going to predict the energy use of one hour ahead having the energy use of last 168 hours as inputs to the network. So using bidirectional RNNs it also needs the future data, which is what we are going to predict! Can you please guide me about my confusion? Thanks
