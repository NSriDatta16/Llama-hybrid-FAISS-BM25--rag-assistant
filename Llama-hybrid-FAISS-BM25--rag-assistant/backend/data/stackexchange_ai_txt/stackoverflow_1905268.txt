Why are you guys over complicating this? It is really simple. The mapping looks like this: The model property looks like this: public virtual OrganizationTypes OrganizationType { get; set; } The Enum looks like this: public enum OrganizationTypes { NonProfit = 1, ForProfit = 2 } NHibernate will automatically figure it all out. Why type more than you need????
