If you remove the 2-room dummy variable, your reference category becomes "1 or 2 rooms". So you're essentially comparing 3 vs. 1+2, and 4 vs 1+2. However: your real question likely is "does the number of bedrooms have an effect on the outcome". To answer this, a better approach is to use a single variable (usually called categorical variable, or factor, although in your example it's ordinal), and use a multiple degree of freedom test (e.g. 3df F-test) to test this variable as a whole. If significant (e.g. see Fisher's LSD), you can then look further into the pairwise differences between levels (what you're doing with dummy variables). You also need to pay attention to multiple comparison issues that may result if you look for too many pairwise comparisons.
