Are interactions only useful in the context of regression?

I have always read the term interaction in the context of regression. Should we also consider interactions with different models e.g. knn or svm? If there are $50$, $100$ or even more features and lets say $1000$ observations what is the usual way to find useful interactions? Try all combinations? Or use only combinations which makes sense?
