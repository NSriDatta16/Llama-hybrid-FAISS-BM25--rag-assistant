3 categorical variables analysis

apologies if this question is obvious. I am trying to determine what type of analysis I should run for an observational study I am doing. The variables are sleep (sleep deprivation My group and I are wondering if a chi-square test with a 3x3 contingency table would be more appropriate, or a logistic regression. The point of this study is to see if the independent variables: sleep and physical activity levels, have an effect on T2D prevalence in people aged 65+ and if so which one has more of an effect. Thank you!
