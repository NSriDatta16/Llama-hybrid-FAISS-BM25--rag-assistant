The efficiency of a view depends in large part on the underlying tables. The view really is a just an organized an consistent way to look at query results. If the query used to form the view is good, and uses proper indexes on the underlying tables, then the view shouldn't negatively impact performance. In SQL Server you can also create materialized or indexed views (since SQL Server 2000), which increase speed somewhat.
