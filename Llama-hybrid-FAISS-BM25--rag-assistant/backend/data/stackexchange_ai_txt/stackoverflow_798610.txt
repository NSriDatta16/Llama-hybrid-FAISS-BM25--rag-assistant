Have you had a look at the great WiX Tutorial which has a UI page here ( archive )? As far as I remember, there UI sample which you can download from there has a bunch of UI dialogs in it. Not sure if it's the "complete" and ultimate list - but certainly quite a nice list, if I recall correctly. EDIT: really seems awfully hard to find a complete list of those dialogs! Hey Rob - if you read this - this would be a GREAT addition to your WiX Help file and FAQ on wix.sourceforge.net! I couldn't even find anything in the source at all...... But digging up some code I had, some time, I must have found a "WiXUI......wxi" fragment file, since I tweaked the list of dialogs to remove the "License agreement" dialog. Other than that, my list here should be complete, I think: Of course, the order in which these dialogs appear, is controlled by the "UI sequences" in your install. Marc
