Can someone explain Metropolis Hastings algorithm with simplest possible example?

I am just beginning to learn about Metropolis Hastings algorithm and MCMC techniques. I have a basic understanding of Markov chains and stationary distributions and need for the Metropolis Hasting but can someone really break down how MH works ? I believe some clear examples will really help me understand. Thanks !
