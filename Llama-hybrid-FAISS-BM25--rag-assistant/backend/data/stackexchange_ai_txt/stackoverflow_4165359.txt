Elegant way of doing table sync reports in Oracle?

So I have my two tables TABLE_A KEYA | VALUE 1 | 1.2 2 | 2.3 3 | 8.3 TABLE_B KEYB | VALUE 1 | 1.2 3 | 1.6 4 | 5.5 And I want to create a report of the sync status between these two tables. I.e. Generate for each record the following information: Record X is in TABLE_A but not in TABLE_B Record X is in TABLE_B but not in TABLE_A Record X is present in both tables but differs in VALUE (records synced won't appear in the report) I don't really need the text (actually, I don't want it). Could be just the values itself: [Table_A.KEYA (if present)]|[Table_A.Value (if present)]|[Table_B.KEYB (if present)]|[Table_B.Value (if present)] The given example tables should yield: |2|2.3| | | |3|8.3|3|1.6| | | |4|5.5| I'm currently doing that with longs series of joins and minuses all around, but figured that should be quite common for DBs and Oracle possibly have a more elegant (and possibly more efficient) way of doing it. Could anyone shoot some tips? Thanks a mil! f.
