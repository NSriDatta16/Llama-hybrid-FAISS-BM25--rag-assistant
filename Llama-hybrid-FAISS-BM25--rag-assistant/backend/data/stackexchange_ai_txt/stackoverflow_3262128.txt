Draggable - 'text' cursor is shown while dragging in Safari

$( ".myCss").draggable({ cursor: 'move', other settings...) Based on this code, draggable object should show 'move' cursor while dragging. In IE and FF it works perfectly; but in Safari, it shows 'text' cursor while dragging. Checked in safari 4.0.5 Any pointers?
