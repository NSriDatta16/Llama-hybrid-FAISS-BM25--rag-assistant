Paypal Standard option does not appear on the Checkout page

After I fill in all the information in the backend of my Magento 1.4.0.1 installation as described here , the Paypal option is not available on the One-Page-Checkout. Does anyone have an idea as to why this can be happening? Cache and Var have been emptied and I tried it on the standard and on my own theme. Kind regards, Avalon
