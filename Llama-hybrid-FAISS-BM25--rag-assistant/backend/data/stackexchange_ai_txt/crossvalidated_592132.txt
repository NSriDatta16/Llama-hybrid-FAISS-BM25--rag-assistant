Ways to increase forecast accuracy

Situation Our use case: demand forecasting for sales and operations planning monthly granularity, ~5 years worth of historical data available goal is to forecast future time windows of 1, 3 and 12 months forecasts are generated twice per month We have a time series forecasting system in place. It uses basic ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing techniques. Problem : The forecasts are deemed not accurate enough for the business stakeholders . We're currently evaluating different ways to improve forecast accuracy. (I'm not going into details around baseline accuracy, target accuracy etc here. At this point, we're looking for general approaches for improving accuracy that we could explore further) Current Approaches We're currently thinking along three dimensions: Tweaking the algorithms advanced non-ML methods: we plan to run tests using Auto ML or frameworks like Prophet , sktime to get an indication of how well more sophisticated algorithms perform use machine learning in general: we are thinking about using ML (regression trees, gradient boosting) which requires rewriting our preprocessing pipeline Enriching the data include external data (and use multivariate methods): There are a couple of hypotheses of macroeconomic time series that could inform demand forecasts. We'd have to acquire datasets and test those, however. preprocessing: we ran basic checks for outliers, missing values etc. our data seems pretty good. Maybe there are more elaborate preprocessing steps (smoothing, transforms etc.) that work well in practice Feasibility this is linked to point 1.: based on our algorithm review we might "verify" (in the loosest sense) that we can only forecast up to some level of accuracy and resort to e.g. only forecasting trends Question Which methods can be applied to increase forecast accuracy? Thanks!
