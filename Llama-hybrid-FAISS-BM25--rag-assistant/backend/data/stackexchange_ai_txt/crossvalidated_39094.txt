The beta distribution follows from the sufficient statistics $(\log(x), \log(1-x))$. Do those statistics make sense for your data? If you have so many zeros and ones, then it seems doubtful that they do, and you might consider not using a beta distribution at all. If you were to choose the sufficient statistic $x$ instead (over your bounded support), then I believe you end up with a truncated exponential distribution, and with $(x,x^2)$ a truncated normal distribution. I believe that both are easily estimated in a Bayesian way as they are both exponential families. This is a modification of the model as you were hoping.
