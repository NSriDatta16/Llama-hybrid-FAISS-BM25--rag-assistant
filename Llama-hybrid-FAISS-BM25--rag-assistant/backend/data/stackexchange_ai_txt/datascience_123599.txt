How to encode Income Type Ordinal Data into numbers?

I am doing a mini project on Credit card Approval Prediction. The Dataset I have taken is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction Problem: I want to encode this ordinal column: ord_col = ['Income Type', 'Education', 'Housing Type', 'Occupation Type'] new_data['Income Type'].value_counts() OP: Working 18819 Commercial associate 8490 Pensioner 6152 State servant 2985 Student 11 Name: Income Type, dtype: int64 new_data['Education'].value_counts() OP: Secondary / secondary special 24777 Higher education 9864 Incomplete higher 1410 Lower secondary 374 Academic degree 32 Name: Education, dtype: int64 new_data['Housing Type'].value_counts() House / apartment 32548 With parents 1776 Municipal apartment 1128 Rented apartment 575 Office apartment 262 Co-op apartment 168 Name: Housing Type, dtype: int64 new_data['Occupation Type'].value_counts() Unknown 11323 Laborers 6211 Core staff 3591 Sales staff 3485 Managers 3012 Drivers 2138 High skill tech staff 1383 Accountants 1241 Medicine staff 1207 Cooking staff 655 Security staff 592 Cleaning staff 551 Private service staff 344 Low-skill Laborers 175 Waiters/barmen staff 174 Secretaries 151 HR staff 85 Realty agents 79 IT staff 60 Name: Occupation Type, dtype: int64
