Non-trivial merge of two tables

There are two tables 1 and 2 with columns: Id: unique ; timestamp:long; money:double SOME RECORDS are missing in Table 1 and table2. Question: try to merge both tables together with the timestamps of table1 , and if the records is only in table 2 adjust the timestamp with average time difference between table 1 and table2. How do I solve this?
