For each variable obtained by PCA you have a loading vector (for example $v=(1,-2,5,5)$ this vector define your new variable as combination of the original ones. $x_1-2x_2+5x_3+5x_4$. You can define a new matrix where the variables are obtained as the linear combination defined by the loadings obtained with PCA. So for example $z_1=x_1-2x_2+5x_3+5x_4$.
