Spend a bit of money and get some sql storage. How much time have you spent working on fitting a crutch to a broken sounding system? If the project is worth doing then it's worth investing some cold hard cash. If a business is trying to force you down this route, explain why the option you have is not viable. If you suggested the option in the first place, grow a pair and explain why you were wrong, but this is how you can fix it. Sorry if that comes off as flippant.
