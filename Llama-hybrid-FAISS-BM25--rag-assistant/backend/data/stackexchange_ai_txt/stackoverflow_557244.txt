Most SOAP and RPC frameworks will set the HTTP status code of an error response to 500 . The Flash Player is not able to process the contents of an HTTP response whose status code is 500, so it can be difficult to work with. Unfortunately, there is no way to work around this problem in the player, so the most common approach seems to be to ensure that the server doesn't set the HTTP status of error responses to 500 for requests whose user agent is a Flash Player.
