Both Student's t-test and ANOVA work by evaluating the observed differences between means relative to the observed variation. In this case the ANOVA uses an average variation of all three groups, but the t-test uses only two groups. The two groups tested with the t-test have much lower variation than the third group and so the t-test yields a smaller p-value than the ANOVA. Reconciling the statistical and practical conclusions is usually not something that can be accomplished using the dichotomous interpretation of significant/not significant. Instead, consider the p-values as continuous indices of the strength of evidence in the data about the null hypothesis and statistical model. If the p-value from the primary F-test of the ANOVA is larger than 0.05 then the p-value from the t-test is probably not very small. In that case you do not have very strong evidence against the null hypotheses in either case. Unless you have enough information from outside the experiment in hand to make a reasoned argument that backs up any conclusion that you want to make, you probably should defer any firm conclusion. It's rarely a mistake to run the experiment again!
