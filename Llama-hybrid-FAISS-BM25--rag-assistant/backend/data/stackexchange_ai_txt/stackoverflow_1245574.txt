JailRoot for the DocumentRoot SafeMode ON to allow access to files only on specific directories Use a per USER MPM to limit system resources to the apache process Set safe php.ini settings for memmory limit and max_execution_time And as Saggi Malachi noted, this is very experimental, you have to monitor the actions on the server and have fallback szenarios, eg. cronjobs watching load average, if loadaverage is above threshold stop apache and sendmail. Other good idea is to compile your own php und deny access to php functions which could be "exploited" by your users.
