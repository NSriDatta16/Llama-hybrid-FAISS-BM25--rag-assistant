LightGBM and XGBoost use essentially the same type of model, namely boosting. Usually, boosting is „tree based“, meaning that (shallow) regression/classification trees are fitted successively to the residual (see here and here for some posts on boosting). Tree based models are often „bad“ in incorporating (linear) time trends. They tend to „ignore“ or misinterprete time trends encoded as „dummy“. Adding time trends as integers (t=1, 2, 3) may work (as a monotonic increasing value). However, truly linear trends are usually well recognized by linear models. So combining (stacking) linear models and (tree based) boosting could be an option. Having a „window“ of BP would be essentially the same thing as a lag (so add BP of last period and of period before that etc.). This should work well also with (tree based) boosting. So you have BP as a feature plus (in addition) several features of lagged BP. I suggest to try this in boosting and compare it to a linear model. However, one or two „lagged“ BP values should do it, I guess.
