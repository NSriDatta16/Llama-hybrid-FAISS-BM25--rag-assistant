Detrending a series that moves about zero

How can I avoid my de-trending model from blowing up? Do I need an additive model rather than a multiplicative model? If so, is there anything I would consequently need to take into account? Can I simply identify series close to zero and add a constant? I have a series which moves about zero. Below is the series with an $S_{12\times 2}$ weighted moving average: The problem occurs when I divide the series by it's trend to de-trend the data. I get the following because the original dataset ~0 at February 2012: If I simply add 50 to the original series I get a decent result:
