How do you know your code is not leaking anything unless you have run with ReportMemoryLeaksOnShutdown := True or FastMM4 in FullDebugMode to catch ALL memoryleaks (your code and Delphi libraries)? Running your app in FullDebugMode would also give you the StackTrace of the unfreed memory allocations. You will probably find that, indeed, you are leaking the IdStack Critical Section. You may want to give a look at this CodeRage 2 session: Fighting Memory Leaks for Dummies . It mainly shows how to use FastMM to prevent/detect memory leaks in Delphi. Was for D2007 but still relevant for D2009.
