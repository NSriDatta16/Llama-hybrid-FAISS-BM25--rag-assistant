I fixed this by not using the wizard. Create a new WinForms app Manually add a DataSet by right-clicking the solution in the Solution Explorer Manually add a TableAdapter by double-clicking on the DataSet xsd file in the Solution Explorer, then right-clicking the blank area and choosing "Add-Table Adapter..." Connect to the DB Choose "Use existing stored procedures" Assign the required stored procedure and complete the wizard Manually add a report to the solution Double-click it, then go to "Data->Show Data Sources" Drag the required fields onto the report Put a Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.ReportViewer onto the main form Use the pop-out smart tasks triangle to associate the required report You can use the report wizard available under the smart tasks thing on the reportviewer control instead of steps 8 & 9 if you want to create tabular reports, etc.
