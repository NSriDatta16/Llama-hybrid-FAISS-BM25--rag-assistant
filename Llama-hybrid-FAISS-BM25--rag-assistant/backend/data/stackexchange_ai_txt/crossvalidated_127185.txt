An ordinary multiple linear regression would not apply here since your output variable is binary. I would recommend using Regularized Logistic Regression . L2 regularization will probably work in your case since you don't expect sparsity (all the variables ought to contribute something to the model). Any multiple regression model can handle an arbitrary number of features. The important point to consider is whether you have enough data to train it reliably and avoid over-fitting. If your website is just launching, you probably won't have enough data for a while. Regularization will help keep the model from overfitting early on. Just a note for the future: if you end up using this model to recommend matches, you'll be biasing your data from that point on. So down the road, you may want to take that into consideration.
