Is there (an automated) way to backup Hudson CI files?

Here at my company we have three Hudson CI servers with 100+ jobs configured. We are looking for an automated way to periodically backup job configurations and build history. Currently we have an ant script that we configure as a job but it's not easy to maintain and not elegant. Have any of you found a way to manage this?
