If you send it with plain-text email programs nearly always will convert a URL into a clickable link. Otherwise you can send an HTML email. How to organize your code: Smarty templates are also great for this. You can have a .tpl template that you pass in variables to, so your email templates are in their own files that have only the tags/fields needed. Then the PHP can pull in this content, parse it, and send the body as the email.
