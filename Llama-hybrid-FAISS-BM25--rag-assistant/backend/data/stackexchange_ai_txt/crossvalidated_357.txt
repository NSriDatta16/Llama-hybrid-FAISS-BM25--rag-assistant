You can't know whether there normality and that's why you have to make an assumption that's there. You can only prove the absence of normality with statistic tests. Even worse, when you work with real world data it's almost certain that there isn't true normality in your data. That means that your statistical test is always a bit biased. The question is whether you can live with it's bias. To do that you have to understand your data and the kind of normality that your statistical tool assumes. It's the reason why Frequentist tools are as subjective as Bayesian tools. You can't determine based on the data that it's normally distributed. You have to assume normality.
