Preparation for Career in Data Analysis Without College

I dropped out of college but am interested in a career in data analysis. Now I am self-studying approximately 10 hours per day. Browsing through job postings on Linkedin has allowed me to compose a rough curriculum. It would be of great help to me if you would either add a subject I have omitted or eliminate a subject that is not necessary for success in the market place. Curriculum (in 3-subject groupings): Group 1 Single-variable calculus Intro to python SQL Group 2 Multi-variable calculus/linear algebra Discrete math Data structures and algorithms Group 3 Calculus-based statistics and probability Hadoop stack Differential equations Group 4 Statistical learning/predictive modelling Python data analysis techniques/Statistical programming in R Fundamentals of machine learning All the while I plan to practice using any data sets I can find online. Will this be sufficient to land a job in data analysis? Of course I plan to learn far more than just this, but is this foundation solid enough to land an entry level data engineering/science position?
