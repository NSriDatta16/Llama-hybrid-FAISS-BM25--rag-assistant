Best model for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) prediction?

Some classes of problem are best solved by a specific class of machine learning model, due to the structure of the data (e.g. CNN's for computer vision tasks). Prediction of bacterial resistance/susceptibility to antimicrobials (from genotypic data) using Machine Learning methods is a problem that has started receiving interest in recent years. The following paper (from 2017) analysed the then current literature and found that: To date, there has not been a consensus about the optimal machine learning model to be used for AST genotypeâ€“phenotype prediction, as reflected by the diverse algorithms authors have implemented (Table 1). Machine learning: novel bioinformatics approaches for combating antimicrobial resistance Macesica, Polubriaginof, Tatonettib (2017) Has this changed in the past 2 years? Is there now a consensus about which models are most effective? References: Table 1 from paper:
