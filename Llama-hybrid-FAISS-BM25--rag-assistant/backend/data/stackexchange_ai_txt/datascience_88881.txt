Generative adversarial network error in training process

I'm trying to make GAN which will generate art from random noise. I rely on this article https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-modern-arts-using-generative-adversarial-network-gan-on-spell-39f67f83c7b4 First off i've created training_data.npy file. For this purpose i wrote simple script. import os import numpy as np from PIL import Image import sys args = sys.argv del args[0] if not args: print('Add at least 1 dir') sys.exit(0) for i in args: if i not in os.listdir(os.getcwd()): print(f"Can't find {i} here") sys.exit() IMAGE_SIZE = 128 IMAGE_CHANNELS = 3 training_data = [] print('resizing...') for dir in args: for filename in os.listdir(os.path.abspath(dir)): path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), dir, filename) image = Image.open(path).resize((IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE), Image.ANTIALIAS) training_data.append(np.asarray(image)) training_data = np.reshape( training_data, (-1, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_CHANNELS)) training_data = training_data / 127.5 - 1 print('saving file...') def get_name(): i = 1 while True: if f'training_data_{i}.npy' in os.getcwd(): i += 1 continue return f'training_data_{i}.npy' name = get_name() print(f'saving to file {name}') np.save(name, training_data) There are folders(which contain images) in my current directory After that i wrote code bellow for training model(this code locate in google colab, training_data.npy i also uploaded to google drive and use it in google colab) https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pLDdyRwQQe1SqYNUI8pwzgnOeUGrxnR6?usp=sharing If u click on link above, u'll see my error which i got. Please, help me to resolve it. Thank u. P.S 5 days ago i read this article carefully , and understood it. But now i've decided to just copy and paste the code from article and don't reread it again. Forgive me if i make some errors in the code.
