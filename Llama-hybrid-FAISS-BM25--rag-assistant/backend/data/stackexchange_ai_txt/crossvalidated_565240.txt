Yes. "Multivariable" is almost unnecessary as most statisticians would consider multinomial (aka polytomous) logistic regression to already signal that multiple predictors are being modeled. Note that multinomial regression is limited by the lowest frequency of Y, unlike the case where you are able to consider Y to be ordinal and hence use an ordinal regression model such as the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model.
