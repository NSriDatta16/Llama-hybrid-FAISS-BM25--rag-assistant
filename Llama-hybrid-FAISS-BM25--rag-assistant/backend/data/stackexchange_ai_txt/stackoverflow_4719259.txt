This might not be exactly what your looking for but you can detect iphone and ipad and ipod devices through CSS like this But I kno you need it through jQuery here is what you might do instead jQuery(document).ready(function(){ var deviceAgent = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); var agentID = deviceAgent.match(/(iphone|ipod|ipad)/); if (agentID) { // do something } else { //do this } }); the only problem is this code is not specific to iPhone, iPad, iPod and so on as far as the background-image Fixed doesn't work I know you know that makes sense why it doesn't but it sucks and I have not explored a solution for this
