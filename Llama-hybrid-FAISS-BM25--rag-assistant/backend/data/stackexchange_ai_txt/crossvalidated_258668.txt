Adding a third class {0 : i-dont-know} to a binary classification problem {+1,-1}

Ive been working one a gender recognition problem from dataset containing pictures features. Normally the problem is a binary classification, meaning the training contains labels -1 if it's a female and 1 if it's a male. X_train shape = 105600 rows ( people) for 128 columns (the features) Im using SVM classifier with scikit learn for the prediction, I want to add a third class, 0 , meaning the classifier simply don't know if it's a male or a female. How can this be done, if the training target does not contain this class, meaning the SVC is not gonna learn it from the train. Can you help me figure out how can this, be done ? Thank you very much.
