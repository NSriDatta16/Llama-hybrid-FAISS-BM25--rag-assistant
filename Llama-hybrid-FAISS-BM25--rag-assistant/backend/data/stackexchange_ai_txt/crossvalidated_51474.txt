Simple statistical features Means in each of the $d$ dimensions Standard deviations of the $d$ dimensions Skewness , Kurtosis and Higher order moments of the $d$ dimensions Maximum and Minimum values Time serie analysis related features The $d \times d-1$ Cross-Correlations between each dimension and the $d$ Auto-Correlations Orders of the autoregressive (AR), integrated (I) and moving average (MA) part of an estimated ARIMA model Parameters of the AR part Parameters of the MA part Frequency domain related features See Morchen03 for a study of energy preserving features on DFT and DWT frequencies of the $k$ peaks in amplitude in the DFTs for the detrended $d$ dimensions $k$-quantiles of these DFTs
