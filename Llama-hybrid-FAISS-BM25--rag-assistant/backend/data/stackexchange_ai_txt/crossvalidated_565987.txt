One option would be calculating summary statistics (e.g. mean, min, max, autocorrelation of varying degrees etc.) from each time series for each feature and representing an object with a long set of features. Another option is to feed the multivariate time series into an LSTM-like architecture and train with the raw series. Although note that making LSTMs work with time series of different length is possible but may need special attention.
