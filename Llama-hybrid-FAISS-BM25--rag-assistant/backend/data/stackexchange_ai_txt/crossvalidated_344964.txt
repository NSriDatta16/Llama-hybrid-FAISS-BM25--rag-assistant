All is fine with your explanation. The 2x2 matrix with $\delta$ and $\rho$ terms are coefficients in front of the lagged series $\Delta Y_{t−i}$ and $\Delta X_{t−i}$. Without it, these lags would all have coefficient 1 in front of them. $\beta_0$ is needed if the stationary combination of the time series fluctuates around some constant that is not zero. When accounted for that by $\beta_0$, you can interpret negative and positive values of the ECT as negative and positive deviations from the equilibrium.
