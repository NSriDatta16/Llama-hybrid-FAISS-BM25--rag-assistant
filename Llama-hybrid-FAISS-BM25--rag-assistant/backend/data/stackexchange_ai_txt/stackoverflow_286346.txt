No. Functional programming will take us closer to proving compilers. That is compilers that prove more assertions about your code. The more compilers can prove for us, the closer software development comes to be engineering rather than art. A NLP programming language is probably more of a "do what I mean not what I say" style language. That is probably the opposite of the direction functional languages go. "All programming languages are converging towards LISP."
