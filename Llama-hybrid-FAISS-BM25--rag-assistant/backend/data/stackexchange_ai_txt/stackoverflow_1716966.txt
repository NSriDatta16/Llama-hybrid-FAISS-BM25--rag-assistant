If you were creating a windows thick client (winform/WPF) then yes a thread would work. ASP.NET is an entirely different beast. It does not have threading (at least in the html) and on the server threading is discouraged because of the possible side effects as the server scales. What you are trying to do can't be done with out of the box components. To do what you want you must use some sort of javascript. I would look at uploadify . It's simple, easy to use and fits your needs. If you need the server side code I can post it.
