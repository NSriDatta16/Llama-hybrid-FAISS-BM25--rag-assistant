Try the following. You may need to modify the date functions depending on your RDBMS. I have assumed MySQL, but the rest should be universal SQL. SELECT doctors.name, monthly.average, monthly.month FROM doctors JOIN ( SELECT AVG(cost), MONTH(visit_date) AS month FROM visits WHERE YEAR(visit_date) GROUP BY MONTH(visit_date) ) AS monthly ON doctors.id = visits.id_doc Note, this may only include months for doctors that have visits. So you may need to use IFNULL or COALESCE to clean up your output.
