To average growth rates the geometric mean seems appropriate. $G = (\prod_{i=1}^n x_i)^\frac{1}{n}$ For example, suppose the rate is .10, .02 and .20. Then the total growth is $1.1*1.02*1.2$ over 3 years, or the cube root of that product per year. $1.1*1.02*1.2 = 1.346$ and $1.346^\frac{1}{3} = 1.1104$ and, of course, cubing that gets back to 1.346.
