Linear regression: interpreting main effect in the presence of an interaction with a continuous variable

I have a classical multiple regression model: $y=b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_1x_2$ where $x_1$ is binary and $x_2$ is continuous and mean-centered. My question is about the interpretation of the estimate $b_1$ . As far as I understand from multiple sources, the interpretation of $b_1$ in the presence of an interaction is as a conditional effect for $x_2=0$ . That is, $b_1$ corresponds to the effect of a one-unit change of $x_1$ on $y$ when $x_2$ is absent, i.e. $0$ . In my case with a continuous $x_2$ though there is not a single sample in which $x_2=0$ . Nevertheless, I have a highly plausible main effect for $x_1$ . However, it seems it doesn't make sense to say that $b_1$ corresponds to the effect of a one-unit change of $x_1$ on $y$ when $x_2=0$ , since $x_2$ is never zero. How can I interpret $b_1$ in this case? And does the fact that " $b_1$ can only be interpreted conditional on $x_2=0$ " mean that $b_1$ is effectively only estimated on samples in which $x_2$ is zero? (Which in this case would be zero samples, i.e. clearly non-sensical). I'm confused. Edit: I thought that mean-centering $x_2$ only ensures that the interpretation of $b_1$ is conditional on $x_2$ being at its average value, which may be more meaningful than conditioning on the original zero point of $x_2$ . However, this post seems to suggest that mean-centering $x_2$ actually achieves that $b_1$ is the average effect of $x_1$ over all possible values of $x_2$ . This may be relevant for my question.
