How to get parent node in Stanford's JavaNLP?

Suppose I have such chunk of a sentence: (NP (NP (DT A) (JJ single) (NN page)) (PP (IN in) (NP (DT a) (NN wiki) (NN website)))) At a certain moment of time I have a reference to (JJ single) and I want to get the NP node binding A single page . If I get it right, that NP is the parent of the node, A and page are its siblings and it has no children (?). When I try to use the .parent() method of a tree, I always get null. The API says that's because the implementation doesn't know how to determine the parent node. Another method of interest is .ancestor(int height, Tree root) , but I don't know how to get the root of the node. In both cases, since the parser knows how to indent and group trees, it must know the "parent" tree, right? How can I get it? Thanks
