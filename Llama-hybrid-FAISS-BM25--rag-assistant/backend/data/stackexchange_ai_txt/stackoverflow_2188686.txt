Is using fieldset and labels in XHTML discouraged?

I heard there was fundamental lack of web-browser comprehension of those, and often IE6,7, opera would flounder trying to display them. Is that indeed true? Should those be avoided? And while we're at it, do they have a specific advantage when using forms? (except for the impeccably square frame around)
