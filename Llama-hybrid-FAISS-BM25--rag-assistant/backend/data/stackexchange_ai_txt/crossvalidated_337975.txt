Softmax dealing with non present classes

Is it okey to assume that, if I have trained my neural network for image classification using k classes using a Softmax output function, whenever I feed an image that does not belong to any of the k classes used for training, the output of the Softmax will be the highest for the class that the network believes this new input is most similar to? Or how that would work? Isn't it a big disadvantage of the Softmax function when used for classification purposes (edited) ?
