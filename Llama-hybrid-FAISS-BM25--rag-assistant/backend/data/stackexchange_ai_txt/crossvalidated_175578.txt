VAR Stability - Lag Order Selection

I followed this excellent tutorial on the implementation of Granger causality: http://davegiles.blogspot.de/2011/04/testing-for-granger-causality.html and applied the method with an R script. My date is monthly data with 48 observations. The time series can be identified as constant and trend. The information criteria of my VAR model suggest: VARselect(data,lag.max=12, type="both") AIC(n) HQ(n) SC(n) FPE(n) 12 12 12 12 When testing for residuals , it appears lag=12 is actually not a good idea. All lags from 8-12 seem to be serial correlated: Portmanteau Test (asymptotic) Vlag.1 As I understand the results, lag = 7 (p-value = 0.557), is different enough from the critical 5% level to avoid serial correlation problems. Now, we have a look at dynamic stability with Inverse Roots of AR characteristic polynomial (if roots(Vlag.1)[[1]] [1] 0.3436322 roots(Vlag.1)[[2]] [1] 0.08627817 roots(Vlag.2)[[1]] [1] 0.5973787 roots(Vlag.2)[[2]] [1] 0.5973787 roots(Vlag.3)[[1]] [1] 0.6117323 roots(Vlag.3)[[2]] [1] 0.6117323 roots(Vlag.4)[[1]] [1] 0.8245237 roots(Vlag.4)[[2]] [1] 0.8245237 roots(Vlag.5)[[1]] [1] 0.9154875 roots(Vlag.5)[[2]] [1] 0.9154875 roots(Vlag.6)[[1]] [1] 0.972209 roots(Vlag.6)[[2]] [1] 0.972209 roots(Vlag.7)[[1]] [1] 0.9501737 roots(Vlag.7)[[2]] [1] 0.9501737 roots(Vlag.8)[[1]] [1] 1.018177 roots(Vlag.8)[[2]] [1] 1.018177 roots(Vlag.9)[[1]] [1] 1.039217 roots(Vlag.9)[[2]] [1] 1.039217 roots(Vlag.10)[[1]] [1] 1.039219 roots(Vlag.10)[[2]] [1] 1.039219 roots(Vlag.11)[[1]] [1] 1.072194 roots(Vlag.11)[[2]] [1] 1.072194 roots(Vlag.12)[[1]] [1] 1.261509 roots(Vlag.12)[[2]] [1] 1.261509 It seems that lag = 7 is the first stable value. Is it okay to go with lag 7 then or do I have to choose a lower lag? I do know that the lag order selection will have consequences for my following Granger causality analysis and will either make or break the model.
