How can I allow a user to drag content in a layer below the top layer?

I have a need to allow users to drag content that is behind other layers or visible through the transparent part of a layer. Here's the best way I can describe it: JSFiddle Example In the example, I want to be able to drag layer 2 around in between layers 1 and 3. I'm not sure this is even possible. It's easy enough to make all of the layers draggable, but I need layers 1 and 3 to stay still while a user positions layer 2.
