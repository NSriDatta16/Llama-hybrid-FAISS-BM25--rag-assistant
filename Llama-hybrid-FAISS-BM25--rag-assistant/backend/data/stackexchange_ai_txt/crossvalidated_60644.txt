Only the nature of your data and your question of interest can tell you which of these regressions are best for your situation. So there are no tests that will tell you which one of these methods is the best for you. (Click on the links of the regression methods below to see some worked examples in SPSS.) If you have a binary outcome (e.g. death/alive, sick/healthy, 1/0), then logistic regression is appropriate. If your outcomes are discrete counts, then Poisson regression or negative binomial regression can be used. Remember that the Poisson distribution assumes that the mean and variance are the same. Sometimes, your data show extra variation that is greater than the mean. This situation is called overdispersion and negative binomial regression is more flexible in that regard than Poisson regression (you could still use Poisson regression in that case but the standard errors could be biased). The negative binomial distribution has one parameter more than the Poisson regression that adjusts the variance independently from the mean. In fact, the Poisson distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution.
