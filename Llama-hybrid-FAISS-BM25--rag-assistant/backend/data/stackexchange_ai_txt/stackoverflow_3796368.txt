I don't think that there is any path to a 'quick and easy understanding of an SVM.' The math is hard and trying to train one without a good understanding is a very quick trip to shooting yourself in the foot. OpenSVM from sourceforge is certainly sitting there. It shouldn't matter to you if it's in Java, just download a JDK. I can't answer your question as to the likely performance of a SVM training procedure in MatLab, perhaps someone else can.
