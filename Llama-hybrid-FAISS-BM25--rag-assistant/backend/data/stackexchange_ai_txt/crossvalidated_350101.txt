In regression analysis, the only was to use categorical variables as covariates is by splitting them up into binary categories (e.g., instead of one variable with universities as categories, multiple binary variables for each university). In R this can be very simply achieved by turning the categorical variable to a Factor : data |t|) (Intercept) 106.667 6.086 17.527 2.21e-06 *** universityb 53.333 8.607 6.197 0.000814 *** universityc -36.667 8.607 -4.260 0.005320 ** Remember, with dummy variables, the coefficients represent the difference between said category and the reference category. In this example, university B graduates, on average, make 53K more than graduates of university A (the reference category). Note that you can change the reference category using relevel function: data$university This will take care of the first step. However, with multiple categorical variables with many categories, this will quickly become cumbersome. You might be well served by trying to decide, empirically or theoretically, to clump categories together - Ivy League, STEM, Humanities etc.. This will become even more important in the final step. What you wish to do is create interaction terms. Interactions are a way of looking at the combined effect of the intersection of two (or more) variables (such as Layers from Stanford). Note, however, that having many interactions between all categories might soon become unwieldy - if you interact 20 categories with 20 categories you will end up with 361 interactions. Here, too, you can look at different interactions and using some logic choose several that make the most sense. In theory, if you do not care at all about legibility, you can use all interactions, but this will be overfitting and will likely kill significance.
