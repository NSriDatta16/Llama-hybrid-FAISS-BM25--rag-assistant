I had the same issue too: Here is the reason. The contrast method in play is treatment.contrast() . For categorical variables this method creates a dummy for each category So for animal_number there are two possible dummies Animal_number single - a dummy variable which is 0 if a case is not single and 1 for single cases Animal _number paired - a dummy which is 0 for paired cases and 1 for single cases The same happens for Treatment groups where Treatment control is a dummy equal to 1 for control group cases and 0 for exposed group Treatment exposed - a dummy equal to 0 for control group and 1 for exposed group For each factor the dummies are perfectly correlated so you must exclude either the intercept or one dummy for each factor.The default is to exclude the dummy for the first level. Which is single for animal number and control for Treatment. |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------| | Group. | Animal_number paired.| Treatment exposed.| Interaction| |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------| |Single control. | 0. | 0. | 0 | |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------| |Single exposed. | 0. | 1. | 0 | |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------| |Paired control. | 1. | 0. | 0 | |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------| |Paired exposed. | 1. | 1. | 1 | |----------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------| So as you can see the interaction has only 2 outcomes 0/1 The coefficient for the interaction is the average difference in log hazard ratio for the category =1 compared to the other 3 groups. for my case i decided to omit the main effects leaving the simple effects this way; coxph(Surv(time,status)~Animal_Number*Treatment- Animal_Number-Treatment,data=data)
