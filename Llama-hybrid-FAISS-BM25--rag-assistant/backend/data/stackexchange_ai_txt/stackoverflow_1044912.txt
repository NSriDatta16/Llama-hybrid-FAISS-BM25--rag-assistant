Depends who you ask. Some people like to put as much as possible in the model (validation, data retrieval, etc), and have the controller just poke it to get the data it needs, which it then hands over to the view. Think about it like this: if you have more than one controller accessing a single model, then shouldn't common things between them be in a common place (as long as that common thing actually has something to do with the model)?
