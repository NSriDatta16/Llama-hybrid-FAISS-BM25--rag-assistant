Using GLM to identify differences in abundance of individuals between years and sites

I have 5 samples of Ephemoptera abundance taken at four streams across a number of years (2012-2017), during the time series a flood occurred (2014). Samples at each stream were taken at the same sampling location in all years. Each stream has a different level of habitat complexity. Therefore the impact of a flood is expected to vary between streams. I want to identify if abundance varies between streams and years. I am interested to know if abundance varies between years at a given site in the study but also I am interested to know if abundance varies between sites in a given year. I believe this question is suitable for analysis using a GLM approach. I am working in r. The code for my initial glm is below. ephlm Using maximum liklihood estimation a normal distribution is found to fit the model residuals best. I believe there is potential for temporal autocorrelation at a given site. Running the autocorrelation function of the residuals of a model only containing year and a model containing year and site appears to support this. acf(residuals(ephlm)) acf(residuals(ephlm2)) I have two main questions: 1 - Is my study design suitable for glm (or do I need to consider applying a repeated measures approach)? 2 - Is there a way to add in a temporal autocorrelation factor into glm?
