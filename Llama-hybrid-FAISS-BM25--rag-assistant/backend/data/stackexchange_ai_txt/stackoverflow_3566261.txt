That looks perfectly fine under the C99 rules. Because stack.c is compiled with both an extern and inline declaration of the function, it will be defined with external linkage and can also be inlined within that file. Other files will have only the declaration, and so will link to the version with external linkage. Note that the function isn't allowed to define any modifiable objects with static storage duration, or reference any functions or global variables that aren't extern .
