(mysql, php) How to get auto_increment field value before inserting data?

I'm uploading image file to storage server. Before uploading I should compose filename, which contains AUTOINCREMENT VALUE in it (for example, 12345_filename.jpg). How could I get autoincrement value before inserting into DB? I see only one solution insert empty row get it's autoincrement value delete this row insert row with real data using autoincrement value from p.1 Is there any other solutions? Thank you
