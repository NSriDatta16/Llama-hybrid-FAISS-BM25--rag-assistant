How to compare two classifiers trained on different training sets?

I sampled a dataset A from the population D(e.g. a large cat-dog dataset). I first split A into training set 'A-train-1' and testing set 'A-test-1'. Then I trained a classifier 'X'(e.g. random forest) on A-train-1 and tested it on A-test-1. This gave me the test score 'score-X-A'. A few days later, I want to train another classifier Y(e.g. LeNet model). This time I forgot that I have split A so I split it again into 'A-train-2' and 'A-test-2'. I trained Y on A-train-2 and test on A-test-2. This gives me the testing score 'score-Y-A' Note that the train-test-2 dataset pairs are different from train-test-1. They may have different split ratio, different elements in training set and testing set since the random seed is not fixed when I split them. Now the question is how to compare the classification ability of X and Y. I guess it is not a good idea to directly compare score-X-A and score-Y-A since these scores are from different testing set . What should I do? Can I resample another testing set 'Test-B' from population D ,which doesn't have overlap with A? Then I test X and Y on this Test-B and compare them based on the new scores? Or is there any other better, more valid method? Thank you!
