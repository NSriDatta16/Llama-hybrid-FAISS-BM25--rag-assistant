I am using unfuddle and it is working for me. Unfuddle Unfuddle is a secure, hosted project management solution for software development teams. We know that you don't have time to get a server up and running and then configure and secure code repositories, ticketing systems and valuable project management tools. Here are some features: Projects Work on many different projects and manage each of them from within a single Unfuddle account. Each project has its own set of tickets, milestones, messages and notebooks. The Dashboard The Dashboard is the hub of information for a project. In just a glance, you and your team can easily see any recent changes to the source, messages, tickets and any upcoming or late milestones. Tickets Unfuddle tickets help your project to stay organized. Prioritize, comment upon and then assign your tickets to your team members. Painless Subversion and Git Hosting Exactly what you would expect: Unlimited Subversion and Git repositories for each project in your account, with quick access to the project source code right from within your browser. Messages Messages are all about simple and effective communication. If your team cannot communicate well your project will suffer. People & Permissions Unfuddle provides you with fine-grained control over what your team can do.
