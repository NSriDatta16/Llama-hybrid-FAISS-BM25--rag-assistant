You need at least: Javascript enabled on the client site (and figure out a nice degrade if it isn't) A second request (the first request is done and over when javascript is called to action, you cannot get anything from it with the PHP building the page). A feasible would be to default to a dimension of your choice, use that as a base, and define a function on document.onload to possibly alter your default in javascript alone, unless javascript has already determined the user-agents dimension and you remembered them in a session or similar. When you have determined the dimension your default output may alter.
