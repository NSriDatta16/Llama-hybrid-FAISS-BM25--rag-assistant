You are using (stochastic) gradient descent. For that to work properly, the learning rate (step size) must be set correctly. I assume that the error lies there. Instead, you could try logistic regression via IRLS (see its definition ), compare also IRLS vs GD Or for the input you tested, you just found a bad local optimum.
