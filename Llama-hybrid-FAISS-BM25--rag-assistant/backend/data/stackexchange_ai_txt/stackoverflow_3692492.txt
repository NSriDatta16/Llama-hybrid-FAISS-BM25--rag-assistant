Never hardwire a path, particularly to external storage. Your path is wrong on many devices. Use Environment.getExternalStoragePath() to get the root of external storage (which may be /sdcard or /mnt/sdcard or something else). Be sure to create your subdirectory, using the File object you get back from Environment.getExternalStoragePath() . And, finally, don't just say "but its not working". We have no idea what "but its not working" means in your case. Without that information, it is very difficult to help you.
