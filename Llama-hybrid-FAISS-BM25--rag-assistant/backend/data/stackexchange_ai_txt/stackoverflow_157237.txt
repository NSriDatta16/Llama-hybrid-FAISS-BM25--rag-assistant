Similar to a combination of jamesh's answers, we do this for web apps Supply a "report a bug" link so that users can report bugs even when they don't generate error screens. That link opens up a small dialog which in turn submits via Ajax to a processor on the server. The processor associates the submission to the script being reported on and its PID, so that we can find the right log files (we organize ours by script/pid), and then sends e-mail to our bug tracking system.
