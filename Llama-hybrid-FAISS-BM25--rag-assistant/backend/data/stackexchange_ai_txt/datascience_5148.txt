Can you elaborate what you mean by 'methodologies'? In the meantime, take a look at The Field Guide To Data Science by Booz Allen Hamilton. This guide talks about data science processes and frameworks. Data Science Design Patterns by Mosaic talks about, you guessed it, data science design patterns. This is quite useful to get a sense of common design patterns. They are also working on releasing a book on the same subject. Then there are several resources out there that will come up as results to more targeted searches, such as machine learning paradigms, recommender systems paradigms, etc. Data Science is a large and varied field, and you'll find many resources out there for each subsection of it. As far as I know, there isn't one book that covers it all.
