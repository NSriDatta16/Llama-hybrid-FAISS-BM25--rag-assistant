Well, in .NET at least, you can disallow reflection by using .NET permissions. Also, the purpose of visibility levels in classes and class members is not only the access security. It is also a means to organize and document your code: when you see a private member you know that it is not intended to be used outside the class, and while maybe you can use it via reflection, you will normally not do it as it can cause unexpected behavior in your application. Anyway I find this question sort of like "What's the purpose of doors having locks if I can smash them with a big enough hammer?" :-)
