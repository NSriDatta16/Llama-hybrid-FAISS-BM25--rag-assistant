Improving Login-Security through denial of Copy & Paste?

we have a common login form for an webapplication, nothing fancy, something like ... ... My co-worker argues that denying the user to copy & paste within the login form would improve the application security. I think otherwise because the password input is already protected by the browser itself (You cannot copy the password from the input element). However, we added the following JScripts to the input elements: ... onpaste="return false;" oncopy="return false;" ondrag="return false;" ondrop="return false;" ... A tester criticised that it is still possible to "drag" copy with the CRT key, of course it will only copy the * characters and not the password, but it still allowes to copy values from the form, and so the test case was returned as failed. So much for the background. My Question: Is there any security improvement at all from denying any kind of copy & paste within the login form that is worth the extra effort? Thanks you Simon
