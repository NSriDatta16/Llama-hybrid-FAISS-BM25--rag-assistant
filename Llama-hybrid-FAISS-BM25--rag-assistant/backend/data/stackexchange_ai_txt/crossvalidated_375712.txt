Calculating DIC from MCMC (gibbs) output

I just want to make sure my understanding of how we estimate DIC using MCMC output is correct, as the wikipedia page is somewhat confusing. Defining DIC by $$DIC = p_D + \bar{D}$$ with $$D(\theta) = -2 \log p(y|\theta) + C$$ $$p_D = \bar{D} - D(\bar{\theta})$$ I have a few questions about this: Firstly, as far as I can tell, the Wikipedia page never actually explicitly defines $\bar{D}$ , but I am guessing that it is the expected value of $D$ wrt $\theta$ ? ie $$\bar{D} = E_\theta [D(\theta)]$$ Is this correct? Secondly, $\bar{\theta}$ is defined as the "expectation of $\theta$ ". Does this mean we take $\bar{\theta}$ as our posterior estimate of $\theta$ , the posterior sample mean? As that would be our best estimate of the posterior expectation of $\theta$ . Thirdly, if indeed $\bar{D} = E_\theta [D(\theta)]$ , then given our posterior sample $$\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_n$$ Is $\bar{D}$ simply estimated by calculating $D(\theta_i)$ for each $\theta_i$ in our posterior sample, and then averaging them? Thanks in advance. I'm still new to Bayesian so even these simple ideas confuse me.
