First hint: If the data are random, it does not matter, on the average, which value you choose as pivot. The only way to actually improve the "quality" of the pivot is to take more (e.g. 3) indices and use the one with median value of these. Second hint: If you change the pivot value, you also need to change the pivot index. This is not named explicitly, but array[start] is swapped into the "middle" of the sorted subsequence at one point. You need to modify this line accordingly. If you take an index which is not at the edge of the subsequence, you need to swap it to the edge first, before the iteration. Third hint: The code you provided is excessively commented. You should be able to actually understand this implementation.
