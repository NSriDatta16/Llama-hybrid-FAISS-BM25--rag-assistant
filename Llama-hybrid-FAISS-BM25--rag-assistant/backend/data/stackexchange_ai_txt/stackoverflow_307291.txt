How does the Google "Did you mean?" Algorithm work?

I've been developing an internal website for a portfolio management tool. There is a lot of text data, company names etc. I've been really impressed with some search engines ability to very quickly respond to queries with "Did you mean: xxxx". I need to be able to intelligently take a user query and respond with not only raw search results but also with a "Did you mean?" response when there is a highly likely alternative answer etc [I'm developing in ASP.NET (VB - don't hold it against me! )] UPDATE: OK, how can I mimic this without the millions of 'unpaid users'? Generate typos for each 'known' or 'correct' term and perform lookups? Some other more elegant method?
