How can the DTW distance between two curves be asymmetric?

According to "Computing and Visualizing Dynamic Time Warping Alignments in R: The dtw package" by T. Giorgino , "the DTW distance is not in general symmetric". From how I understand this, if there is a query time series X and a reference time series Y, the DTW distance will not necessarily be the same if Y were the query time series and X were the reference. I'm confused. How can this be the case? And how should we interpret DTW distance given this asymmetry?
