Scheduling job in sql server mgmt studio to run for 'x' days in a month

How do I run a job in Sql Server Agent in (SQL Server Management Studio) for 'x' number of days in a month? eg: Every 1st.2nd and 3rd of every month The problem is I am not sure of these days! The user will specify the 'x' number of days! For instance, the user feels for the month of April he wants the job to be scheduled on 'x' days. Here x= 1st,2nd and 4th of April. And for the month May he feels to schedule on 'x' days. Here x= 7th,8th and 10th! Is it possible to schedule in such a way? Is there any script to schedule this???
