One idea would be to calculate the log-loss of the probabilities, relative to the outcome. If the log-loss is low, the probabilities closely match the outcome. Another idea would be to bin the probabilities into quartiles or deciles, and find the average probability and average outcome in each bin. Can you share the dataset? It seems very interesting. /edit: Here's some examples. First we load the data and the packages in R: library(Metrics) library(data.table) library(ggplot2) library(ROCR) dat Then we calculate area under the ROC Curve , to see how well the probabilities separate the classes: > auc(dat$outcome, dat$prob) [1] 0.9179451 This AUC is high, but not perfect. It also helps to plot the probability densities by class and the ROC curve itself: ggplot(dat, aes(x=prob, fill=factor(outcome))) + geom_density(alpha=.2) p Additionally, we can calculate log-loss, which measure how well the probabilities fit the logisitic function: > logLoss(dat$outcome, dat$prob) [1] 0.3187371 By this measure, the probabilities are pretty good. We can make a smoothed scatterplot of outcomes vs probabilities, which shows us that the probabilities follow a pretty straight line: ggplot(dat, aes(x=prob, y=outcome)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() This is why the logloss isn't closer to zero-- the probabilities follow a straight line, rather than a logistic curve. Finally, you can bin the probabilities, and look at the predicted vs actual rates. dat bins decile prob outcome 1: 1 0.0445977 0.04885057 2: 2 0.2684770 0.32471264 3: 3 0.4650000 0.44540230 4: 4 0.6441092 0.65229885 5: 5 0.7639943 0.75287356 6: 6 0.8855172 0.89942529 7: 7 0.9654310 0.96551724 8: 8 0.9896839 1.00000000 9: 9 0.9977874 1.00000000 10: 10 1.0000000 1.00000000 A plot of predicted (black) vs actual (red) shows that the predicted probabilities closely match the actual probabilities: ggplot(bins, aes(x=decile)) + geom_line(aes(y=prob), col='black') + geom_line(aes(y=outcome), col='red') I suspect that Civ IV players (myself included) tend to remember distinctly the few times a 97% or 98% battle goes the wrong way, which makes such losses seem more common than they actually are. In a long game, with many hundreds of battles, you are going to lose quiete a few times, even when the odds are 90%+ in your favor.
