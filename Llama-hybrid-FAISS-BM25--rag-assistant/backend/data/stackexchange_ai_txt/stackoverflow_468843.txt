Converting from a Html encoded string to a 'normal' Url

I have a url in an xml documnent which is encoded http://www.sample.com/test.asp?goto=HOTWIZ%26eapid=857 I would like to convert that into a Url in the outputed Html. I can output a link ok but i need the %26 to be converted to an & I assume i could use some sort of replace functionality in XSLT but I imagine there is a more elegant solution Cheers To clarify the intent, is should be two seperate parameters, the url is stored in an xml document so needs the url needs to be encoded
