Taxonomize the right way

I'm facing an organizational problem and thought maybe someone could enlighten me :) I'm working on a classifieds website using drupal and i just can't figure out how to seperate the posts published for each place. Imagine the website can be used by people from three cities. Chicago, Boston, Seattle The cities have the same sections : Cars, Furniture, Computers. What i want is to let the visitor choose his city first, from a select list for example. That will take him to : his_city.website.com Then he can either browse by sections and sub-sections or either create a new post I tried adding the cities as sections and then adding categories and sub-category but it doesn't feel right When creating a new post, all the cities and their categories/sub-categories appear and it can be really confusing for people. I went to see how they do on Craigslist and it's pretty much what i have in mind. http://city.language.website.com/main-section/category/sub-category How would you taxonomize this ? I thought maybe different drupal installations ( one for each city ) but is it possible to connect the databases to allow users to sign up without having to create multiple accounts on each city .. ? Anyway, any ideas are welcome Thank you very much p.s : Switching the website's language while keeping the same content is the big next question i'll be dealing with :)
