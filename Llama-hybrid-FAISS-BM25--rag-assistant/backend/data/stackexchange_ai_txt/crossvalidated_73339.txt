Logistic Regression with time slices

I'm using logistic regression to predict student retention in an online course. I have a data of student interactions within a web platform of an online course. The course spans 6 weeks, with new lecture resources and new assignments uploaded at the beginning of each week. The weekly assignments due at the end of each week. Students can watch lecture videos, view/write forum posts, and do assignments. Students can drop out of the course any time (i.e. no longer interacting within the course platform). Each week, I want to predict the likelihood of a student staying within the course in the next week ( stay in the next week=1, out in the next week=0 ). The predictors are the number of times the student watch the lecture videos ( video_views ), the number of posts the student read ( posts_read ), the number of posts the student wrote ( post_written ) and the student's score of this week assignment ( score ). I'm thinking of building 6 models using logistic regression, for each week. But I also want to make a connection between, say, week 6's model and week 5's model. Can such connection be shown if I use percentage of cumulative values for each predictors (e.g. cumulative number of assignment score out of total assignment score for the whole course) instead of weekly values? Should I just build a single model with the course week ( course_week ) as another predictor? This is my first time using logistic regression, and I'm not sure about putting a time variable in a logistic regression model.
