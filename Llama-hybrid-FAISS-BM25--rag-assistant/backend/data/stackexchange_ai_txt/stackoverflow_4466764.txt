Add or replace entity in Azure Table Storage

I'm working with Windows Azure Table Storage and have a simple requirement: add a new row, overwriting any existing row with that PartitionKey/RowKey. However, saving the changes always throws an exception, even if I pass in the ReplaceOnUpdate option: tableServiceContext.AddObject(TableName, entity); tableServiceContext.SaveChangesWithRetries(SaveChangesOptions.ReplaceOnUpdate); If the entity already exists it throws: System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequestException: An error occurred while processing this request. ---> System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceClientException: EntityAlreadyExists The specified entity already exists. Do I really have to manually query for the existing row first and call DeleteObject on it? That seems very slow. Surely there is a better way?
