Implementing Balanced Random Forest (BRF) in R using RandomForests

Hi I am developing a fraud prediction model. Because this is a highly unbalanced classification problem I have chosen to try to resolve it by Random Forests. Inspired by this article http://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/666.pdf I have chosen to try Balanced Random Forests. For now I am not sure how to implement these Forests in R. The article suggests that: For each iteration in random forest, draw a bootstrap sample from the minority class. Randomly draw the same number of cases, with replacement, from the majority class. Is this achieved by specifying these parameters? replace = TRUE strata = fraud.variable sampsize = c(x,x) where x is the size of samples to be drawn
