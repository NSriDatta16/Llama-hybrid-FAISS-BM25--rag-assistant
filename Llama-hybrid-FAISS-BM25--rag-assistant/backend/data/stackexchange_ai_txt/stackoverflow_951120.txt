send parameters from drop_receiving_element

users can be dragged to nodes to move or copy a user from one node to another node. I have a problem with how I send the variables to user move and copy methods in userscontrol. The drop zone is defined as: "users", :url => move_user_path(:id => node.id), :method => :put, :accept => "move_user" %> The draggable user in a node is defined as: _ " class="move_user" > true %> I also added to routes: map.resources :users, :member => { :move => :put, :copy => :put } The problem is that I don't know how to pass the user id and from node id. Since it's a put operation I only see the id (which is the target node id) defined in the url of drop_receiving_element. Thanks, Stijn
