You read something that appears to be incorrect. Per the Oracle 10g Release 2 documentation : The BLOB datatype stores unstructured binary large objects. BLOB objects can be thought of as bitstreams with no character set semantics. BLOB objects can store binary data up to (4 gigabytes -1) * (the value of the CHUNK parameter of LOB storage). If the tablespaces in your database are of standard block size, and if you have used the default value of the CHUNK parameter of LOB storage when creating a LOB column, then this is equivalent to (4 gigabytes - 1) * (database block size).
