This is it: ProjectandSolutionContextMenus.Project.OpenFolderInWindowsExplorer It works, but I'm sure how you get the solution selected first? Please let us know if you can solve it elegantly, I'm interested because I don't currently use AnhkSVN or VisualSVN, I prefer TortoiseSVN, but it would be nice to open the solution folder since that's normally the root.
