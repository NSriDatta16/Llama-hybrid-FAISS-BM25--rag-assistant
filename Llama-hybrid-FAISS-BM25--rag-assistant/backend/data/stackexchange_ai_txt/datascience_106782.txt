What are the mathematical topics that I need for Machine Learning & Data Science?

I would like to start studying ML & DS, but I feel I am a bit lost, so I don't really know what to study, what the prerequisites are, I mean I know I should study linear algebra, calculus, and statistics, but do not know the exact amount I need. I would be thankful if someone could provide me with a suitable roadmap to start, and an exact description of what I should do (What book to start with, whether to watch videos or read books .. etc)
