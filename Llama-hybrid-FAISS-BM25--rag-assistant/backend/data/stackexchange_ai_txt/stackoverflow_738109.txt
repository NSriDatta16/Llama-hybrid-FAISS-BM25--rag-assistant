There's one major detail that affects your decision: ...I would like to implement the same pattern for other projects that use int ids... Typically, IDs are generated in the database to enforce uniqueness . Now that you have GUIDs, you don't have to rely on the database to generate the value - GUIDs are guaranteed to be unique. Don't follow a pattern for the wrong reasons :) So go ahead and create GUID values in the constructor - just be sure to have a setter so that NHibernate can overwrite the value when it fetches an entity from the database. Additionally, you might want to consider using COMB GUIDs if your DBA is concerned GUIDs and database fragmentation.
