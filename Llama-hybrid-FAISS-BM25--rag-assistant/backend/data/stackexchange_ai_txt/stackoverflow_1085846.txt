You could just backup and restore using the standard SQL Server functions. That's what we do. We run a daily backup on the production server at 9 pm anyway. Then at 11 pm, we run a SQL Server Agent job on the test server which restores the last backup from the production server ("RESTORE DATABASE ..."). The only con is: you have to get used to the fact that all changes you make in the test database are away the next morning :-)
