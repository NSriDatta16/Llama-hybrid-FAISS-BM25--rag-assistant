Is it possible to force an error in an Integration Services data flow to demonstrate its rollback?

I have been tasked with demoing how Integration Services handles an error during a data flow to show that no data makes it into the destination. This is an existing package and I want to limit the code changes to the package as much as possible (since this is most likely a one time deal). The scenario that is trying to be understood is a "systemic" failure - the source file disappears midstream, or the file server loses power, etc. I know I can make this happen by having the Error Output of the source set to Failure and introducing bad data but I would like to do something lighter than that. I suppose I could add a Script Transform task and look for a certain value and throw an error but I was hoping someone has come up with something easier / more elegant. Thanks, Matt
