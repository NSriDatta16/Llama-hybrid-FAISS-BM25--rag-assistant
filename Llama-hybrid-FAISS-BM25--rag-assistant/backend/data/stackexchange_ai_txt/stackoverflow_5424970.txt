When you say "mail client", do you mean the real email client that uses ActiveSync, IMAP or POP access? Then you'd need to know if there is any information on each protocol that could simulate the User-Agent from HTTP, which unfortunately there is none on IMAP or POP3 AFAIK. Over Active-Sync, being HTTP, you have the User-Agent and can tweak the responses as you which - for example, first the device asks for a text version (e.g. the preview lines on the list view), and then asks for the whole mime version (possibly html). At this point the server can tweak the email mime and return an optimized version (e.g. tweak the markup, convert or resize attachments, etc.)
