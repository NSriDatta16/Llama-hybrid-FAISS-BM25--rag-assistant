Congratulations on getting the server to work on premises, that always seemed like too much hard work to me. As you've gone to all of that effort I'm presuming that it's to avoid paying for compute instances in the cloud while you develop or test. I apologise in advance that I'm not actually going to answer your question about how to speed up development storage. This is because development storage and I really just don't get along. It's pretty close to what you get from actual cloud storage, but the differences can be significant enough to cause problems if you develop against development storage then switch to the real thing. In short, I'd say just ignore dev storage and connect straight to the cloud even though you're running locally. This will have a cost associated with it, but in my experience the costs for storage are really quite small. $5 per month will go a long way.
