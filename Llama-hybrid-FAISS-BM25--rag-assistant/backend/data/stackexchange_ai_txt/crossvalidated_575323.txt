Using machine learning model trained on standardized data for real world low volume data

I have developed a machine learning model which has been trained on a preprocessed data by scaling and centering using h2o package of R. I am able to use this model for prediction of new datasets with a blueprint of the preprocessing methods. But if I make an API of my model and want someone to use it to predict outcome of his own single subject, (for example predict one of his patient's outcome), how is it possible to imply this on a single subject(according to not possbile scaling and centering).
