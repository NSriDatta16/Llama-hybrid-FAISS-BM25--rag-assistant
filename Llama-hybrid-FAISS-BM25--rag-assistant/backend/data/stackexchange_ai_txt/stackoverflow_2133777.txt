Are you sure the CASCADE DELETE is a good idea? If the organizer is being deleted, the event still ocurred (thinking about events in the past), so I think it is wrong to delete the associated event, from a data model point of view. Some social networks delete messages a certain user sent to you in the past, which I find extremely annoying, because they are deleting my data. Had the user sent an e-mail or, for that matter, even snail mail, I'd still have the message and the users name.
