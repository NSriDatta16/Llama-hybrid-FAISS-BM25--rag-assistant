Yes the numbers are feature dimensions. That's a common design for classification CNNs, decreasing the spatial dimensionality along the network to learn meaningful high-level features, while increasing the feature dimensionality to compensate for the loss of information. You can think of low-level features as letters. There are in total 26 possible letters, so the feature dimensions should be small in the beginning. High-level features are like words, which are combinations of low-level features (letters). In total there're thousands of commonly used words, so the feature dimensions should be large at the end. The set of high-level features should not be equal to all possible combinations of low-level features, because a string like "meiluanyong" won't be very helpful with processing English texts.
