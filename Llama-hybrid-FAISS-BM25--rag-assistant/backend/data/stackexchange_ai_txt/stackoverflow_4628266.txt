How to create a CPU, disk & memory performance index with C#

We need a custom performance index generated by a diagnostic dialog of our application written in C#. For: CPU Disk Memory This will give an approximation of what the current machine will be able to handle. The value doesn't have to be accurate, it's just an indication. One pragmatic method would be to do common operation the application do, with temporary files, and everything, but we want the routine to be used in different applications. Could you please propose me functions or references written in C# ? UPDATE : application run on windows servers and also still a lot of XP, so Vista & 7 Performance Index is not suitable.
