Should logistic regression models generated with and without cross validation in the caret.train function in R be the same?

I am working with the Titanic dataset and trying to use logistic regression in R to predict survival. The simple approach I tried was to just use the glm function with binomial family and logit link specified: f = as.formula("Survived_char ~ Pclass_char+Sex+mAgeD+SibSp+Title+FsizeD") logit The next approach was to use the train function in the caret package with cross validation: tc However, the two models have the same coefficients. Is that correct? I thought that k-fold cross validation would yield a model where the coefficients were averages of the k models developed. If the same model is generated with and without cross validation, what is the advantage of developing a model with the train function rather than using glm directly?
