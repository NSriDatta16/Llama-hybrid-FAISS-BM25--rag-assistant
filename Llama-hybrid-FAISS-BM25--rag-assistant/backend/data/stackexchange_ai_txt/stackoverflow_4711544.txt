PHP part in Python based website

I need to write a small addition to a Python+Django based website, hosted on Google Apps. Trouble is that I don't have any experience with Python. The addition is pretty straight forward, it requires little database access So thought of 2 possible solution's: Quickly dive into Python and get it done with Python. Run PHP on Quercus and write this particular addition in PHP, then somehow combine it into the website as a dingle PHP page. Edit: There is another option I thought of: Writing it in PHP and hosting it on an external server, embedding it in an iframe. The addition I am writing has no need to be SEO friendly, so an iframe will have no negative effect on the website. What do you suggest?
