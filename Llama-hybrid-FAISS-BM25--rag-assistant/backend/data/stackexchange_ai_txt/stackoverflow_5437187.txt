Answering my own question...though curious if anyone has something more elegant. I found this unsourced function using google: CREATE FUNCTION udf_bin_me (@IncomingNumber int) RETURNS varchar(200) as BEGIN DECLARE @BinNumber VARCHAR(200) SET @BinNumber = '' WHILE @IncomingNumber <> 0 BEGIN SET @BinNumber = SUBSTRING('0123456789', (@IncomingNumber % 2) + 1, 1) + @BinNumber SET @IncomingNumber = @IncomingNumber / 2 END RETURN @BinNumber END Then use the Ascii function to get the char to it's ascii decimal value: select dbo.udf_bin_me(ascii('>')) Seems to be a bit of a run around, but I can work from that. Better solution anyone?
