For a desktop app like yours, passing data as JSON does not make a lot of sense. Its main use is to allow for easier access from a web browser. Although they serve different purposes, the same could be said for REST. For two .NET apps communicating, WCF is the way to go, in my opinion. Though for many people ASMX more easily fits their way of thinking (just decorate something with a WebMethodAttribute and you're done) I would not recommend it because of the lack of decent authorization/authentication/encryption (pick any) and the way that its use doesn't seem to be encouraged much by Microsoft anymore. You could also have a look at WSCF - Web Services Contract First by the way. Unfortunately, now you have even more options to choose from. :)
