Force Application refresh on back button

I have a web app which pulls in information via ajax after the page loads. When a user leaves the page, then hits the 'back' button in their browser, they see the page as it looked on initial load. What I need to have happen is have all javascript run as if they hit the 'refresh' button. I have tried setting the Cache-Control and Pragma headers, but this didn't help. I know this is possible, as Google does it in many of their applications, such as gmail and google reader. Any ideas? Thanks!
