IIS 6 ASP.NET handlers not working in virtual application

I have a virtual directory (configured as an application). It will accept requests for all files that exist, but it will not call handlers (system.web/httpHandlers). Any ideas? this is the url that the application uses. http://www.datalineonline.com/SightMaxAgentInterface/chat.smgif?accountID=1&siteID=1&queueID=2
