DocumentStore As you can read in the docs , you can think of the DocumentStore as a database that stores your texts and meta data and provides them to the Retriever at query time. FAISSDocumentStore FAISSDocumentStore is internally composed of: a SQL database to store texts and metadata a FAISS index to store vectors I think this internal structure of FAISSDocumentStore is an implementation detail and you probably shouldn't care much about it... Integration with your data You can't directly use your private SQL database in the FAISSDocumentStore . Instead, I would consider the following steps (similar to this tutorial ): initialize a new FAISSDocumentStore loop over your source database and write texts in FAISSDocumentStore , calling document_store.write_documents method initialize a retriever, such as EmbeddingRetriever (also consisting of an encoder to represent documents as vectors) compute and store vectors for your texts, by calling document_store.update_embeddings(retriever) save your FAISSDocumentStore repeat whenever your data changes...
