How to change the allowed amout of allocated memory?

Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 40000 bytes) in /mounted-storage/home20a/sub001/sc20063-GJYD/[...] on line 62 It looks like the PHP-script only allowes me to allocate 32 MB to the memory? This was with an example image to test what would happen if a user tries to upload a huge picture. My question is: How can i predict that this will happen, and then alert the user that the image was too big instead of returning this error? Its a while since I tested it, but I think I tried both try-catch and @, but they both failed since this is a fatal error. The size of the example image is only 1 kB, so it won't work checking that value. I think I solved my own problem, I can check the $width and $height of the image, and then notify the user if the image is too big, but I have another question: How do I change the allowed amout of allocated memory? I assume that my users will try to post many high-resolutioned images. I have tried ini_set("memory_limit", $bignumber) , but it isn't working.
