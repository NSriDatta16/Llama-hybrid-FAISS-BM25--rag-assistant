Modal Tab Bar ViewController

I need to present a modal tab bar controller using interface builder. I'd like to be able to specify and design the tab bar controller in a InfoViewController.xib file, then present it from a variety of locations within the application using something like: UIViewController *vc = [InfoViewController create]; [self presentModalViewController:vc animated:YES]; I don't know how to setup the interface builder file. I can drag in a tab bar view controller, but it is not displayed when the view controller is presented. How should I link up this tab bar controller with the file owner?
