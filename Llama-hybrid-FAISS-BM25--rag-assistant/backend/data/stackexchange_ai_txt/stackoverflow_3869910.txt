C's IO and C++' IO share little besides the fact that they both do IO. While C's IO capabilities require programmers to pay very close attention to what they're doing to always match the formatting string with the actual parameters passed, or the code will invoke undefined behavior . C++' IO will do the right thing automatically for whatever types you throw at it. Besides the very few spots where IO performance really matters, I really don't see the point of using C's IO . (And, no, I don't count familiarity with the printf() formatting strings as a good reason to prefer an unsafe feature over safe one.) As for '\n' vs. std::endl : The latter is a convenient wrapper for . IME streams rarely ever need to get flushed, so you should use '\n' by default .
