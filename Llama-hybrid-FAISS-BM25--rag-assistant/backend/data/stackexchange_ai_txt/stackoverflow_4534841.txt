Since you are on Windows, I will say you should try DCE (Dolphin Community Edition), It has every thing (Including better integration with the OS than Pharo or Squeak, especially the GUI). The Professional Edition will take you one level up since it contains other extra get-in-the-flow tools plus the Delivery wizard to directly produce executables (in short EXEs). It's more than enough for learning Smalltalk. It includes a Help file (containing fast intro to Smalltalk, a comprehensive coverage of the environment, pattern usage, and a nice gui example). If you think you will stay for long on Windows (an environment issue, etc...) or as igouy said 'leverage your Windows experience', then by All means check DCE . As an extra I suggest you download it, check the intro to Smalltalk in the Help file and later on enjoy these videos: A Better Hello World Fun with MS Speech library (ActiveX wizard sample tutorial) Interfacing with iTunes Programming Animation with Dolphin (this shows the interactive nature of Smalltalk in general, still in Dolphin is integrated with Windows so you can play with Windows's windows and controls in an easy and thrilling way.) and by the way it's addictive! happy small talks with Dolphin Smalltalk ;)
