It’s fine. It just means that the model is unsure about the outcome for those values of the features. Given that both outcomes have happened for those feature values, the model should be uncertain about this. Depending on how you’ve done the modeling, this might be reflected in a predicted probability around $0.5$ , indicating a model that is unsure. While we like certain estimates, obtaining them might not be realistic. To draw an analogy to linear models, a basic ANOVA has a model with many distinct outcomes for each factor level and has no issue with this. If generalized linear models like logistic regression really are generalized linear models, they ought to be able to do this, too. (Indeed, the G-test and even the chi-squared test are examples of this.)
