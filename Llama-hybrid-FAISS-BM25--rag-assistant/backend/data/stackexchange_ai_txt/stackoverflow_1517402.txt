History tables provide a history of (generally non-temporal) changes made to the primary database records by users. This history is archival in nature (i.e. accessed occasionally for historical purposes). The temporal information (when the change was made) is secondary in nature. A temporal database is designed specifically to execute time queries against. The temporal information is primary in nature, and kept online for immediate retrieval. A second table is not created, unless archiving also needs to take place. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database
