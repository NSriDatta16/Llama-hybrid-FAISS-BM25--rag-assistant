R, if used correctly, should be fast. As mentioned in the comment, R is largely written in C and Fortran and is quite optimized. Make sure you are using the right data structures and leveraging the built in indexing/vector/matrix methods instead of too many loops. You may also want to compile your R code. Check this out for some useful tips: http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/4/25/faster-talk.html If you really know what your doing in R and it's still too slow, try switching to NumPy. NumPy's often faster than R, and much easier to do data analysis with than C. I can't recommend trying to write your own version of R in C.
