3-D random walk: average distance after N steps

I am calculating the average distance in a 3-D random walk process after N steps. Each step is one unit long and the angle is randomly distributed around the origin. After N steps, what is the average distance from the origin? The $X,Y,Z$ coordinates are determined by $Z=\cos(a),$ $X=\sin(a)\cos(b),$ and $Y=\sin(a)\sin(b).$ The angles $a$ and $b$ are distributed uniformly on $[0, 2\pi).$ I have simulated the process using 50,000 points. After 1 step, the average distance is 1. After 2 steps, the average distance is around 1.32. After 3 steps, the average distance is around 1.62. How could I calculate the equation showing the average distance from the origin after N steps?
