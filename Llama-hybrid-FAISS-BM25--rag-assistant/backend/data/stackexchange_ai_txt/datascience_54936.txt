Which clustering method is recommended to start with when all the variables are categorical

Which clustering method (k-means, Hierarchical, PCA etc) is recommended to start with when all the predictor variables (16 of them) are categorical, consisting of 3 to 7 levels. I’m assuming k-means most likely isn’t the preferred algorithm, leaving hierarchical or PCA. I just not that familiar with PCA to perform a cluster analysis.
