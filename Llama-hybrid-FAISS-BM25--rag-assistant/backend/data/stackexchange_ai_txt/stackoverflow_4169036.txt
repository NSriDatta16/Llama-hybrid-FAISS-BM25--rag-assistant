Testing is more of an art, and you get better through practice. For myself, I have read this book Pragmatic Unit Testing in C# with NUnit , and I'll really recommend it to you. Although its about .Net and C# and not about Python, you can skip the exact code, but try to understand the principles being taught. It contains good examples about what one should look out for when designing tests. And also, what kind of code should be written that supports the tests-first paradigm.
