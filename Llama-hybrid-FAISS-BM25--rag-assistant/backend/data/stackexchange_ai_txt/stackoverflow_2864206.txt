Quote from Java Generics and Collections , section 7.2: Class literals are also restricted; it is not even syntactically valid to supply a type parameter to the type in a class literal. Thus, the following fragment is illegal: class ClassLiteral { public Class k = List .class; // syntax error } Indeed, Java's grammar makes a phrase such as the preceding one difficult to parse, and it may trigger a cascade of syntax errors [...] This syntax problem leads to an irregularity. Everywhere else that a reifiable type is required, you may supply either a raw type (such as List ) or a parameterized type with unbounded wildcards (such as List ). However, for class tokens, you must supply a raw type; not even unbounded wildcards may appear. Replacing List with List in the preceding code leads to a similar error cascade. So, you have no choice but use only raw types in class tokens, like GWT.create(Razmataz.class);
