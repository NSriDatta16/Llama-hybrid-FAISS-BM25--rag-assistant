We have recently completed one such exercise using Markov chains. The data that we used for this project was as follows: For a selected set of users, for a 6 month time period their complete campaign history. Format as follows: Userid, campaign-id, campaign-date, response tag, response value The response tag is a binary tag indicating responded or no. Our markov chain approach did not really care about the time of campaign, it only used the order and getting null state vs success. What approach are you using in your model? I'd be happy to compare notes. While I'd not be able to share the data, we could run your code on our data. We had real campaign history data for a client, hence didn't have to simulate it.
