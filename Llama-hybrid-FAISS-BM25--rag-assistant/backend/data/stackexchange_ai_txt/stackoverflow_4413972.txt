Disregarding if it is or isn't possible, if you just installed a gatekeeper type of application an attacker could simply uninstall that application, something there is no means for an ordinary application to prevent. So I believe you would have to remove the SMS from the default storage and keep them in storage of your password-protected application. That way if your application is uninstalled the stored SMS are also removed. You might also want to encrypt the storage to provide some degree of protection against someone rooting the device and gaining the ability to read the application's private storage. They would of course still be able to uninstall the application and read any newly received SMS.
