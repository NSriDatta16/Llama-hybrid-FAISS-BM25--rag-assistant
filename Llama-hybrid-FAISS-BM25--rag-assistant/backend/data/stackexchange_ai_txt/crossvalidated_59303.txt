State space models for time series forecasting

I am new to time series forecasting and have been slowly working my way through the different approaches available. I've so far mainly been using ets and arima models available in the R forecast package. As I need to forecast at a daily level taking into consideration weekends and public holidays, I have also been exploring arimax models with xreg values. As far as I can tell, it does not seem possible to use xreg values with ets models. With my sample data ets also can't forecast the step function that occurs at weekends accurately - the smoothing means the only saturday is forecast correctly but sunday is also incorrect. I cam across a series of slides from Nate Derby - http://www.sas.com/offices/NA/canada/downloads/presentations/Victoria2008/Time.pdf The final slides elude to the fact that state space models might make it easier to model timeseries. How powerful and implementable are state space models? Is this something I need to seriously consider?
