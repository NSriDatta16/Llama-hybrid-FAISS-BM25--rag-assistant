The assumption of linearity is the simplest non-vacuous assumption about how the covariates can effect the expectation. That the linearity assumption is made as on the log-odds scale is a bit strange. But considering that a) the log odds scale is an unbounded quantity (i.e. we can have log odds from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ and have them correspond to probabilities on the unit interval), and b) the logit function is the canonical link for logistic regression, then the assumption of linearity on the log odds scale starts to not seem so crazy.
