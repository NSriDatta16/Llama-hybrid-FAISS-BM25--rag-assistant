iPhone, Convenience Method or Alloc / Release?

Whilst developing for the iPhone I had a stubborn memory leak that I eventually tracked down to NSXMLParser. However whilst looking for that it got me thinking about maybe changing a lot of my convenience methods to alloc/release. Is there any good reason for doing that? In a large app I can see how releasing memory yourself quickly is a better idea, but in a small app is there any other difference between the two methods. NSNumber *numberToAdd = [NSNumber numberWithInt:intValue]; dostuff ... OR NSNumber *numberToAdd = [[NSNumber alloc] initWithInt:intValue]; doStuff ... [numberToAdd release]; cheers gary.
