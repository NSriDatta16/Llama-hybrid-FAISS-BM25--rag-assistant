This seems pretty straight forward to me. The average is given as $$\overline{x}=\frac{n_1+5n_5}{n}=5-4\frac{n_1}{n}$$ where $n_1$ is the number of samples equal to 1, and $n_5=n-n_1$ is the number of samples equal to 5. So, your problem now boils down to $\frac{n_1}{n}\leq 0.06$ or $n_1\leq 0.06n$ . The probability for this is given by the cdf, which is given on your linked Wikipedia page. The population values satisfy $N_1=0.06N$ and $N_5=0.94N$ (by your assumption). The normal approximation should work well here for large $n$ (you already assume $N$ is large), where $E(n_1)=0.06n$ and $var(n_1)=0.06(0.94)n\frac{N-n}{N-1}\approx 0.06(0.94)n(1-\frac{n}{N})$ . This means the "z-value" is actually $z=\frac{0.06n-E(n_1)}{\sqrt{var(n_1)}}=0$ which as you can see, does not depend on $n$ or $N$ . As the z-value is zero, the probability is $Pr(n_1\leq 0.06n)\approx 0.5$ . looking at your case, if $n\leq 16$ then to get the average over $4.76$ you need all the samples to be equal to 5. Using the binomial approximation the probability is $0.94^n$ . This starts out at $0.94$ for $n=1$ and then decrease down to $0.37$ for $n=16$ . Then when $n=17$ you can have a single 1 in the sample, because $\frac{1\times 1+16\times 5}{17}=4.765>4.76$ . This means the probability changes to $0.94^n+n\times 0.94^{n-1}0.06$ which is $0.728$ for $n=17$ . as before it decreases to $0.403$ for $n=33$ . Then, when $n=34$ we can now have two samples of 1, so that we have $0.94^n+n\times 0.94^{n-1}0.06+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\times 0.94^{n-2}0.06^2$ . This is equal to $0.666$ for $n=34$ and decreases down to $0.43$ for $n=49$ . Then it can be 3 ones in the sample (assuming it can be exactly 4.76). If you plot this, you will see a zig-zag pattern around 0.5, with the gap becoming smaller and smaller. The Wikipedia page also contains some bounds for the probability $Pr(n_1\leq (0.06-t)n)\leq \exp(-2t^2n)$ . obviously $0 for the equation to make sense. A more tight bound is given by replacing $2t^2$ with $(0.06-t)\log\left(1-\frac{t}{0.06}\right)+(0.94+t)\log\left(1+\frac{t}{0.94}\right)$ .
