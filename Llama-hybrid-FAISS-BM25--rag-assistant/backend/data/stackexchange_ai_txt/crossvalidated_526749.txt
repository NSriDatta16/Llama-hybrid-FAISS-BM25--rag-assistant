How to use logistic regression with original values from a dependent variable that is a ratio?

I have a dependent variable that is a ratio, i.e. it takes the values between 0 and 1. Some 30% of values are 1s. The dependent variable measures the distribution of funds, i.e. it is calculated just like so: amount of distributed money / the total amount of proposed money. It so happens that often times all of the proposed money is disbursed. I am building a model to see what factors influence the disbursement rate. I was told that a fractional regression could be appropriate for such a dependent variable. However, I was also told in this post that I could use a logistic regression with the original values that have made up this ratio variable. Indeed, I have the original values available. However, I cannot understand how could I use a logistic regression for this? How many dependent variables would I have then (2?), and how would all of this work? Do you think this latter advice is sound? If so, do you have any sources that would explain how to do that? Any justified arguments are much appreciated.
