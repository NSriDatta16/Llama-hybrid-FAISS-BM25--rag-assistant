You cannot embed javascript code inside a string, but you can concatenate a string to an object using '+' like so $('#content').load('data.html #' + $(this).getClass()); About embedding code in a string, I don't think it has a name. Groovy calls those strings " Gstring "s, and ruby calls those ' Expression substitution in strings '. I'm not sure it has a standard name.
