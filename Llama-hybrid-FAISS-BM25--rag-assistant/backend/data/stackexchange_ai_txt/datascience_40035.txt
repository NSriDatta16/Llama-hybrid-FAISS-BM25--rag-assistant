C++ return array from function

I would like to implement machine learning algorithm in C++ without using any C++ machine learning library. So I'm writing this initializer function for generating zero matrices but can't figure out how can I accomplish this. I'm actually trying to write C++ code for simple logistics regression for now. float * intializer_zero(int dimension){ // z = wx + b. float b = 0; float w[dimension]= { }; return w,b; } It's throwing error "cannot convert 'float' to 'float' in return." How can I write this initializer function in C++?
