Of course - the system automatically resizes your images from the drawable directory to correspond to the DPI of the device if you don't define your own. So in fact the 'drawable' directory is pretty much the same as the 'drawable-mdpi' directory, and because you don't have the ldpi and hdpi versions defined the system automatically builds them out of your mdpi resources. See (1.) here: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#support - "Pre-scaling of resources (such as image assets)" Of course your icons will look somehow ok on ldpi devices but ugly on hdpi devices. That's because the mdpi icons are scaled to match higher dimensions, effectively resulting in less information per pixel.
