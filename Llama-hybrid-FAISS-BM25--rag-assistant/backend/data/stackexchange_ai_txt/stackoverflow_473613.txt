Memory pools are most effective imo for transaction style processing where you can allocate to the pool and then when the transaction is done, just dump it into oblivion. The real speed up isn't that each allocation is going to be much faster its that you will have near zero memory fragmentation in an extremely long running application. In sort, it sounds like your applications do not warrant using memory pools
