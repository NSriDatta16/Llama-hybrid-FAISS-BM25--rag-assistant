It doesn't really work quite like that. The network you have described is too simple to have a concept like pain that it would try to get rid of. On a low level it's nothing but just another input, but obviously that doesn't make the network "dislike" it. In order to gain such a signal, you could train the network to perform certain actions when it receives this particular signal. As it becomes more refined, this signal starts looking like a real pain signal, but it's nothing more than a specific training of the network. The pain signal in higher animals has this "do anything to get rid of it" response because higher animals have rather advanced cognitive abilities compared to the network you have described. Worms, on the other hand, might respond in a very specific way to a "pain" input - twitch a certain way. It's hard-wired that way, and to say that the worm tries to do anything to get rid of the signal would be wrong; it's more like a motor connected to a button that spins every time you press the button. Realistic mechanisms for getting artificial neural networks to do useful things are collectively known as "neural network training", and is a large and complex research area. You can google for this phrase to get various ideas. You should be aware, however, that neural networks are not a panacea for solving hard problems; they don't automatically get things done through magic. Using them effectively requires a good deal of experimentation with traning algorithm tweaks and network parameter tweaks.
