I've encountered those. They suck, because they prevent the user from dragging to select the text of the number. A better idea would be a miniature slider beneath the field that expands to a full-size slider when the user holds down the mouse button on it and collapses back to its miniature size when the user releases the mouse button. This way, the selection behavior is still available, but you also provide the sliderâ€”and in a more obvious way. There's no built-in class in Cocoa for either one. You'll have to implement your own.
