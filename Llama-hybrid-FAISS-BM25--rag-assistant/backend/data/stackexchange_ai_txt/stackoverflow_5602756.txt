I think you are getting an error by not enclosing the Date inside Pound signs. You have to do this in Jet (Access) when using variables not parameters. VALUES('#" & DateTime.Now.Date & "#',... I also took the liberty of refactoring this code for you since you are creating a new connection for each record which is bad news. Use a Try Catch Finally block and move all that stuff outside the For Loop (please see below) Function recordOrder() objDT = Session("Cart") Dim intCounter As Integer Dim con2 As New System.Data.OleDb.OleDbConnection Dim myPath2 As String myPath2 = Server.MapPath("faraxday.mdb") con2.ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" Remember to mark as answered if this helps.
