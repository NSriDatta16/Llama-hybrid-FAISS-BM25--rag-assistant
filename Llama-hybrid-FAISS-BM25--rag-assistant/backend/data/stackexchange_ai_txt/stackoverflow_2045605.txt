Property based searches in Javascript

While looking for the best way to search an array of objects in Javascript (there doesn't seem to be a iterate + compare function for that) I came across this post which seems like are really elegant way of doing this. However I have some questions: Javascript doesn't have associative arrays. These seems like one. What gives? This seems like a very elegant solution but how does it stack up against the competition? "Pass the array and comparison function" - means several specific comparison functions for various searches. "Optimised findByX functions" - means optimised searches for each type needed. " scalalala method" - which I suspect would be the slowest but most elegant. Also how would you go about taking a reponse from AJAX and creating an array with a similar structure to this? Most tutorials hand-pick and roll the examples to demonstrate the associativity of arrays but not how that could be used practically. Is there any pitfalls to using this method? Decent links ( beyond this ) would be appreciated. Thanks. UPDATE: This is what I am having trouble with. If I have data coming back from the server similar to this: $.getJSON("map.php?jsoncallback=?", function(data) { for (var x=0,xx=data.stars.length; x Where Star is a class: function Star(id, x, y, n, o) { this.id = id; this.x = x; this.y = y; this.name = n; this.owner = o; } So how do I turn this into the "associative" style array?
