Other approach is instance based algorithms like KNN and SVM predict based on distance rather than a probability distribution. These algorithms create decision boundaries between classes in the training dataset, then prediction of a new sample is based on some sort of distance measure which “determines” the closest class to this sample, and puts the sample on that side of the boundary, no probability here.
