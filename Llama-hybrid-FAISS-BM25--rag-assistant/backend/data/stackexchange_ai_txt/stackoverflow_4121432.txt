Unless you have a very good reason, don't try to design your own file formats. In virtually every field, there are already numerous conflicting file formats which make program compatibility a headache. I encourage you to look for an existing, preferably open, file format which matches your needs. If you do need to create a new format, XML is a good place to start. XML is text based and allows for easy inspection, making it possible for the format to be used with little development work, and for years to come. I also encourage you to research the domain (chemistry) and the potential applications of the file format, to make sure its capabilities match with the needs of the industry.
