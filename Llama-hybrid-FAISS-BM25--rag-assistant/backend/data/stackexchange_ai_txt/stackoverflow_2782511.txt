Me too, I had got the same probleme but I have solved it like this: If you use NetBeans : Create a project : web --> webapplication --> etc you should create a client of your web service that you want to call. The methode is : right click your project---> webservice client. You should give the url of your WSDL and Netbeans will parse this WSDL and create the client. Create your second web service (the web service that will call the first one ) in the same package. Juste right click your project ---> webservice. This part is the most important for your probleme Please create a simple standard Java class in your project but with another package name. Create a default constructor (optional but good) Outside your default constructor, create a function that you give the name TestService(this is a simple exemple of name) Inside your function, right click and choose : Insert code ---> call web service operation. If any think is OK, you must see the service coming from the other web service that you want call its operations.(This, because of the client that you had created in step 2) Choose the operation that you want to call. In your webservice, you can now call your TestService operation as a standard Java operation (instanciate your class, call the operation using the "." notation) That is the all you need. Please, keep me informing about your progress... If you have any other problem about this, we can share informations until you get success... ok? I think that the best way is to use Netbeans if you want to work with webservices. Courage and sorry for my english.... I am a frensh speeker.
