QObjects appear at first glance to be excellent way to handle storage issues for this type of data. I thought the same thing when I first starting using Qt. However, this is not what they are meant to be used for. There is a good writeup on what QObjects really are and do at http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=667415 . If all you are going to do is store data in a class, as I read your question, then don't use QObject based classes. The overhead will seriously hurt your performance. As to what Qt specific features would help you, there is nothing really specific to Qt that will help. What I found was the Qt's containers were much easier to use than standard template library or some of boost's specialized ones because at the time I didn't know stl well enough. My best suggestion from a performance point of view is to minimize number new/deletes by writing a memory pool system or use Boost Pool for each new reading. And also minimize moving data at all.
