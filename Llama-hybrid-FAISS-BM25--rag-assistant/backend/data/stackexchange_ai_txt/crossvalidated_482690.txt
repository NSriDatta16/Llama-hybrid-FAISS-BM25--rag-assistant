Will Different Types of Labels Affect Feature Engineering Outcomes?

Here I would like to limit the question to 2 supervised learning tasks: classification and regression. My question is: for a given set of raw training features, will feature engineering be affected by the type of label/task I choose(binary or continuous labels) and generate different engineered features? If not, does this mean feature engineering process can be independent of labels? In other words, can we just do feature engineering without knowing what the label is?
