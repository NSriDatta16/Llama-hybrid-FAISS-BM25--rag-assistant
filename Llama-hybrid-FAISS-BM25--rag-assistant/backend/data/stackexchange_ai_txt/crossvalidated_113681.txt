Random Forest for data imputation

Currently I am using Random Forest approach for Missing Values Imputation from missForest package in R. I faced the following problem: the algorithm works much longer than any other imputation approaches like KNN or SVD. Does anybody know how to overcome this problem or maybe anyone had experience with using it in other packages? I'd really appreciate any help cause I even failed to find the full description of the approach in the internet.
