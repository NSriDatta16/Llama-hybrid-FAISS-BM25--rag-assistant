Augmenting Kalman filter with parameter -- what does the initial value mean?

It is a fairly standard trick to augment a Kalman Filter with unknown parameters and to propagate them forth with zero error to estimate them. I was wondering if anyone could tell me what the interpretation is of the initial value and covariance is when I use this trick. I know (books by Harvey or Durbin and Koopman) I could make it diffuse or fixed, but what does it mean for it to be fixed? Some a priori known mean and covariance? Does this have an interpretation beyond that of a tuning parameter? Something akin to a Bayesian prior? Thanks.
