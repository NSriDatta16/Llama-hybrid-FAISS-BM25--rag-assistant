use random forests for prediction

I am working on a project to determine the variables that better predict the binary outcome. I am using conditional random forest and permimp::permimp to assess the importance of variables for my subgroup analysis. Now, I want to make probability predictions from a properly constructed random forest, based on each new patient's values. For instance, if I initially used 30 variables to fit the random forest and, through permutation, identified 7 variables as important. Now, when we have a new patient, and we want to predict the probability of their response, we may only have the 7 important variables collected, not all 30. Can we still predict the probability of the patient being a responder based on these 7 variables alone, or do we need all 30 variables? Alternatively, should we refit the random forest based only on these 7 variables? Not all variables might be collected because the setting involves clinical data. Hence, I could train the model based on one study's data, while a clinician is presumably interested in the probability of developing the disease, but he/she might not have the same data collected.
