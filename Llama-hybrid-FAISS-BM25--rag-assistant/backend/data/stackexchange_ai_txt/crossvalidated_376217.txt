Memoryless Property of a Markov Chain of Order 1. Is AR(1) memoryless or of infinite memory?

A stochastic process constitutes a discrete Markov Chain of order 1 if it has the memoryless property, in the sense that the probability that the chain will be in a particular state i, of a finite set of possible states, at time t+1 depends only on the state of the chain at time t. Is an AR(1) memoryless? When written in the form below, it may seem reasonable to guess that an AR(1) model is also memoryless to the same extent as a Markov chain of order 1, because it depends only on its one preceding lag. $$x_t=a+bx_{t-1}+\epsilon_t \quad \text{ and assume }|b| However, when $|b| holds and we write the AR(1) model in MA( $\infty$ ) form, we end up with $x_t$ as a function of innovations going back infinitely far in the past. Now it looks like the AR(1) model has "infinite" memory of all the innovations going back infinitely far in the past, albeit as a function of innovations and not of own past values. What exactly is the memoryless property? Is AR(1) memoryless or of "infinite" memory?
