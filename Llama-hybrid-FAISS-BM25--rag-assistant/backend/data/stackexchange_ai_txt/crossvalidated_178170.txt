You can understand PCA's main purpose with a simple example. Consider that your two variables $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated i.e. all data points lie on a line passing through the origin. By performing PCA, you rotate the data to the direction of maximum variance. This will result in a data that has one constant dimension: the new rotated data (in the coordinates of principal components) will be a horizontal straight line located at $x = 0$. As you understand, this transformation will make classification an easier task since linear data correlations have been taken out of the data. After PCA, you can train your classifier on only one dimension instead of two (as you would in the original dataset) without any loss of information.
