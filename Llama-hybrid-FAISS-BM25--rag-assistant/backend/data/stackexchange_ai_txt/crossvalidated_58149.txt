Why do categorical predictor variables in regression need to be recoded as multiple predictors?

I'm learning about machine learning using Python's library scikit learn, and in their tutorial here they mentioned about a categorical variable color which can have values purple , blue and red . What is the reason behind using 3 boolean variables color#purple , color#blue and color#red instead of having the single variable color but mapping the values purple , blue , red to 1 , 2 , 3 ? Will doing either way have any effects on the regression fitting/prediction?
