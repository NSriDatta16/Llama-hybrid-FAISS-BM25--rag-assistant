I'll list a couple things that have been useful in my own research: First - have you considered the Hotelling's T-squared test? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling 's_T-squared_distribution (for some reason the apostrophe throws off the link given above, so you'll have to copy and paste into the address bar) This is the multivariate generalization of the standard t-test between two groups. An R implementation of this test is given in the R package Hotelling. However, If you don't want to make any distributional assumptions in your data you could also use a permutation test such as the Multi Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) which is a distance based permutation procedure. There's an R implementation of this in the vegan package. Look for the mrpp function. I would recommend keeping the default at euclidean distance, but you can note that using squared euclidean distance would be equivalent to basing the permutation test on the Hotelling T-Squared statistic if you feel more comfortable with that. Between the two things I mentioned - I would recommend using the MRPP test more strongly.
