I think what you are trying to ask is whether your variables are important or not. There is no thing as the variables are overfitting to the model, however you can overfit to the model by tuning and minimizing bias to the very end. In models such as Decision Trees and Multiple Decision Trees Ensembles (Random Forest), you can calculate variable importance by using entropy measure of the variables. This will lead you to understand which variables are actually important. Lastly, in models such as random forest the intuition is to have multiple decision trees where at each splitting node having different variables across many trees. Most of the time you would not even use all the variables you have in your data set in a single tree. This enable to decrease your model's variance while not affecting your bias.
