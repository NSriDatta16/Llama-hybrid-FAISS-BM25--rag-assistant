Difference-in-Difference with Logistic Regression, how to add mutliple fixed effects?

I'm using R and running a Difference-in-difference (DID) regression with unbalanced panel data . Since my dependent variable is a dummy variable (Government officials originated from A or B), my DID is therefore a DID with logistic regression , and I can run the DID (by adding an interaction term of the two binary variables, "treatment(1) or reference group(0)" and "before(0) and after(1) the treatment", to the function, which is the DID estimator then) with glm package. I am now trying to add time fixed effect and county fixed effect simultaneously to the regression. I found in R we have a package called alpaca to do this. When I try to run a simple regression with feglm() , it runs smoothly, but when adding the interaction term (the DID estimator), it cannot work and shows Error in qr.solve(MX * w.tilde, Mnu * w.tilde, epsilon) : singular matrix 'a' in solve . The function I use is basically the same as the one I used in glm . I'm wondering whether you have any suggestions to figure out what's wrong. Also, do we have any other good ways to deal with a " DID logistic regression with two-way fixed effects " in R? Thank you in advance!
