What's wrong with your code? I find it to be quite elegant and simple. The only problem is that if the file doesn't end in a newline, the last line returned won't have a '\n' as the last character, and therefore doing line = line[:-1] would incorrectly strip off the last character of the line. The most elegant way to solve this problem would be to define a generator which took the lines of the file and removed the last character from each line only if that character is a newline: def strip_trailing_newlines(file): for line in file: if line[-1] == '\n': yield line[:-1] else: yield line f = open("myFile.txt", "r") for line in strip_trailing_newlines(f): # do something with line
