Understanding output stepAIC

I am using the stepAIC function in R to do a bi-directional (forward and backward) stepwise regression. I do not understand what each return value from the function means. The output is: Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC 350.71 -5406.0 - aaa 1 0.283 350.99 -5405.9 - bbb 1 0.339 351.05 -5405.4 - ccc 1 0.982 351.69 -5400.5 - ddd 1 0.989 351.70 -5400.5 Question Are the values listed under Df , Sum of Sq , RSS , and AIC the values for a model where only one variable would be considered as the independent variable (i.e. y ~ aaa, y ~ bbb, etc.)? NOTE: Question also in data science exchange: data science link
