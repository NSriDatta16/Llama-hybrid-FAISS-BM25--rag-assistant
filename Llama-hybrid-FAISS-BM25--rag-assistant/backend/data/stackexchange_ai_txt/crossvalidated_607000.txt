Realistically, this cannot be done. It would require you to give every decision tree in your random forest, and that’s a lot of trees! The best you can realistically do is, as Stephan Kolassa wrote, say exactly what you did. If you publish your code on a personal website, GitHub, or journal website, that’s even better! If you just want to illustrate the idea of a random forest in your paper, however, it might make sense to make up three small decision trees, show how an observation makes its way down each tree, and then calculate the mean.
