Firstly, I would like to tell you that domain knowledge plays a crucial role applying machine learning models. Coming to your question 1: ML algorithm will not strictly determine weather to use a feature or not. ML algorithm will only tell you about the relevance of a particular feature present in your feature set. For example, while doing regression, variables associated with higher coefficients are of greater importance than the ones having lower weights,it might be very close to zero as well, which gives you hint to not consider the feature. Similar is the case with the fbeta score of a variable while we deal with trees. User can specify what features are to be considered. User could also make some derivative features which helps a lot while dealing with ML problems Generally this is an iterative process. For the second question : There is no specific mapping between the problem statement and hypothesis. You may develop some of them with experience. You should not(usually) choose such custom functions as they might be fitting your training data perfectly, but could give poor results on test data as there is loss of generality by using a specific function. You could try different algorithms, with making new features, using ensemble methods and other machine learning techniques to improve your score
