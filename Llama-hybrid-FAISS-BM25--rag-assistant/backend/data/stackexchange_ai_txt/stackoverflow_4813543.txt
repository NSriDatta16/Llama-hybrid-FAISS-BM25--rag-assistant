There were a few odd things about your code that I took the liberty of fixing. For instance, no need to keep calling getContext() all the time, just call it once. Same goes for getElementById() no need to call it more than once. I also moved your events out of the canvas tag and into the javascript. I was really puzzled by your problem when I first experienced it. The order of your calls to stroke() and closePath() seemed a little wonky... I fixed that, but that turned out not to be the problem... in the end your only problem was that you wrote "beginpath()" instead of "beginPath()". Have a look at the fixed version on jsFiddle .
