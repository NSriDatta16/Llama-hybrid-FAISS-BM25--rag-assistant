Because of limited data, I would not even try or have faith in developing a sophisticated model here. Fundamentally, I do not feel that given dynamic changing world economies, the introduction of virtual currencies, ..., that a more precise time series model for prediction is possible. However, a crude model may still have some value in my opinion. So, how to proceed, first build a simple model and extract probabilistic predictions therefrom for investment decision making. To start, based on an old data series, define what constitutes a significant data shock (as a %) to the stock market. At those observed points, note the corresponding % impact on the price of precious metals (including gold). From this, based only on old data, develop a simple regression model, for example. The Least-Squares theory provides for the mean prediction, a probability distribution. Use this distribution to define a discrete probability decision model. Employ the old data to construct the best investment decision model relative to stocks and precious metals. Re-estimate the simple regression model on more recent data, and apply the best discrete analysis cut-offs, etc, that were previously developed above, for investment decision analysis on the recent data. Now, you can still continue to pursue a complex model and use my more basic model to confirm or disregard the latter model.
