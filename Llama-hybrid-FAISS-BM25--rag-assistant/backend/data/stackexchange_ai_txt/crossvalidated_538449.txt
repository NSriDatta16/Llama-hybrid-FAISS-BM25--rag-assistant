If I understand correctly the problem, taking $\pi$ as the target density and $Q(\theta,\theta^\prime)$ as the proposal Markov kernel, an MCMC algorithm that would be associated with the transition at time $t$ : $$\theta^{(t+1)}=\begin{cases} \theta^\prime\sim Q(\theta_{(t)},\theta^\prime) &\text{with probability } \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\prime)}{\pi(\theta_{(t)}}\,\dfrac{Q(\theta^\prime,\theta_{(t)})}{Q(\theta_{(t)},\theta^\prime)}\wedge 1\\ \theta_{(t)} &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ would be the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Moving to the transition Select a component index $i$ with uniform probabilities Take $$\theta^{(t+1)}=\begin{cases} \theta^\prime\sim Q_i(\theta_{(t)},\theta^\prime)&\text{with probability } \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\prime)}{\pi(\theta_{(t)}}\,\dfrac{Q_i(\theta^\prime,\theta_{(t)})}{Q_i(\theta_{(t)},\theta^\prime)}\wedge 1\\ \theta_{(t)} &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ where $Q_i(\cdot,\cdot)$ denotes the conditional kernel on the $i$ -th component of $\theta$ associated with $Q(\cdot,\cdot)$ , would work. Were the conditional kernel symmetric, the ratio would then cancel. If in the opposite, it is assymmetric and the densities $Q_i(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $Q(\cdot,\cdot)$ are intractable, I see no generic algorithm taking advantage of this conditional proposal. If the stationary distribution of $Q_i(\theta_{(t)},\cdot)$ , say $\tilde\pi_i(\theta|\theta_{(t)})$ , is known, then the step $$\theta^{(t+1)}=\begin{cases} \theta^\prime\sim Q_i(\theta_{(t)},\theta^\prime)&\text{with probability } \dfrac{\pi(\theta^\prime)}{\pi(\theta_{(t)}}\,\dfrac{\tilde\pi_i(\theta_{(t)}|\theta^\prime)}{\tilde\pi_i(\theta^\prime|\theta_{(t)})}\wedge 1\\ \theta_{(t)} &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ would work as well.
