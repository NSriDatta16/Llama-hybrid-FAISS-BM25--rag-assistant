How to use JUnit and Hamcrest together?

I can't understand how JUnit 4.8 should work with Hamcrest matchers. There are some matchers defined inside junit-4.8.jar in org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers . At the same time there are some other matchers in hamcrest-all-1.1.jar in org.hamcrest.Matchers . So, where to go? Shall I explicitly include hamcrest JAR into the project and ignore matchers provided by JUnit? In particular, I'm interested in empty() matcher and can't find it in any of these jars. I need something else? :) And a philosophical question: why JUnit included org.hamcrest package into its own distribution instead of encouraging us to use original hamcrest library?
