Differences between Kriging and Gaussian Process Regression

I am having quite difficult time to clearly understand the differences between Kriging and Gaussian Process Regression. Here is what I have understood so far: For simple kriging (mean value known), the two methods give the same result expect it is not from the same point of view. Simple kriging uses the best linear unbiased estimator. GPR uses the Bayesian approach by assuming a prior distribution over functions. This prior is a Gaussian process. We use a Gaussian likelihood with the observed values and that way we get the posterior distribution. We compute the expected value of this distribution and we obtain the same result than simple kriging. My first question is: How come do we get the same result as we do not make any assumption on the randomness for the best linear unbiased estimator? For ordinary kriging, one does not know the mean value expect that the value is stationary. So far, I have not seen any link between the point of view using the best linear unbiased estimator and the one using Gaussian Process. Is there any?
