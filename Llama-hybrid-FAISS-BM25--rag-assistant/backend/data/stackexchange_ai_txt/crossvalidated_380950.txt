I was trying to build the softmax regression from scratch, and got stuck here also: why all the posts just silently omit the coefficient $\frac{n!}{x_1! x_2! \dots x_k!}$ totally, after some research and thinking i share my understanding here: In reality, we always use a special form of the multinomial distribution with $k>2$ and $n=1$ , that is categorical distribution , and since $n=1$ , then the coefficient $\frac{n!}{x_1! x_2! \dots x_k!}$ of the multinomial distribution's PMF will be always all 1, that is why we can omit it, more details: $$ \begin{cases} \text{class 1 is chosen: } \frac{1!}{1! \cdot 0! \cdot 0! \dots 0!} = 1 \\ \text{class 2 is chosen: } \frac{1!}{0! \cdot 1! \cdot 0! \dots 0!} = 1 \\ \text{class 3 is chosen: } \frac{1!}{0! \cdot 0! \cdot 1! \dots 0!} = 1 \\ \vdots \end{cases} $$ For getting more details and a better full pic of understanding u can refer to my post GLM and exponential family distributions -> Why the PMF has no coefficient Especially pay attention to understand what does the $x_i$ stand for in multinomial distribution from this section
