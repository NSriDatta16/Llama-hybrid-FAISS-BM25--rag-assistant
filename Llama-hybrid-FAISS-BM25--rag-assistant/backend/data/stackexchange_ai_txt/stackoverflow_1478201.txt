Installing PDO_MYSQL PHP extension on CPanel?

I recieved this error while installing Magento on a customer's server, 'PHP Extension "pdo_mysql" must be loaded'. How would one go about installing/enabling this extension through CPanel Accelerated? Server information is as follows: cPanel Version 11.24.5-STABLE cPanel Build 38506 Apache version 2.2.13 (Unix) PHP version 5.2.8 MySQL version 5.0.81-community Architecture i686 Operating system Linux Kernel version 2.6.18-128.1.6.el5 cPanel Pro 1.0 (RC1) Thanks!
