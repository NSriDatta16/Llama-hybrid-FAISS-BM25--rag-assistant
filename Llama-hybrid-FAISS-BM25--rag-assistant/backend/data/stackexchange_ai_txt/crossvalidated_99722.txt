Test hypothesis "This profit is significantly different than the average"

I am writing a paper about Algo-trading and my supervisor asked me to test the hypothesis that "the return of the trading strategy is significantly different than the average". To reach this result, it has been implemented a software doing the following: Compute the profit by trading on a certain stock for a certain period of time according to the pre-set trading rules; Generate a big sample (1,000) of "random trading strategies". For reaching this, it has been implemented a Linear Congruential Generator which is returning random numbers between 0 and 1; these numbers are hence used, over the same stock and over the same time-period, to decide if trading or not and then compute the profit of each trading session. The output looks like follows: I've studied statistics long time ago so, even if I've realized myself this question is very basic, I'm not able to remind.... how can I say if the profit 12.96% got by applying the trading rules is significantly different from the sample mean 13.05% of 10,000 trading sessions randomly executed? EDIT: Any further suggestion about the sample-size or other factors might make the statistics more valid would be highly appreciated.
