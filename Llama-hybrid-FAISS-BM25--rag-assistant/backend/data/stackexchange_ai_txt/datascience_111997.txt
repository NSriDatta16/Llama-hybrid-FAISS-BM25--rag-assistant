Sounds like more of a resource issue, but it is still related to data science, because of its final objective. Dealing with millions of users could require a lot of memory and computing power. That's why client-side processing should be a priority, using client-side functions like javascript. On the other hand, it is interesting to start with a data analysis about clicks (mean amount of clicks per person, mean time spent in a session, etc.). This is important to set rules to call the database and save the information. For instance, you could count clicks on the client-side and every and save it in the database every (mean time spent)/2 for example. The aim is to reduce as much as possible the request to the server-side, without having to use a long time-out. In addition to that, if you collect enough click data, it is possible to do some interesting stats (rush hours, functions performance, most used functions, ...) and adapt the server-side or client-side processing to it.
