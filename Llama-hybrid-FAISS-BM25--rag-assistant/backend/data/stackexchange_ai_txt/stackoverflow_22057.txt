I have to say that I absolutely agree with the statements on it being too difficult for the "average" Internet user. I think that OpenID could still be considered "new", even though the original proposal was back in 2005. More high traffic sites are taking it up as just an option for creating an account, rather than requiring users to have an OpenID present. In my opinion, as long as normal username/password account creation is offered alongside OpenID, average Internet users will naturally begin to try and eventually stick with using OpenID. The authentication issues apply just as much to OpenID as registering on any website. You put your trust in the website with your password (assuming you do not use a password storage program) so that shouldn't be used against OpenID. All that aside, the standardization of account creation is absolutely cream gravy to a web developer. I'd just love to not even have to worry about the normal creation process, and rather just drop in an OpenID library and reference it to the database.
