The first thing I would do is make a graph with "age" on the x-axis and "percent correct" on the y-axis. Depending on how much data you have, different graphs could be appropriate, but I would want to add a smooth line to this. Then, since your hypothesis is that the relationship between age and percent correct is non-monotonic, I would look at a logistic regression where "percent correct" is the dependent variable and a spline of age is the independent variable (since you seem to have age in years, not in groups). Another alternative is to add a transform of age such as "distance from ideal group" which could be whichever is greater of a) the absolute value of age - 15 or b) the absolute value of age - 25.
