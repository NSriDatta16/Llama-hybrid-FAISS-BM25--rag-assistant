Spoke to one of the quants here the function is of the from T = KNO, where T is time, K some constant, N iterations, O obligors. Rearrange for K = T/(NO), plug this into my sample data, take the average of all sample points, use the Std dev for the error I did this for my data and get: T = 3.81524E-06 * N * O (with 1.9% error), this is a pretty good approximation.
