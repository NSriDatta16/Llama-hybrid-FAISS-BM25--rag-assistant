The easiest way is to subclass the QListWidget and QWidget that you want to be able to drag and drop between, and handle the events in those implementations. If you do this, you should be able to right-click in designer and promote the widgets in your main .ui file. If you would rather not subclass, you could look into event filters, and install an event filter on each of those widgets. The event filter could then handle the events that cause the dragEnterEvent() and dragMoveEvent() to be called. This would likely be more confusing to anyone looking at your code later. I also second quark's suggestion of perusing the examples. You can learn a lot by taking a working example and trying to modify it to do something slightly different.
