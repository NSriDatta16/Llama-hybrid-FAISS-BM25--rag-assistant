Is it possible to iterate all the OutputCache keys?

Is it possible to iterate the OutputCache keys? I know you can remove them individually via HttpResponse.RemoveOutputCacheItem(), but is there a way I can iterate all the keys to see what's in the collection? I searched through Object Viewer, but didn't see anything. Worst case, I can maintain my own index. Since I'm doing everything by VaryByCustom, they get "fed" through a method in global.asax. It just strikes me that there has to be a more elegant way of doing this.
