Classification using n-grams

I have $10000$ samples of 6-lettered strings of the following type Left Right Classification ATTGGC GCGCTC 1 TAGCAA ACGCTC 2 GGGGCG TTTGCC 1 GCCTCG GTTGCG 1 ................ How can I use classification algorithms to classify the above text? I was thinking about generating tri-grams of each of the above strings in each row as [ATT,TTG,TGG,GGC,GCG,CGC,GCT,CTC] for the first row with classifier label 1. Now how should I proceed with the classification? Split each string into constituent characters and use that to classify, eg: for the first row, [A,T,T,G,G,C,G,C,G,C,T,C] for class label 1. I would then do one-hot encoding of the characters and use random forests etc to classify. Can anyone suggest me how to proceed with this problem?
