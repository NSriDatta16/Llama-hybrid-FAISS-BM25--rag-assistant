In addition to the other excellent answer (and yes, more data can really help, this could include different levels of aggregation, e.g. instead of state-level data, can you get county-level data?), there's also the option of shortening or weighting the time horizon for which you are matching the synthetic control. E.g. in the book example, they could have gone further back (assuming the data are available), but they clearly made a choice that e.g. matching the trajectory for data from before the second world war is irrelevant to the question at hand. You could also decide that on a sliding scale of importance matching the data 1987 is twice as important as matching the data for 1977 (which you can either achieve by weighting the loss functions or just scaling the values you are matching - e.g. scaling standardized values in 1977 by a factor of $\sqrt{0.5} \approx 0.707$ ). This would be arguing that a similar recent trajectory is just more important than what happened further in the past. However, there's a situation where interpolated synthetic controls just cannot match the treated unit. That's when it's the most extreme of the available units. E.g. int he book example, if California had had by far the highest (or the lowest) per capita cigarette sales prior to the intervention, there would just no weighted average of the other states that can match its numbers. While there might be ways around it (e.g. if you go to the county level and there are some counties somewhere that can match the California counties), this would also have been a big red flag warning you that perhaps no other states really look like California and trying to compare what happens in California to what happens in these states is really problematic. I.e. it might be a warning that there might be no good answer. To quote John Tukey:"The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data."
