Source : Wikipedia Bertrand's postulate (actually a theorem) states that if n > 3 is an integer, then there always exists at least one prime number p with n 1 there is always at least one prime p such that n So if I am given a number, say n, than I can check in the range (n, 2*n) [open interval excluding n and 2*n] int GetNextPrime(int n) { bool isPrime = false; for (int i = n; i
