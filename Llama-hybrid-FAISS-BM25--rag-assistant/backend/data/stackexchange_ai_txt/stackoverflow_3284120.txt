WMD Markdown appears broken in IE8

I've already found this question on SO (which is exactly the same problem I'm having), but the OP's solution a) doesn't work for me, and b) isn't feasable in my site. On the Google Code project for WMD, it says IE8 support is on its way. My question is, does anyone know how to make WMD Markdown work in IE8 right now? Or does anyone know when the new release might be coming that works with IE8? I'm willing to put in a little effort here (I don't expect a handout), but my Javascript chops aren't all that great, so I don't even know where to begin. FYI, here's my current solution which IMO isn't all that elegant Please use to style your input. note: I tagged this topic with asp.net-mvc-2 just because of what my markup looks like EDIT: Further to this issue, if you go to the official demo page , you will see the same behavior (in IE8) as I'm describing in my issue. This is definitely a bug with WMD Markdown. I'd like to know how Jeff fixed it on the SO site.
