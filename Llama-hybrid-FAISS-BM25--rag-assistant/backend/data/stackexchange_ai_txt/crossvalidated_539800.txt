I view this as a philosophical question with no uniformly satisfactory answer. Consider a 95% CI for $\mu$ based on a random sample of size $n$ from $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu, \sigma),$ where $\sigma$ is known. Before data are observed, there agreement among frequentist statisticians that $$P\left(\frac{|\bar X - \mu|}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \le 1.96\right)= P\left(\bar X - 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \le \mu \le \bar X + 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) = 0.95.$$ However, after data are available, there is disagreement whether the above remains a true probability statement. One can argue that the word "confidence" (instead of "probability") came into use because it is sufficiently vague to avoid arguments. About all one can say for sure is that, over the long run, the procedure giving rise to the interval $\bar X \pm 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ will cover $\mu$ 95% of the time. References to what this interval means for the specific experiment at hand are bound to provoke unproductive arguments. When frequentist statistical consultants tell clients that a given CI is "95% sure" to include the true value of value of $\mu,$ they can feel safe because the exact true value of $\mu$ is typically never known. In a Bayesian context, a prior distribution established a probability framework. A Bayesian posterior probability (or 'credible') interval, based on the prior and likelihood function from data, can be taken as a true probability statement about the current data. If you believe the prior and the integrity of the likelihood, there can be no quibbling about the resulting probability statement about the posterior distribution.
