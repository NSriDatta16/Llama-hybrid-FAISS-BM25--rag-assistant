HTTP Proxy Server in Python (with authentication)

I needed a simple HTTP proxy server written in Python so I began googling around and found this page . Not all the proxies were working and so I settled for this or this . ..but neither of them support authentication. Has anyone come across a HTTP Proxy Server written in Python that supports authentication? Thanks.
