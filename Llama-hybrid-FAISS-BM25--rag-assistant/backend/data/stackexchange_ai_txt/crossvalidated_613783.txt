train, test and validation data set configuration to compare a machine learing method and ARMA method

I want to compare performance a machine learning method and Autoreressive Moving Average-ARMA(p,q) for time series data. I do such a configuration: First I divide data into three part: Trainig data(First %60 of data) Validation data(%20 part of data) Test data(%20 part of data) Then, for machine learning procedure: Evaulate models for different combinations of hyper parameters using training data . Choose the best model using a criterion among all models from the first stage by using unseen validation data . Get the predicted results using the selected model from second stage, by a new unseen test data . For ARMA method: Get all combinations of models such that ARMA(1,0), ARMA(2,0),..ARMA(p,0), ARMA(2,0),....ARMA(p,q) Choose the best model using a criterion among all models from the fourth stage by using unseen validation data . Get the predictied results using the selected model from fifth stage by a new unseen test data . Finally, I compare predicted values obtained at the 3th and 6th stages, by using a criterion and choose which method is the best. I wantto learn, is such a confiuration is true? Or should I change the the configuration. Thanks a lot for any help and taking your time.
