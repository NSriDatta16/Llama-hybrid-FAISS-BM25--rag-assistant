Statistical Rethinking , has been released just a few weeks ago and hence I am still reading it, but I think is a very nice and fresh addition to the really introductory books about Bayesian Statistics. The author uses a similar approach as the one used by John Kruschke in his puppy books ; very verbose, detailed explanations, nice pedagogical examples, he also uses a computational rather than mathematical approach. Youtube lectures and other material is also available from here . Code ported to Python/PyMC3
