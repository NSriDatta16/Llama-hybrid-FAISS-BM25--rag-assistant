Proof that the MLE of logistic regression doesn't have a closed-form solution

It is well known that the maximum likelihood estimator of logistic regression does not admit a closed form solution. Whereas, ordinary least squares regression does have a closed form solution, at least in terms of matrix inverses. Is there a proof that logistic regression can't have a closed form solution or it is simply that none have been found after an extensive search? Proofs of the non-existence of things are presumably difficult in general.
