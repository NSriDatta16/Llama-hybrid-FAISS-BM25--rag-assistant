Clustering vs Non Clustering problems?

I'm just getting started with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning wherein he explained the example of the cocktail party problem vs the gene clustering problem in order to explain the difference between clustering and non clustering problems within unsupervised learning itself. However I still don't understand the difference between the two. Can someone please help clarify.
