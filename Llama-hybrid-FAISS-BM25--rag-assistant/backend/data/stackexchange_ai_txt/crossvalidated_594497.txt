Inherit a model to build a new model

I have the following problem. I have a model, model A. It classifies a persons ability to buy a product. It's a Logistic Regression model. I want to add a new feature, but if I add it to model A that feature only have one unique value for every instances. Not much to train on. The feature is an exogenous feature, capturing the state of the economy, one value per year. The other features are information about the persons in the population, like income, employment etc. Also, model A, is in production, so I don't want to modify it. I want to build an add-on that builds on model A and include the new feature. My thought was to train a new model, model B, on a separate dataset with these state of the economy features spanning several years to get a valid coefficient for this feature (or features) in a logistic regression model. And then add model B to model A in some form of stacking set up. My idea is to "inherit" model A, using the returned probabilities, and then stack them with model B. But I'm unsure about this approach. Given my problem, what would be an expert opinion on how to proceed?
