Magento has some memory leaks in its implementation of the Product class, so this will be an issue into the future. This seems to be part of the reason that the import/export utilities in the system work in relatively small chunks. If you are using this data on the client side, pagination is definitely the way to go. If this is some kind of data dump, you could consider grabbing the data at a lower level than the Magento objects. This approach will be faster, but much more fragile when it comes to changes between Magento versions. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
