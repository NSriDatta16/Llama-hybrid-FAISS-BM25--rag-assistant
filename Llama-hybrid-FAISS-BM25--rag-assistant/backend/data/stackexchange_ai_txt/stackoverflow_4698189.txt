Development Tracking Suite - Individual Developer

I'm looking for a development tracking CMS, where I can list bugs, set milestones, features, etc. I'm an individual developer, so multiuser features are just a luxury for now. I'm also hoping to become more organized in my development methodology by using a development tracking CMS (rather than my own mix). Please share some development tracking management systems (preferably free, running on the LAMP stack) for an independent developer! (In other news - been gone from SO for a while, and I notice the Community Wiki tick has disappeared...)
