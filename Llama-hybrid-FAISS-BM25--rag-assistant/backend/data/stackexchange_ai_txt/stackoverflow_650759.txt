I figured out the heart of the problem here. It has to do with border-collapse . I've had this same problem for a while now. Since tables often have thin borders the problem is not obvious to most people. If you put a regular table with width set to 100% inside a div, as Nate has, you will be fine. However, if you specify border-collapse:collapse on the table, the table will break out of the div. This is not obvious to most people because it may only break out by one pixel, or depending on the context it's in and the user agent, perhaps not at all. To make it clearer what is going on, try this: Put Nate's example next to David Heggie's example in an html file. It will look like both work fine. But now, change Nate's inline TD style to border: 40px solid blue . Change David's table td style to border: 40px solid #999; . At this point, David's table breaks out of the div by 50% of its border on each side. Nate's still works. Put a border-collapse:collapse style on Nate's table and his breaks now too. It's the border-collapse that is causing it!
