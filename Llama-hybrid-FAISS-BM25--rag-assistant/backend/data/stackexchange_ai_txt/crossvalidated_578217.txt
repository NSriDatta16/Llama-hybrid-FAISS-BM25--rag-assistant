Should $3\!-\!$pointers be worth $2.5{\it ?}$

I was seeking an alternative scoring rule sets instead of three points for a win (gained more engaging and balanced) to cancel the theory " Banking a draw meaning a new kind of loss ". It's kind of unreal to assess the consequences of individual changes on game dynamics and appeal . The changes allow for novel strategic and tactical patterns to emerge, while keeping the games close to the original. Overviewing Premier League's seasons from 2013 through 2022, I realized this subtle relationship between Predicted points and Goals differential in cases: . 3.0 points for a win $\texttt{Predicted points}= .63\cdot\texttt{Differential}+ 52$ . 2.5 points for a win $\texttt{Predicted points}= .52\cdot\texttt{Differential}+ 45$ . 2.0 points for a win $\texttt{Predicted points}= .41\cdot\texttt{Differential}+ 38$ Because $\sum\texttt{Differential}= 0$ so in the system of 2.5 points for a win, its slope meaning the position of the "median" team (52th percentile, $52\%$ ), its intercept meaning the average of the "median" team (48th percentile, $= 45/95= 48\%$ ). That's why I doubted it would be, maybe much better . (The probability of a draw is different from a quarter according Skellam distribution.) I wish to see your discovery demonstrate the rich possibilities lying beyond the rules of modern football.
