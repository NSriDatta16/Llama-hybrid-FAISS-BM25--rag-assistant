Merchants and software vendors must be certified by PCI and report their compliance with the industry standard for consumer security. If any customer of an organization ever pays the organization/merchant directly using a credit card or debit card, then the PCI DSS requirements apply. The Standard can be found on the PCI SSC's Website: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml Related Tags pci-dss
