Have a look at the other applications code, maybe it says System.exit(0) , where a click on the exit button is handled... A JFrame can be configured to "exit on close". Even if it is set to "dispose on close" the VM my terminate after the last displayable (AWT/Swing) window has been closed. I didn't pay attention on first reading: You are using Swing components inside the eclipse framework: that is ... not a good idea. Plugins should only use the SWT library or use the SWT-Swing bridge to show Swing based content.
