The problem is if, at 10:00am, a session starts and the constant is set to 'A', then at 11:00am you change it to 'B', then the session 'blows up' in confusion. The Serially_Reusable pragma may work for you. Basically it won't preserve state between calls. So at 11:0am it will just start using 'B'. If you can be 100% sure that won't break your code, it can work. Re-initializing the constants whenever they are needed may be an overhead. Also look at calling DBMS_SESSION.MODIFY_PACKAGE_STATE or DBMS_SESSION.RESET_PACKAGE at appropriate intervals. That may reduce the number of errors you get. You should also look at Edition-based redefinition in the new 11gR2 . That's a more comprehensive solution, but I guess you'd need to upgrade for that.
