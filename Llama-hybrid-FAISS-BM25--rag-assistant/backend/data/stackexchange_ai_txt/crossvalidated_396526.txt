In the Bayesian theory of probability, probability is our expression of knowledge about a certain thing, not a property of that thing. However, I always see people treat $p$ as a parameter that needs to be estimated. They set up a prior for $p$ , usually in the form of a beta function and then update it as "realizations" of this variable come in. This is irrelevant. It has nothing to do with interpreting the meaning of probability, since this is not about philosophy, but about well defined mathematical object. You see people discussing estimating value of $p$ because you look into statistics handbooks and statistics is about estimating things, but $p$ is a parameter of distribution, it can be known, or unknown. If $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable with probability of "success" $p$ , then $\Pr(X=1) = p$ by definition. So $p$ is a parameter of this distribution, but it is also probability of "success". This makes me confused, because $p$ is not a probability , since it is a property of the random variable and it is not a frequency , since the variable represents a single event. Yes, random variable describes some "single event", so if you are going to toss a coin, the possible outcome is a random variable because it is uncertain. After you tossed the coin and know the outcome, it is no more random, the outcome is certain. As about probability, in frequentist setting you consider hypothetical scenario where you would repeat the coin tossing experiment huge number of times and the probability would be equal to the proportion of heads among those repetitions. In subjective, Bayesian setting , the probability is a measure of how much do you believe that you will observe heads. The above is however irrelevant to question what $p$ is. It is a parameter that is also equal to probability of "success". The question how do you interpret the probability and what does it mean is a different question.
