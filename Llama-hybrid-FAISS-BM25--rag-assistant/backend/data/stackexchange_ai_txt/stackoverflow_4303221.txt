Ok, I'll answer my own question - maybe it will help someone one day - though judging by the lack of interest I'm guessing that this is an obscure case. I've test-driven SoapSonar and it does indeed fit the bill. It has full support for X.509 certificate authentication. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it also has support for load testing and security testing. It'll be a pretty good fit in my organisation as the testers can create test cases using SoapSonar independently of developers. They can manage suites of tests and ensure that there is no regression. So the testing effort should scale as we role out more and more services. The tester works through a UI to create the test cases without needing any programming knowledge which is handy.
