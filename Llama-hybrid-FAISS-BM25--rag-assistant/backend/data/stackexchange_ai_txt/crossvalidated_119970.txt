What's the minimum sample size required to do a time series analysis?

I'd like to know the minimum number of monthly data points required to do time series analysis with the seasonality effect in forecasting. I read some articles & they were saying that 50 or 60 data points are sufficient. Is that the really minimum? Are there any trustful documentation which can be used as literature in this problem? I'd be grateful if anyone can help. Thank you.
