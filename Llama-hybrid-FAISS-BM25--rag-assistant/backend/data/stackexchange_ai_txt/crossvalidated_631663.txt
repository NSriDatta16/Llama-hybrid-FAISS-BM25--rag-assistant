If you do not have "real" rates, i.e. a ratio of events per unit time, then you cannot form a rate ratio. A rate ratio would be one rate, i.e. 23 deaths/100,00 population/year divided by another rate, say 10 deaths/100,000 population/year. So the rate ratio would be 2.3 and its interpretation would be that the first population have 2.3 times the yearly risk of death compared to the second population. Poisson regression is an available option for such a data situation. If you have no time of exposure or time of observation information to analyze, the usual fallback is to use the ratio of events to number of individuals exposed or observed in treatment groups of control groups. The odds of an event are easier to analyse statistically with logistic regression than using what might be seen as the more natural choice of analyzing the proportions. The odds are number of events divide by the number of non-events. The first number could be formed from data like "161 deaths from a population of 700,000 in one year" or "322 death from the same population over 2 years". Similarly the second rate could be derived from data that accumulated "5 deaths from a population of 50,000 in one year". Obviously there are assumptions of uniformity in risk over time and within populations that might need examination. Your hypothesized data is really only susceptible to analysis of differences in proportions or odds. Logistic regression lets you estimate log-odds and log-odds ratios from the original counts. Beta regression lets you analyze ratios, i.e., proportions. The fact that the article is behind a paywall is a barrier to my further comment on it.
