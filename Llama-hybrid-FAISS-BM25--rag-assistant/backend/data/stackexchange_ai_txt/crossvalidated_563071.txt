How to compare row entries in a sparse table with lots of missing values?

I have a dataset with ~1000 laptops and performance results across ~100 different benchmarks. Using the benchmark results, I want to give each laptop a single composite performance score, and rank the laptops according to it. Now, the problem is, the table is very "sparse" – each laptop is tested against at most about ~50 benchmarks. The benchmarks are weakly correlated – laptop performance in real-world tasks is difficult to model, and is balanced by lots of different components: CPU Single-core & Multi-core performance, number of hardware and software threads in a CPU, GPU, RAM & storage speed, software optimizations at the level of OS, graphics APIs, and even benchmarks themselves. Plotting a regression trendline I get an R^2 value of 0.3-0.6. The values within 1 benchmark are linearly comparable with each other. Let's simplify the dataset down to a dozen laptops with only 2 benchmark results: +-------+------+ | Alpha | Beta | +-------+------+ | 1673 | - | | 9858 | - | | - | 588 | | 1212 | 420 | | 442 | - | | - | 521 | | 3612 | 425 | | 6529 | 437 | | 3179 | - | | 3474 | 440 | | - | 424 | | 9779 | - | +-------+------+ How would I go about comparing the rows with each other, without dropping any rows or columns ? One solution I've came up with is to: Calculate the percentage ranking of each entry in its column: $\frac{value-min}{max-min}$ Do a weighed sum of each column's score Normalize the weights
