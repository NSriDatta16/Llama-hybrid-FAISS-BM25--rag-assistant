All of the regression design applies to the features, not to the outcome. Engineer your features as you would for an ANOVA linear regression. Then run it through a logistic regression. This is part of the beauty of generalized linear models, that so much of linear regression translates to generalized linear models like logistic regression, just with a link function and a method of parameter estimation that differs from minimizing the sum of squares residuals. The usual ANOVA would be $\mathbb E[y\vert X]=X\beta_{ols}$ . The logistic regression is $g(\mathbb E[y\vert X])=X\beta_{logistic}$ for the same $X$ and $g(z)=\log(\frac{z}{1-z})$ .
