The results of pragma key when passed a text value vs a raw hex value are not interchangeable. If you provide a text key via PRAGMA key='demo', SQLCipher uses PBKDF2 to derive the key data (see http://sqlcipher.net/design ). This uses a random per-database salt and 4000 iterations by default. If you provide a hex key then SQLCipher uses the binary value as the key directly with no derivation. Thus, the actual encryption key will be quite different beween the two modes you mentioned. If you are not sure which to use, you should probably default to using the first method, as the key derivation step provides a greater level of protection against brute force and dictionary attacks. I'll try to update the readme in the future to make this more clear.
