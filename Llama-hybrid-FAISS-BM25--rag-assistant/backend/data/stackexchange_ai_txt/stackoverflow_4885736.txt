Search with ASP.net and SQL Server 2008

I'm about to embark on the ASP.net project which involves building a pretty powerful search function. The application is very database heavy. Essentially, organisations will be adding a lot of metadata about themselves in the form of multi-selects, free text boxes etc. which are all stored in SQL 2008. When it comes to search I'm loath to re-invent the wheel. Normally with a content driven site I'd use a component such as Zoom Search or ASP.net Search engine (http://www.aspnetsearchengine.com/UltimateSearch/Features.aspx) But I don't think these type of content driven search controls are apppropriate for what I need given the data driven nature of the search. I'm thinking full text search is the way to go but then I'm thinking I'll probably lose a lot of the bells and whistles I'd typically get with a packaged search module like spelling suggestions, document search, synonyms, ignore words etc. Are there any good hybrid solutions (paid or free) for .net sites that provides these nice features within a search framework of sorts? Thanks, Ed
