whuber is right that, technically, statistical inference will not be accurate if randomization was not used. However, in practice, random sampling is often impossible, so it is common (and inevitable and unfortunate) practice that people use inference on non-random samples and generalize the results to the entire population from which the sample was drawn. The actual conclusions that you can confidently make is to simply describe the sample without generalizing the results to others in the population. For example, let's say group 1 had a higher average score on a certain test than group 2. You can conclude that, among the children you measured, group 1 scored higher on the test than group 2. In this case, you are only comparing the 5 children in group1 with the 5 in group 2, and inference is not used (i.e., p-vaues and confidence intervals would not make sense). Simply calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, population standard deviation, etc. to describe your data. Keep in mind that you can still run various tests or calculate effect sizes without using inference. For example, you can calculate Cohen's d between group 1 and 2 on a test. You can use ANCOVA and find the mean difference of test score between the groups while controlling for the effect of age and gender. I think some people do not realize that things like ANOVA or multiple regression can be used for descriptive statistics.
