I would treat riskiness as a continuous outcome and see if there are differences in the average riskiness between males and females. Moreover, it seems that you have a crossed design. Hence, I would start with a model of the form (using function lmer() from the R package lme4 ): fm The coefficient for gender will denote the difference in the average riskiness between males and females. In addition, you could also consider whether the differences you may see between males and females are attributed to other factors, e.g., age, education, etc. In this case, you may want to also control for these variables in your model.
