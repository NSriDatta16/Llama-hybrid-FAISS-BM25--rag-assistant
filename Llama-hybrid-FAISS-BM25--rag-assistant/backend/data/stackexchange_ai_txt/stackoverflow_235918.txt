My best advice is to look at your compiler's documentation, because pragmas are by definition implementation-specific. For instance, in embedded projects I've used them to locate code and data in different sections, or declare interrupt handlers. i.e.: #pragma code BANK1 #pragma data BANK2 #pragma INT3 TimerHandler
