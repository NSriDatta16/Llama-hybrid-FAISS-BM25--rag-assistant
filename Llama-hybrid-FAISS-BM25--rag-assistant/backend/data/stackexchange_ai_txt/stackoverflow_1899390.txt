When the compiler is built, it knows about a few standard locations to look for header file. Some of them are independent of where the compiler is installed (such as /usr/include, /usr/local/include, etc.) and some of the are based on where the compiler is installed (which for gcc, is controlled by the --prefix option when running configure). Locations like /usr/include are well known and 'knowledge' of that location is built into gcc. Locations like /usr/local/include is not considered completely standard and can be set when gcc is built with the --with-local-prefix option of configure. That said, you can add new directories for where to search for include files using the compiler -I command line option. When trying to include a file, it will look in the directories specified with the -I flag before the directories I talked about in the first paragraph.
