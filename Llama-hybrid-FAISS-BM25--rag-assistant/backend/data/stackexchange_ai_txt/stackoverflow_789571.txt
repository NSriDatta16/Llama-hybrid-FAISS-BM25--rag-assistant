Very simply, if you are comfortable with JSPs and Servlets, then if you want to save some of the drudgery of web programming, I would look at Stripes or Struts 2. I am very familiar with Stripes, and only am aware that Struts 2 is similar, so I will focus this entry on Stripes. As an aside, Struts 1 is worthless. It offers no value (frankly). Stripes has several features, but I will focus on only a few. The primary value of Stripes, and if this were it's only feature it would still be very valuable, is its binding framework. Binding is the process of converting the requests string values in to the actions values. Stripes does this amazingly well. Specifically, Stripes binding does very well on nested and indexed parameters, as well as type conversions. You can easily have a form field named "currentDate" and then have a "Date currentDate" in your Action, and Stripes will "do the right thing". If you have a form field named "mainMap['bob'].listOfThings[3].customer.birthDate", Stripes will make the map, create the list, create the customer, convert the string to a date, populate the birthDate, put the customer in the 3 slot of the list, and put that list in the 'bob' spot of the map. (I do stuff like this all the time.) The binding of requests to Action variables is just wonderful. On top of that you get, if you use their form tags, you get nice behaviors when, for example, they put "Fred" in your date field. You easily get the form back, with Fred in the field, and a nice error message. Finally, I really like their Resolutions as a result from their Actions. For example, a ForwardResolution to forward to a page, RedirectResolution to redirect to a page, StreamingResolution if you want to pump data down the socket, etc. It's a very elegant feature. Stripes has all sorts of power and does all sorts of things, but those 3 pieces are what make it best for me, and what I use 99% of the time. Simply, it really stays out of the way and readily handles the "plumbing" without completely obscuring the HTTP request nature of the system. For someone who is content with JSP/Servlets, Stripes I think is an excellent step up as it adds good, solid value with very little cost (it's simple to set up) and without having to toss out everything you already know, since it works just great with JSPs and JSTL. Learn the simple mechanism it uses to map Actions to URLs, and how simple it is to map requests to your actions, and you'll be flying in no time. Works great with Ajax and the like as well.
