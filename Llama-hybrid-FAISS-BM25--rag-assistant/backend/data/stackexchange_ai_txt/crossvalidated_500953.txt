How to analyse count data that include 0 as a category?

I'm testing the yield of corn subject to two treatments: Temperature (Cold and Warm) and Light Color (Red, Blue, Natural.) The number of plants per plot that produced no cobs, one cob, two cobs and three cobs were counted. #Several replicates were made, but only one plot per combination of treatments #is shown in this example. temp = c('cold','cold','cold','warm','warm','warm') light = c('red','blue','natural','red','blue','natural') zer_cob = c(8,7,3,0,2,0) one_cob = c(5,2,7,1,0,2) two_cob = c(0,2,4,8,7,0) thr_cob = c(1,0,0,9,8,6) total_plants = zer_cob + one_cob + two_cob + thr_cob data = data.frame(temp, light,zer_cob,one_cob,two_cob,thr_cob,total_plants) Twenty plants were planted in each plot, but only the number in total_plants survived at the end - so the number of plants per plot varies. I want to determine if the treatments produce different yield. My initial plan was to obtain a weighted average of produced cobs for each row and perform an ANOVA, but this will be incomplete as the number of plants per plot differ and I don't want to lose that information (and cold has a higher plant count in the zero-one bracket, while warm does in the two-three bracket). Someone has a recommendation of how to better analyse this dataset?
