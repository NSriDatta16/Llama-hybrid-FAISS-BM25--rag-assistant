What kind of test can I perform to show relationship of numeric dependent variable with numeric independent variable in before and after type study?

I have a test data of a certain group of patients for their heart rate, blood pressure, BMI, and other demographics. These data were measure before and after they began their fitness sessions. So, we measured before they attended as “pre” data, and after each session they attended as “post” data. We also noted the number of sessions they have attended and used that measurements as post. What I want to do is see how blood pressure, BMI, and heart rate improved for the group of patients by number of sessions they attended. I wanna do it two ways: one keeping sessions as numeric values, and next analysis by categorizing it into four groups - 30. I’m using R. Data looks like the following: This is only a sample. The actual data consists of a many other variables for 180 patients. Pre.hr What kind of tests can I perform to show the relationship of fitness sessions attended with the improvement of the numbers. I want to be able to say, this is the number of sessions that should be taken to see improvement in blood pressure or BMI or something like that.
