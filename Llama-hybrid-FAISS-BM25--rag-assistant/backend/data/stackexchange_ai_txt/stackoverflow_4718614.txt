You can do this using NULL values. If you use NULL instead of " H ", MySQL will ignore the row when evaluating the UNIQUE constraint : A UNIQUE index creates a constraint such that all values in the index must be distinct. An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key value that matches an existing row. This constraint does not apply to NULL values except for the BDB storage engine. For other engines, a UNIQUE index permits multiple NULL values for columns that can contain NULL. Now, this is cheating a bit, and it means that you can't have your data exactly as you want it. So this solution may not fit your needs. But if you can rework your data in this way, it should work.
