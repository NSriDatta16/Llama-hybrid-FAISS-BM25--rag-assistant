I would say it depends how you're going to use the data later on. Option 1 will be easier to set up initially, but if you're then going to always be trying to separate the data for processing/display etc later on, then Option 2 might be easier in the long run. DCookie has done a good job in explaining that Option 2 has no technical benefits for storage. It therefore boils down to whatever processing you're going to be doing with it. I want all the raw results (for all tests) in one table ( RESULTS ). If your feeling is that it makes most sense to put it all in one table, then do that.
