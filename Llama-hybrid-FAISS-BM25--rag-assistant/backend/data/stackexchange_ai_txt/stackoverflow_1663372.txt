TL;DR version: As an email client, you cannot reliably retrieve the BCC field. Of course it's missing the BCC field. Once used to direct an email it's removed from the message. BCC means Blind Carbon Copy. And is used to copy people on messages without giving their addresses out to every one else receiving the message. If the incoming email still had this information it wouldn't serve it's purpose. You should probably read the section RFC 2822 about addressing. What you're asking about isn't explicitly defined and becoming implementation dependent. The Mail User Agent (Outlook/Thunderbird/Gmail/etc) or the Mail Transport/Submission Agents (any program that routes the message to you) could be stripping the data you want before you get it.
