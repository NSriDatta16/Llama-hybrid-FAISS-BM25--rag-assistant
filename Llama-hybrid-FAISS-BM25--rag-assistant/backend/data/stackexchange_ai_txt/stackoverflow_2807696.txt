The cause is if you passed the data parameter when creating a dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore . The store uses the object directly. In the source code, you can see this._arrayOfTopLevelItems = dataObject.items; . So the two stores you created used the same array object as the back-end storage. So a change you made in one widget also changed the other widget. By using array literals, you actually created two distinct objects, then it should be fine. Two widgets will not interfere with each other. My solution to this case is to use dojo.clone to create a copy of the data, then use the copy to create the store.
