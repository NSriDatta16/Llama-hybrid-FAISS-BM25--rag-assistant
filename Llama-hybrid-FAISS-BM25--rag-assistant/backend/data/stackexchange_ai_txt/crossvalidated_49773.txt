How to design good plots for multiple time series?

I have huge (about 100 000) set of time series. I need to show between 5 to 10 time series, chosen semi-randomly on one chart. Chart estate is very limited - plot for each time series is only 100px x 800px. It is not possible o predict which time series will be shown together - they have to be plot independently. Ranges of all variables are very different: for one time series it can be between 0-3000 and for another 0 to 50. General range of all variables is 0-60000. I want to use horizon graphs: http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/more-on-horizon-charts.html but, if I make plots using 4 bands almost all time series will look flat. If I plot using 32 bands - plots will change from horizon charts, to heatmap charts. Is it good idea, to set bands range not uniform? i.e. 1st band: 0-100, 2nd: 100-1000 3rd: 1000-5000, 4th: 5000-60000.
