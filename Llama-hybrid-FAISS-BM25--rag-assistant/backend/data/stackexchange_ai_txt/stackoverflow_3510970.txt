What is the best method for creating a layer to catch touch events?

I need to put up an info screen above the main interface, but I need it to be alpha'd so you can see the interface underneath it. However, when I touch across the screen, the interface underneath is still running. What is the best method for intercepting the touch events so they don't pass through? I tried to add a custom UIButton the size of the screen, but that didn't work either :( There is too much code to post here unfortunately. The view is hundreds of lines long, but the important bit is adding the overlayed subview, which is like this: InfoScreen *infoScreen = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame]; UIButton *invisibleButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom]; invisibleButton.frame = self.view.frame; [self.view addSubview:invisibleButton]; [self.view addSubview:infoScreen]; I am using touchesBegan, touchesMoved, touchesEnded and touchesCancelled in the view below. Is this possibly why the touches are getting through? Thanks! :-Joe
