Compare shapes with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

I have two time series, both 100 points length: I would like to perform the goodness of fit to know if these two series have same or similar shape or if they differs significantly. I have read about the K/S test for 1 sample and it seems it compares the serie with a normal or gaussian distribution. I do not want to compare my two series with two standard gaussian shapes, I only want to know if they are similar or different. I have found this class for the K/S test http://www.jsc.nildram.co.uk/api/index.html Here are my questions: 1) is the K/S two sample test the best one for non parametric test with series.length() 2) are there other statistical test to compare shapes? 3) the jsc Java class has some different methods, which one should I have to use to return how much my series differs? Thanks all.
