Why do birth death processes follow detailed balance equations?

I am following a lecture series on Markov Chains from MIT OCW over here . The lecture (and the notes) state that for birth death processes, the detailed balance equations hold. $$\pi_{i}P_{ij} = \pi_{j}P_{ji}$$ Here, $\pi$ represents the stationary distribution at some node $i$ and $P$ represents the probability of going from state $i$ to $j$
