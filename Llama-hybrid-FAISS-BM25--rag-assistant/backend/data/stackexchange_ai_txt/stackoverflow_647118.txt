You can implement it however you choose. If you use a linked-list approach your insertion will be O(1) but your retrieval and deletion will be O(n). If you use something more complex like a red-black tree you'll have much better average performance. If you're implementing it yourself linked-list is probably the easiest, otherwise grabbing some appropriately licensed red-black or other type of tree from the internet would be the best option. Implementing your own red-black tree is not recommended... I've done this and would prefer not to do it again. And to answer a question you didn't ask: maybe you should reexamine whether porting to C from C++ really provides all the benefits you wanted. Certainly there are situations where it could be necessary, but there aren't many.
