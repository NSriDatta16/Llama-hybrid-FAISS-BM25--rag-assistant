I think that I can re-arrange Winkler's argument to make it a little more convincing. You're given an arrangement of dots on a table. You also have a big template made of coins glued together in a honeycomb pattern. You now do a Monte Carlo simulation, repeatedly throwing the honeycomb on the table at a random location (but always with the same orientation), and counting the number of covered dots. If you get enough samples you will eventually find that the expected average number of dots covered is 9.069 per throw. The key insight is that if the average is 9.069, there must have been a throw where 10 dots were covered. Because if you never covered 10 dots, the average would be 9 or less. So now you know that there was at least one throw that covered 10 dots. You duplicate that throw, and remove all the coins that aren't covering a dot. There will be 10 or fewer coins remaining. A small digression: Is it possible that for some clever arrangement of dots the long range average of covered dots is something other than 9.069? The answer is no, because each of the dots can be considered separately. In other words, in 10000 throws of the honeycomb, the expected number each dot will be covered is 9069 times. So we expect a total of 90690 dots to be covered, for an average of 9.069 per throw.
