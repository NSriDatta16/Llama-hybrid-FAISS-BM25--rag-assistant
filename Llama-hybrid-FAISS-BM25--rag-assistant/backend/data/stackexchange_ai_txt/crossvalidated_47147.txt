You correctly note that you cannot use "usual" formulas to calculate confidence intervals for the mean, since your data is not normally distributed. One possibility would be bootstrapping the mean and extracting bootstrap confidence intervals . However, I would argue that confidence intervals for the mean are not necessarily best to describe your data. Instead, I suggest you look at simple quantiles. For instance, a given post may be rated 4.5 on average, and the 25% quantile may be 3.5 (that is, 25% of respondents rated lower than 3.5), while the 75% quantile may be 4.8 (that is, 25% of respondents rated higher than 4.8). Thus, you could say that 50% (75%-25%) rated it between 3.5 and 4.8. Could you clarify what question you are trying to answer?
