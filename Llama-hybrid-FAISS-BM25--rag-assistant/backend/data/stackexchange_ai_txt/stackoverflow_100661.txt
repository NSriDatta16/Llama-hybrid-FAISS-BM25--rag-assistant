Calculate Average Lines of Code per Method for Javascript

Are there any tools available for calculating the average number of lines of code per method ? I want to know the average size of each method, not just the total number of lines in the project. The per method count will allow me to measure how simple each method is. This will be calculated as part of the build process, and displayed on a dashboard. The idea being that we can see if the average size of each method is increasing. And this will flag the possibility that code complexity is increasing and we may need to think about refactoring.
