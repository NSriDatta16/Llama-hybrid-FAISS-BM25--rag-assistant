There are not many ways to regexp an url that is compliant with rfc3986 As a C string, the regex will be: "^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*)|///)?([^?#]*)(\\?[^#]*)?(#.*)?" enum { URL = 0, SCHEME_CLN = 1, SCHEME = 2, DSLASH_AUTH = 3, AUTHORITY = 4, PATH = 5, QUERY = 6, FRAGMENT = 7 }; Where the enum denotes what capture indexes correspond to which url parts.
