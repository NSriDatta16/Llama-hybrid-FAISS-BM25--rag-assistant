Grid_search (RandomizedSearchCV) extremely slow with SVM (SVC)

I'm testing hyperparameters for an SVM, however, when I resort to Gridsearch or RandomizedSearchCV, I haven't been able to get a resolution, because the processing time is exceeding hours. My dataset is relatively small: 4303 rows and 67 attributes, with four classes (classification problem) Here are the tested parameters: params =[{'C': [0.1,1, 10, 100], 'kernel': ['poly','sigmoid','linear','rbf'], 'gamma': [1,0.1,0.01,0.001]} ] sv = SVC() clf = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=sv, cv = 3, param_distributions=params, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs = -1, verbose=1) clf.fit(X, y) print("Best parameters:", clf.best_params_) print("better accuracy: ", (clf.best_score_)**(1/2.0)) I've already reduced the number of parameters and the number of cvs, but I still can't get a result that doesn't take hours of processing. Is it possible to optimize this process? Am I making a mistake regarding gridsearch or SVM?
