It seems like serial multiple linear regressions, removing independent variables one by one and using the change in R2 as a measure of the importance of each scale is the way to go. It seems multilevel modelling is typically used where the levels refer to cases/units - i.e. the cases aorm mutually exclusive groups (the typical "pupils in various schools" scenario). What I wanted was a way to hierarchically evaluate the relevance of variables. What I can do using MLR, from what i understand, is batch remove/add the subscales to evaluate their grouped relevance. Time to properly learn pandas, i guess... (All science leads to learning data science...)
