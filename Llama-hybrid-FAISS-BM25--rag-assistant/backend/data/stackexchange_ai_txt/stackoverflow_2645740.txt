Here's an explanation from the man himself : $y = "some test"; foreach ($myarray as $y) { print "$y\n"; } Here $y is a symbol table entry referencing a string containing "some test". On the first iteration you essentially do: $y = $myarray[0]; // Not necessarily 0, just the 1st element So now the storage associated with $y is overwritten by the value from $myarray . If $y is associated with some other storage through a reference, that storage will be changed. Now let's say you do this: $myarray = array("Test"); $a = "A string"; $y = &$a; foreach ($myarray as $y) { print "$y\n"; } Here $y is associated with the same storage as $a through a reference so when the first iteration does: $y = $myarray[0]; The only place that "Test" string can go is into the storage associated with $y .
