if you have margin: 0 0 20px 0; - you can remove the last 0 as this is the left margin which is the same as the right. There are a few online tools that can optimize css if you google for them(e.g. http://flumpcakes.co.uk/css/optimiser/ ). There is a fine line between optimisation and maintainability though. If you remove all the comments etc that will make the file smaller but less maintainable. Again you can remove all the line breaks to make a smaller file but not sure that is better. I would probably not use a reset. To me you CSS seems pretty compact already.
