How do I control access to my server-side data?

I have created an iPhone application which fetches data held on a server in an XML file. How do I check that the request for the data is coming from my app and not from some other source such as another iPhone app or a desktop browser since currently you could just trace the iPhone request on your LAN with Wireshark and then use the captured URL to load the data in a desktop browser. I'm thinking I'm going to need to serve the file via PHP or something and use some sort of User Agent validation or a challenge-response sequence. If someone could provide a code sample I'd appreciate it.
