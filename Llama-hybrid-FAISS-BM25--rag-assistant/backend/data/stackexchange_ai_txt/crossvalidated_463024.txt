What is the best way of reducing the number of independent variables of a GLMM?

I am trying to model the abundance of beach litter across different beaches by using (currently) 13 independent variables. I have a very big dataset and therefore think that it is acceptable to use quite a lot of ind variables but I know that some of them are correlated to some degree. However, I do think that choosing between either one of the two correlated variables might reduce the power of the model, as it makes sense that both might have an effect on the dependent from a biological point of view. Finally I just wanted to point out that the sampling was not done by me but by volunteers and therefore the data is both biased and datapoints are not really independent (which is why I'm using a GLMM). I am considering either using PCA but I feel that having 2000+ sample points would make this very hard, otherwise I have tried to do perform a stepwise regression with AIC as the criterion but have read in another post that this is usually not the best way of going about it.
