(Ruby) If the array intersection operator ( & ) is inefficient, why is it available?

I asked a question yesterday about comparing ranges for overlap and its been stuck in my throat ever since. The consensus seems to be that my preferred answer which involves using the array intersection operator (&), is inefficient because comparing arrays is costly. I wonder then, why this feature is in the language? Could it be that the language creators believed that sometimes you need an elegant way to achieve a solution even if it's expensive to do so? Is comparing arrays so costly that you should avoid it whenever possible? The whole attraction of Ruby for me is the focus on syntactic elegance over premature optimization.
