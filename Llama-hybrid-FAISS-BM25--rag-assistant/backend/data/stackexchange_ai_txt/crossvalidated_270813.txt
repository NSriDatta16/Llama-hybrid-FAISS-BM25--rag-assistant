It probably depends on your point of view. Many methods can be studied from different angles! and that can be a useful exercise. But, mostly logistic regression is a probability model used for risk estimation. Support vector machines, on the other hand, is just searching for a separating hyperplane, there is no underlying probability model, and it is not clear (at least not for me) how they can be used for risk estimation. So I would say the answer is mostly no, they are not different representations of the same model. See also Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? of which this is maybe a duplicate.
