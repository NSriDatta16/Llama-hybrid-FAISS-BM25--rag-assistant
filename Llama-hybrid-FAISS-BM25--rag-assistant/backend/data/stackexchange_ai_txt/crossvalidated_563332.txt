Statistical test for significance for plant growth over time. Is one-way ANOVA test appropriate?

I conducted an experiment where I had five different conditions and I measured plants growth. There were five trials for each condition. The plant's height was measured 8 times over 23 days. Can I do a one-way ANOVA test for these results? This is what I have tried so far: One way ANOVA repeated measures. -- I thought repeated measures because each day's average would be paired? The numbers I put in for each treatment are the average of the five trials for each condition. They are in order for which day it was. Is this correct? Any help would be much appreciated! I want to know if this is the right way to do it or if I'm just completely wrong. I want to know if there is a statistically significant relationship between my conditions and plant height. EDIT: The conditions were different amounts of a substance, so different levels of a continuous variable.
