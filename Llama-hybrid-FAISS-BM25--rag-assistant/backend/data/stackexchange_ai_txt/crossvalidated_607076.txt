Cox PH model HR - is it possible to measure against the general average?

Reproducible example: require(finalfit) require(dplyr) set.seed(42) a % coxphuni(dependent, explanatory) %>% finalfit::fit2df() -> coxphdf The table coxphdf gives a HR for bB and bC, taking bA as a reference. Instead of this, would it be possible to measure hazard against the general average? I.e. calculate survival without regard to "b", and then saying that compared to this, belonging to "A" raises/lowers the risk by x, etc. In my real data it does not really make sense to make any of the factor levels reference, and I don't want to lose a category, if possible. If what I am trying to do is possible, how would I need to transform the data to achieve this?
