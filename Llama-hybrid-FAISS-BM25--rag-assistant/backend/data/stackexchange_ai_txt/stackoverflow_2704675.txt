These are the steps to use the Adobe PDF Reader control: Create a new Windows Forms Application: File → New Project… → Windows Forms Application → OK Add a reference to the Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Browser Control Type Library 1.0: Project → Add Reference… → COM → Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Browser Control Type Library 1.0 → OK Add the Adobe PDF Reader control to the Toolbox: Tools → Choose ToolBox Items… → COM Components → Adobe PDF Reader → OK Drag an Adobe PDF Reader control from your toolbox into the Form I'm not sure why but I have to run Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition with administrative privileges to get this working. With a limited user I get this message in the designer: Error HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component. Note that after adding the Adobe PDF Reader control to your toolbox a new .NET interop assembly has been created with the name AxInterop.AcroPDFLib.dll . A reference to this new assembly has been added to your project references. API reference documentation for the Adobe PDF Reader control is located here: http://icio.us/ajukkr This forum thread provides some more useful information: http://forums.adobe.com/thread/438362
