Your VIF values are extreme, and your residuals plot is a right-opening megaphone (vice a null plot, which is what you want). It looks like the residual plot is being strongly affected by BTC. If I were working this I would look into Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for two reasons: 1) It can help mitigate your multicollinearity and drive down your VIFs 2) It can reduce the number of predictor variables you're using (linear regression is better on fewer variables) I would also consider removing the BTC data point just to see what happens . This can give you some insights that can help you build the model. Good luck!
