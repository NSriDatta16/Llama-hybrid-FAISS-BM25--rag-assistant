TFS and code coverage for web application (MVC) assemblies not working

I've got an MVC web application with associated controller tests that run under a TFS build as per normal. I can see the tests running and passing in the build log and they appear in the "Result details for Any CPU/Release" section of the build I also have a number of other assemblies with associated tests that are running in the same build. Tests are passing and the details are being shown in the results and logs just fine. I've enabled code coverage in the build script and the testrunconfig. The coverage is appearing for all assemblies EXCEPT the web application even though it looks like the tests have been run for it. Is there anything obvious that I have missed or some sort of work around that I need to do? I've searched around for a while and haven't found an answer. Has anyone got code coverage working for MVC web applications using TFS?
