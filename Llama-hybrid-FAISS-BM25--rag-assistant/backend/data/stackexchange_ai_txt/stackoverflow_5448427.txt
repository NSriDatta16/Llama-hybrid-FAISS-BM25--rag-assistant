Assuming your list of numbers is in ascending order you could do a binary search in the array. So when looking for the key x, you would start at index array.length/2, compare the key at that position with x and continue with the left part if it was greater than x or with the right part if it was less than x. Continue until you've found the closest key to x. Thats very fast (in your case about log(4000) ~ 12 array lookups) and does not need additional storage.
