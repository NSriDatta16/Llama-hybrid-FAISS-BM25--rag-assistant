In general I think the area you need to search around in is "Vector Quantization". I've got an old book title Vector Quantization and Signal Compression by Allen Gersho and Robert M. Gray which provides a bunch of examples. From memory, the Lloyd Iteration was a good algorithm for this sort of thing. It can take the input set and reduce it to a fixed sized set of points. Basically, uniformly or randomly distribute your points around the space. Map each of your inputs to the nearest quantized point. Then compute the error (e.g. sum of distances or Root-Mean-Squared). Then, for each output point, set it to the center of the set that maps to it. This will move the point and possibly even change the set that maps to it. Perform this iteratively until no changes are detected from one iteration to the next. Hope this helps.
