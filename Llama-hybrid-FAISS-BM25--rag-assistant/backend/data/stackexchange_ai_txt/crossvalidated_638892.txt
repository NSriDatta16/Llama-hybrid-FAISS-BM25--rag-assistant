Repeated testing of one widget will allow you to determine the magnitude of measurement variation (noise) and, maybe, if there are time or test-dependent changes in the performance. Those things are important, but they should typically be determined in advance of performing an experiment to determine the effect of the coating. The statistical test of the effect of coating should be based mostly on the variation between widgets rather than measurements, as the test intervention (coating) is per widget, not per measurement. In many settings the measurement noise is small compared to the inter-widget variability, and that means that there is no substantial benefit to measuring more than once. However, if your system yields measurement noise that is too large to ignore then averaging multiple measurements is a good way to deal with it. The number of measurements to average depends on the measurement variability relative to the inter-widget variation. In your statistical test of the coating, an independent (i.e. unpaired) t-test sounds more appropriate unless you have more relatedness within your proposed pairs than is apparent to me. For power calculations for the effect of coating you need to first have a design in mind so that you can input the expected standard deviation into the calculation. That means that you need preliminary tests of the measurement noise and a decision on how many measurements to average. You also need either a realistic estimate of the effect of the coating to serve as the 'alternative' hypothesis size for the calculation, or an effect size that you would not want to erroneously fail to detect. If measurements are cheap (inexpensive, easy, quick) then make lots and average them within a widget. If they are expensive then it is worth your while to perform serious preliminary characterisation of the inter-measurement variation and inter-widget variation.
