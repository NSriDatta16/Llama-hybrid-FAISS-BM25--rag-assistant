How to use discrete wavelet transformation to decompose non-time series data

I want to decompose x from the ames housing data using discrete wavelet transform (dwt) and integrate it to a linear regression model lm() to predict the sale price Here is the code I used library(wavelets) library(waveslim) library(AmesHousing) ames I got this error Error in dwt(x) : 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double' Is this the right approach to achieve my objectives? If not, can you recommend another approach? I want to use discrete wavelet decomposition for non-time series data.
