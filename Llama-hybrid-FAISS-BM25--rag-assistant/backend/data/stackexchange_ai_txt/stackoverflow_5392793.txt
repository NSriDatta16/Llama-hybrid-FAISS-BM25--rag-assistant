How to correctly process XSL transformation in IE and get result as a document fragment

I need to do XSL transformation in the browser using JavaScript. When i'm doing this in the modern browsers, such as FF or Chrome i can do something like this: var proc = new XSLTProcessor(); proc.importStylesheet(xslDoc); return proc.transformToFragment(xmlDoc, targetDocument); But with IE i can only transform to a new document var newDoc = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM"); xmlDoc.transformNodeToObject(xslDoc, newDoc); return newDoc; ... or transform to text return xmlDoc.transformNode(xslDoc); Transforming to text leading to huge perfomace issues (i need to append the result to my current document's DOM tree), transforming to new doc leading to doing adopt/importNode at last. Is there a better way of doing XSL transformation in IE with further appending result to a DOM tree?
