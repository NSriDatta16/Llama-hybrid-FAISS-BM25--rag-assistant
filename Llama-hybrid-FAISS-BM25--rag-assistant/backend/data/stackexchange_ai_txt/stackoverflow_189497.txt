If anyone is interested in performance of the above solutions, here they are for 4000x4000 grids, from fastest to slowest: Brian : 1.08s (modified, with izip instead of zip ) John : 2.33s DzinX : 2.36s ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ : 2.41s (but object initialization took 62s) Eugene : 3.17s Robert : 4.56s Brian : 27.24s (original, with zip ) EDIT : Added Brian's scores with izip modification and it won by a large amount! John's solution is also very fast, although it uses indices (I was really surprised to see this!), whereas Robert's and Brian's (with zip ) are slower than the question creator's initial solution. So let's present Brian 's winning function, as it is not shown in proper form anywhere in this thread: from itertools import izip for a_row,b_row in izip(alist, blist): for a_item, b_item in izip(a_row,b_row): if a_item.isWhatever: b_item.doSomething()
