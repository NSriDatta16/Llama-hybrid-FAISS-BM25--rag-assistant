representative diagram of .net framework Bace class library for better understanding of Types and Members Cooperations

Is it possible to get any representative diagram (such as object diagram or class diagram) from .Net types of a name space. The diagram could represent the relations and dependencies between the .Net types and members, and we could understand better the structure of portion of a namespace. instead of looking at MSDN texts. For example, I like to know the organization of system.configuration namespace important members.
