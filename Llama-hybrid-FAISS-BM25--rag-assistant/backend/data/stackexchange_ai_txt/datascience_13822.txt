Machine Learning to Get X, Y Coordinates From Picture of Plot

I am currently on a project where we have people place sticky notes on a X-Y axis to plot their beliefs on certain topics. These sticky notes can be of different colors to reflect different levels of their beliefs. What we are then left with is a picture that we take of the various plots to base our findings on. I am hoping to avoid plotting each point individually in a data frame based on the picture. I am also relatively new to utilizing machine learning, specifically in relation to image recognition. I have done a couple of random forest projects, but nothing image processing related. My question is this, using R, is it possible to use a machine learning package to read these pictures and create a data frame of X-Y coordinates of these sticky notes plots? I am open to all suggestions. Thanks for any and all help and let me know if you need any clarification. Edit: Here is an example of what one of the images might look like. Unfortunately, I could only quickly find an X-axis only graph, but we do X and Y-axis graphs as well.
