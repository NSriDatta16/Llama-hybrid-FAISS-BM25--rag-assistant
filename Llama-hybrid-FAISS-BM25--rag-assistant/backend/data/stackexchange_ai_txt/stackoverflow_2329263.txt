I would try the following approach: Have the workers perform the calculations, but only write back the values to the inner cells. For border cells, store the results. When the calculations are complete, wait at a barrier. When all workers are at the first barrier, release then and allow each to write the border cells. Wait at a second barrier while the UI updates Storage required for a n x m tile is 2 * (n + m - 1) , so generally larger tiles (8x8 or more) require proportionately less memory for the cached values.
