Apologies if I misinterpreted the question but here goes: HTTPS is built into the SDK so you can access an encrypted resource using NSURLConnection. As far authenticating you can do it a few ways. With the NSURLConnection delegate you can implement a challenge / response type authentication process. Full run down on them can be found here . You can also do session and cookie based authentication by building a NSURLRequest: [NSURLRequest setHTTPMethod:HTTP_METHOD_POST]; [NSURLRequest setValue:FORM_ENCODING forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"]; [NSURLRequest setHTTPBody:postData]; where post data contains variables to pass for the server side technology to process. I would recommend this way as it is encrypted over HTTPS when sent. If you require access to cookies you can access them via NSHTTPCookieStorage . If you are sending cookies with form data send it with the request: [NSURLRequest setAllHTTPHeaderFields:cookies]; Hope that answers your question, if not let me know and I'll try again.
