Increase in time with SpringLDAP and ModifyAttributes

I have noticed that when I do a call to modifyAttributes via SpringLDAP, the time that it takes to do this increases as the object in the LDAP grows. At first I thought that it was the LDAP that was causing this, but after having turned on Ldap auditing, I noticed that so was not the case. When I have nothing in the ldap objects seeAlso attribute, adding something into it takes roughly 200ms (In Java, 3ms of this is measured on the ldap), however, when I have around 1000 items in the seeAlso attribute, I see a time of roughly 7 seconds (In Java) and less than one second in my ldap audit. I can only assume that it is SpringLdap that adds this time for some reason. Is there anyway I can either investigate further to see where the true bottleneck is, or can I optimize SpringLdap in anyway as to avoid this? DirContextOperations ctx = ldapTemplate.lookupContext(organizationalRole.getDn()); ctx.addAttributeValue(LdapConstants.ATTR_SEEALSO, applicationRoleDN.toString()); ldapTemplate.modifyAttributes(ctx);
