As I said, it's very hard to answer in general. I guess you will be getting a list of answers specific to countries - maybe a good idea to make it Community Wiki. For Germany, according to Wikipedia and other sources: Newly built web sites of federal administrative bodies in Germany have to be accessible by law since 2006. The accessibility guidelines are defined in a directive named BITV (german text here ). BITV follows the WCAG 1.0 Guidelines very closely. Similar laws exist for the country's sixteen states ("LÃ¤nder"). The creation of accessible web sites is encouraged by a number of government and EU initiatives and private initiatives like the BIENE Award (German only). To my knowledge, no plans to enforce accessibility in non-government websites exist at this time. As to why countries implement their own guidelines, among other things, language certainly is an issue: To put guidelines into a law, you need the guidelines in your native language, double-checked by lawyers.
