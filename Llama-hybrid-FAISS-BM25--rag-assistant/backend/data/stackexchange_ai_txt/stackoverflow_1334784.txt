Controls dragged and dropped into the designer are not dynamicalled created. They are statically created and recreated. Theses controls are accessible from the toolbox in most cases. Controls declared in the code behind such as your Button are dynamically created. They MUST be created and recreated programmatically. Theses controls are exclusive to the code behind. However, when using dynamically created controls it is a common practice to use PlaceHolders (this control is not rendered) to position your objects. To do so... Drag and drop a PlaceHolder where you would like your button to be. (designer). Add your Button to the PlaceHolder programmatically. (Code Behind) For instance... Button btnTask = new Button(); btnTask.Content = _myCustomTasks[iCtr].Description; btnTask.Background = _myCustomTasks[iCtr].TaskColor; PlaceHolder1.Controls.Add(btnTask); Hope it helps...
