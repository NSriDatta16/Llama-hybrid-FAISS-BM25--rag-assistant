How to stop deep learning speech model to not recognize stranger voice?

I am trying to figure it out. But I can't find any solution. My model accuracy is 99% and my testing accuracy is 98% I am using softmax for multiclass classification and adam optimizer to reach its final value. I am collecting mfccs and other features of the stranger's voice. But my model does its best to give a label to a stranger's voice. I don't want that. Should I increase the label size by 1 for strangers? Is there any solution?
