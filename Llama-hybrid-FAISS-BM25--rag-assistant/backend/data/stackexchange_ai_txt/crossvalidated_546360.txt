I-map Bayesian Network, Practical Explanation

I am having diffculty understanding the concept of an I-map in the context of Bayesian Networks. According to the PGM textbook by Koller & Friedman, an I-map is essentially a set of conditional independent relationships. Let say we have the following DAG: and we determine the implied conditional independencies to be the following: C ⊥ P D ⊥ F | C D ⊥ L | C D ⊥ P F ⊥ L | C F ⊥ P How does this relate to an I-map? Is the I-map just this entire set of these conditional independencies or something else? PS: I did read Explanation of I-map in a Markov/Bayesian network , but I still don't think I am getting it.
