Are there any reasons logistic regression seems to not reach high percentage of classification accuracy?

In all the models I've built, my prediction accuracy has always been around 75%. Around 80% is my max. In examples online, I have never seen anything above 85%. My understanding is that only more complex machine learning algorithms such as neural networks or random forests can help you predict with a very high level of accuracy. Is it possible to get in the 90% range, and in what cases/situations does this occur?
