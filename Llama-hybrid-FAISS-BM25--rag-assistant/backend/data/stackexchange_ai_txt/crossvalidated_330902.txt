NA's appearing in my logistic regression summary output. How should I procede?

I have been following multiple posts on this same topic and understand why I have NA's in my summary table. I am wondering what is an appropriate course of action in order to conduct a post hoc analysis on the data using R Studio. Background: I am conducting an experiment looking at how various factors affect insect marker detectability. Individuals were tested for marker detection only once in a process that destroys the insect (no repeated measures). I have 3 explanatory variables, application method ("apptreat" = 2 levels), marker type ("marker" = 2 levels), and time after exposure ("exp" = 3 levels). The data is binomial with marker detection as the response variable (detec) with 1 representing the marker was detected and 0 representing the marker was not detected. All variables are categorical and classified as factors. Based on the model, the only significant interaction was between marker and exp. I need to look at the multiple comparisons between the main effects to see how they effect marker detectability. I also need to look at the multiple comparisons within the interaction to see the specific relationship of how the detectability of each marker type is affected by time after exposure. Model: >id.glm2 summary(id.glm2) Call: glm(formula = detec ~ apptreat + marker + exp + marker * exp, family = binomial, data = indiv_detec3) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.2631 -0.4884 -0.2857 0.6113 3.0937 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.1781 0.5103 -6.228 4.73e-10 *** apptreatLitter 3.6488 0.3069 11.890 I would like to conduct a post hoc analysis on the data using the glht() function in the multcomp package, however it is unable to do the multiple comparisons on the interaction variable and I get a warning message that values for the main effects may not be accurate because of the presence of the interaction. I have read that in order to fix this problem, I can add a column into the dataset representing the interaction between "marker" and "exp" (ME). I have done this and re-ran the model using the interaction column as a main effect, rather than including the interaction in the model as normal. New model: >indiv_detec3$inter_MarEx id.glm3 summary(id.glm3) Call: glm(formula = detec ~ apptreat + marker + exp + ME, family = binomial, data = indiv_detec3) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.2631 -0.4884 -0.2857 0.6113 3.0937 Coefficients: (3 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.1781 0.5103 -6.228 4.73e-10 *** apptreatLitter 3.6488 0.3069 11.890 I understand that since I added a column to reflect the interaction and am using that as a main effect, there is now colinearity between the "inter_MarEx" (interaction variable) and the two main effects represented in the interaction ("marker" and "exp"). This colinearity is resulting in production of NA's in the summary output and prevents me from preforming the post hoc analysis. When I do attempt the post hoc test I get an error message. > summary(glht(id.glm3, linfct=mcp(inter_MarEx="Tukey"))) Error in modelparm.default(model, ...) : dimensions of coefficients and covariance matrix don't match Is it appropriate to set up 2 separate models (one with the interaction only and one with main effects only) and conduct the multiple comparisons post hoc analysis on each model separately? Should I omit the main effects "marker" and "exp" from the model id.glm3 since they are accounted for in the interaction ("inter_MarEx")? If not, how can I proceed with conducting my post hoc multiple comparisons of all main effects and the interaction?
