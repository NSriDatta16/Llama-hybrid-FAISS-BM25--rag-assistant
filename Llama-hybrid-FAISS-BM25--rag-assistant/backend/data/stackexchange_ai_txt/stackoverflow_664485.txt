GM_setValue normally only stores 32-bit integers, strings, and booleans, but you can take advantage of the uneval() method (and a later eval() on retrieval) to store any object. If you're dealing with pure JSON values (rather than JavaScript objects), use JSON.stringify to store and JSON.parse to retrieve; this will be both faster and safer. var foo={people:['Bob','George','Smith','Grognak the Destroyer'],pie:true}; GM_setValue('myVeryOwnFoo',uneval(foo)); var fooReborn=eval(GM_getValue('myVeryOwnFoo','new Object()')); GM_log('People: '+fooReborn.people+' Pie:'+fooReborn.pie); I tend to use "new Object()" as my default in this case, but you could also use "({})". Just remember that "{}" evaluates as a string, not an object. As usual, eval() with care.
