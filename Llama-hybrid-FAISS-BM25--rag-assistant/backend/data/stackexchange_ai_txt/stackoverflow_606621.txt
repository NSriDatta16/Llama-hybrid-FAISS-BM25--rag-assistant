Reporting Services Parameter Constraint

I have a reporting services (SQL 2008) report with two Date/Time parameters - begindate and enddate. I need to constrain enddate to the same month and year as begindate. This seems like it should be an easy thing to do, but I cannot figure it out. Currently, I am checking the parameters passed to the stored procedure and raising an error if the two datetime parameters are not in the same month and year. I am looking for a more elegant way of accomplishing this.
