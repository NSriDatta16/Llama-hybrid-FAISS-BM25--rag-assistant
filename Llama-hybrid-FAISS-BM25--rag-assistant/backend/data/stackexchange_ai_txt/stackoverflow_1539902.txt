The code looks OK for finding the max value. If you are using C# 3 or later you could use the LINQ extension methods (there are Min , Max and Average methods, and on List there is also a FindIndex method, amongst others), but I get the impression that you are learning programming, and then it is sometimes a good idea to implement stuff that may be built into the framework, just for the learning value.
