Using self organizing maps for dimensionality reduction

Over the past few days, I have been conducting some research on self organizing maps for a project at school. I have come to understand that self organizing maps can be used to reduce the dimensionality of your data. However, I do not understand how this works. For example, say you have a 10x10 network of neurons in a SOM, and your input is 25-dimensional. So, by my understanding, you would create a feature vector for each neuron that is also 25D. By the time training is done, you end up with 100 25D vectors. How is this exactly reducing the dimensions of the data? Am I supposed to be concerned with the location of the neurons? EDIT: I've already read the question Dimensionality reduction using self-organizing map but I don't feel it answers the question that I have.
