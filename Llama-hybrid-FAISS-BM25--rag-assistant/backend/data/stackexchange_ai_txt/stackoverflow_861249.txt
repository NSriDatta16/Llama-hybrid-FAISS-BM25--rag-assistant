ActionScript 3, Flash Player 10 - 3d carousel changes perspective, alignment issues

We made a 3D carousel with the new native 3D support from flash. Now when I resize, my carousel should drag along the middle. Which it does fine. But for some reason the perspective doesnt come along, therefore it looks like the more i resize, the more the carousel is leaning to the left side. The carousel is set up very simple. Everything rotates around the x-axis with a set distance, the x-axis where the objects revolve around is 0. I just move the whole container to middle of the screen. to illustrate: http://www.stijlfigurant.nl/stuff/xaxis1.png http://www.stijlfigurant.nl/stuff/xaxis2.png is there a way to solve this or should i go back to good old papervision?
