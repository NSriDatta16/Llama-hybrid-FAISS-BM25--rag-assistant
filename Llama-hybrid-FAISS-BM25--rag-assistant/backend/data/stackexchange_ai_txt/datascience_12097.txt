Please suggest some good ways to test my RNN

I have developed an RNN in matlab and now its time to test it. You can set your desired number of layers and nodes and it trains data in random chunks. I also included an annealing function for learning rate that decays gradually from 1 to 1e-5 to avoid overtraining of data. I would like you to suggest me some simple ways to test my network in a way that i can get some useful feedback about its behavior from the results. I am a little concerned about convergence. I' ve set to do some testing of my own but would like to hear some suggestions from more experienced users. I try to simulate some 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... grade function between (0-1) and see how it goes. I will also try to predict the next value of a time series based on previous values, as another testing method. What would be a good result from these tests? An accuracy of ??% and an mse of ?? ?
