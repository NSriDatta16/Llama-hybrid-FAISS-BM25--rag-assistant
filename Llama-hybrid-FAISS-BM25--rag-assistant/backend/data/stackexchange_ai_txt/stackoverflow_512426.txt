I would use something that looked like: " ([^<>]+) " I'm not sure why you left off the '>'s and I wouldn't want to match other tags (here I'm assuming we're looking for textual data and not a document fragment). That being said, I'd really look into getting a DOM and using XPath (or similar) to do your queries as regex's are not well known for their ability to deal with trees .
