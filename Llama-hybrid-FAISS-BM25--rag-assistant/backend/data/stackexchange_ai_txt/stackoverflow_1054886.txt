I wrote an article for java.net about how to transparently add logging statements to a class when it is loaded by the classloader using a java agent. It uses the Javassist library to manipulate the byte code, including using the Javassist compiler to generate extra bytecode which is then inserted in the appropriate place, and then the resulting class is provided to the classloader. A refined version is available with the slf4j project.
