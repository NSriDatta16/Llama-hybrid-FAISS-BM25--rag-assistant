matching string to filenames with regex (java 1.6)

I have a bunch of images with names such as nineDiamonds.gif and aceHearts.gif along with a "Card" class for playing card faces. In the constructor, I want to pass a String of the card name and be able to create a JPanel with the right image. Easy enough, but I want to be able to pass things such as: "9 of hearts" => nineHearts.gif "9 hearts" => nineHearts.gif "nine of Hearts" => nineHearts.gif Integer.toString(9) + "hearts" => nineHearts.gif Integer.toString(1) + "hearts" => aceHearts.gif "Ace of hearts" => aceHearts.gif I understand I can overload the constructor and match things up with a switch and what not, but what I am really after is am elegant, functional style solution, something along the lines of: String fileName = name.replaceAll("magic regex") + ".gif"; Thanks!
