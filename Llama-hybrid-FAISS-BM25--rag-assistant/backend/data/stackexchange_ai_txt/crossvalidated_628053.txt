ANOVA, in general, is for a dependent variable that is continuous (or a reasonable facsimile. Your DV is categorical (helped/harmed). So, not ANOVA. A two way ANOVA is when there are two INDEPENDENT variables. You have only one (treatment). So, of the two choices, you should pick chi-square. However, in the real world, I would do a logistic regression and add covariates. It is rarely ideal to analyze health care data without covariates (even in a randomized trial).
