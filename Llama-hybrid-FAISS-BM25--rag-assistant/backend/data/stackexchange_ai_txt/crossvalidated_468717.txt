No, unequal sample sizes are not a problem. I don't know if there is a canonical citation for the unbalanced data claim, but this paper mentions it, and it comes from one of the authors of the lme4 package. Pinheiro, J. C. (2014). Linear mixed effects models for longitudinal data. Wiley StatsRef: Statistics Reference Online. NA Just check the regular assumptions of the GLMMs that you are using. As far as being too unbalanced for using emmeans, I don't think that is a problem, and have frequently seen it used on unbalanced data in psychology/cognitive science papers. Many studies are run on undergraduate students and roughly 2/3 students at North American universities are female, so this is a common issue. Also, in the documentation for the emmeans package, one of the examples they give uses unbalanced data: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/basics.html Edit to include information about checking the assumptions of the GLMMs: For logistic regression, there are not too many. The main one will be multicollinearity, which can be checked using the vif() function from the car package. This website has some more information, and there are plenty of others: http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/36-classification-methods-essentials/148-logistic-regression-assumptions-and-diagnostics-in-r/ For the inverse gaussian model, I've never run one, but this post seems to have some useful sources linked in the answer. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/422383/inverse-gaussian-glm-residual-deviance
