Regarding to your question "which one to use when". Some Oracle gurus recommend: First try to solve your problem with plain SQL If you can't do it with sql, then try PL/SQL Only use other languages like Java externally of your database if you can't do it internally. But of course you can treat your database as a dump storage of data and do all the business logic externally in a separate layer.
