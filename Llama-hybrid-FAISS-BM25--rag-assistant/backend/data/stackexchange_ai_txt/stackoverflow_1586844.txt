Essential ActionScript 3.0 by Colin Moock as clownbaby suggests. Very good book for grasping AS3 in general. ActionScipt 3.0 Animation Making Things Move! by Keith Peters is great for more advanced topics and actual game related stuff. Good resources: www.bit-101.com http://lab.polygonal.de blog.joa-ebert.com http://www.andre-michelle.com/ http://www.gotoandlearn.com/ There are plenty more excellent blogs out there these are just some off the top of my head
