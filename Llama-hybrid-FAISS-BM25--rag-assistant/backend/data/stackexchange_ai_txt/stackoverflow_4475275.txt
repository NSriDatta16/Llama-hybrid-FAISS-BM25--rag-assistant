Filtering events onclick with FullCalendar and the removeEvents method

I'm trying to use FullCalendar to display my events from a JSON feed. It's working fine with the following code: $(document).ready(function() { // Initialize calendar $('#calendar').fullCalendar({ header: { left: 'prev', center: 'title', right: 'next' }, buttonText: { prev: 'Previous month', next: 'Next month' }, columnFormat: { month: 'dddd' }, editable: false, events: "events.json", disableDragging: true, }); I'm trying to create a link that'll filter the events (ideally, it would be a select menu) using the removeEvents method. When I use the method and pass in an ID, the event gets removed. The documentation states: idOrFilter may also be a filter function that accepts one Event Object argument and returns true if it should be removed. I read that the filter function should operate just like jQuery's grep method, but I don't understand how to implement it. I started writing the below, but I'm uncertain how to continue. Any suggestions or examples would be greatly appreciated! ... $('#filter').click(function() { $('#calendar').fullCalendar ( 'removeEvents', filter(events) ); } ... function filter (events) { ... }
