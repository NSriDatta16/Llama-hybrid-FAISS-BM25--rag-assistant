It looks like you may want to do some sort of time series imputation. Imputation refers to the prediction of missing values so you can perform an analysis as if your data were complete. Some common (basic) choices for time series are last observation carried forward (if person 1 is missing T2, you would use substitute it with their value from T1) or the average of the individual's time series to fill in missing points. Here's a link to an article, imputeTS: Time Series Missing ValueImputation in R, that might help you dig into this problem a little deeper: https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/imputeTS/vignettes/imputeTS-Time-Series-Missing-Value-Imputation-in-R.pdf
