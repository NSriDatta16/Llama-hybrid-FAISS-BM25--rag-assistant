What are the differences among Internal storage, external storage, sd card and removable storage?

From the official documentation : Using the External Storage Every Android-compatible device supports a shared "external storage" that you can use to save files. This can be a removable storage media (such as an SD card) or an internal (non-removable) storage ... I'm really confused about this subject. From what I understand, using external storage doesn't necessarily mean to use a removable card, am I right? However, when talking about external storage, it's always referred as "sd card". I'm developing an app that downloads .mp3 files from the internet. I want to save those files in the phone memory (don't want to use any removable device) but for what I have learned, those files have to be saved in external memory.However, I would like to offer the possibility of importing a file from a removable device. Where and how should I save those files? Thanks
