Posted data must be of type multipart/form-data . Edit: OK, so it turns out, specifying form-data is enough as mentioned in the HTTP::Request::Common docs: The POST method also supports the multipart/form-data content used for Form-based File Upload as specified in RFC 1867. You trigger this content format by specifying a content type of form-data as one of the request headers. However, to use HTTP::Request::Common::POST the way you are using, you will need to import POST : use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST); or use $ua->post : The post(...) method of LWP::UserAgent exists as a shortcut for $ua->request(POST ...) . You can make your life easier by using WWW::Mechanize . See also this upload example .
