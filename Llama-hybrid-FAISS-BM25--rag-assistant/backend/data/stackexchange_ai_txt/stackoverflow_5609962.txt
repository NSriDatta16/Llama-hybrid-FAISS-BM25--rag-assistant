Best way to get date strings with Python

What's the best way to get datestrings from a website using Python? The datestrings can be, for example, in the forms of: April 1st, 2011 April 2nd, 2011 April 23, 2011 4/2/2011 04/23/2011 Would this have to be a ton of regex? What's the most elegant solution?
