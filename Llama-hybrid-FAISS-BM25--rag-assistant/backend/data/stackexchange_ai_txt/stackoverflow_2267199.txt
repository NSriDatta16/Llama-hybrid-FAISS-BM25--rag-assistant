A good starting point is to grab the kernel sources, make menuconfig and enter the Filesystems menu. There are some very nice filesystems for microcontrollers - CROMFS and CRAMFS - very small compressed read-only (CROM) or non-persistent read-write(CRAM) filesystems that require special tools to create but provide really small memory and disk footprint, Fossil which provides RW but no directory hierarchy (perfect for data storage combined with CROMFS), several more advanced filesystems intended specifically for flash media, like JFFS or YAFFS. You may also look into UnionFS which allows you to overlay two filesystems, say a ROM-based OS with Flash-based overwritten pieces and RAM-based temporary versions. There is a bunch of other filesystems. If any catches your fancy, there's more about it in Documentation/Filesystems, and then if you want to know more, read the sources. FAT is a murderer for flash-based non-wear-protected devices, as file allocation table is written to the same location over and over. EXT3 isn't very good for flash too.
