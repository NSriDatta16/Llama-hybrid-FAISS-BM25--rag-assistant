How to get attributes on a referenced field

I have a question: Is there an elegant way of getting Attributes on a referenced field. Ie.: public class C1: Base { [MyAttribute] public string Field1; } public class Base { private void Do(ref string field) { if (field has attributes) DoSomething(); } } How can I get attributes of a field in the method Do()? Thanks in advance.
