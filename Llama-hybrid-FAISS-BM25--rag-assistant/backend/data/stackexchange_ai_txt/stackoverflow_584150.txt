Temporary variables. They solve almost every problem I have with long lines. Very occasionally, I'll need to use some extra parens (like in a longer if-statement). I won't make any arguments for or against 80 character limitations since that seems irrelevant. Specifically, for a log message; instead of: self._log.info('Insert long message here') Use: msg = 'Insert long message here' self._log.info(msg) The cool thing about this is that it's going to be two lines no matter what, but by using good variable names, you also make it self-documenting. E.g., instead of: obj.some_long_method_name(subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)) Use: grand_total = subtotal * (1 + tax_rate) obj.some_long_method_name(grand_total) Most every long line I've seen is trying to do more than one thing and it's trivial to pull one of those things out into a temp variable. The primary exception is very long strings, but there's usually something you can do there too, since strings in code are often structured. Here's an example: br = mechanize.Browser() ua = '; '.join(('Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh', 'U', 'Intel Mac OS X 10.4', 'en-US', 'rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6')) br.addheaders = [('User-agent', ua)]
