Is there an easy way to use an OSGi bundle in a classpath for Ant junit or java tasks?

I have a bunch of OSGi bundles that are basically jars that contain other jars and a manifest. bundle xyz.jar: somejar1.jar somejar2.jar Manifest I want to run some junit tests, and need some classes inside these bundles. Is there an easy way in Ant to say ? I could unjar these to a temp directory, but that seems tedious, plus I would not be leveraging the classpath inside the OSGi bundle.
