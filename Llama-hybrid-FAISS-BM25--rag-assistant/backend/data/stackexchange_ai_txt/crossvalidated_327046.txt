What does Intercept and Ref mean in Logistic Regression Model?

I am looking at a results chart from a binomial logistic regression model, and I see the following results. I am not sure what "intercept" means here. I thought "coefficient" is referring to the variable in question - so it makes no sense to have no coefficient in the first line , Also, is "Downtown" location being used as a reference to check the results between the two locations?
