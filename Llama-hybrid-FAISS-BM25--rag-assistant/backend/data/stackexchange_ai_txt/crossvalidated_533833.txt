Adding a variable's effect (from literature) to an estimated Cox model

I have a Cox model (estimated with coxph), built using "some" variables. There is an extra variable that I have not measured, so it is not in my dataset, but I do know the effect of that variable on cohort's similar to mine from literature (let's say the effect is well-established). If I want to "adjust" my model by including this effect, how do i do it? My previous conviction was that this will lead to a biased model as we do not know about the interactions of this variable with the others in the cohort. But, I have seen some papers do something similar, such as Wishart 2012 , where the author's adjusted their prognostic model for an extra variable that wasn't available in their cohort. I am open to changing the base model (to a parametric or Bayesian), if that makes any difference. Edit (for context): My goal is similar to Predict, to create a nomogram, which ideally I would like to adjust for an effect that is not in my dataset (large population level data, >10,000 observations, >500 events), but is well-established in literature.
