If $\alpha$ is the intercept, then I think it should be specified on the log pounds scale. The reason is pretty clear. Assume all the other covariates are mean centered, and then consider the linear predictor for the "average" observation. The linear predictor is $$\eta = \alpha$$ And so the mean of the gamma is then $$\mu = \exp(\eta) = \exp(\alpha)$$ If $\alpha$ is on the log pounds scale, then $\exp(\alpha)$ is on the pounds scale, and so to is the mean of the gamma.
