Another view of "robustness" is try to see if model is easy to get over fitting, i.e., works work on some (training) data set, but not working well on data have dramatic change. Naive Bayes is a linear model and it is a generative model. Comparing to Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, it is less likely to over fit a Naive Bayes. In that sense, it is robust.
