I'd go with more self-describing names, like: EVERYTHING_IS_BROKEN_IMMEDIATE_ATTENTION_REQUIRED RARE_IMPORTANT_EVENT (which includes init/shutdown) DETAILED_EXECUTION_TRACE TONS_OF_DEBUGGING_INFORMATION Maybe not exactly these ones but you get the idea — make sure it is absolutely impossible to be confused about what each log level means. (I also used the “trace” term in a more conservative sense — a list of function calls is actually a trace, so FUNC_CALL and TRACE sound as synonyms to me) Also be sure not to make log levels that noone should disable. I personally have always found the default ERROR/WARNING/INFO levels silly because they are very misleading (is a request for a non-existing item an error?) Also would be good if noone can (accidentally) disable EVERYTHING_IS_BROKEN_IMMEDIATE_ATTENTION_REQUIRED and RARE_IMPORTANT_EVENT levels. Don't be afraid to use long names, IDEs will auto-complete them anyway. Better to have longer names than messed up logs.
