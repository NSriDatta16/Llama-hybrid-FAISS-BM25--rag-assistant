I agree that this an unnecessary step, but it's not an egregious error. It is a good idea to take a look at the initial imbalance in your data before matching so you can see for which variables special attention may need to be paid in matching. I would only change the word "that" to "if" in that step, which is a very minor change. If the propensity score and covariates are well balanced before matching, then, yes, matching may not be necessary.
