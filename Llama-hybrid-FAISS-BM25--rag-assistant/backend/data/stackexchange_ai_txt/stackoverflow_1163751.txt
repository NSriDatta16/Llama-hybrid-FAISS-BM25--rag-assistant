Rails routing and URI fragment identifier

When I was developing my RoR skills with some basic tutorials I encountered a problem. What I am trying to achieve is having comments belonging to posts, with no separate index or individual view. This part was easy. Here comes tough one. I want post_comment_url to return address with fragment identifier : http://example.com/posts/2#comment-4 . It would allow me to use redirect_to in it's simplest form, without :anchor parameter (which would be against ruby way of keeping things simple). How to do that?
