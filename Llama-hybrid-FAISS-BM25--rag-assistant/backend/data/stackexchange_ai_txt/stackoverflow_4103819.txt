First, I would make sure you understand mergesort. Look at this explanation, with fancy animations to help you understand it. This is their pseudo code version of it: # split in half m = n / 2 # recursive sorts sort a[1..m] sort a[m+1..n] # merge sorted sub-arrays using temp array b = copy of a[1..m] i = 1, j = m+1, k = 1 while i See how they use b to hold a temporary copy of the data? What your teacher wants is for you to pass one table in to be used for this temporary storage. Does that clear up the assignment?
