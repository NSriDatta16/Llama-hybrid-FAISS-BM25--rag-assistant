Link Error With Visual Studio 2005 Using Windows SDK 7.1

I am in the process of evaluating an upgrade to Windows SDK 7.1 Part of my team's legacy codebase is a large number of ATL web services, which are still maintained using Visual Studio 2005 because (I am told) ATL web services are not supported in versions beyond 2005. When I pointed the IDE to SDK 7.1, I began to receive the following link error: uuid.lib(cguid_i.obj) : fatal error LNK1103: debugging information corrupt; recompile module I haven't been able to find much on the web related to this problem in VS2005 and SDK 7.1. I found some forum posts from back in 2005 about the same error -- they seemed to indicate an SDK incompatibility. Based on the download page , I was under the impression that Windows SDK 7.1 could be used with Visual Studio 2005 (although I do note the "Not all features work with all versions of Visual Studio" disclaimer). Is this a known issue, or have I got something configured incorrectly? I was hoping someone could share their experience or suggest how/if I might be able to resolve this. EDIT: I discovered that this problem is circumvented by disabling /DEBUG on the linker command line. While allowing the build to complete, this is suboptimal as it precludes debugging during future maintenance.
