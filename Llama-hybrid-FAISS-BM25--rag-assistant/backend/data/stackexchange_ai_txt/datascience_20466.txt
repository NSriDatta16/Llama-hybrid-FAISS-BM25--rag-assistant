The case that you are describing is referred in the literature as sample selection bias [1]. This case is a part of the area of Transfer Learning/Domain Adaptation. The training set does not represent the real world data-set well, which means that there is a difference between the distributions of the training and test sets. Another term from the Domain Adaptation area that is referred to the same problem is the Covariate Shift. B.
