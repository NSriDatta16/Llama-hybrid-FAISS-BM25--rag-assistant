The class Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View_Attributes method getAdditionalData() should point you toward how to limit the variables to only those that are selected as Viewable on Frontend. Its getAdditionalData method is referenced in the product view block. The steps to solving this would be the following: 1. Create a new Magento module with the intent to override the grouped product block. 2. Create the new grouped product block, stealing liberally from the getAdditionalData() method of Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View_Attributes. 3. Create a new template based on /template/catalog/product/view/type/grouped.phtml to back your custom block. 4. Override the block in your module's config.xml (see: Overriding catalog/breadcrumbs and catalog/products/view , Magento forums) This has the consequence that all your grouped products in the catalog will behave this way. If you need to be more selective, then I think a reasonable thing to do would be to add a custom attribute to catalog products (preferably set up in the custom module you just created!) in order to toggle the behavior, and program a check for that toggle into your template.
