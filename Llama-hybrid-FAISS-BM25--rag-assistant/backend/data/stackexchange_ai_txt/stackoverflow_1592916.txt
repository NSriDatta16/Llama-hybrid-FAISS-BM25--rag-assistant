Are you on x86? If so then there is actually an opcode in the CPU that means "invoke whatever debugger may be attached". This is opcode CC , or more commonly called int 3 . Easiest way to trigger it is with inline assembly: inline void debugger_halt(void) { #ifdef MSVC __asm int 3; #elif defined(GCC) asm("int 3"); #else #pragma error Well, you'll have to figure out how to do inline assembly in your compiler #endif } MSVC also supports __debugbreak() which is a hardware break in unmanaged code and an MSIL "break" in managed code.
