Can I interpret logistic regression coefficients and their p-values even if model performance is bad?

I trained a logistic regression model with two binary variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ where my target binary variable is $y$ : $$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) =\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2$$ Looking at p-values, we notice that $x_1$ has statistical significance (p-value However, the model performance is terrible (pseudo-R-squared = 0.004552). So I would like to know if it is reasonable to conclude that there is evidence that $x_1$ is related to outcome $y$ or not. Note: I am using the statsmodel Python library
