I found the solution was to update the GAC again with the same version of the local assembly. I did this by dragging and dropping the assembly file into the C:\Windows\Assembly folder. After doing this & then rebuilding my console application the problem went away. Strange because the assembly in the GAC was already showing the same version number as the one locally.
