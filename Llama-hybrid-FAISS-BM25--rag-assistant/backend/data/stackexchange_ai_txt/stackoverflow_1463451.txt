Question: is it important that users be able to see more than one of your embedded forms or frames at a time? If not, certainly go for tabs. Tabs make it easier to navigate and to see what you have available. But with standard PageControl you can only see one tab at a time - there's no "tiling" or "cascading". Problems begin for example when users need to drag things from one tab to another. It can be done, of course, but is not as convenient - because this time users do not see where they are dragging something to. To overcome this limitation you'd have to look at a docking UI, which adds complexity, but could give you tabs as well as being able to tile them.
