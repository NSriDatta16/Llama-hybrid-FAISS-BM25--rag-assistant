If your really understand the Dempster Shafer Evidence Theory you can do it by yourself, and it is just couple of lines of code. I think this may be the reason that you cannot find it in a package, because it is trivial. On the other hand, I believe Dempster Shafer Evidence Theory is better for "belief aggregation". For example, the widely used example in Dempster Shafer Evidence Theory is doctor dignosis, which doctor believe 60% the patient has disease A and 40% disease B. Note, there is no "pior" data here, just numbers from human experts. In your case, it may be better to use Bayesian approch instead of Dempster Shafer Evidence Theory. In addition search for "bagging" or "ensemble leanring" to see how others to this task.
