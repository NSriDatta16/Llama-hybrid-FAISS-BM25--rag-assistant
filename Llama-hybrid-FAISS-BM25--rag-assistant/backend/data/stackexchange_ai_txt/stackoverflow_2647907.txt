Big task, chances are you shouldn't reinvent the wheel rather using an existing wheel (such as paypal). However, if you insist on continuing. Start small, you can use a credit card processing facility (Moneris, Authorize.NET) to process credit cards. Most providers have an API you can use. Be wary that you may need to use different providers depending on the card type (Discover, Visa, Amex, Mastercard) and Country (USA, Canada, UK). So build it so that you can communicate with multiple credit card processing APIs. Security is essential if you are storing credit cards and payment details. Ensure that you are encrypting things properly. Again, don't reinvent the wheel. You are better off using an existing provider and focussing your development attention on solving an problem that can't easily be purchase.
