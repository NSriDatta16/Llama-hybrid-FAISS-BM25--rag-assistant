Dynamic Grouping Crystal Reports 9

I have a crystal report that has a report parameter that can be a value between 1 and 100. If the value is less than 50, I need to group by CustomerID. If the value is greater than 50, I need to group by OrderID. I've been searching the web on how to do this and I've come across several links that says this can be done via a formula. So inside the formula I have: if {ReportParameter} I created a group manually that correctly sifts through the data, but when I drag the formula into a grouped category, it's not working for me. Is there an additional step I'm missing?
