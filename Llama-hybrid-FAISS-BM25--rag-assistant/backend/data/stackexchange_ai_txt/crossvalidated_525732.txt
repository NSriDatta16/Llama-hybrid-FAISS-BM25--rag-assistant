What is the best time series model to find "time lag" between 2 sets of data?

I have two sets of data. Set 1 is a count of sales & date Set 2 is a count of event x occurring & date. What is the best method to find out how a change in an element of Set 1 (date t, sales s) effects a series of elements in Set 2? Q: After an increase in sales, when can i expect an increase in the count of event x ? What's the best model or method /analysis to answer this ? Thank you !
