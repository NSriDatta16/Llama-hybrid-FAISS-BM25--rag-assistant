You could try removing the 3rd party project from your include path. Then create a sub-dir that has the same dir structure and header files as the 3rd party project, so that all of the #includes now find your headers instead. Then in each fake header xxxx.h you set the pragma's then include the real xxxx.h header, then clear the pragma. To avoid recursively including the same file you would have to add an extra dir to the #include. Personally, I'd just go through your project and add the pragma's.
