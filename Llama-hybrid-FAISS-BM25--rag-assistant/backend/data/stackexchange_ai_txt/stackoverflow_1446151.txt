Active record organisation for maintainability and testability

Some of my AR classes are starting to... bulge around the waist. I'm starting to think it might be time to put them on a diet. Probably the biggest concern I have is that there's just so much code in one file, I'm considering breaking out validations, associations and groups of related methods into modules. Are there any other alternatives I haven't considered? I'd also like to do the same thing with my tests (I'm using shoulda with test/spec if that makes a different)... Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
