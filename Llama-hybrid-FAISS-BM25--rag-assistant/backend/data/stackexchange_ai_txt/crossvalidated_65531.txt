simply put: $ factorscore = loading_1*X_1+loading_2*X_2+\ldots+loading_k*X_k $ You may need to standardize your variables beforehand if they do not share the same metric. If you do this with your data, your self-computed factor score should correlate above .9 with SPSS' factor score (at least if you do not have cross-loadings). Therefore I do not really see the point of computing them by hand. Moreover, if you have reasonable PCA results, you may want to compute something like a sum score instead of factor scores for your subsequent regression analyses.
