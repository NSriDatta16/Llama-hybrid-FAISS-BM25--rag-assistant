I decided to put my DragControl class up for download, along with the Quaternion support class. Once you have an OpenGL canvas looking along the Z axis at some object, it should be little effort to drop this in. It's just the plain .java files currently, no built library. DragControl handles pretty much everything including finger flinging, so you can send your object spinning with a flick. http://github.com/halfninja/android-dragcontrol3d In activity setup: dragControl = new DragControl(); glView.setOnTouchListener(dragControl); When updating object rotation in a loop: Quaternion rotation = dragControl.currentRotation(); If you make any cool modifications I'd like to see them.
