Depending which implementation of logistic regression you're using, scaling will probably already be done. And yes, normalizing your features is very important or the least squares cost at the heart of your algorithm will have some problems. Here's a python standard scaler if you can't find one elsewhere. As an additional note, the overall "accuracy" isn't something you should be worried about since the recall of fraud cases is probably more important. The recall is just the number of fraud cases you accurately predict correctly divided by the number of true fraud cases. EDIT: @Drew75 brought up that I misunderstood how the coefficients were estimated. Scaling shouldn't matter for this particular classifier.
