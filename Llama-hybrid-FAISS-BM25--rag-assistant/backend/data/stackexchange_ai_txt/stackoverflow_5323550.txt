Chrome extension - Localstorage not working

I'm writing a Chrome extension that uses a content script to modify certain parts of a website. The content script worked fine until I tried to add an options page to my extension. Right now I'm using an options.html file to save user preferences to localstorage, as you can see here: Options function save_options() { var select = document.getElementById("width"); var width = select.children[select.selectedIndex].value; localStorage["site_width"] = width; } function restore_options() { var fwidth = localStorage["site_width"]; if (!fwidth) { return; } var select = document.getElementById("width"); for (var i = 0; i Width: 100% 90% 80% 70% Save I also have a background.html file to handle the communication between the content script and the localstorage: chrome.extension.onRequest.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) { if (request.method == "siteWidth") sendResponse({status: localStorage["site_width"]}); else sendResponse({}); }); Then there's the actual content script that looks like this: var Width; chrome.extension.sendRequest({method: "siteWidth"}, function(response) { width = response.status; }); None of that code actually works. It looks solid enough to me but I'm not a very experienced programmer so I might be wrong. Could someone explain localstorage to me in layman's terms?
