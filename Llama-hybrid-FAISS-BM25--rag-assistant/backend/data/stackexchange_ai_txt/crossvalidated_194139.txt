The player chooses one envelope and looks inside. She sees 20D. She is told that the other envelope has either half or twice that amount, determined randomly (e.g. by a coin toss). The logic that half the time she’ll make 10D and the other half of the time she’ll lose only 5D is based on the faulty idea that this scenario, and only this scenario, will be replayed multiple times and she’ll win the average amount over those repeated trials. But that’s not how the game is played. If I repeat that scenario multiple times, which the phrase “the other half of the time” implies must happen in order to use her logic, I’m then requiring that she always choose the 20D envelope out of 2 envelopes while I vary the amount of the other envelope between 10D and 40D. If instead I’m thinking about some random future trial in which she chooses a 20D envelope and the other envelope contains an amount different than it contained on the first trial (e.g. the first time she chose 20D the other envelope had 10D, but some time in the future when she chose the 20D envelope, the other envelope contained 40D), then I must also consider what happens with all the intervening trials to calculate my odds. In some of those intervening trials, if she chooses the larger amount, then double that amount will never happen. In fact, after seeing the 20D, the idea that half the time the other envelope will contain 40D may be faulty. That’s because for amounts larger than the largest original starting amount are never doubled. Whether or not 20D is larger than the largest starting amount is not known, so whether or not the other envelope could contain 40D is also not known. My logic in a previous post seems fitting here. Two envelopes are filled with double/half their amounts. When one is drawn, and it is 20D, it is incomplete and therefore incorrect to think that the other envelope could contain either 10D or 40D because that logic presumes the amount in the other envelope is random. It isn’t. Within the context of the whole game, the amount in the other envelope is constrained by 2 conditions: 1) which envelope is chosen, the larger or smaller amount, and 2) the largest starting amount used. The correct logic sounds like this: “The other envelope contains 10D if I’ve chosen the larger amount and 40D if I’ve chosen that smaller amount.” But each of those choices may not occur in the course of the game, depending on what the highest starting amount is, and therefore the odds of winning cannot generally be determined by averaging the outcomes as though those choices were equally likely. When the odds of winning is determined as though those choices are equally likely, the paradox arises . Here’s another problem with the language sometimes used: Suppose one envelope is filled with some amount of money X and then the other envelope is filled with either half or twice that amount, determined by a coin toss. If the player chooses the envelope with X dollars, it is fair to say that the other envelope was filled with either twice or half that amount randomly by a coin toss. But if the player chooses either other envelope, it is not correct to say that the “other envelope” was randomly filled with either twice or half that amount. The correct language is this: “If you choose one of the envelopes, the other envelope was filled with either twice or half that amount randomly, but if you choose the other envelope, then the other envelope contains twice your amount if you chose the smaller amount and half your amount if you chose the larger amount.” Notice that if the player chooses the envelope without X in it, then the amount in the other envelope is no longer random. It will help me if, when setting up scenarios, you give me an example using envelopes with specific amounts that exemplify the language. You can tell me who knows what, and then what decisions are made according to what logic. It will help to include several rounds of choosing envelopes so I can see the odds playing out. This seems ok to do because in every actual case there must be multiple rounds (to demonstrate the odds) with exact amounts in the envelopes offered in each round. For example, you might say, “I told her that I put double/half the amount into two envelopes. (One had 20D, the other 40D, but she doesn’t know this.) She chose the envelope with 20D. She reasoned thus and so and then decided to trade/not trade and then made/lost money. The next time I offered 2 envelopes with these 2 amounts and told her…and so on. For example, the following language confused me: “a chain of pairs in which every amount appears twice, once as the smaller amount in the pair, once as the larger amount in the pair… If the player is looking at, say, £100 and is told it is an extreme, what should he do? 50% chance it is the smallest, 50% chance it is the largest. We're back to the single envelope case.” If you give me a small example as I described in the previous paragraph, I think I’ll better understand what you mean. You wrote, “It seems to me that some mathematical arguments about prior probabilities effectively say that on opening the first envelope the amount inside allows the player to make a judgment about the prior probabilities.” I’m not sure what you mean by “prior probabilities.” You wrote, “So thinking about finite collections reduces to thinking about a chain which in turn reduces to thinking about a single pair.” Yes, and if a single pair of envelopes is repeatedly given as the envelopes from which to choose, it will quickly become apparent that the logic of, “when I see an amount, the other envelope will have half the amount half the time and twice the amount half the time,” is not true. That logic seems true until you try to play the game using multiple trials, which is necessary for that logic to hold. I think I have addressed your sub-problem above. If it isn’t addressed, it will help me if you restate it and give me an example as I’ve described above.
