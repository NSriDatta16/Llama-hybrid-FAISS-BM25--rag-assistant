My company has licenses to the Infragistics control suite, and currently I'm staying away from all the controls exception for the docking manager, which is quite nice. We're trying to get away from dependence on a Grid control and are using other UI implementations (like list boxes with custom data templates) to avoid being straight-jacketed into vendor specific implementation. In our WinForms days, we were burnt quite a bit by relying on the Infragistics Grid control for everything.
