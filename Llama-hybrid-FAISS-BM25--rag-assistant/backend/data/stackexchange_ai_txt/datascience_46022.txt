General question on the approach to optimise numbers

I have a huge huge model in SQL that nobody knows what it is doing. This model spits out some numbers and those numbers should be optimised to match another batch of 'correct' numbers as much as possible. So I get one set of numbers form my black box model that change according to how different parameters change inside that model - there are around 400 parameters that can be changed to get different numbers out of it (no, I don't want to even touch it, less trying to understand how it works) and I have another 'correct' set of numbers that I get for those parameters from a person in charge of it. What would be the best approach to 'optimise' my black box numbers to match the correct ones? The black box numbers will relatively match the correct numbers depending on how parameters are set up but I need to make them more correct. I was thinking maybe Bayesian optimisation in Python or GridSearch but not sure if that is the best approach. Any ideas would be appreciated.
