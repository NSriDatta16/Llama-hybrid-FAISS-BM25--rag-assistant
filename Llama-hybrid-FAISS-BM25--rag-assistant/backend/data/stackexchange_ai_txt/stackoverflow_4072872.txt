Xslt: Embedding an image in a RSS feed

I am using Umbraco and I need to display an image in a Rss Feed. The feed is generated by Xslt . Everything works if I do text stuff. Such stuff is technically feasible, but the feed I analyzed had been generated by WordPress. The challenge is that I have no idea how I can embed within my tag. I have a variable, say "url", that returns the full url of the underlying image. How can I insert within ? Remember I am using Xslt to achieve the task. I guess that CDATA must be used, but I am not able to escape correctly illegal characters :( Thanks for your help. Roland
