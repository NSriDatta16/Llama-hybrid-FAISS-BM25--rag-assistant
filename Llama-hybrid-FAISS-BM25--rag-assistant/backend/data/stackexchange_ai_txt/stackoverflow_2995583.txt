If you know for sure that there are no separator chars in your input data, the following works string input = "user=u123;name=Test;lastname=User"; string[] fragments = input.Split(";=".ToArray()); Dictionary result = new Dictionary () for(int i=0; i It might perform slightly better than some of the other solutions, since it only calls Split() once. Usually I would go for any of the other solutions here, especially if readability of the code is of any value to you.
