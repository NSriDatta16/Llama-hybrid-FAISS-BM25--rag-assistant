Register a function to be run in PHP when sessions are destroyed

I would like a function to run whenever a session is destroyed. I've looked into using session_set_save_handler but I don't want to manually handle the storage of sessions, I just want to do a little processing when they're destroyed. Is there any way to do this without using session_set_save_handler?
