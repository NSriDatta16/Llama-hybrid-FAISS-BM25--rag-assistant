We have tried this to no avail as well under IIS5. Ran into the same exact problem after trying to set the TempDir registry key. PDF export started failing although all other report exports (apparently) work. However, at a client site running IIS6, this redirection of temp files to a dedicated directory works fine. By default, on their site, Crystal Reports uses the directory C:\Program Files\Business Objects\BusinessObjects Enterprise 11.5\Data as its temp storage location, and gives the ASP.NET account adequate privileges to create and remove files there. So perhaps there is some hardwired logic that mandates that the files be created within the CR installation directory hierarchy. In other words, this all worked as expected by default after CR installation under IIS6. For release 12, obviously the directory would be slightly different.
