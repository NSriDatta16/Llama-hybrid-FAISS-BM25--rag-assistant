When you have only ordinal Y then ordinal regression can be ideal. If you have only a single X that is possibly ordinal then rank regression may be what you need, with careful attention to how ties are handled. Some choices include Somers' $D_{xy}$ , Goodman-Kruskal $\gamma$ , and various versions of Kendall's $\tau$ . When you have more than one X and want to respect the ordinal nature of one or more of the Xs then you may need to use a Bayesian model that is tailored to ordinal X such as what the R brms package does by default for ordered factors.
