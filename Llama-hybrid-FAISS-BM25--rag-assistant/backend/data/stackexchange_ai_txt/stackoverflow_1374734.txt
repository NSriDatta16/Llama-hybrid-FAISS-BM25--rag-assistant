XCOPY-deploying Microsoft Sync Framework in a no admin rights scenario (i.e. ClickOnce install)

I'm currently designing a smart client app (WPF) which needs to operate in an "occasionally disconnected" mode. For the offline scenario, I'm looking at using: Disconnected Service Agent Application Block (from the Smart Client Software Factory) Microsoft Sync Framework I should mention that I want my smart client app to be XCOPY-deployable, auto-updating, and installable without administrative privledges -- basically a ClickOnce-deployed app. From what I can tell this means the Microsoft Sync Framework is out because it has some COM in it's implementation that needs to get registered on the client which requires admin rights. Is it possible to XCOPY deploy and run MSF from a ClickOnce app? Any other ideas for data synchronization?
