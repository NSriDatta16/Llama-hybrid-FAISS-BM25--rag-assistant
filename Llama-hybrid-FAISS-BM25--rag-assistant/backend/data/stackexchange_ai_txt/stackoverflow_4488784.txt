Custom skin and flicker

I created a custom skin with overlaying transparent images and TransparencyKey. http://jesconsultancy.nl/vb.rar (Only right bottom corner works to resize) I have written custom code to resize and drag the application. But when i resize the application it flickers. There wil become some space between the borders of the image/panels. How do I solve this? I can't make a screenshot of the problem because on the screenshot there is no flicker effect :/
