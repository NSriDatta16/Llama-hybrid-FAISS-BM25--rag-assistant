Regression when one class occurs for middle values of a predictor

I am trying to model a process with a binary response (pass/fail). The process fails if the predictor is large or small, but in the middle it passes. The result looks something like this: I want to fit a model to this data. I have tried logistic regression, which doesn't yield good results: I'm thinking there must be an obvious way to model this type of data but I haven't come across anything yet. Looking for advice on what modelling approach should be taken with data like this. And is it able to be generalized for multiple predictors.
