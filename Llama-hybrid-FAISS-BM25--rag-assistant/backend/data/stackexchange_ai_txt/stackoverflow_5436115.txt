How to display images from an array in Flex?

I'm making a Matching Game in Flex. I want to have images from one array on my left and images from the second array on my right, so that user can drag&drop images from the left onto matching images on the right. I have mx:HBox and two mx:VBox inside. Now, how can I display images in VBox that I have in my gameArray, if the length of my array (amount of images) may differ? I would have to create as many mx:Image as the length of my gameArray, but how do I do it in MXML?
