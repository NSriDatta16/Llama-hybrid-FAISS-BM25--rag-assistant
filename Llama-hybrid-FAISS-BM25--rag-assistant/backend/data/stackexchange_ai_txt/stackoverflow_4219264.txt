Check out the work done by Martin Grayson . It is an open source project on CodePlex titled Blacklight . There should be both an SL version and WPF version doing what you need to do via the Drag Dock Panel, with source available to get a better understanding on how it is implemented. To see the sample from above, click WPF then click Drag Dock Panel on the lower left. EDIT: It appears that default WPF support was stripped in 4.3, however jump back to 4.2 and both the binaries and source have their respective WPF offerings.
