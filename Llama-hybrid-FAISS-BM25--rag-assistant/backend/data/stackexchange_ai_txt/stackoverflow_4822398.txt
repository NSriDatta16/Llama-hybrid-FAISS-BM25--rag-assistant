Width and MaxWidth properties not working for WPF ColumnDefinitions

I am working with on an application that I am Dragging and Dropping Items, and creasting grids dynamically based on the contents of the objects I am dropping(some objects will require me to create a grid with 2 columns, some with 4,etc). This is simple enough to do, but when I try to specify how wide I would like these columns to be, it is not working, and it is showing the grids on top of eachother. I will attach what the columns look like. The first example shows the result of 5 objects being dragged and dropped. You can see that the the width specification has no effects. The second example is the same thing, but shows that the grids are not following the width specifications. When I go to drop an "Email" object onto the "Zip" object, it overlays the grids. Here is the code that I am using to create the definitions. As you can see for each Item I iterate over, I am creating a label for. /*Initialize Grid Layout*/ Grid newGrid = new Grid(); newGrid.MinHeight = 40; /*Define Column Definitions*/ List columns = new List (fieldItemList.Count); foreach (ColumnDefinition column in columns) { ColumnDefinition labelColumn = new ColumnDefinition(); /*Specify Width Dimensions*/ labelColumn.Width = new GridLength(150); labelColumn.MaxWidth = 200.0; newGrid.ColumnDefinitions.Add(labelColumn); newGrid.ColumnDefinitions.Add(column); } /*Define Row Definitions*/ RowDefinition row = new RowDefinition(); newGrid.RowDefinitions.Add(row); How do I get it to respect the width boundaries I am assigning to the column definitions?
