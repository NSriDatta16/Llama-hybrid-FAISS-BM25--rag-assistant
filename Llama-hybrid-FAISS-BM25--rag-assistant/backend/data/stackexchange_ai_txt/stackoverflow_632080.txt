I don't know of any specific tools, but I have worked on re-factoring some fairly large PHP projects. I would recommend a templating system, either Smarty or a strict PHP system that is clearly explained to anybody working on the project. Take discrete, manageable sections and re-factor on a regular basis (e.g., this week, I'm going to re-write this). Don't bite off more than you can chew and don't plan to do a full rewrite. Also, I do regular code searches (I use Eclipse and search through the files in my project) on suspect functions and files. Some people are too scared to make big changes, but I would rather err on the bold side rather than accept messy and poorly organized code. Just be prepared to test, test, test!
