Notice that $$ P(\theta | y) = \frac{P(\theta, y)}{P(y)} = \frac{P(y | \theta) P(\theta)}{P(y)}. $$ Since you're interested in calculating the density of $\theta$, any function that does not depend on this parameter ― such as $P(y)$ ― can be discarded. This gives you $$ P(\theta | y) \propto P(y | \theta) P(\theta). $$ The consequence of discarding $P(y)$ is that now the density $P(\theta | y)$ has lost some properties like integration to 1 over the domain of $\theta$. This is not a big deal since one is usually not interested in integrating likelihood functions, but in maximizing them. And when you're maximizing a function, multiplying this function by some constant (remember that, in the Bayesian approach, the data $y$ is fixed), doesn't change the $\theta$ that corresponds to the maximum point. It does change the value of the maximum likelihood, but then again, one is usually interested in the relative positioning of each $\theta$.
