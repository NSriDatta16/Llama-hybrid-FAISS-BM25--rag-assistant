You can use: $($(this).closest("tr")) for finding the parent table row of an element. It is more elegant than parent().parent() which is what I started out doing and soon learnt the error of my ways. --Edit -- Someone pointed out that the question was about removing the row... $($(this).closest("tr")).remove() As pointed out below you can simply do: $(this).closest('tr').remove(); A similar code snippet can be used for many operations such as firing events on multiple elements.
