An architecture for almost complete JavaScript-based web applications?

I know that MVC is highly acclaimed for PHP applications, but I am not sure at all that it fits in JavaScript. If you think otherwise, then please explain how and where you handle common scenarios like AJAX requests, data saving (offline storage), presentation, how do you handle controller logic (do you have a front controller?), and so forth. What about Model-View-Presentation? I am using ExtJS and using the server only for permanent data storage.
