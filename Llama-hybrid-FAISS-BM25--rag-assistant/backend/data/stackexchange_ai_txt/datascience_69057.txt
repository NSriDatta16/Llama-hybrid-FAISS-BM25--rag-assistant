You can use Spacy's named entity recognition. Since I feels it is good in accuracy as well as multi-processing approach is also possible. https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities import spacy from statistics import mode nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md") Q1 = "where is Texas ?" Q2 = "where is California?" Q3 = "where is NASA?" Q4 = "who is Queen Elizabeth II?" Q5 = "who is Donald Trump?" for i in range(1,6): doc= nlp(eval("Q"+str(i))) print("Class :",mode([ent.label_ for ent in doc.ents])) OutPut: Class : GPE Class : GPE Class : ORG Class : PERSON Class : PERSON Hope it will help to start !
