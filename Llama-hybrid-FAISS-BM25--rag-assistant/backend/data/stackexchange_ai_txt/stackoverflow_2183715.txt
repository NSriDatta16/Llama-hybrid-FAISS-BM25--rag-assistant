If C++ is okay with you, take a look at boost::lockfree . It has lock-free Queue, Stack, and Ringbuffer implementations. In the boost::lockfree::details section, you'll find a lock-free freelist and tagged pointer (ABA prevention) implementation. You will also see examples of explicit memory ordering via boost::atomic (an in-development version of C++0x std::atomic ). Both boost::lockfree and boost::atomic are not part of boost yet, but both have seen attention from the boost-development mailing list and are on the schedule for review.
