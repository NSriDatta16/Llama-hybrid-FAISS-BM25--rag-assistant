It's not clear what your question is but as to the difference between ModelMap and ModelAndView, they come from two different "generations" of Spring MVC. ModelAndView is from the Spring 2.0 style, whereas ModelMap was introduced in 2.5. Generally speaking, if your controller subclasses a Spring 2.0 controller, such as SimpleFormController (which I think your code fragment is), then ModelAndView is the thing to use. If you're using Spring 2.5 @Controller annotatations, ModelMap is preferable.
