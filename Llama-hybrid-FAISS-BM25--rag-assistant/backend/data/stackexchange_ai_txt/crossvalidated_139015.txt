How to rank rankings? Two factors - freq and rank but freq has to has much more weight

My respondents has to evaluate number of items (say, 20). Formerly they had to just check three that they liked (like/dislike) and I simply counted the most checked. I 'improved' survey by replacing check-marks on rank (1-2-3) so respondents not just put check-marks but rank (1,2,3) three attributes they like. That is, every respondent has to choose three best items and rank them. Now I'm struggling how to account this. Known "IMDB" formula based on Bayesian average seems doesn't work for me because puts too much weight on "unscored' items (unranked items considered 'not so bad' by default). In my situation, the fact that item was marked is much more important because respondents always evaluate ALL items (in contrast with IMDB films or any other rating where rating occurs by chance).
