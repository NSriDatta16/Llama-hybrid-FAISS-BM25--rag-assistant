Why does Loess Fit not extend over all datapoints in shiny app?

In a shiny app I developed, I'm fitting a number of Loess curves over the ozone datset (temperature vs ozone levels [ppm]). See Link. I wonder why the Loess fits (and the associated average over all fits, the red line) do not extend over all datapoints. I believe I'm setting up the fit such that for every data point a prediction is to be made ( see line 23 in the code ). In my local version of the app, the fit -at least visually- is over all datapoints.
