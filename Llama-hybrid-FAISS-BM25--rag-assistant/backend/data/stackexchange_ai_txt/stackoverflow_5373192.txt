Adding project as dependency in XCode 4.x

With the revamp of XCode I am having a lot of trouble working out how to add make one xcodeproj dependent on another. It was hard enough to work out before but now I am just stuck. If I drag lib.xcodeproj into app.xcodeproj it just shows up as an item in the project tree and I can't expand it or see build products for linking. Can someone give me the correct sequence for adding lib.xcodeproj as a dependency to app.xcodeproj (ie it will build if necessary and link to app)
