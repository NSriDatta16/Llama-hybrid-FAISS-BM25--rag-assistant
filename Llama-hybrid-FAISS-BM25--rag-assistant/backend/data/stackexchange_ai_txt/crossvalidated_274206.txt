Variable step sizes for mutation are a thing, and your idea of using a loop is pretty elegant, though it does restrict you to exponential falloff. Another approach is to tie the mutation size and/or rate to some notion of progress. Start with one operator. If you see too few accepted mutations for a while, increase the step size of the operator. There are lots of ways to do this sort of thing, and the general approach is often very useful. Exactly how you do it for best results probably depends on the specific algorithms and problems.
