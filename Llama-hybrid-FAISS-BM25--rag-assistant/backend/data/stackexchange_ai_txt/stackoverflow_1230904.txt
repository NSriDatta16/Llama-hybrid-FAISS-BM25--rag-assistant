Xcode - Using #pragma mark

I'm pretty sure this isn't a duplicate. Do you use #pragma mark? I've seen multiple ways, which is correct? #pragma mark - #pragma mark === Actions === #pragma mark - #pragma mark - #pragma mark === Actions === #pragma mark - === Actions === #pragma mark Actions What is the way you do it? How do you suggest dividing it up? What do you normally name your sections, for say, a view controller?
