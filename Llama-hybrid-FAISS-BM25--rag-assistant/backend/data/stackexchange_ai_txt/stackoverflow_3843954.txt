It's a UIScrollView with pagingEnabled set to YES taking up most of the screen with a UIPageView underneath it. See Apple's PageControl sample code for details. You can turn off showing the scroll indicators by setting the showsHorizontalScrollIndicator and showsVerticalScrollIndicator properties of the scroll view to NO . It might also be worth checking out the PhotoScroller sample code for an in-depth example of how to do pagination using a UIScrollView. There's also a great video called "Designing Apps with Scroll Views" that walks you through paginating views using a UIScrollView in the WWDC 2010 videos. I highly recommend watching it and the other WWDC videos. You can get them by signing into the iOS developer center and scrolling to the bottom. Also, like they tell you in the video, you don't need to use touch events or override touchesBegan:withEvent: or similar functions to make this happen. If you do it that way, you have to do lots of work to pass events that you don't care about through to the views you're showing and stuff like that. UIScrollView with pagingEnabled set to YES does all of the hard work for you. If you don't want to use a scroll view for some reason, using a UIGestureRecognizer is the way to go. But really, just use a scroll view.
