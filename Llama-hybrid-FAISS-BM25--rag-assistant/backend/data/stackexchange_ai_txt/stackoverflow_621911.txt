Natural language processing is wide and deep, with roots going back at least to the 60s. You could start reading up on computational linguistics in general, natural language generation , generative grammars , Markov chains , chatterbots and so forth. Wikipedia has a short list of libraries which I assume you might have seen. Java doesn't have a long tradition in NLP, though I haven't looked at the Stanford libraries. I doubt you'll get very impressive results without diving fairly deeply into linguistics and grammar. Not everybody's favourite school subject (or so I've heard reported -- loved'em meself!).
