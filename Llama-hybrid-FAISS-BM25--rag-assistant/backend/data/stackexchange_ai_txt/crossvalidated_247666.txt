Your methods don't seem directed at your question, but there are several puzzles over what your data are and what you have done. First off, it seems that what you show are themselves means for each month of larger datasets. Whether that reduction discards useful detail is an open question. Looking at each month relative to the others makes some sense but there are better ways to do it. I won't comment in detail on your procedure except that it is problematic in various ways. I can't fully follow your Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t test or Wilcoxon test. The first (K-S) is a test of whether distributions differ and has nothing at all to do with testing trend in time. Without explicit previous steps, your analysis doesn't seem reproducible even by those using the unnamed software you used (quite apart from the apparent reduction to monthly means). I can't see the logic of comparing just the two Octobers while getting the standard deviations ... from where??? Looking for trend can't validly focus just on beginning and end periods. The fallacy lurking here is seen in its strongest form by imagining a test comparing the heights of very tall and very short people selected from a larger group. A simple method that should be relevant is just to plot the monthly data (or means) and check for a trend. Conventional linear regression results lead to rejecting a null hypothesis at conventional levels and so supports the idea of an increase. But the $R^2$ (e.g.) is inflated by just looking at means, as within-month variation is suppressed, whereas conversely, almost any trend would be deemed significant if the raw data were analysed and the true sample size is much larger than 13. It's not at all obvious that a straight-line fit is quite right, but without any ideas on the process here or a longer dataset, it seems prudent just to stop there, and let a graph tell us that there's an increase and that a straight line trend is a coarse summary. There has to be a higher-level reservation about dependence in time of the errors and what is being assumed. Some might want to direct you to time series analysis here, and in principle they have a good case, but my prejudice with data like yours is that time series analysis would make a simple problem more complicated and that you have far too short a dataset to fit anything more than very simple summaries. If this is just a token problem and you have, or will have, much more data, then the balance tips in favour of that approach. However, time series analysis itself might need to give daily or monthly summaries if the raw data are unevenly spaced in time. Somehow we seem to be assuming that season of year is irrelevant.
