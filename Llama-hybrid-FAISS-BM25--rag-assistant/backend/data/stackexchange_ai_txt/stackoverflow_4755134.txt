WCF does not play nicely if you are trying to do a self hosted service. Because of the way that the HTTP.sys registration happens it does it on the local machine name and does not allow you to do a wildcard registration accepting the load balanced name. The option you have is to use a internal endpoint and try to connect from your web host the IP of the worker role. What I ended up doing was just converting my WCF service to a MVC endpoint and making my worker role be a web application. It's not the most elegant, but it worked.
