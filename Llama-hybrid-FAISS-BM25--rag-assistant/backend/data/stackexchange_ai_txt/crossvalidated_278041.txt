PCA does dimensional reduction by expressing $D$ dimensional vectors on an $M$ dimensional subspace, with $M Consider, for example, a two dimensional space which we reduce to one dimension using PCA. We find that the principal eigenvector is the unit vector that points equally in the positive $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ direction, i.e. $$ \hat{v} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\hat{x} + \hat{y}). $$ In this case I'm using the hat ($\hat{x}$) symbol to indicate that it's a unit vector. You can think of this as a one-dimensional line going through a two-dimensional plane. In our reduced space, we can express any point $w$ in the two dimensional space as a one-dimensional (or scalar) value by projecting it onto the eigenvector, i.e. by calculating $w \cdot \hat{v}.$ So the point $(3,2)$ becomes $5/\sqrt{2},$ etc. But the eigenvector $\hat{v}$ is still expressed in the original two dimensions. In general, we express a $D$ dimensional vector, $x,$ as a reduced $M$ dimensional vector $a$, where each component $a_i$ of $a$ is given by, $$ a_i = \sum_j x_j V_{i j} $$ where $V_{i j}$ is the $j$th component of the $i$'th eigenvector, and $i = 1, \dots, M$ and $j = 1, \dots, D.$ For that to work, the $i$th eigenvector must have $D$ components to take an inner product with $x$. In your case, you can express a "reduced" vector of 200 components by taking the original image, a vector of 65025 components, and taking its inner product with each of the 200 images, each of which has 65025 components. Each inner product result is a component of your 200-dimensional vector. We expect each eigenvector to have the same number of dimensions as the original space. That is, we expect $M$ eigenvectors, each of which are $D$-dimensional.
