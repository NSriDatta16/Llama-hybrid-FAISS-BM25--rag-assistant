Why not use the R squared to measure forecast accuracy?

Why in literature usually the common accuracy measures like MAD, MSE, RMSE, MAPE ... are used. Why not use the $R^2$ (coefficient of determination)? I was thinking about the difference: By using the MSE I can compare the average of the forecast. And when using $R^2$ I'll get a information about the variance. Why is the comparison of averages used most commonly? Can anybody give me an hint?
