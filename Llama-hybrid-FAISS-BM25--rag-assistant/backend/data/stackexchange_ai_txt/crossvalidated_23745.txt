Yes you need to perform the grid search on cross-validated scores. This is well explained in the libsvm guide . In the libsvm tool/ folder there is a grid.py script to help automate that. Alternatively if you use scikit-learn, you should use the GridSearchCV too that does a similar job: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/grid_search.html
