If you will have preassignment of the entities into the entity groups, or of all entities in a certain "field of view" are automatically in the "group", then you could assign a "location" for the entity group using a "center of mass" algorithm, effectively the latitude is just the average of all the contained latitudes, and same for longitudes... Add em up and divide by the count, for both dimensions... If you want an algorithm to "create" the groupings, then you'll need to specifyt some business rules for how to decide which of two or more potential groups an entity should belong to, when there are two candidate groups in "view" from the height you are doing the calculation.
