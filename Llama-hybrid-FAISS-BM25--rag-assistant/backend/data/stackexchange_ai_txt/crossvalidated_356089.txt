Sure, people use neural networks for regression all the time. A recent Google search for "multivariate neural network regression" returns more than $4,760,000$ results. Predicting more than 1 output is simply a matter of having more than 1 output neuron, as in What's the point in neural networks for multivariate regression? Since you want to bound your output values in [0,1], a nice trick is using a sigmoidal output layer. This does all the normalization for you. Typically people use squared error as a regression loss, but there are many other options.
