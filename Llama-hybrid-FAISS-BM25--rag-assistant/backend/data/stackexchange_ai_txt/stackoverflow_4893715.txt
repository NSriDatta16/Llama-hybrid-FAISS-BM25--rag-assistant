detecting the [UITouch view] in touchesMoved method

I wish to drag from one subview to another within my application (and connect them with a line), and so I need to keep track of the current view being touched by the user. I thought that I could achieve this by simply calling [UITouch view] in the touchesMoved method, but after a quick look at the docs I've found out that [UITouch view] only returns the view in which the initial touch occurred. Does anyone know how I can detect the view being touched while the drag is in progress?
