Customize Magento template

I've installed some theme, which has header logo defined in header.phtml like this: getLogoSrc() ?>" alt=" getLogoAlt() ?>" /> I don't really want to alter this template, also in that .phtml file it says not to edit it. How can I override this getLogoSrc most efficiently?
