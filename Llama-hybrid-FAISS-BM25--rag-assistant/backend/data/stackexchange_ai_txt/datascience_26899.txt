Are linear regression models with non linear basis functions used in practice?

I know that popular linear regression models such as Lasso or Logistic Regression are widely used in practice because they perform reasonably good, are efficient and interpretable . As far as I know, the only way for these models to learn non-linear relationships between $X$ and $y$ is by applying non-linear transformations to $X$ through basis functions $\phi(X)$ (as it is summarized in the scikit-learn documentation ). I wonder if this approach is actually used in real world problems, where usually we don't have any prior information about how to design $\phi$.
