It seems that ccgfs might help you in that direction. You would run ccgfs-storage on the end where the files are, and ccgfs-mount where the mountpoint is supposed to be, and either of the component is replaceable by a program of yours, presuming it adheres to the stream protocol (doc shipped in tarball). Note that you still need to connect the two components somehow (as in: you decide; it works with stdin/stdout). socat (preferable to netcat) works with that too.
