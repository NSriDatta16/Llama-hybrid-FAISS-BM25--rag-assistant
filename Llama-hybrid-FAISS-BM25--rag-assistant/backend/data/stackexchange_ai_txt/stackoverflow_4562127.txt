JQuery grid coordinate, drag&drop, ajax

I have an grid. Chessboard to be specific. All the squares have numbers from 0 to 63. What I need to do, is to get number of square that piece is currently on, and pass it to the server, where all game logic is handled. Chessboard is made of divs. My question is how to get that number ?
