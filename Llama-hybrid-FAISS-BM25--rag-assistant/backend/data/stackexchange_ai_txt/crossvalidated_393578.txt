Dealing with different units and indexes in regressions

In my time series model, my dependent variable is a growth measure in percentage. However, one of my independent variables is an index that ranges from -2.5 to 2.5 - and is producing some extreme coefficients. An example using corruption ( cce ) is this: It doesn't seem reasonable that an extra unit of corruption leads to 49% decrease in growth since the index ranges from -2.5 to 2.5. Is there any way to transform such a variable to get slightly smoother / easier coefficients to deal with?
