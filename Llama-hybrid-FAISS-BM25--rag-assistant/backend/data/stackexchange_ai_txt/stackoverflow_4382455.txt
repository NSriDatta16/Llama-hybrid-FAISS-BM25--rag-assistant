Copying Garbage Collector

How does a copying garbage collector avoid memory fragmentation? Also, what consequences for heap-space use? From my understanding, a copying garbage collector, copies all reachable objects from the heap into another section of the heap. All objects that have been left behind are no longer needed and thus removed. If this is a correct understanding, how does this avoid memory fragmentation? This process must use a lot of heap-space, because it will have duplicates of all items it copied, right?
