You are mixing together issues that usually are separate. The distribution of anything for a given customer is a distribution, regardless of whether there is any kind of dependence e.g. in time. Same is true for a patient in a clinical trial. If you reduce either distribution to a single value, you're throwing away information. The information gained by pooling summary values of different customers or patients won't be the same information, except by accident. Note that your proposal would mean that you would never work with time series unless you were sure they were pure noise, but we usually can learn much more from a time series than from its average. You are presumably thinking that dependence is a nuisance because you have often read of independence assumptions, particularly for inference. But the answer to any such nuisance is not usually to throw away information. It is more commonly to use methods that make more accurate assumptions e.g. time series methods when serial dependence is genuine -- or not to use methods that assume independence; or just to be much more cautious when dependence is an issue. Most inference procedures are approximate at best any way.
