What are the predictor variables in a neural network?

In a linear regression model, the predictor or independent (random) variables or regressors are often denoted by $X$ . The related Wikipedia article does, IMHO, a good job at introducing linear regression. In machine learning, people often talk about neural networks (and other models), but they rarely talk about terms such as random variable, (in)dependent variable, etc. In the context of NNs, what are the independent and dependent variables? Are they the "features" of the input dataset? Can the hyper-parameters (e.g. learning rate of the optimiser) also be considered independent variables? What are the dependent variables? The output of the network? I assume that independent variable is a synonym for predictor, regressor (in the case of linear regression), etc.
