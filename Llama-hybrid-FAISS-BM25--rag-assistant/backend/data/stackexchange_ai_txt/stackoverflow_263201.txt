As both a Scrum Master and personnel manager, I have been a strong advocate of the 40-hour work week. I actively discourage team members from working over 40 hours as productivity drops quickly as the work-life balance shifts. I have found recuperating from an late-night work day often takes longer than the extra hours worked. When it is well-run, Scrum aids in minimizing the "cram" that often occurs at the end of an iteration by encouraging (requiring?) a consistent pace throughout and tools like velocity and burndowns work well to plan and track progress.
