First of all, if your main concern is about storing large amount of characters in a String, as far as I know, the only constraints for it are the String length() method, which returns an int (so you are limited to MAX_INT chars) and you JVM memory, which you can change as pointed by Martin. To do that inside eclipse, you must edit your current run configuration, and you'll find a tab named "Arguments" where you can put all arguments (except the java command itself). About finding the word 'Hello', my bet would be using a char array and write the loops myself. String behaviour in Java may be affected by locale and char encoding, so it could mess up your result. Anyway, what you suggest sounds to me like steganography. There is in fact some literature about techniques for finding wether an image contains data hidden with steganography and extracting it, so maybe you should focus your research on steganalysis (not sure if this is the correct word). Cheers.
