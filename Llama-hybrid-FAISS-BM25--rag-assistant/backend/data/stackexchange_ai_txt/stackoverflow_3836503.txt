You cannot mix numeric and character data in a zoo or xts object; however, if the name column is not intended to be time series data but rather is intended to distinguish between multiple time series, one for test1, one for test2, etc. then you can split on column 1 using split=1 to cause such splitting as shown in the following code. Be sure to set the digits.secs or else you won't see the sub-seconds on output (although they will be there in any case): options(digits.secs = 3) z
