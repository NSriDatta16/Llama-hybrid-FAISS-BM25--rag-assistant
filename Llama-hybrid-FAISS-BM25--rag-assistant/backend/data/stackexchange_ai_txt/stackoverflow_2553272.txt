How powerful is the tag in ASP.NET?

I'm new at web development with .NET, and I'm currently studying a page where I have both separated codebehinds (in my case, a .CS file associated to the ASPX file), and codebehind that is inside the ASPX file inside tags like this: //code Q1 :What is the main difference (besides logical matters like organization, readability and ETC), what could be done in one way that could not be done in another? What is each mode best suited for ? Q2 :If I'm going to develop a simple page with database connection, library imports, access to controls (ascx) and image access in other folders.. which method should I choose ?
