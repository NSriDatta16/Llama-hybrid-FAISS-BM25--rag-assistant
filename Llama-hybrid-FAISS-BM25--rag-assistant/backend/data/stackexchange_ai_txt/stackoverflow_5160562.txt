I tried using this code: String id = request.getParameter("name"); but it is not working because the button must be pressed first. You do need to use the getParameter(...) . But I suspect that you were trying to do this in the same doGet(...) method created the form HTML ... before you sent the response containing that HTML to the user. What needs to happen is this: Create HTML and send to the writer. Return from doGet(...) . Wait for user to click the submit button. Get a new call on the doGet(...) method. Figure out that this is an AddandSearch request ... e.g. by looking at the request URI Call getParameter("name") to get the parameter. Given that your servlet is (now) handling requests from different forms, the doGet method needs to dispatch to different parts of your code(e.g. different methods) to handle each form type. (We've also mentioned here and elsewhere that embedding HTML in your code like that is not good engineering practice. It is better to use JSP + JSTL, or some other templating technology. But if this is what your instructor told you to do for this exercise, go with the flow. He may have a good reason ... like not having time in the course to cover JSP, JSTL and other "advanced" Java EE stuff. Curriculum congestion can be a serious issue.)
