He claims that the best practice to secure that everything looks all the same across most browsers You can't secure that everything looks all the same across most browsers. Fonts are always rendered differently depending on platform, settings and availability. If you use full-on absolute positioning — as in, each element has its horizontal and vertical position set in pixels — then any deviation on font-size can result in the lines of text being written on top of each other, making the page unreadable. There are WYSIWYG design tools that do this (and some people abuse Dreamweaver that way), but it's generally considered an amusingly poor approach. More commonly, absolute positioning is used in only the horizontal axis, to make fixed-width headers and footers whilst allowing the text in the page to take up as much vertical space as needed. (This is what SO does, for example, amongst many others.) The fixed-vs-liquid layout argument on browser width is a religious war that will rage forever, but the obviously correct summary is that liquid is best. ;-) (...if harder to pull off, natch.) it's the easiest way to maintain the looks and feel that you intended for a website. Yes! A bad way of solving a problem is quite often the easiest. But “best practice”? Hardly.
