I totally agree with duffymo (+1) (and Bevan) An idea I have been chewing over in my mind recently is, if I do have to have a dependency , and of course when I map a reader to an object I have to have a dependency, maybe I should make it completely explicit and in fact write an extension method to achieve it, something like... //This Static extension class in the same namespace (but not necesarrily assembly) as my BO public static class DataReaderExtensions { public static List GetMyObjects(this DataReader reader) { } } this way, as long as I am in the reference scope of my business object, my datareader will now have a method tailored to my needs...the idea probably needs to be fleshed out more, but I think this would be elegant.
