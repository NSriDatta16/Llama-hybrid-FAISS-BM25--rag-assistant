touchesBegan stops working when view is moved outside its superview

I'm using [aSubview touchesBegan] to move aSubview 's position around on a screen in relation to its superview. Its superview is not much larger than the subview itself. This is quite straightforward to do as the following snippet shows: UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:[self superview]]; self.center = touchPoint; However once a aSubview is moved, as soon as any portion of it falls outside the bounds of its superview, touches in that section no longer register. In other words, touchesBegan no longer fire. I want touches in aSubview to register no matter where it's moved in relation to its superview. Any thoughts? Howard
