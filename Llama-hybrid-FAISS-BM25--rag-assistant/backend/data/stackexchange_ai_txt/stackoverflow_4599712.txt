I've come up with a solution: to combine B and C. Instead of having a separate search handling activity, I can get B to handle the search and pop up a dialog with the results in it. It doesn't feel elegant, I'd much rather have the separate, but it's the best solution I could find. This is assuming, of course, that it works, but I can't currently see a reason for it not to (in my particular situation). EDIT: Here's the code. EditLocation is A, GetLocationMap is B https://github.com/spookypeanut/Wake-Me-At/tree/e0dde4153c375c20bec3d7201b4faac2300f5956
