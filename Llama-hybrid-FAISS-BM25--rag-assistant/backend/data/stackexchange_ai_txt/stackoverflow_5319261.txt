How to put JavaScript values as hidden form fields?

I have a google map that has a marker which is dragged. When I get the new latitude and longitude coordinates, I need to put them into an HTML form as hidden fields. How can I do that? The example page with current code is here: http://www.comehike.com/outdoors/parks/add_trailhead.php
