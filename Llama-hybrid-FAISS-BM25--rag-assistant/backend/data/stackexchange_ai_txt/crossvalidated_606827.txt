Your basic question is how to deal with an exponentially distributed time series in a regression. The generalized linear model provides a powerful and flexible regression framework. For an exponentially distributed outcome, a GLM with a Gamma family, that is an inverse link and a ^2 variance, meets the probabilistic requirement of an exponentially distributed RV. Since this RV is in the exponential family, this is a maximum likelihood procedure, in much the same way that linear regression is the MLE for a normally distributed response. Further considerations for the time-series nature of the data can thus be handled in the same way that one would handle them in a linear regression model, either by adjusting for exogenous time, lagged response or covariates, or including a covariance structure in a GLMM - a generalized linear mixed model. Clustering algorithms, like KNN, don't seem to have anything to do with the problem.
