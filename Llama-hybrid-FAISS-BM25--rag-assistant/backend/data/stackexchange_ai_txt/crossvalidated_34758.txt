This question isn't getting too much attention, so I'm going to answer to update on what I've found and (hopefully) stimulate discussion. I've ran into an article I'm looking forward to reading that uses DPMs to do classification (Shahbaba and Neal, 2007) which they tested on protein fold data. Essentially it appears that they used did something similar to what I suggested in the comments above. It compared favorable against both neural networks and support vector machines. This comes as a bit of a relief to me since I've dumped a lot of time into these models with an eye towards supervised machine learning problems so it appears I (perhaps) haven't been wasting my time.
