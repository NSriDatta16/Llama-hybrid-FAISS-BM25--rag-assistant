Why is only the last record stored in the database?

I am doing tests in Core Data and have an array with approx. 230 records that i try to store in my database. Unfortunately only the last record seems to be stored in the database. I just can not figure out why as i can see that the while-loop is looping correctly? Also, if one field (nrField) is indexed do i need to add numbers to it or will this happen automatically as i add records to the database? nrFields is the unique counter stored in each record. //=========LOOP ARRAY AND INSERT RECORDS INTO DB==============// while (eOF != 99999) { qNr = [myArray objectAtIndex:xx]; eOF = [qNr intValue]; xx = xx++; if (eOF != 99999) { qDifficulties = [myArray objectAtIndex:xx]; int iDiff = [qDifficulties intValue]; [famQuizInfo setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:iDiff] forKey:@"qDiff"]; xx = xx++; // No action for Category as it is not included in the database any longer xx = xx++; // Calculate +1 to compensate for non existing Category [famQuizInfo setValue:[myArray objectAtIndex:xx] forKey:@"question"]; xx = xx++; [famQuizInfo setValue:[myArray objectAtIndex:xx] forKey:@"qRightAnswer"]; xx = xx++; [famQuizInfo setValue:[myArray objectAtIndex:xx] forKey:@"qWrongAnswer1"]; xx = xx++; [famQuizInfo setValue:[myArray objectAtIndex:xx] forKey:@"qWrongAnswer2"]; [famQuizInfo setValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:0] forKey:@"qNrAccess"]; [famQuizInfo setValue:[NSDate date] forKey:@"qRegDate"]; //NSError *error; if (![qContext save:&error]) { NSLog(@"Whoops, couldn't save: %@", [error localizedDescription]); } xx = xx++; NSLog(@"xx: %i", xx); } }
