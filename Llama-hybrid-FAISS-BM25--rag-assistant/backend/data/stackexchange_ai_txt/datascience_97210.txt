Not exactly an answer but just to say that, PCA is not a great way to approach non-linear relationships in your features. Imagine, trying to fit a linear regression to non linearly distributed data, like in the example below (only difference is PCA tries to minimise sum of squared distances conversely to residual sum of squares): Nonetheless, there is the chance PCA will be able to help measuring some of the data variance however keep in mind that even if no correlations exist in your dataset PCA will return PCs ranked in order of variance in each of your features. I would suggest using kernel PCA, especially if you know there are non-linear relationships in your features.
