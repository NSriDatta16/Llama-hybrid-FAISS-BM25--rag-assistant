Reading your comments, it sounds like you are actually trying to compare entire documents, each containing many words. This is done successfully in information retrieval systems by treating documents as N-dimensional points in space . Each word in the language is an axis. The distance along the axis is determined by the number of times that word appears in the document. Similar documents are then "near" each other in space. This way, the whole document doesn't need to be stored, just its word counts. And usually the most common words in the language are not counted at all.
