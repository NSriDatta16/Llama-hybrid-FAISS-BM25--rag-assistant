logistic regression and binned residual plots: How are the error bounds calculated?

In Gellman and Hill (in the section on checking and comparing logistic regression), it says that the dotted lines are calculated as 2 sqrt{ p (1-p) / n } where n is the number of points per bin. In the binned_residuals function in the performance package in R, we see this: y The error bound (sdev) appears to depend on the variation in the residuals per bin. This leads to a rather strange plots, where the error bounds are very tight for some bins, where the residuals had little variation: Could there be something wrong with the binned_residuals function?
