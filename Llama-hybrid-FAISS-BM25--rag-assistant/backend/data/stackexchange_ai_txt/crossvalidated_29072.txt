There is a blog called Quick-R that should help you with the basics of R. R works with packages. Each package can do something different. There is this packages called "randomForests" that should be just what you are asking for. Be aware that sparse data will give problems no matter what method you apply. To my knowledge it is a very open problem and data mining in general is more an art than a science. Random forests do very well overall but they are not always the best method. You may want to try out a neural network with a lot of layers, that might help.
