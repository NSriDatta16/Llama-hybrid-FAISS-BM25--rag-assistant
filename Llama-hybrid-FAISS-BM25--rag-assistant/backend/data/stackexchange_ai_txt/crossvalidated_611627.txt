Brier score might not be the statistic of interest for a particular task. In that case, Brier score would not be appropriate for comparing a logistic regression and a random forest, but that is because Brier score simply is not the right value to calculate, rather than anything specific to how the values the Brier score evaluates are calculated or estimated. However, if Brier score is what interests you, do calculate it. As long as the inputs to the score are appropriate (have an interpretation as probabilities, so not the log-odds output of a logistic regression or the predicted category that you can get by prediction methods in random forest software), go for it. If there is an objection to doing this because random forests often give probability values that lack calibration and the Brier score will penalize this, that seems like a feature, not a bug, of Brier score. (Or maybe you donâ€™t care about calibration, but then Brier score should not be your statistic of interest.) If there is an objection to calculating the Brier score of a model because the model was not optimized well (mentioned in the comments), that seems like an admission that the model is not very good. If a model is making poor predictions (in terms of Brier score) because it was not optimized well, the key part of that to me is that the model is making poor predictions.
