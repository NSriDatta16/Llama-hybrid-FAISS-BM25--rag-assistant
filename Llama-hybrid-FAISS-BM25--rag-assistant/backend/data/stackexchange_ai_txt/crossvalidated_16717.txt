GMM with Bayes decision model

Given two classes of training data (A and B), I want to fit each class' distribution using a GMM with k components, and then use Bayes Decision Model for the classification. The first step was to use PCA on data set A, project the data into a lower-dimensional subspace, and then for each class do the actually fitting. In MATLAB this would be implemented as: >> Aobj = gmdistribution.fit(A, k, 'Regularize', 1e-5); >> Bobj = gmdistribution.fit(B, k, 'Regularize', 1e-5); However, when I evaluate the pdf for the the training data: >> pdf(Aobj, A) one or two of the data points are assigned huge values (3.200989873206918e+241). What am I missing here? Data set: collection of 50x25 grey-scale images with A and B indicating the presence or absence of pedestrians.
