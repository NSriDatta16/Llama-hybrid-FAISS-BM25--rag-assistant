Playing a Media File from Isolated Storage

I am reading a wav file saved as a byte stream from a web service and want to play it back when my record is displayed. Phone 7 app. My approach has been to save the byte stream to a wav file in isolated storage upon navigating to the record and subsequently set the source of my media player (MediaElement1) to that source when a button is clicked and play it back. Below is my current code in my "PlayButton". (size matches byte stream but no audio results). If I set the stream to a WAV file stored as a resource it does work so perhaps I just need to know how to set the Uri to the Isolated storage file. (e.g. following code works) Mediaelement1.Source = new Uri("SampleData\\MyMedia.wav",UriKind.Relative) Works Mediaelement1.Position = new TimeSpan(0,0,0,0) ; Mediaelement1.Play() ; Here is my code sample... any ideas? IsolatedStorageFile isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication() ; IsolatedStorageFileStream str = new IsolatedStorageFileStream( "MyMedia.wav", FileMode.Open, isf) ; long size = str.Length; mediaelement mediaelement = new MediaElement() ; mediaelement.SetSource(str) ; mediaElement1.Source = mediaelement.Source ; mediaElement1.Position = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 0); mediaElement1.Play();
