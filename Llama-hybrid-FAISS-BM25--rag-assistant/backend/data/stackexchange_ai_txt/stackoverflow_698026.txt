Inserting an HTML fragment into a WPF FlowDocument

I'm dynamically building a WPF FlowDocument from a datasource. One of the data elements is a fragment of HTML - I need to figure out a way to parse that and insert it into my FlowDocument. I've found HTMLToXAMLConverter which will return a XAML representation of the HTML, but I'm still not sure how to best go about instantiating that XAML fragment so I can insert it into my FlowDocument.
