I'd try visualizing data in 3d, use generalized scatterplot matrix or use PCA (if you know what it is) to project data to 2d and then try to see the structure. In such low-dimensional dataset it should be easy to see visually which classifier will be the best, using scikit-learn's comparison of different classifiers .
