How to send email from a Windows service?

I need to send lots of emails (probably hundreds a day) on a schedule. The way I'm thinking to do it is as follows but the problem is that my Body field can get very big, and if I add it as a string, it gets ugly. SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(); //host and port picked from web.config client.EnableSsl = true; MailMessage message = new MailMessage(); message.Body = "test from winservice"; // HERE IS MY PROBLEM message.IsBodyHtml = true; message.From = new MailAddress("donotreply@abcde.com"); message.Subject = "My subject"; message.To.Add(new MailAddress("piniusha@abcde.com")); try { client.Send(message); } catch (Exception) { } When I had to do it from an aspx page, I used: MailDefinition message = new MailDefinition(); message.BodyFileName = @"~\EmailTemplate\Template1.htm"; ListDictionary replacements = new ListDictionary(); replacements.Add(" ", this.txtName.Text); replacements.Add(" ", this.txtPhoneOrEmail.Text); replacements.Add(" ", this.txtMessage.Text); MailMessage msgHtml = message.CreateMailMessage(RECIPIENTS, replacements, new LiteralControl()); I think it is an elegant solution, but I don't want to reference to System.Web.UI.WebControls.MailDefinition because I'm in Winservice. How can I send bulk emails from Winservice? Is it possible to send the emails from a Gmail account? Or they are going to block me after a while?
