Chi-squared - How to deal with replications ; proportion or numbers?

I am studying the effect of different treatments on the number of male, female and hermaphrodite flowers per plant (M, F , H). For each plant studied, I have these 3 numbers.( ex : 250, 11 and 10). I think it's better to run a Chi-squared test to see if the proportion of female, male and hermaphrodite flowers is different according to the treatment. However, I have 3 plants per treatment (3 replications). How could I deal with the different replications to run the Chi-squared ? Should I take the average of my 4 plants in order to get an average number of each type of flowers and then run the khi 2 with the average numbers? For some plants, the number of male flowers is 0, would it be a problem to run the Chi-squared with a 0 value ? Should I use the proportions ( 10% of M, 40% of H and 50% of F for example ), or should I use the real numbers? I was thinking to do a table with each treatment in column, and M, F and H in lines.
