There is no intercept term in Random Forest binary classification model. The intercept term in your problem is from LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) which uses a surrogate model. It is not clear from your question what surrogate model you are using but let's assume its logistic regression. An intercept means how likely is the positive class when all the features happen to have zero value. A large intercept value means a large chance of the positive class. Given that LIME only uses local prediction and can do what-if modeling, you can provide specific, concrete examples to the business. For a given data point, the model makes a prediction of the probability of positive class membership. Since your original model is Random Forest, it might make more sense to show a visualization of the prediction path (not explain a separate surrogate model).
