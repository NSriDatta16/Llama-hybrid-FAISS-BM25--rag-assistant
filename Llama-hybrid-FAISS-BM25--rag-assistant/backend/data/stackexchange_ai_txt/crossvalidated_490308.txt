Detecting correlation between 2 groups of time series

Imagine we wanted to discover potential correlation between 2 devices, and these devices are characterized by a number of individual metrics, each having their own time series. For example a single device might have 3 metrics like this (Device A): ...and another device might have its own set of readings for the same metrics (Device B): How might one discover the correlation between these 2 devices ? Obviously this is more complicated than looking for correlation between 2 time series since each device has multiple time series. Are there techniques for finding the correlation between 2 groups of time series ?
