Logistic regression would be a fine start. The basic function to do binary logistic regression in R is glm . See here for how to use it. If performance seems unacceptably poor you can fit a logistic regression using functions of the original features in order to create a more flexible decision boundary (e.g. glm(formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), ...) ). Make sure to evaluate performance on either a holdout set or via cross-validation so as to prevent overfitting if you take this route. If you are not comfortable making this a binary response then you could try ordinal logistic regression. I believe that the ordinal package in R would be helpful. As a final note, it is not impossible to use OLS linear regression to predict ordinal variables although other things like logistic regression will probably work far better.
