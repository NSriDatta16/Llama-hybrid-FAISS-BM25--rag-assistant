There are a couple of ways to get messages on the Bus from a ASP.NET web app. Firstly you can bootstrap the Bus once in a global place(global.asax or otherwise) and provide a reference to it. We prefer to reference the Bus via some abstraction, typically a class such as ServiceAgent where T is a message you will internally Bus.Send(). If you don't want to boostrap the Bus in your web app, the other option is to expose your NServiceBus endpoint as a WCF service. This is done simply by implementing a class with the WcfService . From there you can simply call the exposed SOAPy service. If you don't like SOAP, you can configure the endpoint differently. From within your endpoint you can then do a Publish().
