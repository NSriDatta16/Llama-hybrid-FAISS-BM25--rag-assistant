Not very familiar with k-medoids, but i guess it's something like k-means, right? If so, the most time-consuming part of the entire model is updating the medoids . We randomly select initial start and update the center of mass to have better cluster results. I suggest you to pickle final_medoids . When you have new data, compute the pca, pass it to kmedoids function with the pickled final_medoids as starting medoids. Then you can use following functions to compute score or something. There might be some tenical errors, but i think the main idea is to save the steady medoids so that we don't need a lot of time for updating.
