Get Decision Tree Prediction With Random Forest

If I give random forest parameters as RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10,bootstrap=False,max_features=None,random_state=2019) Should it be creating 10 same decision trees? But it is not. I am asking the random forest to Sample without replacement (bootstrap=False) and each tree have same number of sample (ie the total data )(verified using plot) Select all features in all trees. But model.estimators_[2] and model.estimators_[5] are different
