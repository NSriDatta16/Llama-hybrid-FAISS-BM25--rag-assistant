Shapley value calculations assume all the features are uncorrelated. Correlated features will split the Shapley values among themselves in unexpected way, usually depending on their scales. The optimal trees probably selected one for each correlated groups to minimize unwanted variance from extra dimensions in the model. If you run PCA on your features, you may find 3~4 dimensions to be optimal, for example.
