How do you want compare Tiles with Velocity? - Tiles is a way to compose page fragments, while Veleocity is a more complete template engine, better comparable with JSP than Tiles. Anyway: I used Spring MVC with Tiles and JSP: It worked greatly, saved a lot of time (toward just using JSP, or JSP with Sitemash), and I did not noticed any performance problems. (But the web application was never used under high load.)
