Perl Array Question

Never done much programming -- been charged at work with manipulating the data from comment cards. Using perl so far I've got the database to correctly put its daily comments into an array. Comments are each one LINE of text within the database, so I just split the array on the line-break. my @comments = split("\n", $c_data); And yes, this being my first time programming, that took me wayyy too long to figure out. At this point I now need to organize these array elements (is that what I should call them?) into their own separate scalars based on capitalized words (this is a behavior of the database, which was at one point corrupt). Example of what two elements of the array look like: print "$comments[0]\n"; This dining experience was GOOD blah blah blah. or print "$comments[1]\n"; Overall this was a BAD time and me and my blah blah. These "good" or "bad" or "best" are already capitalized by the database the data came from. What's the easiest way in Perl to get these lines into scalars from an array based on these capitalized words?
