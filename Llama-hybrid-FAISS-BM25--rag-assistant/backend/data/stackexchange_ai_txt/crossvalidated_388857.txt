What is the recommended maximum number of time steps for RNN or LSTM?

More time steps incurs longer training time, which above certain limit becomes impractical. What is the recommended maximum limit of the number of time steps for RNN or LSTM? I'm using a powerful workstation with GPU, but not a server. Around a few hundreds time steps? A few thousands time steps?
