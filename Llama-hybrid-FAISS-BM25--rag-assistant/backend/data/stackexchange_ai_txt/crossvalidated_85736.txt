You need to relate the range to the standard deviation/variance.Let $\mu$ be the mean, $\sigma$ the standard deviation and $R=x_{(n)} - x_{(1)}$ be the range. Then for the normal distribution we have that $99.7$% of probability mass lies within 3 standard deviations from the mean. This, as a practical rule means that with very high probability, $$\mu + 3\sigma \approx x_{(n)}$$ and $$\mu - 3\sigma \approx x_{(1)}$$ Subtracting the second from the first we obtain $$6\sigma \approx x_{(n)} - x_{(1)}= R$$ (this, by the way is whence the "six-sigma" quality assurance methodology in industry comes). Then you can obtain an estimate for the standard deviation by $$\hat \sigma = \frac 16 \Big(\bar x_{(n)} - \bar x_{(1)}\Big)$$ where the bar denotes averages. This is when you assume that all sub-samples come from the same distribution (you wrote about having expected ranges). If each sample is a different normal, with different mean and variance, then you can use the formula for each sample, but the uncertainty / possible inaccuracy in the estimated value of the standard deviation will be much larger. Having a value for the mean and for the standard deviation completely characterizes the normal distribution.
