There are several attempts to incorporate alternative variations of splitting rules into decisions trees via generalizing the CART algorithm. One prominent one is GUIDE by Wei-Yin Loh in Wisconsin, another is the rotation forest which has also been extended to RandomForest ensembles. My experience with rotation forest hasn't been great byt your mileage may vary. I also haven't used the GUIDE algorithm either, as noted in the 1988 JASA paper on GUIDE the computational complexity is increased by considering linear combinations of features. Also with rotation forest the same complaint with PCA also holds which is that you lose the interpretability of the splits when considering linear combinations that satisfy an orthogonality constraint.
