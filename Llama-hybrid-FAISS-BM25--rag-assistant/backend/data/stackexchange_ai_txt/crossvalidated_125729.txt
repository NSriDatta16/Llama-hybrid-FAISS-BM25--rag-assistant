Spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) are non significant

I want to use latitude and longitude as a feature for models like SVM or Logistic Regression (both for classification). What is the most common approach to use latitude and longitude values as features? I have tried to use decimal representation, I've also tried to scale it (for SVM) and the results were the same as without the latitude/longitude. These features are supposed to be significant in the performance of the model (according to my specific dataset of course).
