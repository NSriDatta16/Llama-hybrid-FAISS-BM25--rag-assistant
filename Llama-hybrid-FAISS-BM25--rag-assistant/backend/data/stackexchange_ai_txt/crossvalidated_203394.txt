A priori I would say that the method is valid. Only a few points: The t-test requires, to be justified by the theory, that your error measurements follow a normal distribution. There exist tests to verify that, but a plot is usually sufficient to convince oneself. Otherwise, look at non-parametric tests (e.g. Mann-Withney). Then the test measures if the respective averages are different between the two methods, taking their variance into account. At 0.05 p-value threshold, it means that you still have a 5% chance that the two methods generate errors according to the same distribution, i.e. the new model is no improvement. Why use a threshold anyway ? Read the p-value as it gets out of the test. It gives you the probability that you a are wrong, which you can base your decision on. Always report it, anyway.
