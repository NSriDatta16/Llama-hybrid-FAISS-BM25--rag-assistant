From the sources, it looks to be pretty tight. Everything is private to either Thread or ThreadLocal. You might be able to do what you need through an instrumentation agent by redefining ThreadLocal to add a method that will dump the locals on the current thread. Here's an example I found for adding logging to an existing class: http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2008/04/24/add-logging-at-class-load-time-with-instrumentation.html You'll need to use BCEL or JavaAssist to patch ThreadLocal bytecode to add the method. Later on, you'll need to use reflection to get a handle to the method so you can call it. Note: this probably won't work if you are running in a restricted environment (applet or appserver) as the security mechanisms generally prevent you from mucking about with system classes.
