Oddly, with reference to the comment "Yep. Turn warning level to 4 and compile again." (Noah Roberts), apparently there is a warning provided that 'ChangeName' takes a non-const reference. If this is a function that takes a const-reference then there's no warning, but the temporary variable is still created. Perhaps this is just another vaguary of the Microsoft compiler.
