Yes! I have been having the same problem with "duplicate MCs". This is especially troubling when you need to move between levels or "frames" in the timeline. All I would like to do is have the MC (target) I drag to always be on top of other draggable MCs. One thing is for certain what is causing it is this code: setChildIndex( target, numChildren - 1 ); Oh, give me back, getNextHighestDepth(); !!!
