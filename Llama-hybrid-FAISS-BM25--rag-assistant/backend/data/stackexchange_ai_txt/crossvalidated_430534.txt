An easy way to go about answering your question is to look up the common classification tables. For instance, 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification is used by some publications to classify papers. These are relevant because that's how a lot of authors classify their own papers. There are many examples of similar classifications, e.g. arxiv's classification or Russian education ministry's UDK (universal decimal classifictaion) which is used widely for all publications and research. Another example is JEL Claasification System of American Economic Association. Rob Hyndman's paper " Automatic time series forecasting: the forecast package for R ." It's classified as C53,C22,C52 according to JEL. Hyndman has a point though in criticizing the tree classifications. A better approach could be tagging, e.g. the keywords in his paper are: "ARIMA models, automatic forecasting, exponential smoothing, prediction intervals, state space models, time series, R." One could argue that these are better way to classify the papers, as they're not hierarchical and multiple hierarchies could be built. @whuber made a good point that some latest advances such as machine learning will not be under statistics in current classifications. For instance, take a look at the paper " Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians " by Catherine F. Higham, Desmond J. Higham. They classified their paper under aforementioned MSC as 97R40, 68T01, 65K10, 62M45. these are under computer science, math education and numerical analysis in addition to stats
