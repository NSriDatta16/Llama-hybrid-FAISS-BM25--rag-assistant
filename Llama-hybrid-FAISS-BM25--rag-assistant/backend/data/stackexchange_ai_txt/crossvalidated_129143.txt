Paired samples or independent sample hypothesis test for two time periods

I want to know if employees in an organization are surveyed in 2013 and again in 2014 if the samples from the two time periods are considered related and dependent or independent if they are asked the same likert-type questions for purposes of a hypothesis test for change on individual items. They would not be matched pairs. For small samples what would be the appropriate statistical test and should a finite population factor be considered for confidence intervals?
