Barring the storage considerations and some initial confusion from future DBAs, I don't see any reason why NUMERIC(38,0) would be a bad idea. You're allowing for up to 9.99 x 10^38 records in your table, which you will certainly never reach. My quick digging into this didn't turn up any glaring reason not to use it. I suspect that your only potential issue will be the storage space consumed by that, but seeing as how storage space is so cheap, that shouldn't be an issue. I've seen this a fair number of times in Oracle databases since it's a pretty big default value that you don't need to think about when you're creating a table, similar to using INT or BIGINT by default in SQL Server.
