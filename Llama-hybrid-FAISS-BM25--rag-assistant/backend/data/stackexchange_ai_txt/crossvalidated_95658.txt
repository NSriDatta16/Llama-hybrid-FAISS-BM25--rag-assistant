Are there useful distributions for ternary variables (e.g. $-1,0,1$ data)?

The title says it. If one wishes to analyze ternary outcomes—that is categorical outcomes with specifically three values (-1,0,1)—are $\chi^{2}$ / contingency table tests and multinomial-logistic regression type models the only choices for making inferences, or are there well-articulated and useful ternary distributions and related inferential methods that we might consider as an alternative? Such data result in the differences of two 1/0-coded nominal variables, in the qualitative (sign) representation of causal effects (e.g. in loop analysis), in ternary logic , and perhaps elsewhere.
