You're spot on in thinking it's ideal to separate the news and user list out to partial views as you can reuse them in other parts. It's also ideal to separate the data functions for these out too into a separate class often call repository class. So you might have a News repository class which would have a GetNews function on there. You can then call that function from inside your news list. Anywhere else you want to get those lists you can just call that function and you're not writing the same data retrieval code again.
