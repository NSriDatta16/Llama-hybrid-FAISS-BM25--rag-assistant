Time series analysis vs linear regression

I am working on developing an algorithm which will predict the future traffic for the restaurant. I am confuse that which of the two: Linear regression or time series analysis I should use as the base for my algorithm. The features I am using are: Day,whether there was festival,temperature,climatic condition , current rating,whether there was holiday,service rating,number of reviews etc. Please guide me how should I proceed . Also how can I optimize my algorithm so that it can learn with time.
