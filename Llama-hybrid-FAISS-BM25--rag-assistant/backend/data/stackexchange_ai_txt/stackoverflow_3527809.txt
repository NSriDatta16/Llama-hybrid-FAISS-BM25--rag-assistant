Mobile Phone: google maps api or native sdk - capabilities?

We have an existing website which currently uses v2 of the google maps api which displays cellphone signal strength as a ground overlay on top of the google maps tiles (similar to this http://www.vodafone.co.nz/coverage/ ) What I would like to know is if it's possible to have ground/tile overlays in google maps android/iphone native api's? The client is wanting to create an iPhone app, but we figured we may aswell make an android app while where at it. Personally I'd prefer to make it just a web app which would then work on any modern mobile browser but then I guess its not a native app. which has its downsides I guess since you can't just tell people to get it off the app store. But im unsure of the capabilitys of the iphone/android native google maps api. I've set up a very basic map app in android but there doesn't seem to be any support for ground overlays and not even polygons The funconality I need but not sure if the Android/iPhone native api supports are: drawing polygon's ground/tile overlays Would It be better to just create a web app using google maps api v3 in javascript. I've never doing any mobile app dev so not sure if a web app is a good option
