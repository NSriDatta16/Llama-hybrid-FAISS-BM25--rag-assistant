time series - Poor prediction using ARIMA model

I am trying to fit and forecast log returns of a price data using ARIMA model in R. For reproducibility, data is provided here . Steps Followed, Code and Results obtained Check for outliers (Package: forecast ) - No outliers detected. outliers Stationarity Check using ADF test (Package: fUnitRoots) - Series found to be stationary stationary Determination of p,d,q using ACF and PACF (Package: astsa) - Based on my understanding, p = 2, d = 0, q = 2 acf2(log.rtn, lags = 20) Fitting ARIMA (Package: forecast) fit Model obtained : ARIMA(2,0,1) Series: log.rtn ARIMA(2,0,1) with zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 -0.5705 0.1557 0.6025 s.e. 0.1549 0.0532 0.1519 sigma^2 estimated as 0.001086: log likelihood=775.57 AIC=-1543.14 AICc=-1543.04 BIC=-1527.29 Prediction (Package:forecast) fcast I am quite confused why the model is predicting so badly.
