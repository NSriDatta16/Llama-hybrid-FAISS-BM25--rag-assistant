It sounds like you have time series data, in which case multiple linear regression is going to give you biased estimates. Even without that, however, I don't think your approach is correct. In your comment to @Michael you say you want to "analyze the influence of single variables" but influence on what? Presumably on the dependent variable (electricity usage). Then decide: Controlling for what? And include those variables in your model. And I would make that decision of which variables to include based on substantive knowledge. If you want to include multiple models, there are methods for model averaging, but they are more complex that what you outline.
