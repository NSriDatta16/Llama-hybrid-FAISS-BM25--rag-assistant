What's the best pattern to handle a table row datastructure?

The Facts I have the following datastructure consisting of a table and a list of attributes (simplified): class Table { List m_attributes; } abstract class Attribute {} class LongAttribute extends Attribute {} class StringAttribute extends Attribute {} class DateAttribute extends Attribute {} ... Now I want to do different actions with this datastructure: print it in XML notation print it in textual form create an SQL insert statement create an SQL update statement initialize it from a SQL result set First Try My first attempt was to put all these functionality inside the Attribute , but then the Attribute was overloaded with very different responsibilities. Alternative It feels like a visitor pattern could do the job very well instead, but on the other side it looks like overkill for this simple structure. Question What's the most elegant way to solve this?
