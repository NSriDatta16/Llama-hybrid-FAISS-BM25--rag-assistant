Dual-trained medical oncologist and biostatistician here. In theory, censoring should be noninformative because informative censoring causes bias. In practice, not all bias is clinically important . Papers 1 and 2 are only talking about (A) how they've chosen to define their outcome; what counts as an event, what counts as a censoring. They make no claim about (B) whether these censorings are informative or noninformative. (A) and (B) are two separate issues that should not be mixed together. If the desired event is a composite of stopping due to inefficacy or toxicity, you are (B) technically correct in that censoring due to remission is informative (for brevity, I'm going to focus on stopping due to remission). This is because a patient in remission obviously has a very different risk of inefficacy compared to the average patient under observation. These remissions will bias the drug to look worse (think of it as "cherry-picking away the cream of the crop"). This bias could be important in theory if there was some huge difference in the pattern of remissions between different drugs but is unimportant in practice because remissions comprised a tiny proportion of drug discontinuations. But let's take a step back. We're using the composite outcome of inefficacy or toxicity as a construct for measuring the drug's "badness." Lower risk of an event means a less bad drug. Obviously, stopping due to remission cannot count as a badness event, so (A) the investigators chose to censor instead. Sure it's informative, but let's think about whether they could have chosen any differently: They could have continued counting those patients as under observation, but now they've simply traded informative censoring bias for immortal time bias, among other problems. They could have used a competing risks model, which might give the "hazard ratio for inefficacy/toxicity if the remissions never happened." This might be a purer measure of "inefficacy/toxicity" on paper but is arguably a worse measure of "drug badness" which is actually what we're interested in clinically . I don't see the point of a multistate model here. It's not as if remission is some sort of intermediate step between taking the drug and stopping for inefficacy/toxicity. In summary, I think the decision to censor remissions is reasonable, but this is on (A) clinical and pragmatic grounds and has nothing to do with (B) informativeness.
