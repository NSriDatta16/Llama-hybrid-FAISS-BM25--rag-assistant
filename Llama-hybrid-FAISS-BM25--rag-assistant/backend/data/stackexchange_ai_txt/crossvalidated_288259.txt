One way to think of this is as repeated Bernoulli trials with an equal probability of success $θ$. Suppose you observe 10,000 trials, all of which succeed, and you want to know the probability that an additional 62,000,000 - 10,000 = 61,990,000 trials would also all succeed. I'm at a loss to formulate a frequentist approach to this problem, using a confidence interval. But a Bayesian approach seems natural: you want the posterior probability of all 61,990,000 trials succeeding given your prior beliefs about $θ$ and the 10,000 observed successes. Let $θ$ have a $\operatorname{Beta}(α, β)$ prior. Then its posterior distribution is $\operatorname{Beta}(10,000 + α, β)$. Then the posterior predictive probability for success of a single future trial happens to be just the posterior mean of $θ$, which is $$\frac{10,000 + α}{10,000 + α + β} \quad .$$ For the probability that 61,990,000 independent trials succeed, just raise this quotient to the 61,990,000th power. It is interesting to note that because 61,990,000 is so large, this probability will be very small unless $α$ is much larger than $β$; that is, unless you were already virtually certain that your method was extremely accurate before you even observed those 10,000 successes.
