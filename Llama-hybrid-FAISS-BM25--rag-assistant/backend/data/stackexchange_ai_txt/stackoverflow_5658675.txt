Replacing a fragment with another fragment inside activity group

I have a fragment inside a group activity and I want to replace it with another fragment: FragmentTransaction ft = getActivity().getFragmentManager().beginTransaction(); SectionDescriptionFragment bdf = new SectionDescriptionFragment(); ft.replace(R.id.book_description_fragment, bdf); ft.setTransition(FragmentTransaction.TRANSIT_FRAGMENT_OPEN); ft.addToBackStack(null); ft.commit(); It works fine when it is done as a seperate project without using activity group, every thing works fine in log cat as control goes inside getview(), but no view is visible, not even any exception arises, I want the book detail fragment to be replaced by section detail fragment. Xml of book detail fragment has id book_description_fragment and xml for section description fragment has id section_description_fragment. The above code is in onClick method of an item, I want that when user taps on an item in horizontal scroll view, then the fragment changes.
