The difference was, it appears, due to the different implementation of Random Forests in R and Cascading Pattern (as well as openscoring which I tried later) with respect to ties in the tree voting - i.e. when an even number of trees are built (say, 500) and exactly half classify an application as Good , and the other half as Bad , the handling of those situations differs. Solved it by growing and odd (501) number of trees.
