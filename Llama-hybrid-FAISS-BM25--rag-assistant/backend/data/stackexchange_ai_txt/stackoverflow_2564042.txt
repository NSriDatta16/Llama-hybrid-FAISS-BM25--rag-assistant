Div positioning on a canvas with arrows bindings

I'm searching for a little piece of javascript that can attach to a div (in data-x data-y attributes for example) the x,y coordinates of a draggable div. And then be able to draw arrows between them (using a data-targetid attribute?). If the solution can look like a simple version of graphview , jsPlumb or vizster but without the complicated library, and only in javascript/html
