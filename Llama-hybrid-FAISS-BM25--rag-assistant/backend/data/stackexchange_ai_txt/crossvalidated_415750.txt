Comparing Neural Network Architectures

I wanted to compare two Neural Net architectures, with the rest of hyper-parameters the same. Now once I have trained it I see the following observations: One of the accuracy curves of 1st NN is much more oscillatory than the 2nd (the 2nd has similar accuracy but the oscillatory 1st one sometimes goes up in accuracy and sometimes goes done compared to the relatively smooth curve of the 2nd NN) The loss curve of 2nd NN is lower than the 1st NN. What can we conclude from this? Which one is better and why?
