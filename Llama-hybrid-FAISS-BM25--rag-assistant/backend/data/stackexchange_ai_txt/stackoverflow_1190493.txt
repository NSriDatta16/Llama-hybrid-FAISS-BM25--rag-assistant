In case anybody else ever wants to know the answer... It appears the best solutions might be: Move the Isolated Storage code into a separate Assembly which can be called from both the main application and the uninstaller, so that they can both access the data. Add a means for executing the main application with a command line flag that instructs it to delete the Isolated Storage files and exit, then call it from the uninstaller. or save all this messing about and ditch Isolated Storage altogether
