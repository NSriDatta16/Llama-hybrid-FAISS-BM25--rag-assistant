Rails XML Builder: How do I in-explicitly construct XML elements?

I am trying to use xml builder without explicit definition of elements. This is useful when the required elements are variant. How can I accomplish something similar to the following? xml.instruct! :xml, :version=>"1.0", :encoding=>"UTF-8" for col in [:customer, :name, :address, :city, :street, :postal_code] eval("xml.#{col.to_s.upcase}(#{self[col]})") end This code obviously does not work if there is a ' or " in self[col]. I would also prefer not to use eval. I have already tried: xml.send(col.to_s.upcase, self[col]
