Jython classes and variable scope

What I want to know is, how can I create GUI elements using swing inside a Jython class so that they can be referenced from outside the class, and I can use statements like button.setText("Hello") on an object that was created inside another class. For example: foo.py: from javax.swing import * class Test(): def __init__(self): frame = JFrame("TEST") button = JButton("Hey") frame.add(button) frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE) frame.setSize(300,200) frame.show() and then I have another file called somethingelse.py: from foo import * run = Test() If I were to want to change the button text by using run.button.setText("Message") , how could I organise the Test() class such that I could change the text from the second file, somethingelse.py .
