You can't. But you can use an Access runtime instead to run you project on the systems where there is no Access installed. Everything you have to do is to supply your clients runtime installation and copy of your project. Of course you can prepare a nice installation program to accomplish the task and install the whole solution smoothly without client's/your attention with just only few clicks. Take a look at: Access 2007 runtime There is a nice difference between runtime for Access 2007 and older versions. Currently you can have the runtime installation for free (for you and your clients), instead of paying for Access 2003 development tools (and also runtime components).
