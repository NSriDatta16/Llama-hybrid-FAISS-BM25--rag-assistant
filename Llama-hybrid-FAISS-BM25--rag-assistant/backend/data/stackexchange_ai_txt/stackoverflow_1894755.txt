Answer has already been provided, this may happen during construction: It might also be a funny source of run-time errors, so pay special attention to constructors & pure virtual methods calls in the base class ;) http://support.microsoft.com/kb/125749 class A; void fcn( A* ); class A { public: virtual void f() = 0; A() { fcn( this ); } }; class B : A { void f() { } }; void fcn( A* p ) { p->f(); } // The declaration below invokes class B's constructor, which // first calls class A's constructor, which calls fcn. Then // fcn calls A::f, which is a pure virtual function, and // this causes the run-time error. B has not been constructed // at this point, so the B::f cannot be called. You would not // want it to be called because it could depend on something // in B that has not been initialized yet. B b; void main() { }
