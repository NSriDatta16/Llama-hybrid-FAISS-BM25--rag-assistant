Fitting data in a generalized Pareto distribution and parameter estimation

I have log(return) data as time series, how I can fit this data in a Generalized Pareto distribution and estimate the parameters of this distribution, any kind of resource pointer with clear code would be good for me, If it can be done using open-source like R or Python that would be great.
