Specifying a multilevel model: an experimental psychologists nightmare

Thank you greatly for your help in answering this question. I am having some trouble figuring out how to define my multilevel model. Firstly, a description of what I have completed. This is the prelude to a wider experimental piece of work. I had participants rate 25 images for their attractiveness (outcome). The images varied in waist to hip ratio (factor: 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0) and BMI (factor: emaciated, underweight, average, overweight, obese). I also measured the individuals sociosexual orientation (continuous: 1-100). So, I have the following model: Outcome: attractiveness (ordinal data on a Likert scale 1-7) Predictors: WHR (categorical) BMI (categorical) Sociosexual orientation (continuous) What I am looking to see is whether the attractiveness scores were influenced by BMI, WHR and their interaction, and whether there was an interaction between sociosexual orientation and WHR, sociosexual orientation and BMI, and sociosexual orientation, WHR and BMI. Basically, I want to see whether WHR and BMI of the person has an effect on attractiveness scores and whether the sociosexual orientation of the participants influences those judgements. I believe I want WHR and BMI as fixed effects, but sociosexual orientation as a random effect? I hope this makes sense. I find multilevel models very difficult to conceptualise.
