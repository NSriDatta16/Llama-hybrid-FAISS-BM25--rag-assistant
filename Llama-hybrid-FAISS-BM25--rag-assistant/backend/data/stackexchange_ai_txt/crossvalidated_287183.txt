What Bayesian prior for normally distributed data with knowledge observations are too high

I'm just learning Bayesian statistics with stan, so bear with me. Let's say we have one observed data points: tweets_dat I've left the error term incomplete as I don't yet know exactly what should go there. I know that the mean from my observations should have mean of 1100. In other words, if the 2500 is quite high. I estimate it is two standard deviations away from the mean. How can I make my model reflect this prior knowledge? I'm using a simple Bayesian model, but it's not clear to me how to put that two standard deviations information into the model or into the standard error in such a way that I arrive at the right parameters in the end. data { int J; real y[J]; real sigma[J]; } parameters { real theta[J]; } model { y ~ normal(theta, sigma); }
