I have customized customer module to meet my requirement. I am able to rewrite block classes of customer module. I am trying to add one custom block class in this module which is not exists in existing customer module but I don't know how to accomplish this. my code looks like in config.xml Mynamespace_Customer_Block_Widget_Name Mynamespace_Customer_Block_Form_Register Mynamespace_Customer_Block_Form_Edit I created a new block class under the Form directory of customer module called 'Test.php' And customer layout file looks like But it is not executing the block class file. Is there anything should be added in config.xml file of this module? Please help how this block can be integrated with existing module. Thanks.
