Docking *inside* an editor

I have a document type which has multiple presentations. Say I want to display the document in an RCP editor with a customizable subset of those presentations, in a layout chosen by the user. One option that has come up is docking-like behavior for the panels inside an individual editor, with drag-and-drop, resizing, closing, maybe rollover and floating. Clearly this would need usability testing, but my question here is of feasibility. Are there any existing libraries or e4 plans to support behavior like this?
