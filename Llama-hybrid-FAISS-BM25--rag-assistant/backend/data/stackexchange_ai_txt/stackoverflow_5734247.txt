Trigger a page change based on a textbox edit

My problem is that, I want to call a code behind function from a JS. So that I can implement TextBox on Click event. I am NEW in JS so bear with me on this one...What I heard is that from the client side scripting you cannot call anything to the server (code behind). Here is my code: function callCodeBehind() { } This is my Textbox: This is my code behind: protected void txtAgentName_TextChanged() { } This function is getting fired on Page_Load() , which I don't want it to. All I want is that to call this function txtAgentName_TextChanged() when user clicks on txtAgentName textbox. Help!
