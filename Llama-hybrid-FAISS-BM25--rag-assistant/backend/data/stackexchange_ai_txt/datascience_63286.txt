Your ways of putting coefficient value denotes the relative importance of such variable is wrong. You need to also say that predictor variable is standardized(zero-centred and s.d. of 1) to make it a better argument. Personally I don't think . If you are discussing this on data science stack exchange we only care about how the relationship between efficiency and fuel. So we start of with prior assumption of $$efficiency = a \cdot displacement^2 + b\cdot displacement + c$$ and how we can find such $a,b,c$ and whether quadratic relationship could be a fit that could also generalize well with our data. Whether or not the relationship makes any sense is subject to people that has better domain expertise to interpret. Predictor importance reference
