Logistic regression with one variable

Why does the b-value in logistical regression tell how much do the odds change when X increases by one? For example if we have people who smoke and people who don't and we are trying to find out how does smoking affect coronary artery disease. If we have total people of 500, 210 people who smoke and 290 who don't. Of those who smoke 81 have coronary artery disease and of those who don't 62 have coronary artery disease. If I use logistical regression for this in SPSS i get that the b-value is 0,837 and this value hasn't been explained at all in my materials. Could someone tell me what the b coefficient is and what does it have to do with odds?
