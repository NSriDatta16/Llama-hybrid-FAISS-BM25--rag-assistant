Given disk is slow and multiple cores does on the fly decompression make sense for performance?

It used to be that disk compression was used to increase storage space at the expense of efficiency but we were all on single processor systems back then. These days there are extra cores around to potentially do the decompression work in parallel with processing the data. For I/O bound applications (particularly read heavy sequential data processing) it might be possible to increase throughput by only reading and writing compressed data to disk. Does anyone have any experience to support or reject this conjecture?
