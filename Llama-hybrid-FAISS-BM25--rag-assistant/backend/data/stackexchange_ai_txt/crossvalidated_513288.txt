Just simple AE (Autoencoders) are neural nets that do Identity function: $f(X)=X$ . They are simpler than the VAE, but very interesting as you may experiment with LV (latent variables). They have encoding/decoding functions and a loss function. GMM? Well you think of them as generalizing k-means clustering procedure where we can detect the centers of the latent Gaussians (latent variables in general). So there are similarities with AE/VAE and any other generative models model in general since these generative models are made to learn the distribution of data classes (features). All these are getting the information about the covariance structure of the data.
