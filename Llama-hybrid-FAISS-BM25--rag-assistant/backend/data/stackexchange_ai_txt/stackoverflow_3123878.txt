Where to find a full list of gcc warnings and errors?

Sometimes I need to use a gcc for cross-platform work, and sometimes gcc really amuses me with its warnings. For example: #pragma once in a main file This is very informative warning, but I really don't know what a 'main file' IS in terminology of gcc and WHY it must not contain #pragma once :). So, does any documentation exist that covers all gcc warnings and errors (mostly warnings, errors are trivial) with some comments on them?
