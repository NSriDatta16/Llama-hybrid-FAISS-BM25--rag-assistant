Flashbuilder 4 and Clearcase plugin

I am running flash builder 4 plugin on eclipse Ganymede 3.4.2 I'm trying to install ClearCase plugin for eclipse but it is giving me no repository found errors. Has anyone run into this? I saw a workaround on a Java forum but it doesn't work in flex view. Also, I'm willing to even install ClearCase remote client 7.1 bit I can't even get the IBM installation manager installed. Their instructions are impossible. I'm at my wits end. Can anyone possibly lend a hand? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you
