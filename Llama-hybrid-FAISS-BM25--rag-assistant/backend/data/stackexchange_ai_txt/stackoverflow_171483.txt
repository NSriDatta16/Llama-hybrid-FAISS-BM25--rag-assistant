In general, the following regular expression fragment is what you are looking for: "(.*?)" This uses the non-greedy *? operator to capture everything up to but not including the next double quote. Then, you use a language-specific mechanism to extract the matched text. In Python, you could do: >>> import re >>> string = '"Foo Bar" "Another Value"' >>> print re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', string) ['Foo Bar', 'Another Value']
