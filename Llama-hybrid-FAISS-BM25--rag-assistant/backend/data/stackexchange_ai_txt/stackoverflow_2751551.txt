I'd suggest using the jQuery UI Dialog plugin for custom modal windows. You can find demonstration and documentation here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/ In theory, to do what you're asking for, you could follow these steps: Add a “dialog” div tag to your page. Build the link into your data feed. If you’re using a XML data type make sure you use a CDATA flag to encapsulate your link so that they XML may be parsed correctly. text]]> In this instance, since we know the actual id at the time the link is create, I pre-populated the id (e.g. 551) in the function. This could also be retrieved from jqGrid API with the selrow property. It’s your call. If you use a JSON data type, the idea would similar. You wouldn’t have to worry about the CDATA qualifier. Create a local function (e.g. showDialog (id)) to correspond to your link. Add code in the showDialog function to populate and open the modal dialog. Using an AJAX call to gather specific data for this record, create the dialog content and populate the dialog using the jQuery .html method. function showDialog (id) { $.ajax({ url: "feed.aspx?id=" + id, success: function(data) { var content = // TODO: create dialog layout here $("#dialog").html(content); $("#dialog").dialog({ title: 'Record Details', modal: true, closeOnEscape: true, width: 300, height: 200, buttons: false, position: "center", }); $("#dialog").dialog("open"); } }); } This is just one way to skin the cat. You should be able to use more of a jQuery approach with the link creation. If desired, rather than building the specific link the data feed, you could add jQuery click event bindings to handle the request. It’s your call. You could also add the dialog div dynamically to your page using jQuery rather than just placing it manually like I described above. It might be a little more elegant looking but would achieve the same goal.
