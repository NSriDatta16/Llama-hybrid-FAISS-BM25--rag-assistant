If I am not mistaken the dataset used is the Boston home values dataset from http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston The given code works fine on google colab if the dataset used is correct. Please check the dataset before proceeding further. Here are the screenshots for the same. Step 1: Reading the dataset Step 2: Printing the first 5 rows of the dataset Step 3: Generating descriptive statistics using agg function in Pandas Note: I changed the column names according to the dataset Here is another solution for step 3 Note: I have run the script on google colab. Your problem might be there due to version issues. Here is the code used. import pandas as pd import numpy as np house=pd.read_csv('Boston.csv') house.columns house.groupby('medv').agg( avg_Nox=('nox', 'mean'), rng=("nox", lambda x: (max(x) - min(x)))) house.groupby(['medv'])['nox'].agg( [('avg_nox', np.mean), ('rng', lambda x: (max(x)-min(x)))]) You can view a similar machine learning project which predicts the price of the house based on other variable here https://bit.ly/3ApVCAO
