I will give you an answer for the mapping between the autocovariances and the spectrum of a time series. Your question is about the cross-correlation and cross-spectrum, but the ideas below may be helpful. The mapping between the autocovariances or order $\tau$, $\gamma(\tau)$ and the spectral density, $f(\omega)$, can be expressed as follows: $$ \gamma(\tau) = \int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{i\omega\tau} f(\omega) \, d\omega \,. $$ Given the spectral density, the autocovariances can be obtained in R as follows: # generate a sample series set.seed(123) x Sample autocovariances and the values inferred from the mapping are close to each other: plot(seq.int(0, length(gamma)-1), gamma, xlab = "lag order") lines(seq.int(0, length(gamma)-1), Re(b)) legend("topright", bty = "n", lty = c(0, 1), pch = c(1, NA), legend = c("sample autocovariances", "autocovariances mapped from the spectral density")) The following points will also apply for the cross-spectrum and cross-covariances: More accurate values are expected when a smoothed version of the periodogram (as obtained by spectrum ) rather than the raw periogram Mod(fft(x))/(2*pi*length(x)) . Depending on the range and scale of frequencies used to compute the spectrum, your definition of $\omega$ ( w in the code) may change. Observe that in the code above the integral is summed over the range $(0, \pi]$. The conjugate values are then added up so that the complete range $(-\pi, \pi]$ is covered. The imaginary part of the complex numbers will therefore cancel out. There may be a way to use the inverse Fourier transform that you mention, but for a test version it may be safer to obtain the products $e^{i\omega\tau} f(\omega)$ in an explicit loop.
