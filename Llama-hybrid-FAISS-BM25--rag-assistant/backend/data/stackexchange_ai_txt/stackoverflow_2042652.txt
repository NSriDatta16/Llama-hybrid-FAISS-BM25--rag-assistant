How to model coarse grained geolocation to correct market

Use case example: Client A comes to request sales information, enters their zip code and are directed to Representative X. Since there is an effectively infinite number of zip codes there will not be an agent assigned to every single zip code which would then move out to the county level, and then so on into a region of counties and finally end at the state level. What type of relationships would be best at modeling this scenario? Is there any way to remove the need to specifically define regions that a zip code could be approximated to a nearest county assigned a rep, if so would it only be possible with a full geolocation look up to do distance comparisons to find the nearest representative or perhaps could the zip code itself be used to closely approximate the distance? Clarification: The real intent of this question is how to solve the region approximation without needing to maintain a perfect association table of counties to regions or is the solution to this problem so complex that the cost of maintaining the relationships manually is less prohibitive?
