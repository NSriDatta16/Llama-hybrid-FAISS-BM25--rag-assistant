Including future values in a regression

If I have a variable that depends on its expected value in the future among other things (for example inflation), would it be possible to regress it on future values of the dependent variables (in a sense an AR model but with future lags instead). For example runnng the regression $y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 y_{t+1}+\beta_2 x_{t}+\beta_3 x_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ Does this create an endogeneity problem? In a sense I am using future values as a proxy for expectations (which would assume agents have rational expectations).
