Nonlinear basis functions are perfectly acceptable for generalized linear models like logistic regressions. You’re probably familiar with polynomial models, such as including a quadratic term in a linear regression. For modeling more bizarre curvature like you seem to have, splines could be your friend. For reputable sources, Frank Harrell’s blog and Regression Modeling Strategies textbook talk about using nonlinear basis functions (chiefly splines) to model nonlinear relationships, and his rms R package implements splines through the rms::rcs function for so-called restricted cubic splines.
