To expand a bit on @PeterFlom : Think of a target at which an individual can shoot. Reliability means that the shots are all close together, but it does not necessarily mean that they have to be close to the bullseye. Validity means that the shots are on average close to the bullseye, but it does not necessarily mean that the shots are close together. So a valid measure can be reliable or not and a reliable measure can be valid or not; all combinations are perfectly feasible. So these are really two separate characteristics of a measurement.
