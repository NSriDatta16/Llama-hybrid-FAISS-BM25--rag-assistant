chmike, this really sounds like the sort of thing you want to do first the simpler way, and see how it behaves. Any sort of GPU voxelization approach is pretty fragile to system details once you get into big volumes at least (which you don't seem to have). In your shoes I'd definitely want the straightforward implementation first, if for no other reason that to check against....
