Multiple imputation vs single imputation

We have missing data which we want to impute in order to provide an imputed value to some business users. However, we will not be providing any other information other than the point estimate. In addition, we don't have the capacity to provide a range of possible values derived from multiple imputations. The only thing we can provide is one single value for each missing data point. In this situation, is it still advised to use multiple imputation (and take the average over the imputations) over single imputation?
