Probably not the most concise possible, but perhaps something like the following? (use 'clojure-csv.core) (doseq [file (.listFiles (File. "data/"))] (if (.matches (.getName file) ".*[.]CSV$") (doseq [[x y z] (parse-csv (slurp file))] "... do whatever stuff you want with x, y, z...")))) N.B. uses the clojure-csv library. This would be more elegant and shorter if I could find an obvious way to get a filtered directory list without resorting to regexes.... but it eludes me for the moment UPDATE: Brian's link to Java support for globbing is also useful and interesting and offers a more general/robust approach than simple regexes - however it depends on Java 1.7 (too cutting edge for some?) and it doesn't really shorten the code much.
