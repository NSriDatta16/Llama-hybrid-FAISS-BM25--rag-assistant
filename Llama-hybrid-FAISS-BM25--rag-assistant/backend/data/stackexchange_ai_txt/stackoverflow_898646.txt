Browser agnosticism - In enterprise apps, it used to be that the developer would target the app at a specific browser, just for simplicity's sake. In internet accessible apps, the developer must target the vast majority of browsers. While this has gotten easier in the last few years, it is still a issue that needs attention. Scalability - its easier to scale an enterprise app, its easier to predict the growth of usage of the app, or simply design for access by all users in the org at once. This is not generally the case for internet sites. The day you get slashdotted, or dugg is the day that you learn this. Better to design scalability in from the start, rather than have to learn it at the time that your site starts to suffer.
