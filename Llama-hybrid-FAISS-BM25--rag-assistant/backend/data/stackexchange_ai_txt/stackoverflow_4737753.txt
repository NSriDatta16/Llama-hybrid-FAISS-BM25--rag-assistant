calculate average over multiple data frames

I would like to use R for plotting performance evaluation results of distinct DB systems. For each system I loaded the same data and execute the same queries in several iterations. The data for a single systems looks like this: "iteration", "lines", "loadTime", "query1", "query2", "query3" 1, 100000, 120.4, 0.5, 6.4, 1.2 1, 100000, 110.1, 0.1, 5.2, 2.1 1, 50000, 130.3, 0.2, 4.3, 2.2 2, 100000, 120.4, 0.1, 2.4, 1.2 2, 100000, 300.2, 0.2, 4.5, 1.4 2, 50000, 235.3, 0.4, 4.2, 0.5 3, 100000, 233.5, 0.7, 8.3, 6.7 3, 100000, 300.1, 0.9, 0.5, 4.4 3, 50000, 100.2, 0.4, 9.2, 1.2 What I need now (for plotting) is a matrix or data frame containing the average of these measurements. At the moment I am doing this: # read the file all_results I could put all this into a function and calculate the average matrix in a for loop, but I have the vague feeling that there must be a more elegant solution. Any ideas? What can I do for cases when I have incomplete results, e.g., when one iteration has less rows than the others? Thanks!
