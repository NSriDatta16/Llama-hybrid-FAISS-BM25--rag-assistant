Are there alternatives to UltraWinGrid?

I've been using the Infragistics UltraWinGrid for a while in a C# project, and while it's very spiffy, it is sometimes a bit heavy to run (and editing it in Visual Studio can be hazardous). I'm looking for a lighter alternative. Looks (always a big plus with Infragistics) are not as important as functionality. Namely, I'm looking for a beefed up DataGridView which: has data binding (duh!) has lock control over editing allows for sub-tables on opening a row can have multiple headers to group columns together (say header 1 is composed of "Group A" and "Group B", and header 2 has various columns under each group) has sorting by column (and can sort numbers properly, even if it does not have a stock method at first) has filtering by column (perhaps the most demanding spec) Ã  la UltraWinGrid/Excel (text field with a way to specify if the filter is equal, not equal, greater, lesser, starts with, ends with, etc). supports check box, text box or data bound list/combo box cells allows cells to be merged (not the control cells of course!) can have events bound to each row (say double click)
