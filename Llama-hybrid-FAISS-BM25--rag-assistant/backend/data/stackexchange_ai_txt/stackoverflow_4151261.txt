How to create a local central repository for maven artifacts

My organization uses maven for all our projects. Every time we create new maven project, the artifacts are downloaded from maven central repository. But i want to create organization level local repository where all the maven artifacts are available and when new maven project created should look for the artifact in local repository and if not found, then only look in the maven central repository. Can anyone let me know how to do this. Thanks.
