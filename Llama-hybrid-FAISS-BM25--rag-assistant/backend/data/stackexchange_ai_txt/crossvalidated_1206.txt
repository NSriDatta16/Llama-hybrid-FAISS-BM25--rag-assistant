One practical issue that arises here is variable selection in modelling. A variable can be an important explanatory variable (e.g., is statistically significant) but may not be useful for predictive purposes (i.e., its inclusion in the model leads to worse predictive accuracy). I see this mistake almost every day in published papers. Another difference is in the distinction between principal components analysis and factor analysis. PCA is often used in prediction, but is not so useful for explanation. FA involves the additional step of rotation which is done to improve interpretation (and hence explanation). There is a nice post today on Galit Shmueli's blog about this . Update: a third case arises in time series when a variable may be an important explanatory variable but it just isn't available for the future. For example, home loans may be strongly related to GDP but that isn't much use for predicting future home loans unless we also have good predictions of GDP.
