You can also use the HST (mentioned here) How should I transform non-negative data including zeros? If $x$ is p.c. consumption, create a variable $x'=x-\bar{x}$ (i.e. de-mean x). Then use $f(x',\theta=1)$ as your explanatory variable (where $f()$ is the inverse hyperbolic sin transform). for positive values of x' (i.e. people who consume more than the average) $f(x',\theta=1)$ behaves as $\log(x')$. for negative values of $x'$ (i.e. people who consume less than the average) $f(x',\theta=1)$ behaves as $-\log(-x')$. ($f(x',\theta=1)$ looks like a big 'S', passing by the origin).
