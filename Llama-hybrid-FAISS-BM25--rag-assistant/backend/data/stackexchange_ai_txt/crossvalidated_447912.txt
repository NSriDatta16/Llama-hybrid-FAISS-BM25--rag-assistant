Analysing the impact of each CNN layers

I want to analyse the impact of each layer of CNN. I have trained the CNN model with a dataset. After that, weights of first convolutional layer are fixed and remaining layers are initialise to zero to get the exact impact of first layer. Then test the model with same data. is it correct way?
