Alex, I'm not matching your output completely but here is how you can resolve your document by hrefs. This stylesheet: Given this input: 0 Produces the following result: 0 I think that this apporach could be easily customized to fit your needs. I would like to outline that the provided stylesheet operates on @hrefs and does not take in account any element names. Therefore it can be used flexibly without paying attention to the referring element names. However all the reference should be named multiRef s but this can be easily customized too.
