Fastest way to determine whether a string contains a real or integer value

I'm trying to write a function that is able to determine whether a string contains a real or an integer value. This is the simplest solution I could think of: int containsStringAnInt(char* strg){ for (int i =0; i But this solution is really slow when the string is long... Any optimization suggestions? Any help would really be appreciated!
