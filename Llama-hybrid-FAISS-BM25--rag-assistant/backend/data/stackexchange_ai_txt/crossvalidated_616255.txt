Average Log Likelihood of Sum of Discrete Random Variable plus Continuous Uniform Noise

I am looking at the proof given in this paper constituting lines (3) to (6) but am stuck on the first line. The setup is as follows: Consider $X \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with a discrete probability distribution $P(x)$ , uniform noise $U \in [0,1]$ and noisy data $Y=X+U$ with density $p(y)$ . Suppose we model $Y$ with density $q(y)$ . Then we have (first line of proof): $$\int p(y)\text{log} q(y)dy = \sum_{x} P(x) \int_{0}^{1} \text{log} q(x+u)du$$ I am truly stuck with this inequality; I'm sure there is some rule of probability at work here, but I really just don't see what (other authors citing this proof assert that it is "easy" so I'm assuming there is just some rule I'm missing).
