Take action based on fragment ID in jQuery

I have a CSS modal box on my site that is opened by clicking on an anchor which looks like this: Click here to open modal box Once users have clicked that, the modal box opens up, and they find themselves at: http://example.com/#modal-box This, to me, represents a location on my site, so I would like for users to be able to copy and paste that url into another browser, and get the same modal box popped up. Using jquery, is there a way to capture the fragment ID that a user is at, and to then to take an action based on that?
