$\hat{x}$ is drawn from $p(\hat{x} \mid x)$ if it's drawn from a distribution that depends on $x$. Maybe it's mean is a function of $x$, maybe some parameter depends on $x$, maybe both, etc. You could also write $\mathbb{E}_{p(\hat{x}|x)}[\hat{x}] = \mathbb{E}[\hat{x} \mid x]$. That's probably clearer. If you're dealing with continuous random variables, it equals $\int \hat{x} p(\hat{x} \mid x) d\hat{x}$. So it's a function of $x$. If you're dealing with discrete random variables, it equals $\sum_{\hat{x}} \hat{x} p(\hat{x} \mid x)$, which is still a function of $x$. Expectations are just weighted averages, only this time we're using weights that depend on $x$. In the continuous case, the weights are $p(\hat{x} \mid x) d\hat{x}$ where $p(\hat{x} \mid x)$ is a density. And if we're looking at a discrete variable, the weights are $p(\hat{x} \mid x)$, where $p(\hat{x} \mid x)$ is a probability mass function.
