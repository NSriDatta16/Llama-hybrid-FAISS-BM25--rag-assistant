You're making assumptions about the way UIButton works. It's not implemented the same way as UIImageView. UIImageView is just a view, with no subviews, and its contents is the image. UIButton is different, and the way it works is a private implementation detail. If you're trying to stretch an image appropriately on a button, you should use -[UIImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight:] to get a UIImage that knows how it should be stretched. If you want to stretch just the middle pixel, you can use something like UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]; image = [image stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:floorf(image.size.width/2) topCapHeight:floorf(image.size.height/2)];
