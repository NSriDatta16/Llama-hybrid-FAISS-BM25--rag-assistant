To see if an estimator, $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased for $\theta$ you need to calculate the bias: $$b = bias(\theta) = E(\hat{\theta}) - \theta $$ If $b=0$ then the estimator is unbiased. If the bias is not zero then the estimator is biased. The bias assesses how close an estimate of $\theta$ is to $\theta$ on average. If two estimates are unbiased then the one with least variance is preferred, this is because if it has less variance then it should, on average, be closer to $\theta$ . Now the variance of a mean, $\bar{x}$ based on a sample of size $n$ is $$Var(\bar{X}) = Var(X)/n $$ when each $X$ is independent. Therefore, $$Var(\bar{X}_1) =\frac{\sigma^2}{6} \approx 1.67\sigma^2$$ $$Var(\bar{X}_2) =\frac{1.25^2 \sigma^2}{10} \approx 1.56\sigma^2$$ So the second estimator has least variance, thus is preferred.
