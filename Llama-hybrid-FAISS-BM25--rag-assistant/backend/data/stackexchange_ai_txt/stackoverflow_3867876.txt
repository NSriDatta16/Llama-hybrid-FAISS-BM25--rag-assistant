Embedding User + Password data for HTTP Basic Access Authentication in Querystring

We're trying to test an API that requires HTTP Basic Access Authentication credentials (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) in the request. Ideally, we could just test the API using a web browser by putting all API parameters in the URL querystring, but we haven't yet found a way to encode the HTTP Basic Access Authentication credentials (username and password) in the querystring. Does anyone know a way to do this? Thus far, we've tried: https://username:password@mydomain.com/ ...without success.
