XSLT: Transfer text of element to parent element, and remove element

This is my XML: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. An item paragraph. Another item paragraph My XML gets rid of list, changes orderedlist to ol, changes item to li. Now I would like to get rid of the paragraph nodes that are children of item while transferring the text to the new li. Note that I do not want to get rid of the paragraph nodes that are NOT children of item. This is my XSLT so far: The output is this: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. An item paragraph. Another item paragraph Bonus: I would also like to get rid of the blank lines and correct the weird formatting that was caused by eliminating the list node with so if anybody knows a better way to remove a node, I'd love to hear it. Thanks much!
