Mahalanobis distance is the scaled Euclidean distance when the covariance matrix is diagonal. In PCA the covariance matrix between components is diagonal. The scaled Euclidean distance is the Euclidean distance where the variables were scaled by their standard deviations. See p.303 in Encyclopedia of Distances , an very useful book, btw. It seems that you're trying to use Euclidean distance on the subset of factors of PCA. You probably reduced dimensionality using PCA. You can do it, but there will be some error introduced which is "proportional" to the proportion of variance that is explained by your PCA components. You'll also have to adjust the distance for the scale (i.e. variances explained), of course.
