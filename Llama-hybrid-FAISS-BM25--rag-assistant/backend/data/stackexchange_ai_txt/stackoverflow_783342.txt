Dragging handle in Java Swing

I can't seem to figure out how to make a resize drag handle in Java Swing. If you're not sure what I mean, open up the "Ask Question" page on this website and look at the bottom of the text area. It has a bar which you can drag in order to change the size of the area. I'm looking for a way to do this in Java Swing. I don't even know where to look at this point. Any help would be appreciated.
