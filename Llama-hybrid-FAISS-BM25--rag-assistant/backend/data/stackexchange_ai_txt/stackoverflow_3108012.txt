Getting and setting user-agent in uiwebview in iphone?

i am trying to display an image from a url into my UIWebview but the image size is too small to be displayed without making it blurred by stretching it..Since i cannot auto-resize the image(as it gets blurred) i was thinking of getting and setting user-agent value for iphone...But i m not able to find much relevant info about it and i am also not sure if it'll work or not?? anybody having any idea how it can be accomplished??
