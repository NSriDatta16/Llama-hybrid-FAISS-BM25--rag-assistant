If this is a completely balanced within-subject design with $27\times 6=162$ observations, then you can actually calculate the marginal means: simply average over the levels of the second factor. Of course, you have to be sure that averaging over different conditions is meaningful for your planned experiment - do you expect each of those conditions to be present with about 1/3 probability? The real difficulty is with the variance of the difference. It is well known that $$Var(X-Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2 SD(X)SD(Y)Corr(X,Y)$$ The problem is that you don't know the within-subject correlation. Option 1. You could just to guess at a value: would you expect the correlation to be high or low? Since higher correlation will lead to lower variance, you could assume the worst case scenario of 0 correlation, and be guaranteed to overestimate the required sample size (unless the true correlation is negative, but that is rare). Option 2. If the published results have more information, like a p-value from a test, you could try to figure out the correlation. For a complicated design like this one, it might be difficult to do analytically, but you could try a simulation approach. Given a correlation coefficient, simulate data with the given means and variances, run the test and check the p-value. Modify the correlation coefficient until you get close to the published result.
