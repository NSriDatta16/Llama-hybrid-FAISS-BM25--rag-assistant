Is there a statistical model for the problem I want to solve?

I have two time series features, $A$ and $B$ : both returns. When $A$ is at 0 (as it is for the vast majority of the dates), you cannot say anything about $B$ ; it's just noise. However, when $A$ increases, $B$ increases (usually with a day lag) and similarly, when $A$ decreases, $B$ decreases. (I also observed the lag through a Granger Causality test in which the p value is $\approx .001$ ). I'd like to find a way to describe/model this relation effectively. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!
