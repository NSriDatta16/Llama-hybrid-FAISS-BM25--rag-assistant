Plot overlapping time series

I'm trying to plot my test set and test set predictions to check the differences and see how my autoencoder reconstructed the data, but since I have a test set 30x10 I have a huge visualization problem: How can I solve it? This is the code, I'm just showing the first row (X-test[0]), but I have 29 more and I don't how to show all of them properly. fig = plt.figure() plt.plot(X_test[0].T, label='y_true') plt.plot(x_test_pred[0].T, label='yhat_conv') _ = plt.legend() plt.show() plt.close()
