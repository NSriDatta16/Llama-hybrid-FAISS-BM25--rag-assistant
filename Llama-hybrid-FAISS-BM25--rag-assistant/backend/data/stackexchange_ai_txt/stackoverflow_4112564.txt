There is a type of Z-index but there's nothing that can actually manipulate it pragmatically. I've been trying to do similar for over a month. I've tried: Zend, FPDF, AcroJS, PyPDF, ImageMagick and GhostScript with no luck. The only way I've been able to add something "under" something else in a PDF is to rebuild it from the bottom up. Example: I needed to add a photograph under an employee barcode. First I cropped the PDF to the just the barcode (my_crop.py - Python) Then I converted it to tiff copy (imagemagick) Next I added the employee photo to the original PDF (Zend framework) Finally I added the barcode tiff from the first step (Zend framework) It's not in any way perfect but it's the only thing I could get anywhere near what I wanted.
