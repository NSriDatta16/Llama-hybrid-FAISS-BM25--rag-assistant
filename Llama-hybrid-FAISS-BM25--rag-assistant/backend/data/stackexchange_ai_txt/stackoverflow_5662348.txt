You've initialized fs with a space (in a rather complicated way). The following is equal and shows your problem: String fs = " "; String information ="filename (copy).jpg"+fs+"otherInformation"; String[] parts = information.split(fs); The ascii char FS has the number 0x1C , so this should work properly: String fs = "\u001C"; String information ="filename (copy).jpg"+fs+"otherInformation"; String[] parts = information.split(fs); Background information The file separator FS is an interesting control code, as it gives us insight in the way that computer technology was organized in the sixties. We are now used to random access media like RAM and magnetic disks, but when the ASCII standard was defined, most data was serial. I am not only talking about serial communications, but also about serial storage like punch cards, paper tape and magnetic tapes. In such a situation it is clearly efficient to have a single control code to signal the separation of two files. The FS was defined for this purpose. (source) The FS was invented to separate real files and not filenames in a hierarchical file directory. Technically, yes, you can use it, but it has a different meaning.
