What you describe here is a typical case for a "Master Data Management" system. EAI vendors (Oracle, TIBCO, IBM) offer such products. They resemble your first solution, being centralised databases with synchronization processes, detecting changes in external data sources, grabbing the changes and synchronizing data out to other external databases. They also provide a user interface to change master data directly. MDM software are expensive, but you can implement a custom solution which will be - at least initially - cheaper than purchasing one. Both of your solutions make technical sense but there is a difference in their manageability. The first one is better, if you can dedicate a responsible person/organization to take care of it and the business owners of your services can agree on making changes via this new centralised system. The second solution shares the responsibility between the service owners. The hard task here is to identify the owner of each type of information (business object). I cannot advise a solution without a deeper knowledge of your systems and organizations, but I hope I could give some ideas.
