You would have to predict the values for future observations outside of ggplot2 and then plot the predicted values, you could also get a confidence interval for these predictions. Look at the loess function, although I'm not sure if it does predictions outside your data range, I'm sure some smooth function does however. However it is usually not wise to predict values outside your data range. I would not put much trust in these predictions. You may want to investigate predicting values using a time series model.
