This may seem like a silly question, but figured I'd double-check before proceeding to alternatives or other optimizations, but is there an index (or hopefully a primary key) on the Batch Id column in your Batch table. Without indexes those kinds of searches will be painfully slow. For fast object retrieval, a key/value store is definitely a viable alternative. I'm not sure I would necessarily recommend redis in this situation since your Batches database may be a little too large to fit into memory, and although it also stores to a disk it's generally better when suited with a dataset that strictly fits into memory. My personal favourite would be mongodb - but overall the best thing to do would be to take your batches data, load it into a couple of different nosql dbs and see what kind of read performance you're getting and pick the one that suits the data best. Mongo's quite fast and easy to work with - and you could probably ditch the nhibernate layer for such a simple data structure. There is a daemon that needs to run locally, but depending on the size of the db it will be single file (or a few files if it has to allocate more space). Again, ensure there is an index on your batch id column to ensure quick lookups.
