How do I generate Emma code coverage reports from Hudson?

I am trying to generate Emma Code Coverage Report from Hudson. I have added "Record Emma coverage report" plugin in Hudson This plug-in needs a path where generated emma xml report will be placed. I have added that path "/opt/dfte/hudson" but it is saying that Recording Emma reports /opt/dfte/hudson/emma.xml Finished: FAILURE Did I missed any steps?? Please help me. Thanks
