I probably would have found this to be a bigger problem if hadn't had CTRL-SHIFT-V as a shortcut to the VAR section. I'm not writing GIGANTIC methods here, but sometimes they get a little out of hand (and I can justify this of course) and it helps a lot. I'm not sure if that shortcut comes from cnTools or GExperts, but they're both pretty useful and I'd recommend them both.
