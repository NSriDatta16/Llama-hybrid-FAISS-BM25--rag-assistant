How to best implement an OGC best practice

I'm having some difficulty wrapping my head around building an OGC compliant Earth Observation ordering service. I'm not asking for a step by step process but rather hope to spawn a high level discussion about what might be the best way to approach this task. There is this best practice document on what i would like to accomplish: Order Services for Earth Observation Products OGC 06-141r2 However, i'm not sure whether i should get the schema(xsd) files that are at the bottom of the PDF and generate stubs from them, or leverage geoNetwork in some way. I have no idea where to start. Has anyone any experience implementing any OGC standards, best practices or something similar? Where do i start?
