Bayesian replication, but with new variables

Suppose I have data I've collected containing predictor variables $X_1, X_2$ , and $X_3$ . I build a main effects statistical model predicting $Y$ from these predictors and estimate the relevant coefficients ( $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$ ). Now let's suppose I want to collect more data and build the same statistical model, with the addition of two new variables (e.g., $X_4$ and $X_5$ ). Easy. But, let's suppose I want to do a Bayesian analysis this time, using my estimates from the original model as priors. That sounds reasonable, and mayhap I could put informative priors on $b_0-b_3$ , then use uninformative priors on $b_4/b_5$ . But we have a problem. The estimates of $b_0, \ldots, b_3$ were built from a model that did not have $X_4$ and $X_5$ . Since I expect these new variables will be at least somewhat correlated with $X_1, \ldots, X_3$ , there's no reason to suspect my original estimates will be the same. But, I really want to use Bayesian methods with informative priors. It seems a waste to not use the prior information I've gleaned. So, here's my question: can I use informative priors from a past model on a new model, when the new model contains new predictors? If so, how? My initial thoughts: I know the new estimates of $b_0, \ldots, b_3$ will be a function of the old values and the covariance between the old and new predictors. I'm thinking I could just do a somewhat informative prior on the covariances between $(X_1, \ldots, X_3) \& (X_4, X_5)$ and use the old values of $b_0, \ldots, b_3$ with the appropriate covariances to get a more informative prior. This might make sense and work well, assuming there are no interactions between the new/old predictors. But, there may be interactions. If so, it seems to me (initially) there's not much I can do to make those priors informative.
