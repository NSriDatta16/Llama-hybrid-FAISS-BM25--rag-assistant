How to get model equation/coefficients for SVM in Orange

I have dataset and want to train an SVM model, I have done so in Orange, and the model behaves good, I used the File -> SVM -> 'test and score' widgets, now I want to take that linear model and implement it in C code, from literature, I know the hyperplane can be represented mathematically and then you can use the equation to classify depending on the result sign, where can I find that equation/coefficients in Orange?
