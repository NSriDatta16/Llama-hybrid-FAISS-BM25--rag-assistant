Simple solution: create separate table, de-normalized, with all fields in it. Create stored procedure, that will update this table on your schedule. Create SQl Agent job to call the SP. Index the table as you see how it's queried. If you need to purge history, create another table to hold it and another SP to populate it and clean main report table. You may end up with multiple report tables - it's OK - space is cheap these days.
