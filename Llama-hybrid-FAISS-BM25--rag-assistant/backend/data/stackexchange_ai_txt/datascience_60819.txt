Why don't we use space filling curves for high-dimensional nearest neighbor search?

Some space filling curves like the Hilbert Curve are able to map an n-dimensional space to a one dimensional line whilst preserving locality. Does that mean that we could map a dataset of high dimensional points to a line and expect the order of the nearest neighbors to be preserved? If so, wouldn't that be more efficient than building a Ball tree?
