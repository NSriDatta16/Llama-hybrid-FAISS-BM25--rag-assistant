UIGestureRecognizer - detecting tap and drag like trackpad

Is there any way to cascade UIGestureRecognizers to detect a tap and then drag. For example, I want to detect when the user taps and then drags his finger around. This would be similar how drag works on trackpads. So I want to detect a tap, then I want to get UIPanGestureRecognizer to send me continuous updates. I want to use standard UIGesture classes to create this new gesture instead of creating my own using raw touches. Is this even possible?
