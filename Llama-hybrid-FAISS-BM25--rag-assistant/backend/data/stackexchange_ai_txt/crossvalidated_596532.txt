Impact of power cuts on electricity consumption

I am trying to work out which types of property are most affected by rolling blackouts (ie. South Africa has Load Shedding where our power utility shuts down power when demand exceeds supply). I have collated the load shedding information into MegaWatts shed per month: Year Month MegaWatts 201502 28400.0 201503 9900.0 201504 70900.0 201505 57700.0 201506 15400.0 201507 14400.0 ...... ...... 202207 1216200.0 202208 22200.0 202209 1983600.0 202210 1417000.0 202211 26000.0 This is a sample of the information available for electricity consumption. Year Month Property Type Total Consumption No. Properties 201807 Agricultural 112217.50 46 201807 Business 3281828.70 1155 201807 Government 117490.40 56 201807 Industry 1431048.20 194 201807 Municipal 1084101.90 1381 201807 Residential 5355781.20 13145 201808 Agricultural 111931.40 46 202104 Industry 507556.60 129 202104 Municipal 600801.50 608 202104 Residential 3174809.10 7871 202105 Agricultural 28465.00 17 202105 Business 1286016.80 850 202105 Government 87199.40 37 202105 Industry 409162.00 132 When I produce a graph of Average Monthly Consumption (all property types) and MegaWatts of load shedding, I get the following: I am trying a Paired t-test for consecutive months but am worried about natural fluctuations in electricity consumption due to seasonality. I have looked into Interrupted Time Series analysis but am not at all familiar with this methodology. Any advice on a good approach for this?
