Built-in method for finding a specific instance of an object in PHP?

I really am clueless when it comes to object-oriented programmings, so forgive me if this is obvious... I am using a Zend extension which returns a request as a nested object. I need property a based on if the object has property b . Right now I am using a foreach loop with a conditional to search for property b and, if I get a match, set my variable to property a . Something like: foreach($nested_object as $object) { if($object -> foo -> bar == "match") { $info = $object -> stuff -> junk; } } I was hoping there was a more elegant way to do this, along the lines of XPath (but certainly it doesn't have to be remotely close to XPath, just something as simple). So if I know the property I need, is there a way in PHP to retrieve any and all objects with that property?
