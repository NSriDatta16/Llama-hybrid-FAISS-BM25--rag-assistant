Does matlab neural network toolbox use early-stopping by default?

I have trained a neural network in matlab using the toolbox (code below), but I no longer have a maltab license; does anyone know if the validation in this toolbox by default is only to assess the performance of the neural network, or if it is used for early-stopping (when the error starts enhancing instead of diminishing, stop training)? I think I remember seeing something related to this when training the ANN (number of epochs after which the training was stopped by the validation), but like I said I no longer have matlab and I can't find anything about it online... Thanks in advance! % Create a Pattern Recognition Network hiddenLayerSize = 15; net = patternnet(hiddenLayerSize, trainFcn); % Choose Input and Output Pre/Post-Processing Functions % For a list of all processing functions type: help nnprocess net.input.processFcns = {'removeconstantrows','mapminmax'}; % Setup Division of Data for Training, Validation, Testing % For a list of all data division functions type: help nndivision net.divideFcn = 'dividerand'; % Divide data randomly net.divideMode = 'sample'; % Divide up every sample net.divideParam.trainRatio = 65/100; net.divideParam.valRatio = 20/100; net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100; % Choose a Performance Function % For a list of all performance functions type: help nnperformance net.performFcn = 'crossentropy'; % Cross-Entropy % Choose Plot Functions % For a list of all plot functions type: help nnplot net.plotFcns = {'plotperform','plottrainstate','ploterrhist', ...
