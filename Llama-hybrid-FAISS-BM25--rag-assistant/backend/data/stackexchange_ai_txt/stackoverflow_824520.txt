Avoid being more specific than you need to. You might be tempted to think of your storage object as a HashMap: HashMap myStore = new HashMap(); But I would recommend thinking of it only as a Map (interface): Map myStore = new Hashtable(); The rest of your code does not need to know how we implemented myStore, it just needs to know that myStore is some kind of Map. This way we can change the implementing type later (HashMap,Hashtable,...), and only one line of code will be affected. And I chose Hashtable as an example, over HashMap, because Hashtable is thread-safe. In a multi-threaded app, this avoids the problem that two threads reading and changing the same HashMap concurrently can start throwing Exceptions.
