I'd suggest a new book that came out since the original question: Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan by Richard McElreath, CRC Press. It's very well written and uses a Bayesian approach. It's very interactive, and you'll want to work the problems or you may get halfway through and begin to get lost. It starts very basic and ends up with multi-level models, and it's aimed at fairly advanced scientists who have some statistical knowledge but don't feel comfortable overall with statistics as it was taught to them. So I can't exactly say it's a beginner's book, but it does start very simply and he has a wonderful arc and style. The "Stan" part of the title is a general-purpose Bayesian sampling tool. Essentially, it's a programming language that compiles automatically to C++ and then gets compiled to an executable. (Bayesian inference is general, unlike alternatives, so you can have a generalized tool.)
