What happens if I choose a bad prior for Bayesian AB testing?

I'm trying to go through this article http://developers.lyst.com/data/2014/05/10/bayesian-ab-testing/ and I see that they choose a Beta(3, 50) prior and make an argument for that. However, if you use their calculator and choose a Beta(1, 1) prior, the results don't seem too different. In fact I've been playing around with both small and large sample sizes, and a Beta(1, 1) prior often times generates a higher probability that A > B. What are some downfalls of using the wrong prior. Does our probability estimate mean less?
