A while back we were working on implementing local storage in the webview of an iPhone app, and what we found is that it does not work. Although local storage will work on the iPhones regular browser. We ended up doing what we needed natively within the app itself. Looks like these guys came to the same conclusion: How do I enable Local Storage in my WebKit-based application? Caveat lecture: When we were trying this solution it was before iPhone 4 was released.
