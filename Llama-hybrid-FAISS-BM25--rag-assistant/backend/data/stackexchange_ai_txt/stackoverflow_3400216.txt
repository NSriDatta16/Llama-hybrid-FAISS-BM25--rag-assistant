Array of NSStrings from filenames within a folder?

I'm trying to create an array of NSStrings of the contents of a folder that I've dragged into my project... but when I count the items in the array afterwards, it's always comes back with 0; So, my folder in my project looks like this -Cards -Colors Blue.png Green.png Orange.png Yellow.png Purple.png Black.png And my code which tries to get this list of files (the color pngs) is NSError *error = nil; NSString *pathString = [[NSString alloc] init]; pathString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"/Cards/Colors/"]; NSArray *fileList = [[NSArray alloc] init]; fileList = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] contentsOfDirectoryAtPath:pathString error: &error]; [pathString release]; NSLog(@"%@", error); // this is always 0 NSLog(@"file list has %i items", [fileList count]); The NSError I get is Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=260 "The operation couldn’t be completed. (Cocoa error 260.)" UserInfo=0x596db00 {NSUserStringVariant=( Folder ), NSFilePath=/Cards/Color/, NSUnderlyingError=0x5925ef0 "The operation couldn’t be completed. No such file or directory"} Any ideads where I am going wrong?
