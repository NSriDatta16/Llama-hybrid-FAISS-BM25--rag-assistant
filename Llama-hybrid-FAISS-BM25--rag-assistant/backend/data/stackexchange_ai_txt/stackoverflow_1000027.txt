You can't calculate the gradient of a "kink" (as you so eloquently put it). If you really need a gradient at such a point (x), I'd just average the gradient at (x-d) and (x+d) where d is a small enough delta. It's as mathematically valid as any other single answer you're likely to get. For example, the function: f(x) = |x| will produce: \ | / \ | / \ | / \|/ ----+---- where there is no gradient at the origin (0,0). However, averaging the gradients at -0.0001 (gradient = -1) and +0.0001 (gradient = +1) will give you a gradient of zero (flat line). This should give a half-decent answer for other equations that produce non-symmetrical gradients at (x-d) and (x+d) as well. What I would do, since it's licensed under MIT, is to modify the source to allow an option for the Bezierspline to use that +/- delta method to calculate gradients at the non-continuous points. Maybe even push back the source changes to the developers if you think it's a worthwhile addition.
