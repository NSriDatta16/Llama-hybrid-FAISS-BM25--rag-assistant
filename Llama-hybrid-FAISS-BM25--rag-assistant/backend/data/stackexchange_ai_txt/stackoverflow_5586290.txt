You are confusing files with classes. You can create folders in Visual Studio to organize your files. That way you can group interfaces and classes (which is what I usually do). VS will automatically put new classes for which the file is in those folders in the namespace of the same name. This is usually not what you want (I don't know how to turn it off, so I can't help you with that). I agree with the other answers here that you should group types based on what they do, not on what kind of language construct they are.
