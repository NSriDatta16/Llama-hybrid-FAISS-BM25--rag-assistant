ML Algorithm for Parking floor traffic congestion

I'm trying to create an ML Algorithm to predict traffic congestion at a particular floor at a particular time. I'm New to Machine learning. Currently in learning mode. Trying to start with some classification algorithm later to time series. Generated one data-set. Which contains 4 floors. I'm little bit confused on searching internet for reference. Anyone have some idea where i need to start. Its great if i get some similar reference too. Data-set looks like following 'Floor Number' 'Slot Number' Date 'Sensor Data' 3 95 1-jan-2000 1:5:39 1 Where sensor data indicate whether the vehicle is parked ( 1 ) or left ( 0 )
