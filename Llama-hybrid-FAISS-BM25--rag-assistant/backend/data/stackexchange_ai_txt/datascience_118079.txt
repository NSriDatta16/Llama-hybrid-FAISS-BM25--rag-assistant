RNN is a general term for Neural network architecture having recurrent connections. This architecture is built from a single entity called "cell". These so called cells are used repeatedly and connected in recursive fashion. LSTM is one of these type of cells. If you build a RNN using LSTM cells, it becomes LSTM RNN. So basically as long as you use LSTM as a basic entity for building a RNN, it will be called LSTM RNN.
