You can simply mark a piece of HTML/CSS code and drag it into the toolbox. Then rename the snippet in the toolbox and give it a name so you can easily remember what it is. Then just drag&drop it from the toolbox onto another page to insert the snippet. (Maybe first create a separate group in the toolbox for your snippets).
