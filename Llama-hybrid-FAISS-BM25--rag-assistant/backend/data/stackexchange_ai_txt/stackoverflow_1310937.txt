The obvious question is why you want to ask the user what browser they are using? But given that: a) Normalise the user string: lower-case, remove spaces, remove numbers? b) Build a map between the normalised strings, and user-agent strings. When you do a lookup, if the normalised string, or the user-agent string is not in the map, pass it to a human to add to the map with appropriate mapping. Possibly you'll want to normalise the user-agent in some way as well?
