For what you described, I cannot see any direct relationship with MCMC. What you needed is just a forward sampling. Here is how it works (suppose we have discrete binary random variables): Step 1. get a sample for $X_1$ . In order to do this step, we need to have the distribution $P(X_1)$ . (Something like $$ P(X_1)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0.2, ~~~~~~ X_1=0\\ 0.8, ~~~~~~ X_1=1\\ \end{array} \right. $$ , and for these numbers you may guess it is very likely to get a $1$ as a sample in this first step). Step 2. get sample for $X_2$ . Based on $P(X_2|X_1)$ . We need to have the conditional probability table to do this step. (Something like $$ P(X_2|X_1)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0.2, ~~~~~~ X_1=0, X_2=0\\ 0.8, ~~~~~~ X_1=0, X_2=1\\ 0, ~~~~~~~~ X_1=1, X_2=0\\ 1, ~~~~~~~~ X_1=1, X_2=1 \end{array} \right. $$ From this example, you will get the a sample of $X_2$ to be 1.). Step 3. get sample for $X_3$ . We need to have $P(X_3|X_1,X_2)$ . I will ignore the example of the conditional table here (the table will have $2 \times 2 \times 2$ rows).
