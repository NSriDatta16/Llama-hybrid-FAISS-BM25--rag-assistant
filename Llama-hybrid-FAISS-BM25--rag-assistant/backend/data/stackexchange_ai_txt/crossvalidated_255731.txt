Average path length between two nodes in cyclic directed graph?

I want to calculate the average path length between any two nodes in a directed graph that contains cycles. The reason this is not trivial is because there is an infinitive number of paths between most nodes due to the cycles, even though longer paths become increasingly unlikely. One "empirical" solution is to run a long random walk and count the average number of steps that occurred between two states. My question : is there an analytical solution that integrates over the possible paths and their likelihood, or a good approximation?
