Ideas for model to predict wind speed in a local kitesurfing spot

We have a sensor in a local kite spot that captures real time wind speed, we've found that we can somewhat predict if there's going to be "good" wind by looking at different forecast models and weather conditions. I think it should be easy to train a model that takes input from different forecast models as well as real time data to predict with higher accuracy the speed in the spot. Do you think this would be too crazy? if not how would you suggest I approach building this, having no experience with machine learning at all
