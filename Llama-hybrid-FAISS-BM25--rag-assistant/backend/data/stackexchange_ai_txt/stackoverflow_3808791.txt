Not sure if this is homework, and just in case it is I'm trying to avoid spoiling it by "telling to much", and instead point you to the key ideas you could use. To avoid reading the whole file, you could use first use the seekg method to position the file a certain number of bytes from the end, then perform the "read to the last word" from there. To perform the "read to the last word" task proper (net of the optimization of not reading the whole file one word at a time, for which see first paragraph) use the >> operator with the std::ifstream as the left operand and a std::string as the right operand: just put this in a while(!thestream.eof()) { ... } so it will keep reading until it has the last word. BTW, note that reading the text from a .doc file will be orders of magnitude harder than reading it from a text file, unless you can use a suitable ".doc-reading library" (the standard C++ library has no such functionality, per se).
