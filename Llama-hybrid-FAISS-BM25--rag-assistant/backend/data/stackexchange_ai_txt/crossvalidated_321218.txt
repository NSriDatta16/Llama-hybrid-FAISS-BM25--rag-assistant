Interesting.. Hard to answer the question directly. Two things I would try to diagnose would be: 1) How do logistic regression and random forest fare? 2) By "fare", I suggest you look at the calibrations of the classifiers . What do the bins look like? Binarized posterior class probabilities will not be very helpful.
