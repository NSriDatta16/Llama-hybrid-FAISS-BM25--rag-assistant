OSGi Logging with spring-DM extender not logging

My Setup : I am able to create a simple OSGi bundle with Log4J as my logging framework and when deployed to my OSGi container (Equinox) it works great my logging is configured very simply with a seperate bundle fragment that configures my logging. This setup does not have spring involved and it works really nicely. My Issue : I am converting over a spring application which uses log4j as its logging framework to OSGi, the first stage was creating various bundles for my spring application which I have now completed. The problem I have is that the OSGi logging fragment bundle that worked with the non spring applications does not configure my spring enabled bundles. I know the bundles are active as system.out.println does work however all my logging configuration is not working. I can see nothing in the console I do see a lot of spring output confirming my bundles services are exposed but no logging. Any suggestions appreciated.
