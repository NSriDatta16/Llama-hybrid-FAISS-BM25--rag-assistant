django form variable

I have spent too much time on this problem and am beginning to think that it can't be done in Django. I am pulling a list of pathogen names from a postgres database to a drop down box. The user selects the pathogen, which requires the id to be passed back through django to the database for further retrieval of more data. Please see http://dpaste.com/119358/ for the drop down code. The problem is that the select id = statement is above the point where the form retrieves the pathology id. The django statements must be placed at this point or the drop down doesn't work. Has anyone written something similar and found a solution? Max
