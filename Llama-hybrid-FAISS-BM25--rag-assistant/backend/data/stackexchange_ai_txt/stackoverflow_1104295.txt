jQuery - use canvas to draw lines between divs

I have n >s, each with > title and > list of items in. I would like to float these over a canvas and draw lines from > list item y to >. I am using jQuery UI to make the >s draggable. The canvas element is part way down the page (a paragraph of text and some form elements precede it) but I can change this if necessary. [edit] I tagged the question with graph, but let me add this link: Graph_(mathematics) :-)
