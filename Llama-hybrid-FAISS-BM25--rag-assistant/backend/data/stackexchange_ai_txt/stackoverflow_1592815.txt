same answer as here: How to detect and estimate heap fragmentation in my C++ program? write your own memory manager adapted to your memory allocation patterns. Or buy one (for example smart-heap). Since the fragmentation depends on your memory allocation patterns / freeing patterns, a better answer is difficult to give. But you could take a look into fixed size allocators or take a look at the smart heap page how they handle allocation. There are also a lot of papers on this topic. Try for example www.memorymanagement.org Or you could take a look at FastMM4 - which is open source, but in Pascal/Delphi There are some programming techniques as well. Most notably: the Object Pool . In this case, there is no fragmentation, as the objects are re-used and not freed. But I think a fixed size allocator performs better than the Object Pool. The Object Pool used this way is only a "poor mans" fixed size allocator.
