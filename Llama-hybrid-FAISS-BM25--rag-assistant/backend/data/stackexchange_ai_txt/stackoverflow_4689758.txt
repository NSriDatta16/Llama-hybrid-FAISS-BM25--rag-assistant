Yes, it should be in the base page. In my opinion, the Master Page exists for design purposes only and is purely visual layout. Some of that layout, of course, might depend on permissions but it makes no decisions itself, that is entirely up to the base-page classes. This has the added advantage of using different Master pages without losing the functionality in your page classes. Which is nice. AFAIK, you have to change the base class of your 'code-behind' page-class manually. To detect issues where developers are not deriving from the appropriate class: Tell them to pay attention ( :P ) Write some code using reflection that examines the pages in your assembly and throws out some kind of warning text if it is not derived from the right class. Bonus points if the developers' name can be included in this output. With regards to ensuring a method is called, you could set some kind of flag that is set only in that method and throw an exception further down the rendering chain if it has not been set. Better yet, make sure it gets called regardless of what the developer has decided to do.
