Features extracted from image/signal processing tend to get correlated a lot! This is not a very bad thing if you have enough samples. From my experience, a classifier with small variance tend to work well (ex. logistic regression). They have less chances of overfitting the train data. Another idea that I employed is the Additive logistic regression here and here some references. They are already implemented in Weka. They are slower than the logistic models. In the same time they have the great advantage that they perform a feature selection while learning. Moreover, the model is human friendly so you can see what features are more relevant. Hope it helps
