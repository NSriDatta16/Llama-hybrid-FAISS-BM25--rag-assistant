Testing whether we should build a model on the union of data sets

Suppose I have 4 massive data sets representing specific products all belonging to the same "product class". A priori we expect that these will all behave similarly and that a grouping will make sense. Our task is to predict a binary response associated to each observation in a product. The current implementation is to fit a logistic regression to each product separately. For various reasons we would prefer to merge the data and fit one model to it, unless the data suggests strongly that this is not appropriate. Is there a well-defined procedure or statistical test to judge whether fitting one model to the combined data is a good or bad idea? I can see that this question is tricky in general, and will depend on subject knowledge. However, if we assume that all subject knowledge indicates that these datasets should behave in highly similar ways, a priori, how can we test this?
