Infobright is just MySQL with a custom engine that implements a column based database with high compression. Go into C:\Program Files\Infobright\bin, and type: mysqld --console This starts Infobright in standalone console mode (rather than in service mode). The command line parameter "--console" pipes any errors to the console (rather than swallowing the errors to a file hidden somewhere on the hard drive). You will receive something similar to the following: C:\Program Files\Infobright\bin>mysqld --console Loading configuration for Infobright instance ... Option: AllowMySQLQueryPath, value: 1. Option: AutoConfigure, value: 0. Option: CacheFolder, value: C:\Program Files\Infobright\cache. Option: ControlMessages, value: 0. Option: InternalMessages, value: 0. Option: KNFolder, value: BH_RSI_Repository. Option: KNLevel, value: 99. Option: LicenseFile, value: . Option: LoaderMainHeapSize, value: 400. Option: PushDown, value: 1. Option: ServerMainHeapSize, value: 1300. Option: UseMySQLImportExportDefaults, value: 0.

For the 64-bit version of Infobright, copy the .lic file to: C:\Program Files\InfoBright For the 32-bit version of Infobright, copy the .lic file to: C:\Program Files (x86)\InfoBright and you will get something like the following: C:\Program Files\Infobright\bin>mysqld --console Loading configuration for Infobright instance ...
