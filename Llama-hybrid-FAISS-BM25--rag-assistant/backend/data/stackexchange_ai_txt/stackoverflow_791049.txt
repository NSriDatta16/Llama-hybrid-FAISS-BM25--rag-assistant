Unable to access SAN storage device

I am attempting to programmatically FTP a backup file that is stored on a SAN device. The device has been mapped on the server. I tested the application by running it from an icon on the desktop and it works perfectly. When I run the program through a windows service I get an error message saying that the drive cannot be found. The account that the service was running under was the local account. I thought the issue might be that account so I created a new user and ran the service under that account. The same error message occurs. Has anyone experienced this before and found a resolution to this problem?
