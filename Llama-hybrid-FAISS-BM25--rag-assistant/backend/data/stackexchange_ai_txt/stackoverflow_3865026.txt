Is there a LINQ query that will give me the sum of several maximum values?

I've got a table of transaction data for several locations and I need to find the sum of each location's maximum from a subset of locations. So imagine the following table: location year transactions 123 2009 57 124 2009 23 125 2009 45 123 2010 64 124 2010 12 125 2010 66 So if I'm looking just for the data for locations 123 and 124 the code should pick out the value 64 for location 123 in 2010 and 23 for location 124 in 2009. I've got the following code which works in that it finds the maximum value for each location and then adds it to the running total. int total = 0; foreach (var location in locationIds) { int? temp = transactions.Where(t => t.Location == location) .Max(t => t.Transactions); if (temp.HasValue) { total += temp.Value; } } Is there a more elegant way of coding this?
