Too many columns design question

I have a design question. I have to store approx 100 different attributes in a table which should be searchable also. So each attribute will be stored in its own column. The value of each attribute will always be less than 200, so I decided to use TINYINT as data type for each attribute. Is it a good idea to create a table which will have approx 100 columns (Each of TINYINT)? What could be wrong in this design? Or should I classify the attributes into some groups (Say 4 groups) and store them in 4 different tables (Each approx have 25 columns) Or any other data storage technique I have to follow. Just for example the table is Table1 and it has columns Column1,Column2 ... Column100 of each TINYINT data type. Since size of each row is going to be very small, Is it OK to do what I explained above? I just want to know the advantages/disadvantages of it. If u think that it is not a good idea to have a table with 100 columns, then please suggest other alternatives. Please note that I don;t want to store the information in composite form (e.g. few xml columns) Thanks in advance
