How can I find out why my drag action momentarily freezes in Perl/Tk?

I'm seeing some occasional (one time in five), momentary (5-10 seconds) "freezing" when it dragsâ€”possibly as part of the -startcommand callback. It never happens on the first drag. The callback is simple enough; it just sets the text of the dragging cursor to the value that is being dragged: sub DragStart { my( $token ) = @_; my $w = $token->parent; my $e = $w->XEvent; my $idx = $w->nearest( $e->y ); if( defined $idx ) { $token->configure( -text -> $w->get( $idx ); my( $X, $Y ) = ( $e->x, $e->y ); $token->MoveToplevelWindow( $X, $Y ); $token->raise; $token->deiconify; $token->FindSite( $X, $Y, $e ); } } I can't help but wonder if the problem is outside of my code, so what I'd like to do is find a way to identify which subroutine is currently called when the freezing happens. Is there such a tool? Something that shows a real-time call stack would do it, if there is one.
