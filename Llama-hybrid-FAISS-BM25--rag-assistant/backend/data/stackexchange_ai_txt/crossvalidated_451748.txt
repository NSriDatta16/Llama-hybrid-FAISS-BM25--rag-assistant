How to download data from SNB in R

I'd like to download data from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) n R. For instance, let's take data about "Foreign trade by goods category" https://data.snb.ch/en/topics/aube#!/cube/ausshawarm In R, a simple function to get .csv data is csv_df / .csv') but I don't know how to get SNB data. I click on the CSV(all) on the bottom right, cf. screenshot of what it looks like atm: When I download this file (or any other) from SNB and copy the download link, for the instance above, the link copied into the above function would look like this snb and R can't deal with that, as it doesn't recognize it as a delimited file. I understand there's some JSON magic happening on the server side, but I don't know what to do with and how to work around it. I didn't find other useful tags, so if you read this and would like to suggest one, I encourage you to break your silence and let the class benefit from your knowledge. I added the econometrics tag, because I guess people in econometrics might have dealt with SNB data and know how to access it.
