I've always used a global boolean variable like bUserPressedCancel, along with DoEvents within a loop. Elegant, smelegant, it works. I agree with Mr Shiny that testing against the value of a caption is not a great idea. If you change the text on the button in the designer, you'll break the code. Better not to rely on the wording of the text for your code to work.
