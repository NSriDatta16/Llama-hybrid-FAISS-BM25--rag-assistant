Prior to the revival of deep learning in the last few years, hyperparameter tuning used to be called model selection. The purpose of the validation set is to choose among several model candidates. It shouldn't make a difference whether these models have the same architecture with different hyperparameters or are completely different architectures. So no, you shouldn't need a second validation set.
