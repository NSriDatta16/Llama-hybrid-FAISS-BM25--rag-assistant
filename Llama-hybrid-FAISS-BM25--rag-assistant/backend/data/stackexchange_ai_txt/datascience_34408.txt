Machine Learning & Image Recognition: How to start?

I've been a full stack web developer for 15 years now and would like to be involved in machine learning. There is already a specific scenario for this: We have a database with several million products and one product image each. There is also a database with about 5000 terms. A product image is linked to several terms (usually 3 - 20), whereby the link still has a weighting (1-100%). The terms are always of a visual nature, that is, they describe a visually recognizable feature on the image. The aim should now be to upload a new image (of course with thematic reference) and to get an answer with possible terms (including probability) based on the already classified images. Do you have any advice on how best to start here? Is there a framework that comes close to this scenario? Is TensorFlow relevant for this task? What new language should I learn? Thank you very much!
