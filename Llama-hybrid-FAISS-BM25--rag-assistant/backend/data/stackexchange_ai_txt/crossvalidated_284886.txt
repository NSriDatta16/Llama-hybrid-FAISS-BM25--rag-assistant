The following method will only work if the mean of $X$ is not 0. You have have $X \approx N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. Then by the central limit theorem, for the sample average $Y = \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i/N$, $$ \sqrt{N} (Y - \mu) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \sigma^2)\,.$$ However, you are interested in $Z = |Y|$. Define a function $g(x) = |x|$. Then $g$ is continuous everywhere and differentiable everywhere except 0. If $\mu \ne 0$, then the Delta Method applies. That is $$\sqrt{N} (g(Y) - g(\mu)) \overset{d}{\to} N(0, \sigma^2 g'(\mu)^2)\, $$ where $$g'(\mu)^2 = \left(\dfrac{dg(x)}{dx} \Big|_{x = \mu} \right)^2 = \left(\dfrac{\mu}{|\mu|} \right)^2 = 1\,.$$ So we have, $$\sqrt{N} (Z - |\mu|) \overset{d}{\to} N\left(0, \sigma^2 \right)\,.$$ So if $\mu \ne 0$, confidence interval for $|\mu|$ can be created using the above distribution.
