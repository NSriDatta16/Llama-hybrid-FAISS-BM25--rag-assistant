What is the feature of https that you are hoping to leverage? The signing/server authentication is done by code signing, though you are undermining this using a self-signed certificate. Does your application code contain secrets that must be hidden from eavesdroppers? As you say you "need to enable" there must be an underlying reason. I believe that before you "need https" you need a proper code signing certificate. You might want to rephrase your question so that your underlying problem can be solved instead of the very specific question.
