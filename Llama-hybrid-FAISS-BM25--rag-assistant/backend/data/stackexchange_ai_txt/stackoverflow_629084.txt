You can copy the private key in this way, but it's really UNSAFE: Give him your login.keychain file (located in ~/Library/Keychains/), and let him open it with Keychain.app, and ask him to drag your private key to his login.keychain. Apple also said you should keep your private key secured, if you need to reinstall your system, make sure you backup the login.keychain file.
