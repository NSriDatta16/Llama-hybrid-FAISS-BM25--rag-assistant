Methods for breaking up content client-side into multiple "pages"

I have a long HTML text-only article formatted with paragraph tags. What I'd like to do is break this content into N number of divs so that I can create individual pages. So, for instance, on an iPad/iPhone, instead of reading one long page the user could swipe right/left to navigate to pages. My initial javascript attempts have been somewhat convoluted: creating an array of the text, measuring line-heights, device window heights, adding closing/opening paragraph tags and the end/beginning of pages. Thoughts on a good way to approach this? I will not have access to server-side processing, this has to be a client-side solution.
