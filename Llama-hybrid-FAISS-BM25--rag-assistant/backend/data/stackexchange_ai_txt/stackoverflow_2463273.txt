What is wrong with this mail header text?

The following $header is being sent via PHP's mail($to,$subject,$content,$header) command. The mail arrives and appears to have an attachment. But the mail text is empty as is the file. I think this has something to do with line spacing but I can't see the problem. I have tried putting the contents (between the boundaries) in $contents rather than appending it to $header . It doesn't make a difference. Any thoughts?
