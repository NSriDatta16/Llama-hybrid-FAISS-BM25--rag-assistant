Ajax redirect based on the fragment?

consider I have an array with some urls: $array[0]='mywebsite/pagea'; $array[1]='mywebsite/pageb'; $array[2]='mywebsite/pagec'; //> please note this is the PHP array, but I can output as a javascript array without problems I will output them in my link.php Is there a way with jQuery to read that fragment (idX) and then redirect to the corrispondent url? Edit Thinking about compatibily (browsers without javascript) now let's consdier I have this kind of link: pagea pageb pagec For browser without javascript the link will work as normal, for every else i will do like $('.intercept').onClick( function (){ //> append the hashtag to the current url //> make the right redirect after some interval (ie this.href) //> how? xD }); At this point i have only to check if the url was opened with an hashtag and make the right redirect.
