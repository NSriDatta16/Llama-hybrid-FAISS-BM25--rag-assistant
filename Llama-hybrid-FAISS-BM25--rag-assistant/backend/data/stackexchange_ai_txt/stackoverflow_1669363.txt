I had a similar problem. In the end I "solved" it by sending http headers with every page to say the content had expired and force a renewal of the page. Not a very elegant solution though. In PHP this was: header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1 header("Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past Not sure about Tomcat though.
