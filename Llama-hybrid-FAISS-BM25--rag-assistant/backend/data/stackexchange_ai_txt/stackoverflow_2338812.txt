How can I view log files in Linux and apply custom filters while viewing?

I need to read through some gigantic log files on a Linux system. There's a lot of clutter in the logs. At the moment I'm doing something like this: cat logfile.txt | grep -v "IgnoreThis\|IgnoreThat" | less But it's cumbersome -- every time I want to add another filter, I need to quit less and edit the command line. Some of the filters are relatively complicated and may be multi-line. I'd like some way to apply filters as I am reading through the log, and a way to save these filters somewhere. Is there a tool that can do this for me? I can't install new software so hopefully it's something that would already be installed -- e.g., less, vi, something in a Python or Perl lib, etc. Changing the code that generates the log to generate less is not an option.
