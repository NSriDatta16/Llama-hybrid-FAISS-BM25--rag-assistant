Are predictions obtained with spuriously correlated predictors any useful?

Short version: How useful are predictions of a variable y that are obtained using theoretically unrelated variables X that happen by mere luck to predict y very well? Is there any paper out there dealing with this issue? Long version: For example, let's say that I have time series data on y (monthly crime rates in Belize), and I need to estimate the causal impact of an intervention following the methodology in Brodersen et. al. (2015) . To do this, I'd have to estimate a model that predicts my data very well for the period previous to the intervention, and use the predictions for the post-intervention period as a counterfactual scenario. Then the difference between expected and observed y would be a measure of the impact of the intervention. For inferring causality, I'd need a counterfactual created with variables that were not affected by the intervention, but that create a good predictor of the series without the intervention. To do this, I employ series that are highly correlated with y , but that are certainly unrelated from a theoretical point of view (for example, monthly number of Google queries for "sushi" from Burkina Faso extracted from Google Correlate). These should satisfy the assumptions mentioned above. However, the guarantee that comes from a causal relationship is just not there. Does this mean that I can't measure the causal impact of interest using that counterfactual?
