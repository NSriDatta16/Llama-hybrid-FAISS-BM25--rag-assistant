Are EF4 classes really POCO?

I'm starting to study EF4 as a possible replacementt for NH in my new projects. I'm interested in an object-first developement. I found a tutorial that drive me in creating a designer surface and draw my entities here... the resulting entities are plenty of attributes ( are this POCO ? ), so what I ask is: Is there some way to use EF4 by writing the entities in code, whitout dragging and designi, plus creating and updating the database ? Some tutorial/blog ?
