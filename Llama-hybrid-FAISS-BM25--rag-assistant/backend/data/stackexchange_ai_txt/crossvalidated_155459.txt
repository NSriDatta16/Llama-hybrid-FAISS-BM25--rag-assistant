Logistic Regression: the categorical variable is significant but each of its sub-group (level) is not

I'm trying to predict the outcome "Decision" in the function of Age, Gender, Occupation, .... The independent variable "Occupation" is known to be significant. But when I do the logistic model, each sub-group (modality) of it is not. Should I regroup the levels having the same value of estimated coefficient? (which I guess doesn't make many sense because the levels are not statistically significant) The variable Occupation has 74 different sub-groups. And another problem is that when checking the multicollinearity, the function VIF in R doest work, it produces the NaN value, may be its due to the large number of sub-groups of Occupation.
