Custom persistent-storage?

I need to make a desktop application that stores data, I want this data to protected, and besides, the user shouldn't have to install any data-servers (i.e. SQL-Server, office etc.). I thought XML would be the best idea, the question is how can I protect the data whilst enjoying the other cool features of it which is XML literals and XLinq (VB.NET is the love of my life). UPDATE : It's important for me the users shouldn't know I am using an external tool. Any ideas on this or other approaches would be appreciated.
