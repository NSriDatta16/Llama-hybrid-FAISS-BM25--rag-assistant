Have you ever seen anyone mention probability density function as a framework for neural network?

I am evaluating a proposal pitch from a vendor about their machine learning solution. I do not have access to the source code or any other technical details about the algorithm they are using as it is their IP. But in the only technical side of PPT slides, they mention that they are using self learning neural network (actual text is given below). Initially this sounded like reinforcement learning to me. But in the very next line they mention the framework behind the solution and the big surprise to me was that they have mentioned 1) Probability Density Function and 2) Clustering. In the machine learning world, these two are not frameworks and this immediatedly makes me suspicious about the caliber of the vendor. Honestly I was expecting a deep learning framework like Pytorch or Tensorflow but PDF as frameworks is a big redflag for me about the technical knowledge of the vendor. However, I could be wrong. So my question is: Question : What would be your perception or first impression of a vendor who puts probability density function as the core a framework for something they claim to be a self-learning neural network? Text from PPT slide We use self-learning , to provide employers with the best matching candidates to their open jobs. The AI is built on smart neural networks that learn from the behaviors and activities of users as well as employers' activities. The below are some of the frameworks used in the backend in providing informative hiring decisions for recruiters: Probability Density Functions – the use of normal probability distributions, such as Gaussian distribution, which will help better analyze the users’ data in the system which will eventually cater to the needs of each employer based on their history, peer vector analysis, scoring modules and other technical information to provide the best matching talent. This would help employers in their pipeline building as well as in hiring their needs efficiently and in a timely manner.
