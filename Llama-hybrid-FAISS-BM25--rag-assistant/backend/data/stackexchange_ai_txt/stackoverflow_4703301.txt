Architecture of an image hosting site

I'm sure many here are aware of image hosting sites, like imgur, min.us, photobucket etc. Not that I want to develop one, but besides just uploading the file, organising it in some directory somewhere, what architectural considerations are involved in these sites? Especially when there's millions of page views a day (like imgur, I'd imagine) I'm curious about this because it seems that a lot of sites (say, dating websites etc) would be pretty image intensive. Even if it's not for millions of page views, what are some basic architectural requirements of efficient image deliveries online?
