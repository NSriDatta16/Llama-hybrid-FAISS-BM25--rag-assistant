GLSL: How to get pixel x,y,z world position?

I want to adjust the colors depending on which xyz position they are in the world. I tried this in my fragment shader: varying vec4 verpos; void main(){ vec4 c; c.x = verpos.x; c.y = verpos.y; c.z = verpos.z; c.w = 1.0; gl_FragColor = c; } but it seems that the colors change depending on my camera angle/position, how do i make the coords independent from my camera position/angle? Heres my vertex shader: varying vec4 verpos; void main(){ gl_Position = ftransform(); verpos = gl_ModelViewMatrix*gl_Vertex; } Edit2: changed title, so i want world coords, not screen coords! Edit3: added my full code
