You should check out Effect Games . It is a free to use, online hosted Javascript Game Engine that runs incredibly smooth and supports all major browsers. Don't believe me? Play this demo , or this one . Those that say you must use Flash and Javascript is too slow, obviously haven't been paying attention, especially to the newer browser such as Chrome that utilise compiled javascript . Why use Flash, when you can have a cross platform, cross browser game developed using native browser functionality. You should also check out Chrome Experiments to see just how much current Javascript (and sometimes HTML5) capabliities have improved. Effect Games provides free, online tools for building, sharing and playing your own browser based games. Your games may include sound effects, music, and multiple layers of parallax-scrolling tiles and sprites. Users can play your games right in their browsers, without needing any new plugins or extensions. Publish your games on your website or blog, share on social networking sites, and submit them to our featured games section! Build your games using JavaScript and our custom browser game engine, level editor, and suite of developer tools. The Effect Engine supports Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and all modern browsers including IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari.
