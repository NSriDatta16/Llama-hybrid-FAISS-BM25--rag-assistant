Is it possible to avoid Focus on SplitContainer?

The WinForm SplitContainer gets the focus when it's dragged or clicked, while the Splitter does not. The side-effect of this, is that dragging a SplitContainer bar fires Leave/Validate on other controls, and I need to avoid this. I already tried setting TabStop and CausesValidation to False, but with no success. Is there a way to stop the SplitContainer from getting focused? (not a big deal, I can still use the old Splitter, but I lose some nice VS properties...)
