You shouldn't blindly think that a unit == a class. I think that can be counter productive. When I say that I write a unit test I'm testing a logical unit - "something" that provides some behaviour. A unit may be a single class, or it may be several classes working together to provide that behaviour. Sometimes it starts out as a single class, but evolves to become three or four classes later. If I start with one class and write tests for that, but later it becomes several classes, I will usually not write separate tests for the other classes - they are implementation details in the unit being tested. This way I allow my design to grow, and my tests are not so fragile. I used to think exactly like CrisW demonstartes in this question - that testing at higher levels would be better, but after getting some more experience my thoughts are moderated to something between that and "every class should have a test class". Every unit should have tests, but I choose to define my units slightly different from what I once did. It might be the "components" CrisW talks about, but very often it also is just a single class. In addition, functional tests can be good enough to prove that your system does what it's supposed to do, but if you want to drive your design with examples/tests (TDD/BDD), lower lever tests are a natural consequence. You could throw those low-level tests away when you are done implementing, but that would be a waste - the tests are a positive side effect. If you decide to do drastic refactorings invalidating your low-level tests, then you throw them away and write new once. Separating the goal of testing/proving your software, and using tests/examples to drive your design/implementation can clarify this discussion a lot. Update: Also, there are basically two ways of doing TDD: outside-in and inside-out. BDD promotes outside-in, which leads to higher-level tests/specifications. If you start from the details however, you will write detailed tests for all classes.
