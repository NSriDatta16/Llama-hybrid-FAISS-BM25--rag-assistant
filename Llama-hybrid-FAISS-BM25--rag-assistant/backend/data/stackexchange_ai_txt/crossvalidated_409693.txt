If $\mathbf{C}$ has no restrictions on its elements, the prior $$ p_1 \left(\bf C \;\middle\vert\; \gamma \right) = \prod_{m=1}^M \prod_{d=1}^D \mathcal{N}\left( c_{md} \;\middle\vert\; 0, \gamma_d^{-1} \right) $$ is proper, and so the posterior is proper, and so you have valid Bayesian inference. However, as you allude to, the likelihood is not identifiable, so your posterior might be exchangeable for certain combinations of elements of $\mathbf{C}$ . This is a problem if you want to make inferences on individual elements of this matrix. If you are defining $\mathbf{C}$ as $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ c_{21} & 1 & 0 \\ c_{31} & c_{32} & 1 \\ c_{41} & c_{42} & c_{43} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ c_{M1} & c_{M2} & c_{M3} \end{bmatrix} $$ then you only need to define a prior for the free element of this matrix, and so $$ p_2 \left(\bf C \;\middle\vert\; \gamma \right) = \prod_{m=2}^M \prod_{d=1}^{ \min(m-1,D) } \mathcal{N}\left( c_{md} \;\middle\vert\; 0, \gamma_d^{-1} \right) $$ is a proper prior that assumes all of the lower-diagonal elements are independent.
