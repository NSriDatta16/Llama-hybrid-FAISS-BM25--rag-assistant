User access log to SQL Server

I need to get a log of user access to our SQL Server so I can track average and peak concurrency usage . Is there a hidden table or something I'm missing that has this information for me? To my knowledge the application I'm looking at does not track this at the application level. I'm currently working on SQL Server 2000 , but will moving to SQL Server 2005 shortly, so solutions for both are greatly appreciated.
