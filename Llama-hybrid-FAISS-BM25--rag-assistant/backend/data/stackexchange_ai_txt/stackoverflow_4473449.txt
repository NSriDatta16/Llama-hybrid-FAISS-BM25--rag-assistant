Maven encourage you to play with "goal-to-phase assignments", instead of explicit instructions about when to run what. Maven lifecycle is your roadmap, which you can't change. And on every milestone ( phase ) in this roadmap you can do certain operations ( goals ). In other words, you have to forget Ant and start using Maven :)
