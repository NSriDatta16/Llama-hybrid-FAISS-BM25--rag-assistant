In the end I have selected following solution: 1) Enlisting all existing roots using: File[] roots=File.listRoots(); 2) check presense among those roots standard ones, i.e. File phoneRoot=new File("//"); File sdRoot=Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); 3) If there are some extra ones - treat them as those additional external disks/sticks I think it's best solution, since no hacks, everything is standard and this covers possible future extensions.
