For text it is common, if not mandatory, to do some preprocessing steps that you don't mention: lowercasing, stemming, stop-word removal. For twitter spacial care should be taken for hashes (you probably want them as hashes, not standard words). I am sure that linear SVMs will do better than naive Bays. Not sure about logistic regression. In terms of methodology you follow same approach as you did with naive Bays. You should pay attention on the measurement of performance you use. Do you really want accuracy? Accuracy can be easily misleading in these problems. Probably it is better if you go for precision/recall per sentiment of interest. For example, precision 95%, recall 50%: I am able to detect 50% of the tweets with sentiment, and from those that I detect I am gonna be correct in 95% of the cases.
