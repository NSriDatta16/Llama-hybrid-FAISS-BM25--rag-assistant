This is quite late as an answer, but I hope others can benefit from it: What else are they good for? Any time you need to model causality and/or feedback loops, you need PGMs. Especially chain graphs are particularly expressive. Have they not been outstripped by more advanced methods for lots of problems now? I would not say so no. Most of the hype about deep learning etc, comes from the results obtained by the models. The underlying graph has a much stricter condition on the flow of the computation. Whereas in the case of PGMs the flow computations is determined by the set of factors in practice thus it can be largely dissociated from the independence assumptions encoded by the graph. In which domains or for which specific kinds of problem are they still king? To my knowledge, they are extensively used in computational biology, especially in genetics. Not sure if they are still the king though. How are they complementary to modern advanced methods? If modern advanced methods imply deep learning, machine learning, etc. I see some PGM structures appear in machine learning libraries. But it is best to think of them as another way of attacking the same problem from a different directions. Should I dedicate time to reading any of Koller & Friedman's massive tome on this subject? If you are interested in PGMs then yes at least first few chapters on inference and learning, else no. How dated is this set of MOOCs? Not sure.
