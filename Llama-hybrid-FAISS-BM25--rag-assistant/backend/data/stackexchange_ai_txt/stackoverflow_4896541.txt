This is not really a solution, more of a work around... It seems after much messing around that the only way I can find to get this to work (usin go2) is to use inline styles for css containing the data uri's. However, my intention was to embed the images into the external stylesheet so it (and the embedded images) would become cached, embedding images into the html document itself means I cannot cache the images so they must be loaded with every request. As always, if there is a better way I would love to hear about it.
