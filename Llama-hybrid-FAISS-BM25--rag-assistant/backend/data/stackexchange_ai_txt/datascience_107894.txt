Why linear model cannot understand the interaction between any two input features?

The book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow states that: Linear models also have the obvious defect that the model capacity is limited to linear functions, so the model cannot understand the interaction between any two input variables. What is meant by "interaction between variables" How do non linear models find it? Would be great if someone can give an intuitive/graphical/geometrical explanation.
