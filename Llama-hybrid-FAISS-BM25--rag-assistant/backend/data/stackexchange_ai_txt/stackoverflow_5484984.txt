Averaging over continuous blocks

I have a data like this: f x A 1.1 A 2.2 A 3.3 B 3.5 B 3.7 B 3.9 B 4.1 B 4.5 A 5.1 A 5.2 C 5.4 C 5.5 C 6.1 B 6.2 B 6.3 I would like to average x over continuous blocks of f , to get this, similar to tapply(...,mean) , but aware of the fact that it shouldn't mix separated blocks and in original order: f x A 2.2 B 3.94 A 5.15 C 5.67 B 6.25
