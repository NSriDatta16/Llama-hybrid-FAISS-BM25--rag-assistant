AdvancedDataGrid SummryRow

One update: I tried using the SummaryRow on the datagrid for its basic functionalities and it is working. Now, I need to embed the text in the summary fields. E.g. If one of my summaryfields returns me the count then it should be able to display 'TOTAL (count)' Is it possible with the summaryrow? Also, I need to have the data to be formatted when it is displayed. e.g. %age, like 50%, 0.1%, etc. Is this also possible? Hi, One quick question. I have an AdvancedDataGrid. I need to add a summaryrow to the grid which will contain SUM/AVERAGE of the respective columns in the ADG. Can anyone point me to some tutorial or any reference where I can learn how to create a summaryrow? Thanks!
