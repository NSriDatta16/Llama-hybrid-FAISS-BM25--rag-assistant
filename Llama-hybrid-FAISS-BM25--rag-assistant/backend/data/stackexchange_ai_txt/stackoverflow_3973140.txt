You can use what is called a bookmarklet. Build the js file you want to run on the other site: your.js Make an HTML page with the following code: Drag'n Drop this to your bookmarks Replace /url/to/your.js with the path of your js file. Load that small page in your browser and drag'n drop the link to your bookmark bar. Go to the web site you want to hack, and click the bookmark you just created. This will load your.js in the page and run the code. Note : the ?'+(Math.random()) part is to avoid your js being cached, this is not mandatory but it is helpful when you develop your.js
