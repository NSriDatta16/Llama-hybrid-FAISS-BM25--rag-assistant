rev 10406 in the Catalyst subversion is a failing test for your issue, we can confirm that it's a bug. This has been broken forever, it's unfortunate that nobody has given us a bug report or 'officially' discovered it before :/ I'll try to fix that (or get someone else to fix it) this week, and we'll ship 5.80005 once that's done as there are enough other fixes ready in trunk for that to be worthwhile. Thanks everyone who brought this to the core team's attention, singingfish++
