I hope this one also helps: I have provided necessary comments in the code. Code: ' this are 2D dynamic arrays ' StudentArray(,) for storage of data of student grades ' Ave_Values_per_Subject(,) for storing average values ' Ave_Values_per_Student() ' actually you can use only the first array, but to make the codes more understandable, _ ' we declare another 2 arrays Dim StudentArray(,), Ave_Values_per_Subject(,), Ave_Values_per_Student() As Object ' this is the function Sub SolveMyProblem(ByVal Num_of_Students As UInteger, ByVal Num_of_Subjects As UInteger) ' get the number of students and resize the array ReDim StudentArray(Num_of_Students - 1, Num_of_Subjects - 1), Ave_Values_per_Subject(0, Num_of_Subjects - 1), _ Ave_Values_per_Student(Num_of_Students - 1) ' you can imagine this as having a table with Num_of_Students as the number of rows and Num_of_Subjects as the _ ' number of columns ' StudentArray(0,0) gives the value of student #1 at subject #1 (say english) _ ' StudentArray(0,1) gives the value of student #1 at subject #2 (say math) _ ' StudentArray(1,3) gives the value of student #2 at subject #3 (say science) and so on ' example: we have 4 students with english, math, and science as subjects ' thus Num_of_Students = 4 and Num_of_Subjects = 3 giving us StudentArray(3,2) and Ave_Values_per_Subject(0,2) ' Suppose the grades of student #1 for english, math, and science are 70, 80, and 90 respectively; _ ' student #2 = {75, 80, 90}; student #3 = {75, 85, 95}; and student #4 = {60, 100, 85} ' Suppose index 0 of StudentArray (StudentArray(0,0)) represents english subject; _ ' StudentArray (0,1) = math; and StudentArray (0,2) = science '' to calculate for the average of students for EACH subject and to store it in a separate array: For subjectCount = 0 To UBound(StudentArray, 2) Dim SumPerSubject As Single For studentCount = 0 To UBound(StudentArray, 1) SumPerSubject += StudentArray(studentCount, subjectCount) Next ' average of students per subject: Ave_Values_per_Subject(0, subjectCount) = SumPerSubject / (UBound(StudentArray, 1) + 1) ' the average of students per subject is determined and stored in the above array ' this means that the average of values for english is stored in Ave_Values_per_Subject(0,0) _ ' Ave_Values_per_Subject(0,1) for math; and Ave_Values_per_Subject(0,2) for science Next '' to calculate for the average of EACH student on all subjects: For studentCount = 0 To UBound(StudentArray, 1) Dim SumPerStudent As Single For subjectCount = 0 To UBound(StudentArray, 2) SumPerStudent += StudentArray(studentCount, subjectCount) Next ' ave values of each student on all subjects: Ave_Values_per_Student(studentCount) = SumPerStudent / 3 Next End Sub
