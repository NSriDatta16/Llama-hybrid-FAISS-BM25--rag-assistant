The issue here is that if you perform one analysis you get a single estimate of $\tau^2$. If you split the dataset into subsets you get separate estimates for $\tau^2$ in each subset. This leads to different estimates throughout. Note that is all supposing you are fitting random effects models which is in fact the case here. There is an extensive explanation in the page linked to by Wolfgang which also shows how to get estimates from the combined dataset which match those from the separate subsets by allowing for $\tau^2$ to vary between subsets.
