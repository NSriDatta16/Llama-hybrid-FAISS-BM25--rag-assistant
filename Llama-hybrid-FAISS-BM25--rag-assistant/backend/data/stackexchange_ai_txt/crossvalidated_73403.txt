If you believe there is little if any interaction between the independent variables a simple approach is the linear-additive model. Y= B0 +B1X1 +B2X2 + . . . B60X60 +e Then by examining the coefficients you can identify the top 8 factors. This paper may be of some use. If the above model is too simple, there are many other approaches such as neural networks, symbolic regression, splines and others.
