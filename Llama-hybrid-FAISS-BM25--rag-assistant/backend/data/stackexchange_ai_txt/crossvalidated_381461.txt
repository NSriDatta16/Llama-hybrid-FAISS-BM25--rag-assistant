Bayesian approach to report simulation studies?

I am running a simulation study where we want to estimate a proportion $p$ . We are reporting the coverage of credible intervals with a uniform prior, and we are doing $500$ Monte Carlo simulations. We report the proportion of intervals that contain the true value of the parameter, and report a confidence interval for this proportion. I was wondering if I should also do a Bayesian analysis of the results from the simulation study or if the frequentist nature of the simulation study favours reporting confidence intervals. Q. More in general, is it valid to use a Bayesian approach to report a simulation study?
