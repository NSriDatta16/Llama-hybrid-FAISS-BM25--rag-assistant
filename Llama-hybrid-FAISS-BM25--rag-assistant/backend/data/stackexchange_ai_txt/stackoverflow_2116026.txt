Well, most of the options listed on that page don't have provider support, so I think your options come down to OpenID Enabled's php-openid or Zend_OpenId. I'm partial to the openidenabled libraries myself, but then again, I was on the team that wrote them. php-openid is generally compatible with a wider range of PHP versions, and its test coverage is pretty extensive. I don't really know much about the Zend offering, but it might be appropriate if you're fortunate enough to not need PHP 4 compatibility and like that framework thing they do.
