To illustrate the convergence in a sequence of coin tosses to approximately equal numbers of Heads and Tails, one sometimes looks at the excess $D_n$ of the number of Heads over the number of tails. If the number of heads by the $n$ th toss is $X_n \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n, p),$ then $D_n = X_n - (n - X_n) = 2X_n- n.$ Then the Law of Large Numbers guarantees the convergence of $A_n = D_n/n$ to $0$ with increasing $n.$ A plot of the 'running averages' $A_n$ against $n$ is sometimes called a 'trace' of the coin toss experiment. Four traces are shown in the figure below. Typically, at the left side of such a plot, for small $n,$ the values of $A_n$ will be quite variable, but for larger $n,$ towards the right, the values 'settle down' near to $0.$ Here is R code used to make the figure. set.seed(1234); M = 1000 par(mfrow=c(2,2)) for(i in 1:4) { ht = sample(c(-1,1), M, rep=T) # +1 = Head, -1 = Tail. a = cumsum(ht)/(1:M) plot(a, type="l", lwd=2, ylab="Running Avg") abline(h=0, col="green2") } par(mfrow=c(1,1))
