If you want to mark the source files in a dired buffer and then run a function to format each you can do something like this: (defun clean-file(filename) (your-function-goes-here)) (defun clean-each-dired-marked-file() (interactive) (for-each-dired-marked-file 'clean-file)) (defun for-each-dired-marked-file(fn) "Do stuff for each marked file, only works in dired window" (interactive) (if (eq major-mode 'dired-mode) (let ((filenames (dired-get-marked-files))) (mapcar fn filenames)) (error (format "Not a Dired buffer \(%s\)" major-mode))))
