An alternative to ILMerge is to embed dependent assemblies into the executable as embedded resouces and leverage the assembly resolve mechanism to load them as resource streams. An example of how to do this can be found here: http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/brante/archive/2008/04/14/Embedded-Assembly-Linker.aspx I use this pattern myself which works well. ILMerge sometimes has issues so your milage may vary.
