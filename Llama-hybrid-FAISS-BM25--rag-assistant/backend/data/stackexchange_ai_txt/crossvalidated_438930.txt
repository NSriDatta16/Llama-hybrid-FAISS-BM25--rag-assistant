Shall we use log(diff(x)) or diff(log(x))?

I am starting to learn time series and when detrending I always end up with the same doubt... Generally, I use diff() for, let's say there is an upward trend like inflation... and I use log() to stabilise the variance. My question is: given time series x , is there a rule when we shall do log(diff(x)) Instead of diff(log(x)) (code is in R language).
