If you like screencasts, take a look at Autumn of Agile . There are not that many episodes out yet, but I believe he will cover a few of the most important best practices. The episode plan looks something like this: Agile Values and Practices Overview Basic OO Design Principles Design Patterns In Action Unit Testing Basics Mock Objects TDD Project File/Folder Organization Source Control Basics Continuous Integration / Build Automation Agile Project Planning Principles Overview of Domain Driven Design Core Concepts The author of the series has also made the series Summer of NHibernate , which has been quite popular. In addition to that, at dnr-tv Jean Paul Boodhoo has made five episodes on design patterns and two on test driven development, I would recommend taking a look at those also.
