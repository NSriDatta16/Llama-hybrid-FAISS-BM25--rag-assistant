Dealing with singularity in lmer (r = 1) when the estimated variance is high

I have a genuine question about singular (linear mixed) models and would appreciate any help. In my study, I am trying to predict people's emotion perception responses based on who the target expressing the emotion is ( variable Group : social ingroup/outgroup member) and based on the response 'level' ( variable Condition_Cat : First-order - The person is giving a response for themselves; Second-order ingroup - The person is guessing how other ingroup members would perceive the same emotion; Second-order outgroup - The person is guessing how outgroup members would perceive the same emotion). All my fixed effects are research question-driven, but random effects are not, and that's where the question pops up. I started with the maximal model and simplified it further to find a non-singular structure, so I am currently fitting this model: EP_model With the participant random structure, I have run into the following scenario: Linear mixed model fit by REML. t-tests use Satterthwaite's method ['lmerModLmerTest'] Formula: EmotionPerception ~ Group * Condition_Cat + (1 + Condition_Cat | Participant.Public.ID) + (1 + Group | TextClean) Data: subset(DataFinalOutliers, DataFinalOutliers$EmotionPerceptionOut == FALSE) REML criterion at convergence: 67279.8 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.5090 -0.4963 0.1080 0.6267 4.0512 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. Corr Participant.Public.ID (Intercept) 68.372 8.269 Condition_CatSecondOrderCro 21.496 4.636 0.42 Condition_CatSecondOrderSrb 27.368 5.231 0.34 1.00 TextClean (Intercept) 37.974 6.162 GroupSerbian 1.615 1.271 -0.11 Residual 133.942 11.573 Number of obs: 8584, groups: Participant.Public.ID, 184; TextClean, 16 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 84.7811 1.6850 20.8305 50.315 The correlation of 1 is between different levels of the same random slope (Condition_Cat), but the estimated variance is still reasonably high. The output of rePCA is the following: $Participant.Public.ID Importance of components: [,1] [,2] [,3] Standard deviation 0.7841 0.5104 0.00001497 Proportion of Variance 0.7024 0.2976 0.00000000 Cumulative Proportion 0.7024 1.0000 1.00000000 $TextClean Importance of components: [,1] [,2] Standard deviation 0.5326 0.10907 Proportion of Variance 0.9597 0.04025 Cumulative Proportion 0.9597 1.00000 Finally, the output of a model with uncorrelated intercept and slope is the following: REML criterion at convergence: 67279.8 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -5.5090 -0.4964 0.1080 0.6267 4.0512 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 84.7811 1.6847 20.8453 50.324 My question is what does one do in this situation where the singularity is coming from the slope itself (so I cannot just remove the correlation between the intercept and the slope), but the estimated variance is not negligible? Would this still point to potential over-fitting and should this slope be dropped? Thank you in advance!
