Simultaneous equations, innit? I'm assuming that each line is supposed to retain its slope. Then your figure satisfies these equations (or nearly these equations, I'm not 100% sure about the slope of the AF line): B.x = C.x = D.x B.y = A.y C.y = G.y = F.y D.y = E.y A.x = G.x F.x = E.x (A.y - F.y) = 2(F.x - A.x) When the player is dragging A, then A.y and A.x are effectively constant, so you have eleven equations and twelve unknowns. (There's some under-constraining, as Beta points out, because the three equations B.x = C.x = D.x don't relate to any of the others, and neither does D.y = E.y.) What you probably want is the solution that changes the fewest of your variables. I don't know how to do that. But since this is a game, it probably doesn't matter if occasionally you don't get quite the minimum set of changes. So maybe a greedy algorithm would work, like this: Let S be the set of variable that we keep constant. Initialise it to the empty set. For each variable V, if the set of equations can be solved keeping the variables in S âˆª {V} contant, add V to S. The last solution you found is the one you use.
