For general distributions, a conjugate prior is not guaranteed to exist (though they are if the distribution is from the exponential family ). Whilst the log-normal distribution is in the exponential family, the logistic distribution is not. So a priori I would not assume that a conjugate prior exists. Having said that - at a glance this paper seems to address conjugate priors for Generalised Linear Models (of which the logistic model is an example). If you intend to use MCMC to perform inference on the model, then ultimately conjugacy is not important, and you can choose priors relatively freely; this paper might prove useful if you want to explore this route. Update: An excellent resource enumerating appropriate priors (and pre-processing steps) for various scenarios has been prepared by the Stan dev community; you can find it here , and it covers linear and logistic regression.
