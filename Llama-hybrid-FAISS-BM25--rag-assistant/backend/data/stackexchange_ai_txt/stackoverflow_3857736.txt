Making private changes to Three20

I've made some private changes to the public Three20 libraries. Three20 will now work with semi-trusted SSL certs. Custom views are now working for headers in grouped table views. Custom chrome is now allowed on the photocontroller, and the network performance was tuned for image loading over 3G. Finally, a display bug that would cause textfield cells to disappear from a TTTableViewController was fixed. Unfortunately, I have sinned. I didn't make a new branch before doing this. %git status # On branch master # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 3 commits. # nothing to commit (working directory clean) %git log commit a6ab33d74dd92787a0f7f2b7aa25911aff06a709 Author: Scott Penberthy Date: Mon Sep 27 15:35:46 2010 -0400 Add appropriate method headers to expose custom views, custom chrome commit 9b65760c0ab9f0b7d576d657ab6fd42e8446ed81 Author: Scott Penberthy Date: Tue Sep 21 14:36:38 2010 -0400 Updated to 4.1, allowed custom table header views in a grouped table commit 52f95dc5d0e1a7f51d0cf992859f90d3ee212783 Author: Scott Penberthy Date: Sun Aug 29 10:18:52 2010 -0400 Fix display bug in TTableControlCell. Tune network. Fix SSL bug with bad cert. Is there an easy way to create a diff from these three commits? I'd like to offer these to Three20 and also let others use the changes. What's the best way to bundle just my local changes?
