It depends on how it’s normalized. If it’s just a linear transform that maps the minimum value to -1 and the maximum value to 1 (like MinMaxScaler does), then the mean is not necessarily going to be zero. But that’s not common in machine learning. It’s more common to normalize by standardization , which explicitly shifts the data to have mean 0 and variance 1.
