Insert Leading Spaces to String to Match Format

I have to create a string that has a fixed amount of chars. The format says that the string must be filled with leading spaces in case it isn't long enough. How can I (elegantly) add these leading spaces? P.S. I know I could count the length of the string and a space till I fill it but... I feel like there's gotta be a easier (more elegant) way of doing it. Perhaps with regular expressions?
