Covariance functions or kernels - what exactly are they?

I am rather new to the field of Gaussian processes and how they are being applied in machine learning. I keep reading and hearing about the covariance functions being the main attraction of these methods. So could anyone explain in an intuitive manner what is happening in these covariance functions? Otherwise, if you could point out to a specific tutorial or document explaining them.
