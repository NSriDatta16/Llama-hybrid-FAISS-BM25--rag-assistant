All of them, given a sufficiently small dataset. Proof: Consider a dataset with 0 data points. A neural network can't be fit to this dataset or provide predictions, whereas a Bayesian network can, assuming you set proper priors on all parameters; so the Bayesian network will do better. For small but nonzero datasets, priors are still very helpful. Given a sufficiently large dataset, a neural network will eventually perform at least as well as a Bayesian network, since it will converge to the correct answer (thanks to the universal approximation theorem). But Bayesian nonparametrics are also a thing, so picking the right Bayesian network also guarantees convergence to the right answer. Moreover, "sufficiently large" can be really big, requiring way more data than you could ever realistically get your hands on. Neural networks exist because they can be trained quickly on large datasets, not because they're better at learning from the same dataset--the reality is just the opposite. If it weren't for the internet giving us absolutely insane amounts of data for free, we really wouldn't be using neural nets at all.
