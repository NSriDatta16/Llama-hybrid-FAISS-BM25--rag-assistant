This is what we wanted to do: -Send co-ordinates from an android phone to a server -Plot these on a map in a browser window The complexity was - One 'box' was server for android, and client for google maps. And we needed some glue between these two functionalities. We initially tried ActiveMQ but could not get it to work. Due to time constraints, we were forced to explore other approaches... our end result isn't elegant, but it works. We have a FIFO on the server to which the co-ordinates are written. On the same server, our map page is also hosted. On a button press, XMLHttpRequest is sent to the server. In response, a co-ordinate is dequeued and sent back, which is plotted on the map using google maps api. I will be happy to share more details/answer questions...
