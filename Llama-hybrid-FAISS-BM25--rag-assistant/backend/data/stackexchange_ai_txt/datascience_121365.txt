I prompted ChatGPT and received a good response including a link to https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/transformers-for-image-recognition-at.html Prompt: Please link to some implementation examples and tutorials, including Hugging Face, for the paper titled AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE so I can learn more about it. Response: Here are some example implementations and tutorials for the paper "AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE": Hugging Face's official implementation of the ViT model in PyTorch: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/vision TensorFlow's official implementation of the ViT model: https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer A tutorial on how to use the ViT model in TensorFlow: https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/ A tutorial on using the ViT model to classify images in PyTorch: https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-for-image-recognition-61527a2fed19 A blog post discussing the paper and its implications: https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/transformers-for-image-recognition-at.html A YouTube video explaining the paper and its key ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4 That was my second prompt because I knew Hugging Face had one which was missing from the first prompt's response: Official Implementation by authors: https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer PyTorch implementation by Ross Wightman: https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/tree/master/timm/models/vision_transformer TensorFlow implementation by Piotr Dollar: https://github.com/pdollar/coco/tree/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools Keras implementation by Ali Salloum: https://github.com/Alsaoudi-Salloum/ViT-Keras Jax implementation by Ryan Reece: https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/examples/vision_transformer TensorFlow implementation with added Efficient Attention Module by GitHub user Vignesh Murali: https://github.com/Holmesalbatross/ea-myelonet/blob/main/eamodel.py . From the Google blog you can watch an animation that illustrates the simplicity of the model: animation
