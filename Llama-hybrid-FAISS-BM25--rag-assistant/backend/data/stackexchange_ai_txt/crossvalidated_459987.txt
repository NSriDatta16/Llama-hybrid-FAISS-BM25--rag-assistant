Why does R take so much time to run auto.arima(). How can I shorten the calculation time?

I have been trying to run analysis and model a ts series of Natural Gas spot prices. With data provided by the Qandl API. The whole analysis was working fine, however, I experiences issues with the auto.arima function. 1- If I specify the NG series as XTS, the auto.arima function does not take into account the seasonality. It's quite a bummer for Natural Gas, as the consumption of this resources is all about the time of the year. 2- If I specify the NG series as TS, the auto.arima function takes forever to calculate, and I am not even sure it can finish it. As i let it run the calculation for 20 min once, and it couldn't come with an answer. Hence, I am wondering if there is a problem with my code or my specification. I'm new to data science, it's my first TS project. I really love what I am doing ! Here is my code: NG1= Quandl("CHRIS/CME_NG1", start_date =start, end_date =end, type = type)$Settle prices2returns What do you suggest I do ? I was thinking about specifying manually the seasonal arima function, but I lack the skills to do so for now, where should I start to learn how to specify the function myself ? What did I do wrong in my code?
