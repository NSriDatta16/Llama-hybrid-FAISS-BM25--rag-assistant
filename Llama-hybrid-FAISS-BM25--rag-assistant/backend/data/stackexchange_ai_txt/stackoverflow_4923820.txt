The way I would do this is to open an input file handle and an output file handle, and go line by line through the file checking column one and, if its fine, just plop it into my output just as it is. If it does need to change, I would make a new line with the necessary changes and put it into my output file as well. This is a simple approach, that while not the greatest/elegant/whatever, would give you what you need quickly.
