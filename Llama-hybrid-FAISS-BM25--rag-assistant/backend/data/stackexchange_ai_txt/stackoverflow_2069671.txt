How to change string resource xml values in Android programatically?

Is there any possibility to Edit String.xml values in Android? Please suggest me the possible ways. I want to provide Enable/Disable option for my App. To accomplish this I can use SQLite database. But I doesn't like to Use DB for a single variable value. Thanks in Advance. With Regards, Raghavendra K.
