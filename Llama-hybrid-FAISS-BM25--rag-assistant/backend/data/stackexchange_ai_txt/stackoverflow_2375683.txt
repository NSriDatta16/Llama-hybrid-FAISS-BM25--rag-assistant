The definitive reference for network proxy configuration in Java 5 is this Java Networking and Proxies page. From this page, it seems that Java 5 pays no attention to the system settings from the host environment. But even if it is supposed to pay attention to them, the fact that this is (apparently) not working for you means that you should not be relying on this ... at least for now. In order to explicitly configure a Java 5 JVM to use a default proxy for HTTP you need to set the Java system properties: http.proxyHost - the DNS or IP address of the proxy http.proxyPort - the port number for the proxy http.nonProxyHosts - a list of hosts or domains to connect to directly, separated by the "pipe" character | . If you are using HTTPS as well, you also need to configure https.proxyHost and https.proxyPort . And, I think you have to set http.proxyHost for http.nonProxyHosts to have any effect. Setting the latter by itself may have no effect. More details are in the page linked above. I'd recommending using "-D" options in the command script that you use to launch the app. Maybe you could make this script pull the proxy parameters from the system settings. Note that in Java 6 and later, network proxy support changes (again) and a Java 6 JVM will pick up and use system settings from the host environment under certain circumstances.
