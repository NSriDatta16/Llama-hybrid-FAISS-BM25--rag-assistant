how to draw a picture in iPhone with Quartz2d

I'm studying Quartz now and want to do a demo like this: when your finger moves on the iPhone screen, it shows the track in red colorã€‚ The code is like: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; _firstPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; _endPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; [self setNeedsDisplay]; _firstPoint = _endPoint; } then - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { // Drawing code. CGContextRef _context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); CGContextSetRGBStrokeColor(_context, 1, 0, 0, 1); CGContextMoveToPoint(_context, _firstPoint.x, _firstPoint.y); CGContextAddLineToPoint(_context, _endPoint.x, _endPoint.y); CGContextStrokePath(_context); } Here,_firstPoint and _endPoint are CGPoint to record positions. However, it doesn't show the track. I don't know what is the problem. Please give any tips. Finally, I'd like to consultant whether it is right to fulfill such a kind of App. thanks!
