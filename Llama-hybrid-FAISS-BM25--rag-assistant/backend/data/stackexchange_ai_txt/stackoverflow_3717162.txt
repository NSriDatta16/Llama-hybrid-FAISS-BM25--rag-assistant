What do you mean by "much"? If "much" is more than a handful of GB:s, you need to be on 64-bit hardware and operating system, in order for a process to be able to address that large an amount of storage. I'm pretty sure you can use virtual memory on 64-bit Linux at least, to provide apps with more storage than there is RAM. Of course, it won't be fast if the access pattern is random.
