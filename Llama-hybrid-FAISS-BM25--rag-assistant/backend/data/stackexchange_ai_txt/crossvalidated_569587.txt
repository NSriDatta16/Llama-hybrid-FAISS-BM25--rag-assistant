It is possible to build a time series model with this dataset

So basically, I started my internship in business intelligence, and when my boss know that I have a background in machine learning and deep learning. so, he asked me to build a model that predicts a specific number for the next month. so, it time series problem, and the datasets that I have it is very small it starts from May 2019 so it is just 31 rows. And when I plotted the data, it had no clear trend. This pitcher for the graph looks like my dataset (sorry I cannot share the dataset because of privacy). So, I started to take the difference in the data to remove the seasonality and log transformation and after that, I bullied the model using the Arima algorithm and LSTM, and prophet. And I applied a prediction interval for the predicted number to get periods and expect the number will be inside this interval. But unfortunately, the actual number (for this month) was out of the interval. So, I decided to look back in a database and I found a feature I think that may help and have a high correlation with the main feature now becoming a multivariate time series problem. so, I tried to use the VAR algorithm but unfortunately, the model also filed and the actual number for each feature was out of interval. This first time for me to build a time series model in the industry for a real dataset and I worked alone. So, there is an approach that can help me to build a better model that I do not follow in my step. Or I should go to my boss tell him cannot build a model for this dataset, especially the data is impacted by a coronavirus
