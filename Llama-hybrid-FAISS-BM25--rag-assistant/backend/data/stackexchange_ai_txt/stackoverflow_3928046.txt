Utilization of User Stories for automated, scheduled, or reactive functionality

I was wondering what the thinking is in regards to using User Stories to describe automated, scheduled, or reactive functionality. For example, what do you do when you have something like an order fulfillment process which involves pulling an order from a queue, preparing a "fill order form", sending the form to an order processing center, then waiting for some sort of confirmation from the processing center, such as "order fulfilled", or "order fulfillment error: reasons...", etc.. Keep in mind that the only user intervention during this entire process would be when the order was entered. One could always argue that the fulfillment process is something that can be implied from a order entry story, or that it is an implementation detail, but it seems to me that the fulfillment process is too large to simply take it as implied from an order entry user story or as an implementation detail. It feels like there should be a description of the fulfillment itself as a story as well. Particularly, the aspects that interest me about writing a user story for automated, scheduled, or reactive functionality is from whose perspective should it be described? Given that we are using a story format like "As a [role], I want [functionality] so that [purpose]", what is the role in the "As a [role]" part of the story, and what is the purpose in the "so that [purpose]" part of the story? The functionality is usually clear enough but the role and the purpose seem a bit relative. For example, I could use the system as my point of reference and write something like "As the Order Fulfillment System/Agent, I want to be able to pull an order from the fulfillment queue, prepare a fill order form, and send it to the order processing center so that the order can be fulfilled". Or alternatively, I could look at things from the business's point of view and write something like "As an order taker, I want to be able to process the orders that are entered by customers so that I can fulfill my responsibility to my customers and give them what they want" (or something along those lines). However, I could also write this from the perspective of the customer and say something like "As a customer, I want to my order entry to be processed/fulfilled so that I can receive the things that I want". I realize that there may not be one ultimate answer as to whose perspective is the valid one or more usefull one. I'm sure I will get a lot of "it depends" replies. Nonetheless, I would be very interested in hearing about what others have done in situations like these, or if anyone knows of any recommendations, guidance or practices specifically for these types of scenarios.
