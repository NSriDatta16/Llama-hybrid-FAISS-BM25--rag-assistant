Time series Multiple breakpoints test in R

I'm using package strucchange in R to deal with time series data, but I have a question about breakpoints() function, how to set the optimal period 'h' to the regression sample? if the period h too short, it's become very sensitive, every small shock will be conclude in the change points. Here is my code, first, i'm generate and combine two ar(1) with trend data to one xt Using AR(1)+Constant+Trend to OLS summary(brk) With the RSS & BIC Suggestion, Which is the best choice guidelines? With the plot, i choice breakpoints = 2 brk Then I reduce the period from 40 to 20 summary(brk) i choice breakpoints = 2 Then, if I choice smaller period of regression samole h = 10, it's become very sensitive. Almost 17 breakpoints. brk How to choice the optimal period h ? Thanks for your help!
