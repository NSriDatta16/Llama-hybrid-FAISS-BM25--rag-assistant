Well the statement is true for all statistics, since a statistic is (but) a function of the data. Converserly, I know of no statistical model/method that overcome the problem. It a generally a big no-no in statistics to generalize to the entire population, unless you can somehow argue that your sample is "very" good. On a side note; I have seen some reserachers, within machine learning, who leave out some of the data when they estimate. Then they try to predict the outcome of these (leftout) observations. As a way of testing the the predictive power.
