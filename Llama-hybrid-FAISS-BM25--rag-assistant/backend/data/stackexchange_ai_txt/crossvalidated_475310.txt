You can intuitively think of wavelet transforms as a tool that allows you to decompose the signal you want to analyze in different temporal "portions" and inspect and carry out a frequency analysis of that portion of the signals. For this reason the wavelet transform is not affected by the non-stationarity of the time series, since you break up your signal in portions where frequencies are "approximately constant" and carry out independent analysis on that portion. Note that there is a trade-off between time and frequency resolution: the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that increasing resolution in time, corresponds to reducing the resolution in frequency. The time and frequency accuracy are hyperparameters that you choose based on the time-frequency dynamics of the signal you analyze.
