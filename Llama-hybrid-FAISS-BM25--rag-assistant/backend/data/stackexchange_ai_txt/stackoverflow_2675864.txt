Pragma works. As an example I just tried it on one of my Android App DBs. sqlite> pragma table_info (userCommand); cid name type notnull dflt_value pk 0 id INTEGER 0 1 1 description TEXT 0 0 2 message TEXT 0 0 As we can see there are three fields in the specified table. id, description, and message. So in your app, use something like: Cursor c = null; c = RawQuery ("pragma table_info (userCommand)",null); // if c has records and is not null then iterate through the records in search of your table name. Please excuse the poor formatting.
