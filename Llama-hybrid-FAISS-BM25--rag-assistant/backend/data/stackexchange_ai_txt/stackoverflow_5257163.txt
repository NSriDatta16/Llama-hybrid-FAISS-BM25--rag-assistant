Migrating a multi-project Subversion repo with a common trunk to Git?

I began using Git last year and have enjoyed it so much that I'm considering switching over my largest, most active Subversion repo. Unfortunately, that repo contains several (related, but independant) projects. There are many, many pages describing how to convert a single-project repo, but far fewer for multi-project repos. In fact, I've only found a few , and they all seem to assume that each project has its own trunk: project1/ branches/ tags/ trunk/ project2/ branches/ tags/ trunk/ project3/ branches/ tags/ trunk/ Regrettably, my Subversion repo looks something like this: branches/ *empty* tags/ project1-0.9/ project1-1.0/ project1-1.0.1/ project2-0.9/ project2-0.9.1/ project3-0.5/ trunk/ project1/ project2/ project3/ Worse, the tags are all created from the working copy (e.g. svn copy . svn://example.com/svn/tags/project1-1.0.2 ), so include small changes never commited to the trunk (mostly hard-coding version numbers). Also, there are a handful of commits which span all projects (license updates, etc.). Thankfully, at least, there are no merges! Is there a clean way to untangle these projects while keeping my tags? If it helps, this would be a one-way conversion, with the Subversion repo taken offline afterward.
