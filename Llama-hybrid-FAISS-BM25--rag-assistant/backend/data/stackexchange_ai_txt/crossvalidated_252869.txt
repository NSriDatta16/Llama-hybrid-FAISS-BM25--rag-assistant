Why did my neural network performance change when I re-arranged the input variables?

I have a data-set of 4184x20 and 4184x1, 20 are input parameters while 1 is my target variable. When I first trained my network, it gave a specific value of m.s.e, but a strange thing happened. When I re-arranged the variables or simply swapped the position of some variables, my NN performance has changed. Why is that so? Can someone guide me, I am new to this method. Thank you
