@Wyatt Barnett's suggestion is where I would start. Clear your cache, look in Firebug's Net console and watch for any pages coming in 404. If that fails, concentrate on finding the differences between the source code / support files on your production and development servers. Get a diff tool (I'm on a Mac and I use FileMerge, but there are heaps of very good, free diff tools available for every platform). Save the page source of your production and development pages (ignore what the server is supposed to be building, look at what the browser is actually getting instead). Pay close attention to any CSS differences there might be, or any extraneous elements that may be getting injected into the document in your production environment. Lastly, change your development pages so that they point directly at your JS files on your production environment. If you accidentally changed one of these files, or if they got saved at different versions, it would account for the problems you're seeing. If the page source code is identical and the JS files are identical and there are no issues with loading the files, my next guess is gremlins. They get into everything.
