Interpret Pearsons correlation output from R

I have conducted Pearson's correlation in R and need help interpreting the results. Pearson's product-moment correlation data: A.C$Average.tortuosity and A.C$Area t = -0.6168, df = 14, p-value = 0.5473 alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.6092369 0.3622606 sample estimates: cor -0.1626531 I am interested in reporting the r and p values. Would it be fair to say based on the the above output that: There was a non-significant correlation between the two variables, r (14) = -.16, p > .05.
