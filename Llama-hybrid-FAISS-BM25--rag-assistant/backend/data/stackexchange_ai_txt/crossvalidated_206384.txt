MCMC using GIBBS sampling: can different burn-in be used for different parameters?

I have run a stochastic volatility model with 4 parameters. I have used the Heidelberg and Welch convergence diagnostic. The result shows 3 out of 4 parameters have passed the stationary and half-width mean test but the 4th parameter failed the tests. I wanted to ask if I can use a different burn-in period for just the 4th parameter?
