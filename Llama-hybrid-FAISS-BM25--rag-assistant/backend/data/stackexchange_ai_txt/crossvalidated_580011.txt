Yes, it's just expected value . If you multiply the ranks by the frequencies (%) and sum it, they would be weighted by how popular they are. You would get the average rank, so the lower the better. For a different perspective, the weighted average is calculated as a dot product between the values and the weights. Dot product is proportional to cosine similarity and is itself a measure of similarity . So it does measure how “correlated” weights and values are. See also Why is the expected value named so?
