To add to @MachineEpsilon's answer. Deep learning has become the de-facto tool for tasks like segmentation and object detection. And is starting to take over in domains like 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, it is still an ongoing process. You still need to have a good knowledge of projective geometry (Hartley and Zimmerman's book) to solve tasks like metrology (performing accurate measurements on images). There are situations where you want to extract some features (like edges or contours). Also, matching and tracking planar objects with feature based methods are still a very good option, and easier to set up, compared to fine tuning a neural network. This techniques are also at the core of many SLAM approaches. My point is: there are still many relevant use cases where either deep learning does not provide a (satisfactory) solution, or where traditional approaches are easier to use. If only because there are well-proven software libraries like OpenCV.
