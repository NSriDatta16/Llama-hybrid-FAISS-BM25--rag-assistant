How to visualise coefficients of a Binomial Logistic Regression?

Hello all! Do you have an idea how best visualise the data from this table knowing they are coefficients of binomial logistic regressions? What I would like to visualise is a confrontation between the predictors likely to influence 'paying intent' Also what is the difference is between 'beta' and 'exponential(beta)'? edit: All of the variables are binomial but for the age variable that is continuous.
