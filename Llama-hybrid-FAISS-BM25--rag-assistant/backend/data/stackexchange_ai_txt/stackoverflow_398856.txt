How can I test my knowledge of .NET?

A lot of programming and computer science topics are tricky, and as a result it's hard to know sometimes if you've gotten an idea straight after just reading about it. Some programmers' learning material incorporates self-testing pretty well; a great example of this is The Little Book of Semaphores . I'd love some ways to test my knowledge of the .NET runtime: BCL, and C#, as well as WPF. I'd especially like to understand how storage and retrieval in data structures work in .NET in some way analogous to STL ( deque , vector , map , etc...). Ideally, this would be like the material in the semaphores book, where relevant material is presented along with self-tests. Suggestions?
