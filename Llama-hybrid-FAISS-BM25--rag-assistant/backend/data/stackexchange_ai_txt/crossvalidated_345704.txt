Well, in Bayesian NN you need to set a prior over your NN weights. Setting that properly is needed for it to deliver good performance. Also, if this is a full Bayesian setting where prediction is done under the the distribution over the parameters, corresponding to, $$P(y|x) = \int P(y|x,\theta)P(\theta|D)d\theta$$ then it also depends how you approximate that integral. No, if it is full Bayesian and not just MAP, you need to report an expectation over your prediction. Which is to draw samples from the posterior distribution parameter and report the expectation (i.e., average) over the prediction.
