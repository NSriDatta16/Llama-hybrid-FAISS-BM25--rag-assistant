For unknown nonlinear dependences, there are nonlinear models. The most commonly used are tree models, i. e. random forest (package randomForest) and boosted trees (package gbm) and neural networks. If you want to use linear regression for nonlinear dependence, one possibility is to create a big polynom with lots of terms, and then do stepwise elimination. Use logarithms if (and only if) the feature change orders of magnitude, i.e. you try to predict the life span of arbitrary animal from its weight. Another possibility is to try Kernel Ridge Regression. You may also want to read about Generalized Additive Model.
