You do have an alternative. You can embed reports directly into your code projects in .Net. In this case the report runs through the Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms and Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms namespaces, ReportViewer object. Each report will have a ".rdlc" extension instead of ".rdl", though the two files types are actually equivalent. There is an ASP.Net version of the ReportViewer that allows you to integrate these reports into your website. You just need to drag the ReportViewer control from the toolbox into your website to configure it. For more information, see the MSDN overview of ReportViewer Controls .
