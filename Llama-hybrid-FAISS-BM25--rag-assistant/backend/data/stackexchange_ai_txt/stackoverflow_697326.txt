What's the average limit of divs for a page to be stable?

Some time ago I found this site which has an API to draw stuff in javascript using divs. I've tried to use it, but noticed that as the number of divs increased, the stability of the page (especially doing select,copy,paste) decreased. Now I'm about to write a web-app that will have a huge amount of generated divs, and I'm wondering if it will affect it's stability. What's the average limit of divs one can use in order for the web page to remain stable, and avoid overloading?
