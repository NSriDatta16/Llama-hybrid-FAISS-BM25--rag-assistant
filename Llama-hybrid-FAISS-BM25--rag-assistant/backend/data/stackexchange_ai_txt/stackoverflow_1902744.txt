When is `eval` in Ruby justified?

" Is 'eval' supposed to be nasty? " inspired this one: Mostly everybody agrees that eval is bad, and in most cases there is more elegant/safer replacement. So I wanted to ask: if eval is misused that often, is it really needed as a language feature? Is it doing more evil than good? Personally, the only place I find it useful is to interpolate strings provided in config file. Edit: The intention of this question is to get as many real-life cases as possible when eval is the only or the best solution. So please, don't go into "should a language limit a programmer's creativity" direction. Edit2: And when I say eval , of course I refer to eval ing string, not passing ruby block to instance_eval or class_eval .
