Random Forest: it's better to have lower error or a higher var explained?

I'm specifically referring to Random Forest regression. The first statistics that are usually printed after running a random forest regression (in R - randomForest package - randomForest:::print.randomForest ) are: Mean of squared residuals and % Var explained obtained. Tuning the model, if you made a "good" change, usually you get a lower Mean of squared residuals and a higher % Var explained : is this always the case? (I'm aware of the fact that randomForest reports the variation and not the variance explained as specified here -> Manually calculated $R^2$ doesn't match up with randomForest() $R^2$ for testing new data ). In case it is not, should I prefer a lower Mean of squared residuals or a higher % Var explained ?
