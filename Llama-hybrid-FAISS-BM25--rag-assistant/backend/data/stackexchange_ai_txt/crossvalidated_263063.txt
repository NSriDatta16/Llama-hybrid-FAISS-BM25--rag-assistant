Relationship between negative binomial distribution and Bayesian Poisson with Gamma priors

I am studying the negative binomial distribution and it seems it models overdispersion in a poisson process using a gamma distribution (a mixture or something, but I may be wrong). In parallel, I am studying about Bayesian inference and it caught my attention that when modelling a Poisson process the prior is drawn from a gamma distribution. From my beginner understanding Bayesian statistics are particularly useful to study cases with overdispersion (few observations). Hence, I was wondering whether there is a relationship between the neg-bin distribution and the Bayesian modelling of a Poisson process. I am just trying to get a deeper understanding. Thanks!
