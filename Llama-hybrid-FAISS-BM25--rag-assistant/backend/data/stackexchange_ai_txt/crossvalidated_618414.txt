TL;DR when you make some observations and record them (using whatever means) the recordings are data . What the data represents, encodes, or communicates, is information . This is nicely explained by Wikipedia Information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform. At the most fundamental level, information pertains to the interpretation (perhaps formally) of that which may be sensed, or their abstractions. Any natural process that is not completely random and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information. [...] Information is often processed iteratively: Data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step. [...] As noticed by Peter Flom in his answer , "information" is not a term that you would commonly see used in statistics. You would see it used in statistics in the context of information theory . Information theory was invented by Claude Shannon and others in the first half of the XX century and is the mathematical study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information. Information may be communicated so that a message sent between the communicating parties contains some amount of information, whereas different messages can contain different amounts of information. In Chinese languages, you may use a single character to describe some concept, while to encode the same information in English, you would need to use multiple characters. Information can be stored, sometimes we may compress the data, where an efficient compression algorithm would enable you to store a large quantity of information within a small space. Finally, in statistics, information may be encoded using a statistical model so that the model carries it with as little loss of information as possible. As you can see, this is an academic discussion of abstract concepts. It does not really apply to using Excel software unless you are interested in a philosophical discussion on how it processes data while the information is the knowledge and facts we interpret from the data. As the saying by Alfred Korzybski goes , "A map is not the territory". As for statistical science, again if you are interested in theoretical considerations, information theory has its implications. The concepts of information and entropy inspired some statistical methods and tools ( maximum entropy , K-L divergence , etc). For a more formal and in-depth discussion, see Stanford’s Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on “information” .
