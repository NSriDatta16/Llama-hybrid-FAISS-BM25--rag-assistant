How much important is it to develop different database specific escaping mechanisms for different projects?

As we know, the magic quotes in PHP is already deprecated, this is done to discourage relying on this feature for preventing SQL Injection and to encourage developers to develop database specific escaping mechanisms.[Source: php.net] Is this really neccessary? If Yes, Why? Why can't we just use functions like mysql_real_escape_string() , addslashes() and stripslashes() to achieve the same thing instead of developing a different escaping mechanisms? An answer with example will be appreciated. Thanks
