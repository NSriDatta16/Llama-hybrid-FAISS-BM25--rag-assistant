I like Java Almanac (now renamed www.exampledepot.com/). It has great examples and very pertinent questions, but it only goes through java 1.4, so unfortunately it's pretty out of date. It has good coverage of simple questions like "Quintessential Regular Expression Search and Replace Program" and "Reading Text from a File". Also covers some more complicated topics. Another site I like is javapractices.com. This one answers questions at a little higher level than Java Almanac, for example "Modernize old code" or "Know the core libraries".
