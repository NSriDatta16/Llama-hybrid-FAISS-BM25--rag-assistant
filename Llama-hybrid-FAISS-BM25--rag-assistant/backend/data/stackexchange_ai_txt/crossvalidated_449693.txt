Why can a Random Forest generate extreme values?

I'm training a Random Forest Regressor, and I'm using a target variable thats values are between negative and positive 40. The regressor performs relatively well, however, I've noticed sometimes it generates extreme values. For example, it can generate values that cause some errors of around 60 (so, for example, for a value that should be 0, it generates 60). Why could this happen in theory and how to prevent it?
