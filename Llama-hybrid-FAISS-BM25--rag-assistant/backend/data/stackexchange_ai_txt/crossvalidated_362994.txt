This not an issue with L1 norms nor with logistic regression specifically; it will happen with ordinary L2-norm multiple linear regression. The direction of an unconditional relationship can change once you condition on another variable (include an additional feature). Consider 4 groups, where the $p=\text{Pr}(Y=1)$ is an increasing function of $x$ within each group but where the four groups get lower average $p$ as x increases: Of course the population $p$'s are not observable in practice; you only observe the proportion of Y's that are 1. However, if you have many replicates at each x-value (say 50 or something), you could actually observe something very like this for the sample proportions at each x.. Now if you fit a logistic to just the y vs x values, ignoring the group factor, you will get a negative coefficient. But as soon as you include group, the coefficient for x will be positive. [In fact it is possible that the sign could even flip each time you included additional feature.] Further reading: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias
