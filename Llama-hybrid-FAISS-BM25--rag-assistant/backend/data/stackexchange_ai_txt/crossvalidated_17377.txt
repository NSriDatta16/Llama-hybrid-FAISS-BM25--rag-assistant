How to choose best value of 2 discrete parameters simultaneously?

I have devised an algorithm that takes as input a dataset $s$ and two parameters, $k$ and $d$. $k$ is discrete while $d$ is categorical. My algorithm outputs a vector $v$ of length 20 which contains real numbers between 0 an 1. I run my algorithm on three different datasets $s_1$, $s_2$, $s_3$. For each dataset, I vary $k$ in the range {5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}, and I vary $d$ from {1, 2, 3}. I run each combination and save the resulting $v$. My goal is to find out which values of $k$ and $d$ show the best average performance (in terms of $v$, larger values are better) across all three datasets. I'm ideally looking for a test or method that will tell me exactly which value of $k$ and $d$ are the best overall values for these three datasets. How can I do this?
