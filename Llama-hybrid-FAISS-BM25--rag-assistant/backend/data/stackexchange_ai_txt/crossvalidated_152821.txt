This appears to be related to the Whitworth distribution. (I don't believe it is the Whitworth distribution, since if I remember right, that's the distribution of a set of ordered values, but it seems to be connected to it, and relies on the same summation-scheme.) There's some discussion of the Whitworth (and numerous references) in Anthony Lawrance and Robert Marks, (2008) "Firm size distributions in an industry with constrained resources," Applied Economics , vol. 40, issue 12, pages 1595-1607 (There looks to be a working paper version here ) Also see Nancy L Geller, (1979) A test of significance for the Whitworth distribution, Journal of the American Society for Information Science , Vol.30(4), pp.229-231
