You can use skewed or heavy-tailed Lambert W distributions to transform your data to something more well-behaved (disclaimer: I am the author of both papers and the LambertW R package). The advantage over the Box-Cox transformation is that they do not have any positivity restriction, the optimal parameters of the transformation can be estimated (MLE) from the data, and you can also forget the transformation and model your data as a Lambert W x F distribution directly. The LambertW R package provides several estimators, transformations, methods, etc. I especially recommend a look at Gaussianize() IGMM() MLE_LambertW() The skewed Lambert W x F distribution is a general framework to make a skewed version of any distribution F. Conversely you can then make your skewed data again symmetric; the distribution of this symmetrized data basically determines what kind of Lambert W x F you have; if the data is just a bit asymmetric, then you might have a skewed Lambert W x Gaussian; if your data is additionally heavy-tailed maybe you can try a skewed Lambert W x t. Heavy-tailed Lambert W x F are a generalization of Tukey's h distribution, and they provide an inverse-transform to make data Gaussian (also from asymmetric). In the paper I demonstrate that even a Cauchy can be Gaussianized to a level that you - and also several Normality tests - can't distinguish it from a Normal sample.
