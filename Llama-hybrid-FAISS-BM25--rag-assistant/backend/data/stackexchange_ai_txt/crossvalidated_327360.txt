I will answer each question: $A$ is indeed the covariance matrix (so $X^TX$ assuming $X$ is standardized) The output of PCA is 3 things: the vector of column means $\mu$ of $X$, the vector of column stddevs $\sigma$ of $X$ and the rotation matrix $R = [v_1 ... v_p]$. Therefore, for a new sample row $x_0^T$, to compute its projection onto Principal Component Space, you have to standardize and rotate, that is $((x_0 - \mu) / \sigma)^T R$, which will yield a row vector with $x_0$ in PC coordinates. Please note that here I'm dividing by $\sigma$ elementwise.
