That's definitely possible. It sounds like the access classes are abstracting around a database for storage. Thus it's behaving like a DAO and using JPA to access the datasource. For the getters your access class is using an exposed REST interface from some service. So rather than using JPA to query and return the data, it's using a service that's performing the same tasks. Maybe the REST interface is a get only and doesn't provide a mechanism for storing data and that's why the direct JPA is used.
