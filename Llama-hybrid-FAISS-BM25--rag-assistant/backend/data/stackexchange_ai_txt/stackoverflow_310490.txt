JMS/DDS Integration

I have a legacy C++ application that uses DDS for asynchronous communication/messaging. I need to integrate this application into a JavaEE environment that uses JMS for messaging. Other than building a standalone JMS/DDS bridge module, are there any other options that I might have?
