I think there may be an error in the worked example, but the numbers are fairly clear: You have a process where the shop starts with a stock of $60$, and over $12$ opening days sells at an average rate of $4$ a day, so over $d$ days sells an average of $4d$. So this leads to your Poisson calculation: it will be out of stock after $d$ days with probability $P_d=\Pr(X \ge 60|\lambda = 4d) = \displaystyle \sum_{j=60}^{\infty} e^{-4d}\frac{(4d)^{j}}{j!}=1-\sum_{j=0}^{59} e^{-4d}\frac{(4d)^{j}}{j!}.$ This gives $P_{11}$, $P_{10}$, $P_{9}$, $P_{8}$ as about $0.01253479$, $0.001879629$, $0.0001578351$, $0.000006406888$. The worked example in fact uses $X \gt 60$ rather than $X \ge 60$, which changes the numbers slightly to $0.008750118$, $0.001200979$, $0.00009125053$, $0.000003306611$. So you have $P_{11}, P_{10}, P_{9}, P_{8}$ as stated for the probability of being sold out with $1,2,3,4$ opening days to go. You could have gone in for any of these with equal prior probability. But conditioned on them being sold out, the posterior probability of for example being sold out with three days to go is $\frac{\frac14 P_9}{\frac14 P_{11}+ \frac14 P_{10}+ \frac14 P_{9}+ \frac14 P_{8}}$ and similarly for the others. The expected number of days you would need to wait conditioned on them being sold out is the sum of the number of days to wait multiplied by the conditional probabilities of having to wait those number of days.
