Using maven to output the version number to a text file

I want to generate a zip file that will update an application with maven. The zip will be hosted on a server and I am using the assembly plugin to generate the zip. However I would like maven to automatically generate a text file that stores the current version number outside the zip. How is this possible? EDIT: I successfully did it using the maven Assembly Plugin and two descriptors to create two custom assemblies. One has a directory-single goal and it just creates a folder with the updated version.txt based on filtering. Then another one with a single goal actually packages the zip file. This seems to be very inelegant and I guess it will not properly update the maven repo with the whole updated folder. If there is a better way to do this, please let me know.
