transferring files using TCP

I'm to trying to develop a program to transfer files using TCP (in a local network) with C#, files should be transfer in encrypted way. My knowledge about c# is average, and about socket programming just know the basics. Currently have no idea how to begin.It will be great if you have any suggestion about how to begin, if there is any book, website or any other resources.
