On git, svn and mercurial: git, svn, Mercurial are all version control systems. svn was a great improvement over cvs, a commonly used version control system prior to emergence of new VCS. svn like cvs has a client-server model. git and mercurial provides a distributed version control system that does not depend on network as any repository is self contained with all the history and change records. Of course, there are other goodies. Remember that version control system solves the problem of "the cat ate my code". You can use it to track any kind of development - code, text documents etc. On github, bitbucket, code.google.com and codplex: These provide additional goodies on top of what a version control system provides. They provide you storage for keeping your repository, which you can access and share with the world. When you share code, you would want to also provide documentation. They provide wiki support for this purpose. They also provide ticketing / bug management system which can ease a development project. In short, they provide various tools that can help in project management and development of your code. Since you are getting to whet the knowledge in some of these areas, following links will be a very useful introductions: a-visual-guide-to-version-control intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated
