GWT - internationalization of entity properties

I'm looking for an elegant solution for the following problem: In my database, I have some predefined(!) entities. These entities have names and descriptions (Strings). Around the data access layer, there are some EJBs containing business logic to load/search for/etc. those entities. Now for the frontend, we are developing a GWT application which calls the EJB methods on our backend. The problem is, that the name and the descriptions of the entities mentioned above must be internationalized - e.g., depending on the user's locale, an entity's description must be "My cool description" (English) or "Beschreibung bla" (German) or whatever :) My first approach was to use a resource string in the database. So entity A has a description "descriptionA", entity B has a description "descriptionB"... Later on, the GWT app (or any other client) translates this resource string into the actual description using some kind of "resource bundle". E.g.: *resources_en.properties*: descriptionA=Actual Description of Entity A descriptionB=Actual Description of Entity B *resources_de.properties*: descriptionA=Beschreibung A descriptionB=Beschreibung B (Remember, the entities are predefined, so it's possible to "know" all descriptions at compile time. BUT it would be better if the resource bundle could be enhanced without having to recompile the application). Is this possible with GWT? How can I do this? Is it better to "translate" on the server or on the client side? Otherwise, I've to deal with all that i18n stuff on the backend side. Well, this would allow to keep data together (instead of defining the descriptions on the client side). But the big drawback is that the backend must be aware of the caller's locale. Regards, Frank
