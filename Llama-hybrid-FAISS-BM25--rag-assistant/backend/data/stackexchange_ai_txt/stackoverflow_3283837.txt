How to return a true/false statement off of a select conditional in rails

I am trying to select an array, and check and see if any of the objects within the array are false. If any of them are false, I want an ultimate value of false returned. If all of them are true, I want true returned.. Here's what I have.. validates_presence_of :email, :if => Proc.new { |user| user.organizations.find(:all).select {|org| org.contact_24} } This unfortunately just returns the array. How would you do it?
