Optimistic Concurrency Issue and Improving Solutions

In our database we have gigantic tables (it was initially built 20 years ago). We are on the process of developing it. Some tables contain rowversion and optimistic concurrency. We were wondering if there is a way to just correspond rowversion to the modification of some specific columns, but not all of them. In Normal Case, T-SQL which is generated then would be huge. Any Suggestions?
