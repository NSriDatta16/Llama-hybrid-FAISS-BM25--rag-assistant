Numeric variables can be analyzed with Principal Components Analysis to see if they measure the same underlying component. Variables that measure the same underlying component as determined by factor loadings in the PCA can be aggregated into a single variable. The identity of the components can be identified by determining what is similar about the variables loading onto the same component. The aggregated score representing a component can then be used in other analyses such as t-tests comparing whether gender influences the aggregated component score.
