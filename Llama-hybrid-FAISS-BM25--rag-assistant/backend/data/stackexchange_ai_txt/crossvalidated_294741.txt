Since $d$ can take a continuum of values, there is no simple choice as opposed to the case of integer orders of integration, where you normally choose between $d=0$ and $d=1$ (and, rarely, $d=2$). Software can estimate $d$ for you. In R, check out package "rugarch" and its functions arfimaspec , arfimafit . If you want more details, Ooms & Doornik (1999) consider different ways of estimating ARFIMA models. References: Ooms, Marius, and Jurgen A. Doornik.
