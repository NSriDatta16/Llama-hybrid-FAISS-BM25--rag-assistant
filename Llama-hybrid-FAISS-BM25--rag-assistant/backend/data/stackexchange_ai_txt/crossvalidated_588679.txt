Essentially answered in comments: An SVM for classification is trying to partition the data into two subsets, so you need one label for each of the subsets. Traditionally the labels are ±1. This is for algebraic niceness - it allows you to express two constraints (that the margin doesn't contain data points of either class) as a single equation. – Chris Taylor
