No pre-built ActionBar for Android pre-3.0?

I note the release a few days ago of the static library bringing fragments to Android versions prior to 3.0, but does this library include the ActionBar? I suspect not. I assume that for an app that will work on pre-3.0 versions, that it needs a hand-built ActionBar implementation for versions up to 2.3 and then to use the OS default ActionBar in v3.0? for some reason I assumed the library had ActionBar in it, but as I dig further I'm not finding any evidence of its presence.
