Make each of the twenty questions its own factor variable. Some of them might still have very many levels, for ideas how to handle that see Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? . For better answers, you should augment your question with some more information, sample size? Are all the possible choices used by some participants? If so you must have a large sample --- other idea could be some dimension reduction, look into multiple correspondence analysis --- GLM with scores/principal dimensions from MCA , How can I use projections (components) from multiple correspondence analysis in subsequent regression analysis, similar to PCA
