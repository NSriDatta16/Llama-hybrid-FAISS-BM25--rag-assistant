Custom tld function validation in eclipse

I am working in eclipse (Ganymede 3.4.1) and have created a ctl TLD : 2.0 Name readExtendedField uk.newsint.advertising.wsconnection.ConnectionManager java.lang.String readExtendedField( uk.newsint.advertising.aws.ExtendedFields , java.lang.String ) and referenced it in my jsp (excerpts): ${au:readExtendedField(lin,"EXTRDATE")} Eclipse is giving me an EL Sytax error on the this section${au:readExtendedField(lin,"EXTRDATE")} and assigning it to the first quote and the closing bracket {" and )}. The expression works fine under tomcat but eclipse warns me when I try to commit to the repository and of course shows errors in the problems tab. Has anyone else suffered this and does anyone have a fix?
