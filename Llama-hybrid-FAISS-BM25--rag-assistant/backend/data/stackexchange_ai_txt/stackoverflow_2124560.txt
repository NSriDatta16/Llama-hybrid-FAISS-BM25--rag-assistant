How can I make LWP::UserAgent look like another browser?

This is my first post on SO, so be gentle. I'm not even sure if this belongs here, but here goes. I want to access some information on one of my personal accounts. The website is poorly written and requires me to manually input the date I want the information for. It is truly a pain. I have been looking for an excuse to learn more Perl so I thought this would be a great opportunity. My plan was to write a Perl script that would login to my account and query the information for me. However, I got stuck pretty quickly. my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $url = url 'https://account.web.site'; my $res = $ua->request(GET $url); The resulting web page basically says that my web browser is not supported. I tried a number of different values for $ua->agent(""); but nothing nothings seems to work. Google-ing around suggests this method, but it also says that perl is used for malicious reasons on web sites. Do web sites block this method? Is what I am trying to do even possible? Is there a different language that would be more appropriate? Is what I'm trying to do even legal or even a good idea? Maybe I should just abandon my efforts. Note that to prevent giving away any private information, the code I wrote here is not the exact code I am using. I hope that was pretty obvious, though. EDIT: In FireFox, I disabled JavaScript and CSS. I logged in just fine without the "Incompatible browser" error. It doesn't seem to be JavaScript issue.
