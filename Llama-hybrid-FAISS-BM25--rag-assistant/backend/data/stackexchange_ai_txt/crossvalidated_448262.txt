This method collapses the information of multiple columns into fewer. In that specific example, 6 columns from the Swiss dataset is collapsed into two columns/variables. Dim1 and Dim2 stands for dimension 1 and dimension 2. Thus the distances between the points from 6 dimensions (variables) are now in 2 and thus can be visualised. Now, if you identify an outlier point in the plot you can then go back to the original dataset and identify why this point is indeed an outlier in many ways. In this example, I would identify the variables by looking at which variables yield the largest proportional difference: From the plot in the example, "V. De Geneve" seems to be an outlier. Let's see why: library(magrittr) library(dplyr) # Average of value of each variable in the dataset x1 % summarise_all(mean) # Average of value of each variable in the dataset excluding the outlier x2 % filter(rownames(swiss) != "V. De Geneve") %>% summarise_all(mean) # Let's see which variables have the highest difference before and after excluding V. De Geneve abs(1 - (x1/x2)) # Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic Infant.Mortality # 0.01077431 0.02078308 0.02779219 0.0907587 0.0006324191 0.002113079 From the above, it seems that this person changes the average mostly for Education, followed by Examination and Agriculture. Indeed: swiss %>% summarise_all(mean) # Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic Infant.Mortality # 70.14255 50.65957 16.48936 10.97872 41.14383 19.94255 swiss %>% summarise_all(sd) # Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic Infant.Mortality # 12.4917 22.71122 7.977883 9.615407 41.70485 2.912697 swiss %>% filter(rownames(swiss) == "V. De Geneve") # Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic Infant.Mortality # 35 1.2 37 53 42.34 18 If you take a look at the dataset's average and standard deviation overall stats, you will see that this person is far away for these variables. For instance for education he is 4 standard deviations away from the mean (even with him inside the calculations)
