Scroll by clicking and dragging inside div instead of clicking scrollbar

This CSS is for a DIV in an MVC2 application. The overflow:auto line adds a horizontal scrollbar to the div which is needed since the table in the div is very wide and extends past the edge of the page. #main { padding: 30px 30px 15px 30px; overflow:auto;/* this adds horizontal scroll*/ background-color: #fff; margin-bottom: 30px; _height: 1px; /* only IE6 applies CSS properties starting with an underscore */ } Eventually there are going to be multiple tables stacked and the horizontal scroll bar is going to be below the bottom of the screen. Is there a way to allow the users to click and drag inside the div to make it scroll instead of actually having to click the scrollbar?
