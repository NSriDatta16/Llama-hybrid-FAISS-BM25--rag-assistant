How fast is Google App Engine?

I am experimenting with GAE for last 2 Months. I am saving records to the bigtable by uploading CSV file. My Test File's size is 300 KB. Here what i found Local system Upload take less than 1 second Process 2500 records in 3 seconds On Google Sandbox Upload takes 5-7 seconds. Processing file gives timeout. It only save 60-180 records. My questions are Why it takes too much time? Is there a way to reduce this time? Google counts this processing towards CPU uses. They do not disclose h/w so what CPU internally they use? I mean do i get a CPU euquivalent or greater than PIII? Edited for @Drew Sears 's answer. What i am doing at present Upload the file to GAE Get uploaded data bytes. By stream, count lines , save it into bigtable. There is a unique field, id, my Record. Now, i create queue int x = linesCount/ 50; for(int i 0 ) { x = (linesCount / 50) * 50; Queue queue = QueueFactory.getQueue("test-queue"); queue.add(TaskOptions.Builder.url("/TestQueue") .param("id", id.toString()) .param("startIdx",String.valueOf(x)) .param("totRec",String.valueOf(y)) ); } The task processing servlet read file from storage and using totRec and startIdx process the file and close it..
