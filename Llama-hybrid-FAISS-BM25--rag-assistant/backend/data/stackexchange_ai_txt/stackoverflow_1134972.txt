Questions about Hosting customers' ASP.NET sites

Where do you host your customers' ASP.NET sites? I am about to develop a few sites, and I am looking for a good place to host (cheap, fast, good bandwidth, good storage, updates, service packs, etc.) I have also thought about earning revenue for the hosting/domain, even though I am not actually hosting it (kinda sounds bad when you put it out there). Basically, I would just handle the hosting/domain costs and bill the customer, with a bit of markup. They wont know anything about the host, unless they go digging. Does anyone else incorporate this into their business model? What are the pros/cons?
