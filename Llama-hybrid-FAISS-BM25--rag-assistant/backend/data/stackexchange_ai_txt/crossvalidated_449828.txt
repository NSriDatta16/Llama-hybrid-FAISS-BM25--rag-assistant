Often it is simply because it is a reasonable assumption. If you sample from a population, say for instance, the height of men in Europe, it is reasonable to assume they follow the same distribution. If you are in a setting where you are uncomfortable with the assumption of identically distributed, you could do the bayesian approach and and construct a hierarchical model. Then you can get different posterior distributions, but then these are based on some "deeper" assumption. But then you need to consider how to construct this model. In the end I think it boils down to if you are going to make a model, you need a place to start. And if you take measurements of individuals in a population, the assumption is reasonable.
