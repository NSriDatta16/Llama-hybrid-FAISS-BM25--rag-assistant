If you want to stick with vanilla Machine Learning, SVMs hav been known to work really well on text classification problems. You can experiment with various kernels. Alternatively, you can try neural networks with word embeddings. However from your evaluation metrics, it seems you have a data imbalance problem, hence the low precision and recall. Accuracy becomes completely meaningless here. Before you try anything else, I would suggest that you try to balance your samples by getting more data, if that doesnt seem to be possible then try bagging.
