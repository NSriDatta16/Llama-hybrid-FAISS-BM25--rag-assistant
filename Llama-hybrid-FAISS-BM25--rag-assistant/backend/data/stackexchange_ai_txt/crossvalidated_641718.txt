Power Analysis and Potential Issues with Replication There is some background information here that may be useful to determine why your results were not replicable. Some potential culprits: Did you determine results purely by $p$ values? Effect sizes, confidence intervals, and visualization will really go a long way to determining if the $p$ value is of any worth (I would argue, like Frank, that they are often meaningless at low sample sizes unless you have a lot of repeated measures...even then you are making a sacrifice to get there). What is the reliability of your measurements? Do they systematically differ between observations? This may also play a large part if it is not determined. Are the measurements standardized? Perhaps there are differences in measurement bore purely by the person measuring the data. Any potential ecological factors at play which influence the results? With respect to statistical power, I don't know if you can really get any meaningful power of anything with $n = 10$ or lower unless you have a crazy effect size that makes any statistically significant effect obvious. As such, some options may be found below. Small Sample Solutions There is a nice book on small sample techniques that you may find useful called Small Sample Size Solutions: A Guide for Applied Researchers and Practitioners . It covers the following main themes: Bayesian methods for small samples (basically adding very informative priors to a small sample estimation). Keep in mind that your analysis would be heavily weighted by these priors. Repeated measures designs (RMANOVA, multilevel modeling, etc) such as Peter noted. This can make a huge difference sometimes. Crossed random effects models, for example, simply require multiplying two random effects to get more observations (e.g. $10$ people x $200$ trials = $2000$ observations). N-of-1 designs, which attempt to combine repeated measures and causality into one framework with very small samples. This might actually be your best option given the extremely low samples you are working with here. Beyond all of that, I think numbers can only say so much. Doing some detective work on what's going on will go a long way with respect to the replication problem.
