What data cleaning to do for logit regression with only dummies?

Does anyone know what exact data cleaning steps one need to undertake in order to clean data for a logit regression (not a logistic regression)? I have only time variables, meaning year and month, as my independent variables, and I am using R. A logit regression is simply a normal linear regression where the DV have been transformed with the following formula: logit(y) = ln(y/(1-y) for An example: 3 of 12 people gets cured from taking a pill in period 3 -> ln(0.25/(1-0.25) 5 of 25 people gets cured taking a pill in period 5 -> ln(0.20/(1-0.20) One can use the logit transformation if you have ratios and in many papers and books it is closely related to the logistic regression.
