This operation is not that common and there is not really a predefined way to do it, other than writing it directly, in Common Lisp. Various people like a short syntax and added syntactic elements that would help in such a case to all kinds of Lisps. In Common Lisp one might want to write a function that does what you want (instead of adding syntax). (defun fmap (functions &rest args) (declare (dynamic-extent args)) "Applies each function to the arguments. Returns a list of results." (mapcar (lambda (function) (apply function args)) functions)) CL-USER 1 > (fmap (list #'+ #'- #'* #'/) 42 17) (59 25 714 42/17)
