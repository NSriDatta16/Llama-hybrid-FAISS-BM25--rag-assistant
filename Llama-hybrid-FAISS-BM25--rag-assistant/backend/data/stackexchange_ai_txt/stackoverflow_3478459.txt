Neural Network for multidimensional problem

I'm wondering if it's possible for Neural Network to operate on matrices say I want to: A(i)=matrix(10,10) -> B(i)=matrix(10,10) input = vector of matrices, i = sample size output = vector of matrices Say I would like to guess an matrix operation transforming matrix into another matrix ie f(A(i,j))=2*A(i,j)*b Matlab does not take arrays with dimension >2 in NNtool Any idea? Thanks
