xRM - CRM Platform

As Microsoft is trying to leverage xRM as a development Platform for LOB applications. Some of my clients start requesting applications to be developed on top of that platform. I still need to know the right conditions where this platform will work and when the need arise to work in native .net environment so that i can convince my client. please help.
