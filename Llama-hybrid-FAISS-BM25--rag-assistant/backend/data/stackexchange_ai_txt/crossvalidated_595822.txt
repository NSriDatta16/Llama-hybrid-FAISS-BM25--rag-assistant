Should we test only 20% of the sample for intraclass correlation coefficient?

I'm currently calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient for my data . As far as I'm concerned, the best choice (following this approach and the approach kindly recommended on the previous post answer) is: Model: 2-way random effects ## two teachers' assessment of the same group of students on an exam (it could be any other pair of teachers randomly selected, thus I believe it's generalizable) Type: average ## we'll be using the two-teacher's average in further analysis Definition: absolute agreement code: ### check if variance is homogeneous: car::leveneTest(data $RATER1 ~ data$ RATER2) ##I don't know if it's necessary, but I've seen that ICC relies on the assumption that variance is homogeneous ### run it: library(irr) icc(data[,2:3], model = "twoway", type = "agreement", unit = "average") That being said, I've seen elsewhere some comments on using only 20 to 25% of the sample to calculate ICC, such as in this article and in another internet post, but not nowhere else. Why is that? Question: 1 Is it ok to use the whole sample or Should I only perform it with 20 to 25% of the data? Thanks in advance.
