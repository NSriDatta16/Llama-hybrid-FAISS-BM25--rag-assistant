Is there formal test of non-linearity in linear regression?

In logistic regression there is Box-Tidwell but I know of nothing like that in linear regression. I use partial residual plots to look for this, a graphical feature, but would love to find a formal test (in honesty I doubt you can do a formal test of this, but I could be wrong).
