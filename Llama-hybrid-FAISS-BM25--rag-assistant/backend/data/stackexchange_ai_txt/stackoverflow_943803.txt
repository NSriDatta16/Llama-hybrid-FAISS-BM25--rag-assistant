When pluginA should use classes frmo pluginB, pluginA has to put the package path to the runtime packages. You can find the configuration in MANIFEST->Runtime->"Exported Packages" When you want to use properties files, you have to use the bundle of the called plugin, to find the right properties file. Try to get the in pluginC the default plugin implementation of pluginA AbstractUIPlugin.getDefault() Than search for the bundle object and use the findResource method to find the properties file. Another way is to write a Utility class in pluginA that gives you the property value for a specific key. This class you can call from every plugin you want. You can test your jars in Eclipse by calling Export -> Deployable plug-ins and fragments Than you can check if the export works and all files are inside the jar. If not, you have to update your MANIFEST or build.properties file
