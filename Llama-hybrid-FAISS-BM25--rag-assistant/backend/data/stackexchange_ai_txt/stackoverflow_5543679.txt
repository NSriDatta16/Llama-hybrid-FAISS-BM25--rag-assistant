Why my custom button states are not working?

I made a custom 9-patch images for my button's background. Buttons are in drawable-hdpi and drawable-mdpi folder. I created custom selector file for my button states. selector file login_button.xml: Then I made a custom styles.xml file for the button style: center_vertical|center_horizontal #FF000000 #FFFFFFFF 0 1 0.2 13dp bold @drawable/login_button true true Then applied this style to my theme file in themes.xml @style/login_edittext_style @style/login_button_style @style/login_textview_style And finally added button itself to the layout file: But if I click the button, then background image is not changed. Code is ok and all compiles nicely. I know that I have same image for two different states, but it doesn't work even for one state in emulator. Can anyone point me where is the problem? EDIT: Obviously normal state is working, because it gets it's image from selector xml file. Now i'm wondering why the other states are not...
