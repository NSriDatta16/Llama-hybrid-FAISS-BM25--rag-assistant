The universal approximation theorem asserts that there exsits a feed forward neural network to approximate a function. From the wiki page "however, it does not touch upon the algorithmic learnability of those parameters". In other words, although the universal approximation guarantees the existance of such a neural network, we cannot guarantee that there is a way to train a neural network to reach this performance. There are situations where LSTM are better suited to learning the underlying function.
