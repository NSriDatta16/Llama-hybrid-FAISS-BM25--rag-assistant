Restrict access to page for anonymous users in Drupal

Very simple question that i'm stuck with. I'm making a very simple 'classifieds' website; i have a content-type of type 'classified' i'd like to give access to that content-type for registered users only; i edited the permissions so only 'authenticated' users can 'create classified' and also created a menu link to 'node/add/classified'. The problem is that when anonymous, i don't see the 'create classified' menu link (right, because the user doesn't have the right to 'create' one) but I still want this menu item to appear and i'm redirecting to my custom 403 page that says 'hey, you have to create an account first before posting a classified'. What's the best 'elegant' way to achieve this ?
