There is no standard way that works across all C implementations, but implementation-specific solutions exist. For example, with Microsoft's compiler (see the docs ), __declspec( thread ) int tls_i = 1; makes tls_i live in thread-local storage (each thread has its own separate instance of this variable). With gcc , the syntax is __thread int tls_i; You may also want to check the wikipedia entry on the subject.
