Well I dont know if there is any jquery plugin to do that for you, but google maps API is well documented: http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/basics.html If you want to add a marker to a map when a user click on it, use a listener: google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'click', function(event) { marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position: event.latLng, map: map, draggable: true, title: title }); marker.setMap(map); }); here the coords are available by a property of the event (where the user did click on the map), this comes from the event itself click(overlay:GOverlay, latlng:GLatLng, overlaylatlng:GLatLng) and this latlng is an object of type GLatLng http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/reference.html#GLatLng and the GLatLng class has methods to get the lat and long actual values. var LAT = event.latLng.lat(); var LNG = event.latLng.lng(); All this can look a little overwhelming at the beginning but its just a thing of knowing the type of object, events, methods and properties that are available for each case. If you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript you should do well and there is really no need to do it with a plugin just as @rcravens stated it does not need much wrapping.
