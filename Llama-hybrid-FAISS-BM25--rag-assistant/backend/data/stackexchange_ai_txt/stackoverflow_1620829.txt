Newbie question on Flash video players, products/SDKs, and API

I'm a C programmer and a total newbie to Flash/video/web world. Don't know where/how to start, and so would greatly appreciate your initial help. Question If I need to host flash videos off of my website (instead of embedding YouTube links on my webpages), AND If I need to provide player API like YouTube's that can be used, say, for supporting chromeless player versions customizable via this custom API of mine... THEN What do I need to do essentially...? Write a custom Flash video player? If yes, how? I mean, using which Adobe products / tools / SDKs / language(s)? Is there anything free/opensource available for doing this? Especially, for Linux platform? Write a new browser (firefox) plugin for users visiting my site? Not sure how my custom Flash video player will get to the user visiting my site for the first time? Any books, resources that cover this problem well? Does the Flash content need to hosted off of a Windows server only? Currently lost. Thanks in advance, /SD
