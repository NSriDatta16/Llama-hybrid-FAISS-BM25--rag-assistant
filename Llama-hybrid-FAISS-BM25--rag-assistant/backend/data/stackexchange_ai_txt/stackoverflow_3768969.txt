command line flume throws an error

I want to collect logs from the console with flume, I start flume with the following command: process_which_generates_the_log | flume node_nowatch -1 -n node -c 'node : console | agentBESink("localhost", 12345)' but it says: 10/09/22 13:59:21 INFO agent.FlumeNode: Loading spec from command line: 'node : console | agentBESink("localhost", 12345)' 10/09/22 13:59:21 WARN agent.FlumeNode: Caught exception loading node:Parser error: unexpected 'null' at position -1 line 0: 'node : console | agentBESink("localhost", 12345)' what am I missing? I followed cloudera's howto . it is expected to work isn't it?
