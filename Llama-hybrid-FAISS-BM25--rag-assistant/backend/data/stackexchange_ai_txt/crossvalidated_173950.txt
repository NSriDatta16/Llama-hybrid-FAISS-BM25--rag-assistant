In your case, the package can produce another fit of the model or use linear interpolation. From the documentation of predict.glmnet: If exact=TRUE, and predictions are to made at values of s not included in the original fit, these values of s are merged with object$lambda, and the model is refit before predictions are made. If exact=FALSE (default), then the predict function uses linear interpolation to make predictions for values of s that do not coincide with those used in the fitting algorithm. Note that exact=TRUE is fragile when used inside a nested sequence of function calls. predict.glmnet() needs to update the model, and expects the data used to create it to be around.
