Redirecting so often is blatantly wrong. The ideal maximum number of redirects is 1. In practice it can be a lot easier to do certain tasks if you allow for more than that, but anywhere more than 5 redirects happen should be considered a bug (more than 1 on the same server or more than 3 that crosses to another server should be considered sub-optimal, but not urgent to fix). Browsers can't depend upon servers never doing anything blatantly wrong, so after a few goes they give up to save the user from the server. Sometimes user-agents don't protect themselves in this way (not serious browsers, but it's an easy mistake to make writing a simple piece of HTTP client code). It isn't pretty. To demonstrate just how bad this can be, consider a case where the handler for /somePath/?id=1 redirects to /somePath/?id=2 which redirects to /somePath/?id=3 and so on. For all the server knows, you've just got a more obscure version of that, and will never stop redirecting.
