Interpreting neural networks in terms of generalized linear models?

in a 3-layer (input->hidden->output) feedforward network, the last layer can be interpreted as a generalized linear model (GLM) where the independent variables are the outputs of the hidden neurons. Is it possible to interpret the coeffiecients of this GLM in some meaningful way? A major problem might be that the indpendent variables of the GLM are (transformed) linear combinations of the network input and thus are difficult to use for inference. However, I think that it should still be possible, isn't it? Is there some existing literature which uses/demonstrates this approach?
