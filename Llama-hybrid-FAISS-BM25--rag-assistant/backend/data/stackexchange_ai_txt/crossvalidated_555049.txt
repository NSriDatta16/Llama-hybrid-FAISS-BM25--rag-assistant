extreme event time series R

I'm new into time series and was wondering if there is some implementation in R for decomposing a time series into 'trend', 'extreme value', 'cyclical' and' error'. I'm dealing with yearly weather data so no seasonal component would make sense but acf suggest some cyclical component and extreme values would also be nice to take into account according to proposed models in literature. Because of these characteristics I speculate normal arima like fitting would not do the job.
