I had a similar problem and my problem was with the php code. Try yo have a look there see if the #textarea gets _POST - ed correctly. I am using this and works perfectly for me: //we need to get our variables first $email_to = 'xxxxx@yahoo.com'; //the address to which the email will be sent $name = $_POST['name']; $email = $_POST['email']; $subject = $_POST['subject']; $message = $_POST['message']. "\n\n"; /*the $header variable is for the additional headers in the mail function, we are asigning 2 values, first one is FROM and the second one is REPLY-TO. That way when we want to reply the email gmail(or yahoo or hotmail...) will know who are we replying to. */ $headers = "From: $email\r\n"; $headers .= "Reply-To: $email\r\n"; if(mail($email_to, $subject, $message, $headers)){ echo 'sent'; // we are sending this text to the ajax request telling it that the mail is sent.. }else{ echo 'failed';// ... or this one to tell it that it wasn't sent } Not sure what's going on, like the other user said I believe to be a problem with the way the data is being carried over to the php script. Try to look into $.post and serialize() functions that jquery can offer: to give you an idea: var error = false; var name = $('#name').val(); var email = $('#email').val(); var subject = $('#subject').val(); var message = $('#message').val(); --- Due some checks to see if the info is correct--- if(error == false){ //#contact_form has all the variables that get serialized and sent to the php and you can get a message back to check if everything went okay. $.post("your_php_code.php", $("#contact_form").serialize(),function(result){ //and after the ajax request ends we check the text returned if(result == 'sent'){ //if the mail is sent remove the submit paragraph $('#cf_submit_p').remove(); //and show the mail success div with fadeIn $('#mail_success').fadeIn(500); }else{ //show the mail failed div $('#mail_fail').fadeIn(500); $('#send_message').removeAttr('disabled').attr('value', 'Send The Message'); } });
