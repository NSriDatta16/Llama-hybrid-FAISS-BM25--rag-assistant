Postitive event but unsure when it occurred in time

Morning, I have a lot of data of which I am positive an event (target data / the event I want to predict going forward) occurred within a two week time frame, however I am unsure when it happened within this time frame. I can get daily or more frequent feature data, but the target data only appears in 2 week gaps or in some cases 4 week gaps. Currently I use an average of any feature during the timeframe or gather the feature data on the same day as when the target data is available but is there a more appropriate / better way? I am using the data for machine learning purposes.
