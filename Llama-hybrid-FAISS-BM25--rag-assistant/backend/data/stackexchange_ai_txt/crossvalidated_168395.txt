Conditional logistic regression or GEE in PS matched study

My situation: In a cohort study, I'm trying to find the correlation between outcome & Tx (Arm A vs Arm B). However, baseline covariates are unbalance between different treatment groups. Hence, I use propensity score to balancing the covariates , and create a 1:2 matched data set. My questions : Q(A): After PS method with 1:2 matching, if the covariates are binary , should I use conditional logistic regression method or GEE to check if there are significant covariates difference between Tx groups ? Information I know : Conditional logistic regression applies fixed effects and given the subject specific estimate but GEE gives the population average estimates. for example In a model: Covariate(DM=1) = B * Tx ; If using conditional logistic regression , the result e^ B would imply the odds ratio of Tx-A vs Tx-B to DM=1 if Tx-B is reference group. P value of the Tx parameter would give conclusion if the 2 different tx groups are statistical significantly different. The B is also the subject specific estimate; Q(B): If the above is correct, then I'm quite confused about whats is the population average estimate in the model in GEE ? Thanks a lot for any hint or help ~
