I came up with a workaround using floats, but it's extremely fragile and relies on the actual number of list items you will have. The more digits of numbers, the more you need to increase your margins to account for it. Not to mention it depends on what font you use too. ol.d { counter-reset: item; } ol.d li { float: left; margin-left: 1.5em; } ol.d li:before { clear: both; float: left; margin-left: -1.5em; content: '(' counter(item) ') '; counter-increment: item; } Be sure to clear the floats with whatever element follows your ol . jsFiddle preview
