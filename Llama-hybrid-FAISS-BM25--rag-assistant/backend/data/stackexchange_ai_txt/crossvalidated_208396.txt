I think that this one is just a rough estimate as the following lines states that keeping 20 axes is a lot better than having the 100 initial variables and not that far from 5 (if you kept only the 'good' initial variables). 20 is high enough to ensure capturing the 5 but low enough so that PCA is still a pertinent approach. What I usually do to decide on the number of dimensions to keep is just according to the percentage of inertia I want to keep (95% often times).
