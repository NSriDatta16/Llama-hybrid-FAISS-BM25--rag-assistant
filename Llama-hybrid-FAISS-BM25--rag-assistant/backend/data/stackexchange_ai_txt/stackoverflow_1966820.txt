Pointers, arrays and passing pointers to methods

Confused with the problem here. New to C, as made obvious by the below example: #include #include void pass_char_ref(unsigned char*); int main() { unsigned char bar[6]; pass_char_ref(&bar); printf("str: %s", bar); return 0; } void pass_char_ref(unsigned char *foo) { foo = "hello"; } To my understanding, bar is an unsigned character array with an element size of 6 set away in static storage. I simply want to pass bar by reference to pass_char_ref() and set the character array in that function, then print it back in main().
