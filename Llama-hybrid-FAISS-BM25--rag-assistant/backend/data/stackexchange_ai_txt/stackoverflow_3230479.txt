It might be that the work the browser intrinsically has to do while the window is resized (that is, re-figure the layout in response to the changing window size), added to the DOM changes you're making, is just bogging things down. What you might try is waiting for the user interaction to finish before triggering your code. $(window).resize((function() { var timeout = null; return function() { if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout); timeout = setTimeout(findWidth, 250); }; })()); That'll change things so that your code won't try and do anything until 1/4 second after the user pauses or stops dragging the window around.
