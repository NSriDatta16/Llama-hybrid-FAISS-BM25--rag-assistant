Polymodel on App Engine suggestion

I'm designing a model for a posting system where an entry contains an image with or without a comment. An user can reply to it as either a comment or as an image entry as well. As there can be more properties for ImageEntry, I came up with this design with Polymodel. Not sure if this is the best way to do this. Storage-wise, is CommentEntry less than ImageEntry? Any suggestions would be great. class Entry(polymodel.PolyModel): comment = db.TextProperty() reply_to = db.SelfReferenceProperty() # reference to the entry created_at = properties.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True) updated_at = properties.DateTimeProperty(auto_now=True) class CommentEntry(Entry): created_by = db.ReferenceProperty(User, collection_name='comment_entries') class ImageEntry(Entry): created_by = db.ReferenceProperty(User, collection_name='image_entries') image_url = db.LinkProperty(indexed=False) slug = db.StringProperty(indexed=False)
