If you do not modify the cachedResponse then it will be cached according to the policy in cachedResponse.storagePolicy and cachedResponse.response. One reason you might want to override this is to prevent certain things from being cached. Say you are talking to some REST service that returns security sensitive data that you do not want to have stores in a disk cache on the iPhone. Then you could return a modified cachedResponse with the storagePolicy set to NSURLCacheStorageAllowedInMemoryOnly. Are you just interested in how this works or do you have a problem that you think is related to caching?
