Problem in discrete valued time series forecasting

I have a temporally ordered discrete valued data. The only possible states for the data are: {1,2,3,4,5,6}. So the series is something like {1,2,3,5,6,4,3,5,2,......} I want to forecast the next value of the series based on past data.What are the methods appropriate for this? Now please note that my question is not repetitive. I am aware of this How to model categorical (discrete-valued) time series? Wherein people suggested that a HMM or a Markov model would be appropriate. I searched the site for that, downloaded R packages like HiddenMarkov, hmm.discnp, etc. Esp in the later, I used the Viterbi function given and got the most likely sequence of hidden states that led to the generation of observed states, i.e. data given to it. But that is not what I want! what I want is FUTURE value of the OBSERVED sequence from the PRESENT and PAST values and the Viterbi function does not give that. What is the solution for this? Also, what other methods are useful for which some packages are available? I read about discrete ARMA methods, but not for multi-class data and then also without any implementation. Is this problem really that hard? Please suggest preferably a software implementation or a method.
