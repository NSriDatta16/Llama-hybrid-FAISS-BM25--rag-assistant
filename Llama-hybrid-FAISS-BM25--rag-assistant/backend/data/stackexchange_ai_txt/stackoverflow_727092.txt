Parsing Raw NCover XML file for Coverage Data

I'm trying to extract the coverage data from XML file generated by NCover using C#. The XML file looks something like this: Right now I'm using pattern matching for when there's a value > 0 for c and then looking behind to retrieve the method name, but its really cumbersome. Is there a better way to do this?
