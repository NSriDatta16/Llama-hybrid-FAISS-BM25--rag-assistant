In accordance with whuber's suggestion, I am posting an extended version of some comments that I made on whuber's answer as a separate answer of my own. The experiment consists of players A and B each (independently) tossing their individual coins that turn up Heads with probabilities $p_A$ and $p_B$ respectively. Repeated independent trials of this experiment are performed until at least one of A and B tosses a Head for the first time, at which point the game ends with A the winner if the outcome is $(H,T)$ , B the winner if the outcome is $(T,H)$ , and a tie if the outcome is $(H,H)$ . The game ends on the very first trial on which the outcome is NOT $(T,T)$ . Clearly, if $p_A=p_B=0$ (both players have two-tailed coins), the outcome of each trial is $(T,T)$ and the game never ends, and so to exclude this trivial case, we assume that both $p_A$ and $p_B$ cannot have value $0$ . If exactly one of $p_A$ and $p_B$ has value $0$ , then with $\{X,Y\} = \{A, B\}$ where $p_X = 0$ and $p_Y > 0$ , we can say that Y is guaranteed to win the game (ties are impossible), and it takes an average of $\frac{1}{p_Y}$ trials for Y to actually win the game by tossing a Head. So, assuming that $p_A > 0$ , $p_B > 0$ , the game is guaranteed to end in a finite number of trials (cf. whuber's answer cited above). Because of independence, we can ignore all trials on which $(T,T)$ is the outcome and concentrate on the very first trial on which the outcome $(T,T)$ does not occur meaning that the outcome is necessarily either $(H,T)$ in which case A wins, or $(T,H)$ in which case B wins, or $(H,H)$ in which case there is a tie. Note that the game ends at this point. So, all previous trials (if any) have resulted in $(T,T)$ and the current trial is the very first one on which the outcome is not $(T,T)$ . Since the game ends at this point, there are no future trials to consider. Given that the event $\{(H,T), (T,H), (H,H)\}$ has occurred, what is the conditional probability that the outcome is $(H,T)$ and so A wins? the conditional probability that the outcome is $(T,H)$ and so B wins? the conditional probability that the outcome is $(H,H)$ and so the game ends in a tie? We have \begin{align} P((H,T)\mid (T,T)^c) &= \frac{P(H,T)}{P(\text{at least one of A and B tosses a Head})}\\ &= \frac{p_A(1-p_B)}{p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B}\tag{1}\\ &= P(\text{A wins}),\\ P((T,H)\mid (T,T)^c) &= \frac{P(T,H)}{P(\text{at least one of A and B tosses a Head})}\\ &= \frac{p_B(1-p_A)}{p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B}\tag{2}\\ &= P(\text{B wins}),\\ P((H,H)\mid (T,T)^c) &= \frac{P(H,H)}{P(\text{at least one of A and B tosses a Head})}\\ &= \frac{p_Ap_B}{p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B}\tag{3}\\ &= P(\text{game is tied}). \end{align} But, as whuber cogently asked earlier, why am I claiming that the conditional probabilities computed in $(1), (2)$ , and $(3)$ (note that they add up to $1$ ) are respectively equal to the unconditional probabilities of A winning, B winning, and the game being tied? Well, the game ends on the trial being considered and we are just looking at the reduced sample space $\Omega^\prime = \{(H,T), (T,H), (H,H)\}$ and the conditional probability measure that assigns the probabilities given by $(1), (2)$ , and $(3)$ to these outcomes. Alternatively, consider the mutually exclusive events $C= \{H,T)\}$ and $D = \{(T,H),(H,H)\}$ . It is a standard result in probability theory that on a sequence of independent trials, the (unconditional) probability that $C$ occurs before $D$ does (and so A wins) is given by \begin{align}P(\text{C occurs before D}) &= \frac{P(C)}{P(C)+P(D)}\\ &= \frac{p_A(1-p_B)}{p_A(1-p_B) + p_B((1-p_A) + p_Ap_B}\\ &= \frac{p_A(1-p_B)}{p_A + p_B - p_Ap_B} \end{align} which is the same value as in $(1)$ . The careful but incredulous reader is invited to work out the other cases similarly to verify that right sides of $(2)$ and $(3)$ do indeed give the respective unconditional probabilities of B winning, and of the game ending in a tie.
