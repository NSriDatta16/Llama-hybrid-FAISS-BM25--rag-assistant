CLT states gives you a distribution for sum/average of random variables when the number of random variables goes to infinity. However additional assumptions must be met, depending on the version of CLT you can use. Lindeberg-Levy CLT requires independent and identically distributed samples with finite expected value and variance. Other versions like Lyapunov CLT requires only independent samples and some criteria, but it does not need identical samples. One of the key assumptions is independence which is maintained in all versions of CLT. I think is reasonable to suspect some non zero covariance between values, as they depend on time.
