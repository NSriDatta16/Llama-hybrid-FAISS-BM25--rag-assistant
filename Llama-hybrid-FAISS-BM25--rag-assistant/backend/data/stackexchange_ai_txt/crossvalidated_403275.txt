That cryptic initialism i.i.d. is the key; it stands for independent and identically distributed which says to the cognoscenti that Every random variable in the process/time series has the same distribution, and so for any given distinct integers $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ and any $k \in \mathbb Z$ , the $2n$ random variables $A_{t_1}, A_{t_2}, \ldots, A_{t_n}, A_{t_1-k}, A_{t_2-k}, \ldots, A_{t_n-k}$ all have the same distribution. The random variables $A_{t_1}, A_{t_2}, \ldots, A_{t_n}$ are independent , and so their joint distribution is just the product of their $n$ identical marginal distributions. Similarly, $A_{t_1-k}, A_{t_2-k}, \ldots, A_{t_n-k}$ are also independent and since the have the same marginal distributions as the $A_{t_1}, A_{t_2}, \ldots, A_{t_n}$ , the joint distribution of $A_{t_1-k}, A_{t_2-k}, \ldots, A_{t_n-k}$ , which is the product of their marginal distributions, is the same as the joint distribution of $A_{t_1}, A_{t_2}, \ldots, A_{t_n}$ .
