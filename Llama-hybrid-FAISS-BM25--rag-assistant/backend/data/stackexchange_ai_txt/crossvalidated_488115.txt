As a personal rule of thumb I begin by applying simple statistical models (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) because they require less computations and are generally more interpretable. Moreover, there exist automated packages (such as the forecast package) that take care the task of model selection. Generally, I would expect better predictive performance by applying advanced machine learning algorithms, especially when there are a lot of external predictors. However, there is no guarantee about that. In any case, you have to consider how much time you want to devote in constructing a model, hyperparameter tuning, etc.
