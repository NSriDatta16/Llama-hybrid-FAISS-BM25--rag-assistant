R: Can I use percentages instead of counts in a chi-squared & pairwise test?

I have count data with a corresponding time and place of each count, but my research question is about proportions. Is it valid to run a chi-squared test on percentages rather than count data? I'm also asking because I don't understand some of the results. For example, "Whipray" in 2016 (value of 43.75000) is "higher than expected value" (Residuals: 4.23 and statistically significant: 0.00027), but the next value (58.33) in 2017 is not higher than expected...just confused why a lower observed value would be significant and a higher observed value than the previous wouldn't be. Contingency table of my data: library(chisq.posthoc.test) > table Year Zone 2016 2017 2018 Crocodile 0 8 2 Rankin 3 17 8 West 7 31 17 Whipray 4 4 0 Same data (as average % of total count): > table2 Year Zone 2016 2017 2018 Crocodile 0.00000 41.66700 28.57143 Rankin 27.27273 33.92857 13.23656 West 23.91304 42.64676 36.01179 Whipray 43.75000 58.33333 0.00000 > chisq.test(table2) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: table X-squared = 76.958, df = 6, p-value = 1.516e-14 > chisq.posthoc.test(table2, method = "bonferroni") Dimension Value 2016 2017 2018 1 Crocodile Residuals -5.727856 1.6457246 4.146400 2 Crocodile p values 0.000000 1.0000000 0.000405 3 Rankin Residuals 2.068596 -0.9662472 -1.050602 4 Rankin p values 0.463008 1.0000000 1.000000 5 West Residuals -1.046354 -2.1617513 3.716144 6 West p values 1.000000 0.3676480 0.002427 7 Whipray Residuals 4.233146 1.5844252 -6.429553 8 Whipray p values 0.000277 1.0000000 0.000000
