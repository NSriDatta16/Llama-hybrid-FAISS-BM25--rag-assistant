By definition ga:organicSearches will almost never have any matches for ga:adContent (edge cases aside). ga:adContent is for the content of an advertisement, where ga:organicSearches is for organic search result visits within a session (like if you use Google multiple times within the same session to try to find something specific on a site). Don't use it for anything besides trying to measure that particular phenomenon. Try not to use an SQL mindframe here; Google Analytics doesn't use SQL on the backend, so the notions you have of traditional relationships aren't applicable. IIRC, they use a few things, amongst them a BigTable variant , which is a NoSQL-type database. From a Google Paper on BigTable from 2006 : We briefly describe two of the tables used by Google Analytics. The raw click table ( ̃200 TB) maintains a row for each end-user session. The row name is a tuple containing the website’s name and the time at which the session was created. This schema ensures that sessions that visit the same web site are contiguous, and that they are sorted chronologically. This table compresses to 14% of its original size. The summary table ( ̃20 TB) contains various predefined summaries for each website. This table is generated from the raw click table by periodically scheduled MapReduce jobs. Each MapReduce job extracts recent session data from the raw click table. The overall system’s throughput is limited by the throughput of GFS. This table compresses to 29% of its original size. If you want the lowest common denominator for a metric for a list of all dimensions, use ga:pageviews .
