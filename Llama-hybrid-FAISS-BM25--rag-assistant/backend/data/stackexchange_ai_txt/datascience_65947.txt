How to build a OCR for reading text from image?

This is my first time working on a OCR application. I have lot of scanned images of English text-book pages like this and I want to build a OCR using DL to extract the text from each image . Can anyone outline just the approach I need to take to implement it? There are few questions that I couldn't figure out: 1) How do I need to do it? I mean I don't have any target label (or) annotations (or) bounding box. 2) What will be my target label be here? Do I need target label? 3) Is it possible to do un-supervised learning. If so How? 4) What are CRNN algorithms I need to check out to implement it? Not looking for any api's (or) libraries (like teserract, vision-api etc..).
