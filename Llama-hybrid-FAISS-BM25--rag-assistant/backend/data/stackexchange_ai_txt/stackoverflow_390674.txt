"because they can" seriously, it's called the "Free Market". check it out! EDIT: [sigh] it's a shame that so many drive-by downvoters have no sense of humor...and no grasp of economics. So let me explain: one theory is "linux is free, windows costs money." While true, that doesn't explain the difference, since windows is a fixed cost. what does explain the difference is the free market . - One could argue that the typical linux user is a cheapskate is unwilling to pay much for hosting services because they know the software being used for hosting didn't cost the host anything, while the typical windows user is a sucker is willing to pay more for hosting services because they know the software being used for hosting costs the host money. but in reality, since the cost of the hardware, software, and typically even the bandwidth capacity is a fixed cost, the above just doesn't hold water - the relative fixed costs of the hosts is irrelevant for larger-scale hosting companies so the price becomes whatever the target market is willing to pay, balanced by how good the host is at presenting their quality and other 'added value' propositions. For example, i used to host my site on a cheap LAMP host because it was just some static html. When the site went to e-commerce I researched the 'free' e-commerce packages offered by the inexpensive host and discovered that they all had serious security flaws and so decided to use asp.net and write my own e-commerce code since (a) I know asp.net, (b) I needed to learn how to do that anyway, and (c) i trust my code more than anyone else's [or at least if there is a flaw in my code I have someone easily accessible to blame!]. The difference is hosting plans was a few dollars a month . The new host's uptime seems to be better, but some of their tech support is lame and they are missing some obvious features but nothing i can't work around (without paying more somewhere else) so in the end i'm happy to pay a bit more. The host i chose is not the cheapest, and they're not the most expensive. And i spent about ten minutes doing the research because for my site it just wasn't that important . which brings up the next economic point: if the average programmer costs $50/hour, how cost-effective is it to use said programmer's time to complain about $7/month in hosting fees? in summary, the answer is: the free market. EDIT 2: Here are some windows server license prices These certainly look like one-time fixed costs to me, but even if this was a yearly fee it still pales in comparison to the cost of the hardware and bandwidth for a hosting service. The relationship between license cost and hosting cost is indirect at best, and is essentially irrelevant compared to market pressures. But please don't take any programmer's word for it, ask a hosting provider . cost breakdown for hosting services Addendum: MS-SQL licenses do cost additional $$$ so that may be a factor
