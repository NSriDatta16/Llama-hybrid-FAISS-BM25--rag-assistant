Zero-heavy dataset with proportional independant variable

I am examining the effect of a binary variable (rural vs urban) on my dependant variable (total mileage expense). Essentially, a person (n) will do X amount of trips in one year, and Y trips will be to rural areas, and Z trips will be to an urban area. So the variables I have for each person (n) are essentially: Total Mileage Expense, Y(Rural Trips), Z(Urban Trips), and X(Total Trips) I am trying to find the average Mileage expense for an Urban trip and the average Mileage expense for Rural. I have tried using the proportion of Rural Trips to Total trips as my independent variable and the Average Mileage expense as dependant but I was not sure how to specify the model. Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated, I am not very statistically inclined. Also note that Y(Rural Trips) is zero-heavy, with approx. 50% having value of 0. Thanks!
