Basically kluged this together, but it seems to work okay when comparing it to last season's data. I was using last season's data to make the avg, med, stdv. Just kind of started with the regular values and modified weights and things until it looked right. Quick and dirty until you or anyone else on here gets to the elegant solution. MAX(0,ROUND(NORM.INV((RAND() 0.95+RAND() 0.05),RANDBETWEEN(avg 0.55,avg 0.9)+avg-med,stdv+(avg-med)),0)))
