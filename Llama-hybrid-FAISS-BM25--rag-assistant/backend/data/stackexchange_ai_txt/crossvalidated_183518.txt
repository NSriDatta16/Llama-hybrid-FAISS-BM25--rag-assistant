Calculate p trends

The following table shows the averages of the response variables var1, var2, var3 with respect to the explanatory variable divided in quartiles. Explanatory variable (Quartiles) Response variables Q1 It has been suggested to add an extra column showing the p trends...I know what is the p value, but I have never heard "p-trend"...what is that? Any idea how to calculate using Matlab? Thanks
