Yes, you can re-randomize if for whatever reason your randomization is not successful. This is called re-randomization. Asymptotic theory is developed by Li, Ding, and Rubin (2018) and an introduction is presented in Morgan and Rubin (2015) . Typically this is done with the intention of balancing covariates better rather than balancing the sample sizes. With a study of $n$ units, the probability that all $n$ will be in a single treatment group is $2^{1-n}$ . For a sample of 10, this is less than 2 in a thousand; for a sample of 20, this is less than 2 in a million, making this an issue of little concern in applied research. An alternative is to use random allocation where you have $n/2$ balls of two colors each and draw them from an urn without replacement, in which case you will still have random assignment with a treatment probability of .5 but you can guarantee balanced samples. This does induce dependence among the units, but as long as their order is randomized, it doesn't matter. Asymptotic theory may differ for this type of design, though (and I don't know enough about that to comment).
