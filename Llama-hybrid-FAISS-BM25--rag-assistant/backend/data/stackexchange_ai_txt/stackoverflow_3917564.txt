Is there anything out there that will make it easy for me to allow my users to share their Facebook photos (and videos) on my site?

I see a bunch of .NET open source projects out there that look to be able to get at the users information, but I just want a user to be able to "post" media that's already on Facebook on my site as well. Other websites seem to allow you to do embedding of their media (I'm really liking oEmbed) but FB seems a bit of a mystery to me. I have no experience using their API, but I'm guessing it has something to do with the "social graph" part. Anyone else done this before? Did you use something or is this easy enough to do without these OS projects? Any examples anywhere of how someone already did this? I wouldn't think that I'm the first person to want to do this but have searched Google and didn't come up with anything.
