Whats the difference between logistic regression and fractional response model?

Can anyone tell me the theory behind fractional response model, how it really works? I wonder if the logistic regression works only with binary variable {0,1}, why when conducting a GLM with quasibinomial family on fractional variable [0-1], it gave me same results in the estimates as the fractional response model?
