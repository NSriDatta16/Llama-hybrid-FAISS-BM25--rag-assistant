You're exceeding the precision offered by type Double , i.e. 8 bytes. It isn't really that division auto-rounds things to 2 decimal places; it's just that your 3rd+ decimal places have nowhere to go and are therefore rounded out. One solution is to use type Decimal , which offers 14 bytes of storage space. Dim r As Decimal r = 106681252129194) / 16 ' r = 6667578258074.625 Note: The above is for VB. In VBA and VBScript, the Decimal type is only accessible within a Variant . You can't directly declare a variable of type Decimal ; you have to create a Variant and then make its subtype Decimal using the CDec function: Dim r r = CDec(106681252129194) / CDec(16) ' r = 6667578258074.625 It's still good to be cautious... Decimal will give you 28-29 significant figures, while Double gives you only 14-15. On the other hand, Double gives you the flexibility of a power of 10 between -324 and +308 as in the scientific notation, while with Decimal you're stuck with straight notation, no powers of 10.
