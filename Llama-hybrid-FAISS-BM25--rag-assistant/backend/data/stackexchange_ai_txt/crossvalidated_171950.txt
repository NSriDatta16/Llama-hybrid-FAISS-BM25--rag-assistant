Extracting spatial covariance given only mean and variance

I have the results of an MCMC experiment in the form of a set of means $\mu(\phi,\theta)$ and standard deviations $\sigma(\phi,\theta)$ as a function of spatial coordinates $\phi$ and $\theta$ (in this case latitude and longitude). Unfortunately, the actual distribution that generated these maps was not saved due to space constraints. Is it possible to use this data to get a decent estimate of spatial covariance (perhaps by assuming a particular form for the spatial covariance), and if so, how?
