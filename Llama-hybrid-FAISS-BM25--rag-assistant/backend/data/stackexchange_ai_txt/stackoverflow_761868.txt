I've had some problems before with one combination of Xdebug & PHPUnit (as did others, from a report I say on devzone.zend.com at the time), but that was a while ago. PHPUnit does explicitly support Xdebug though - and I'm using it to produce code coverage reports for my own systems. I'd suggest the fairly standard debugging techniques, updating any versions you can (maybe even PHP?) commenting out the @setExpectedException, or throwing it explicitly - and of course, making sure that you have full warnings and errors being shown with error_reporting(E_ALL|E_STRICT); set on. Don't forget to stop and restart the Apache server to make sure that the Xdebug module is loaded as well.
