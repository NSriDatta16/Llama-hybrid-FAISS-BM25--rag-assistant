How to deal with categorical dependent variable with more than 2 categories?

I've been struggling to understand how to approach this problem. Problem Description I have $n$ features that describe a dog race such as: Final time First bend time Track Grade My dependent variable is the FINAL POSITION that could be from 1st place to 6th place. What I need to predict Given my training data and features and $m$ past dog races, I need to predict the dependent variable $y$ , that is, a dog's final position (1st to 6th). WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND How should I approach the dependent variable $y$ ? The first model I created: instead of using 6 possible outcomes for a race (1st to 6th), I divided my dependent variable into WINNER and LOSER . That is: if dog has finished 1st: $y = 1$ if dog has finished 2nd to 6th, $y = 0$ In this simple case I have a dependent variable like: $y = [ 1, 1, 0, ... , 0, 1]$ BUT: What if I want to predict every position? If I use 1: 1st, 2: 2nd, 3: 3rd ... 6:6th but as I read from this topic: How to deal with categorical features in machine learning models? assigning "6" and "1" to a variable is not recommended. Because that encoding indicates that the 6th place is 6 times greater than 1st place, which is not true. How should I handle my dependent variable?? Is it possible to have a multidimensional dependent variable $y$ ? Something like $n \times 6$ ?
