I"m sure you can see that this is happening because you are overriding a method that was previously defined on a super class. and by doing so means that the events are not being called. have you tried calling [super touchesBegan]? that way all upstream stuff is handled. and you can override the swipe gesture. or another option is to call the delegate when the touch is detected in your own touches method. something like (you will probably have implementations of the other touch events as well) -(void) touchesBegan { //logic to detect tap only. [tablecell.delegate didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(some way to determin touched row)] }
