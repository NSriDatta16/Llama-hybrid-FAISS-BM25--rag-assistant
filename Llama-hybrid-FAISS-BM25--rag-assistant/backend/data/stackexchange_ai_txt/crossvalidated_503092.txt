heteroskedasticity and logistic regression

I have cross sectional data and am using logistic regression. My question is how do I check my data for heteroskedasticity and in case it is present, then how to deal with it in Stata. I have come across a lot of information using linear regression along with the Breusch-Pagan Test (using command - hettest) or Whiteâ€™s Test (using command - imtest) for testing for heteroskedasticity. And heteroskedasticity is dealt with by computation of - Robust Standard Errors. However, there is less information on this issue in case of logistic regression.
