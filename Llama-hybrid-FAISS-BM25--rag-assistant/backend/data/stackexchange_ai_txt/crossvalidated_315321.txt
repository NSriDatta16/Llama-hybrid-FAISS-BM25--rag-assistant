Huge forecast intervals on differenced time series?

I'm forecasting 12 periods h=12 using an ETS() model on a time series that I integrated using a first difference diff() (because the time series are non-stationary). Once I get my forecast, I revert back to the "undifferenced" form by doing the following: y where I know that h0 is my last observed value before the forecast, of 329.50. The data frame x of the original integrated forecasts obtained by ETS() that I am using is the following: x However, once I get the "undifferenced" values, the forecast interval values are ridiculous, it cannot be normal (see the plot below)? Some values are even negative, which does not make sense as I am forecasting a stock's closing price. Am I missing something? Thank you.
