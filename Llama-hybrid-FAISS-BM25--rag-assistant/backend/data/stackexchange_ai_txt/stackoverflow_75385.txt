Make VS compiler catch signed/unsigned assignments?

The Visual Studio compiler does not seem to warn on signed/unsigned assignments, only on comparisons. For example the code below will generate a warning on the if statement but not the initial assignments. Is there anyway to make it catch these? I'm already at W4 but thought (hoped) there may be another setting somewhere. Thanks, int foo(void) { unsigned int fooUnsigned = 0xffffffff; int fooSigned = fooUnsigned; // no warning if (fooSigned Update: Quamrana is right, this is controlled by warning 4365 which appears to be off by default, even at W4. However you can explicitly enable it for a given warning level like so; #pragma warning (4 : 4365) Which results in; warning C4365: 'initializing' : conversion from 'unsigned int' to 'int', signed/unsigned mismatch
