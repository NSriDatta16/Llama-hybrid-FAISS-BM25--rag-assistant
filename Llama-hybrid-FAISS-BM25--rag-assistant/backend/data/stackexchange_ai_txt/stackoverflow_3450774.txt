First of all I would be recommend you to use userdata to save and additional information to the jqGrid. The data saved in userdata can be absolutely free. It can be for example an array with you HTML code fragments or an object with ResourceRequestID values as properties and the corresponding HTML code fragments as the value. So with jQuery("RequestGrid").getGridParam('userData') you can get the reference to the data any time and with userData parameter you can set the data directly for a new jqGrid. The main advantage of the usage of userData is that the data will be not placed somewhere as a part of HTML code like you do this now. So the data will be not encoded in any way and it can have any contain without restrictions. If you want to refresh the data in jqGrid you can either just use jQuery("RequestGrid").trigger("reloadGrid") or get the grid data with jQuery("RequestGrid").getGridParam('data') , then create new grid with data as a parameter and datatype: 'local' . Then you can change datatype from 'local' to 'json' after the grid is created (if you really want to have 'json' and not 'local' grid). It can be a simple way to duplicate the data. Moreover, I am not sure, but probably the usage of loadone: true can be interesting for you (look at JqGrid Reload not working if you decide to use this).
