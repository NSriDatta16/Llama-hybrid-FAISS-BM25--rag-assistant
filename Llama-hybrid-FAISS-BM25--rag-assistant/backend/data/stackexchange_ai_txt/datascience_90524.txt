While decision trees have a natural resistance to outliers, boosted trees are susceptible, since new trees are built off the residual. Normalization, or even just a log transform, will give you better protection from outliers. For an XGB model that is planned to go into production, I recommend doing it. It's not like one can interpret the output anyway. I think of XGBoost as being on the black box side.
