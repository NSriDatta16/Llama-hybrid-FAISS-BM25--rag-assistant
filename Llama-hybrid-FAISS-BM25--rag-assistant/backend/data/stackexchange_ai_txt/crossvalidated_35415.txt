I am working mostly with biological data, samples from humans and animals. Sometimes also cell cultures. It's in the -omics area so the ration of variables to observations is generally high (about 1:1, it's not genomics). So for visualization the usual techniques like PCA and PLS are very imporant. There is also a large amount of standard linear modelling, where a problem is that we usually do not have the data to model the covariance structures and when we look at the response variables univariately we do not have the time to look at each model seperately, so we have to automate model selection and diagnostics as much as possible. Finally, classification is also an imporant topic since diagnostic questions is often what brings customers to us.
