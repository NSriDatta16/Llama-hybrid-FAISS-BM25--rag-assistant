You can do it using Java's serialization mechanism, but beware that serialization is not a good solution for long-term persistent storage of objects. The reason for this is that serialized objects are very tightly coupled to your Java code: if you change your program, then the serialized data files become unreadable, because they are not compatible anymore with your Java code. Serialization is good for temporary storage (for example for an on-disk cache) or for transferring objects over a network. For long-term storage, you should use a standard and well-documented format (for example XML, JSON or something else) that is not tightly coupled to your Java code. If, for some reason, you absolutely want to use a binary format, then there are several options available, for example Google protocol buffers or Hessian .
