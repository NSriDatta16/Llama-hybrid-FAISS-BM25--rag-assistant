Space and Time Estimation Of Xmlparsing

I have to develope a function which will take string (xml string) as input and return parsed result (in object format). I am new to C# .Net so from net I find out that there are number of ways to do this: Xml Serialization Xml TextReader XmlDocument XDocument (and so on) I wanted to know which way is better (in terms of time and space) considering that every second this function has to parse on and average 10-20 string (of avg 1000-2000 characters).
