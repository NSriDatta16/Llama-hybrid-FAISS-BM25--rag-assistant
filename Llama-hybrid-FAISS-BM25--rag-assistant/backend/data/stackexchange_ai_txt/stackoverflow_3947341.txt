help with understanding the logic behind how javascript executes on new dom elements being created on the fly

I have a this set up item 1 my js let me make them sortable and what not, one feature I have is that via ajax i can create a new list item on the fly. But whats interesting is that I have a hoverIntent letting me hover over the list item and a delete and edit icon appears letting me perform the intended actions. My problem is that when I make a new list item on the fly the hoverIntent isn't applied to it. The code created is identical to the other list items, I know it works because when I refresh the page and reload the js then the hoverIntent kicks in and applies the hover effects to the new items created. None of this works on the fly tho, how can I make this work? my js for creating a new list item is: var timestamp = 0; $('.new-group').click(function(e){ // Only one group per 5 seconds is allowed: if((new Date()).getTime() - timestamp I'm betting that in my success function is where I can make this work, you can log in and see my problem at www.helixagent.com with login as test/password go into the Contacts tabs and click on the + icon to make a new group
