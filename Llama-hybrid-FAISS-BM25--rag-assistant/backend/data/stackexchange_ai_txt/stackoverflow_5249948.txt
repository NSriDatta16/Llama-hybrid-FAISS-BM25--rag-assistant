Is returning a reference for accessor idiomatic?

In C++, it is possible to create an accessor which returns a reference to a private field. class Cls { private: int _attr; public: int& attr() { return _attr; } }; such that the attribute can be accessed as such: // set c.attr() = 4; // get cout Is this style of accessor idiomatic/good practice? Would an average C++ programmer be surprised seeing this style of accessor? (Hint: I was surprised the first time I saw this, but kind of liked the style)
