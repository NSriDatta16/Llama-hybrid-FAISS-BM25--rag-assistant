What are the Amazon Kindle User Agent strings?

What are the valid Amazon Kindle User Agent strings? Are they different for each model of the kindle? Update: just got this one off the new wi-fi only kindle: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; en-US) AppleWebKit/528.5+ (KHTML, like Gecko, Safari/528.5+) Version/4.0 Kindle/3.0 (screen 600x800; rotate)
