SQL Server 2005 - Multiple Databases

We are using SQL Server 2005 at work and when development started it was decided that multiple databases would be created. For example, we have one database for Individual say dbIndividual and another one for Translation say dbLocale. So far this has simplified the backing up and potential restore greatly as we just need to backup what we need (unless there's a way to backup/restore a schema only that we don't know of.) This cause us to have multiple queries with JOINS over multiple database table and files. for example: select customer.firstname, address.addressL1, addressType.value from dbIndividual.dbo.customer inner join dbIndividual.dbo.address on fkCustomerID = iCustomerID inner join dbLocale.translation.addressType on fkAddressTypeID = iAddressTypeID and fkLangID = 1 Is there any drawback to this? Beside the obvious that we can't enforce data integrity across multiple db. Will it slow things down when joining since the data is potentially on totally different part of the disk? Reason I am asking is because we are in the middle of reorganizing our infrastructure and this is one potential issue that kept popping up.
