You can store any object in a SharedObject , but you need to register the class first: You can store typed ActionScript instances in shared objects. You do this by calling the flash.net.registerClassAlias() method to register the class. If you create an instance of your class and store it in the data member of your shared object and later read the object out, you will get a typed instance. By default, the SharedObject objectEncoding property supports AMF3 encoding, and unpacks your stored instance from the SharedObject object; the stored instance retains the same type you specified when you called the registerClassAlias() method. One caveat is that storing object graphs can sometimes lead to storage issues. There is a limit to how much you can store in SharedObject before it notifies the user and asks for permission to store more. This threshold is 100k by default, I believe.
