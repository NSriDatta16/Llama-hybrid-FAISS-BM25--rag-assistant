perhaps this can give you an idea: http://www.jsfiddle.net/dimitar/stthk/ (extracted it from another menu class I am working on and modded for delay for you as an example) basically several interesting bits: options: { showDelay: 500, hideDelay: 500 }, defines your delays on mouseover and out. and then the bind for mouseenter deferred via .delay(): mouseenter: function() { $clear(_this.timer); _this.timer = (function() { this.retrieve("fold").setStyle("display", "block"); }).delay(_this.options.showDelay, this); }, mouseleave: function() { $clear(_this.timer); _this.timer = (function() { this.retrieve("fold").setStyle("display", "none"); }).delay(_this.options.hideDelay, this); } _this.timer is a shared var that handles the deferred function - it gets cleared up on either mouseout or mouseover. if no event that matters takes place within the allotted time period, it will change the display accordingly, else, it will cancel the function. this is for mootools 1.2.5 btw (storage system + elment delegation) but the principle remains the same for the bits that matter.
