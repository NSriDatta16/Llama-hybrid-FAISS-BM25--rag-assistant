How to train and validate a neural network model in R?

I am new to modeling with neural networks, but I managed to establish a neural network with all available data points that fits the observed data well. The neural network was done in R with the nnet package: require(nnet) ##33.8 is the highest value mynnet.fit The data I am analyzing looks as follows, where the DOC is the variable that has to be modeled (there are about 17,000 observations): Q GW_level Temp t_sum DOC 1 0.045 0.070 12.50 0.2 11.17 2 0.046 0.070 12.61 0.4 11.09 3 0.046 0.068 12.66 2.8 11.16 4 0.047 0.050 12.66 0.4 11.28 5 0.049 0.050 12.55 0.6 11.45 6 0.050 0.048 12.45 0.4 11.48 Now, I have read that the model should be trained with 70% of the data points, and validated with the remaing 30% of the data points. How do I do this? Which functions do I have to use? I used the train function from the caret package to calculate the parameters for size and decay. require(caret) my.grid Any direct help or linkage to other websites/posts is greatly appreciated.
