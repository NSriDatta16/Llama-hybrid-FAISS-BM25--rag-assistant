Clustering of unlabeled ship images

I want to create a ship detection classifier from a dataset that is formed by 4000 photos(3072*2048). But the dataset that i currently have is not labeled so i can feed it to a cnn .So i want to cluster this dataset to 2 labels(or 2 directories) ship and no_ship .I tried running k-means but the results were dissapointing.Is some other more functional way to do this?
