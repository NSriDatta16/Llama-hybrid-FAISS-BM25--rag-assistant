PET does support UTF-8, depending on how it was configured when compiled. In addition to the wiki page, also take a look or post a question to the mailing list . Several input methods do exist, I would recommend FSC (XML) or YY(s-exp) for being the most modern. Im unaware of any short tutorials, but you could also look at Heart of Gold for a complete end-to-end NLP package, where PET is a component. Are you parsing with the ERG?
