Is there any deep learning work using unit norm constraints?

I am currently trying to develop an architecture that could benefit from a unit norm constraint on the convolutional weights. I saw in keras docs , that this constraint was available. Therefore I wondered if any work had used it before, so that I can see how they used it and if they had any difficulty using it (I didn't find any googling it, the paper on weights normalization actually being reparametrization). I am especially asking because I had tried before without using the constraint, instead implementing a custom callback normalizing the weights. Training was very inefficient, and I think it's mainly because the Adam optimizer isn't optimized for projected gradient descent as explained in this maths SE answer .
