Stick to INT for this one, DEFFINITELY INT (OR BIGINT) Have a look at int, bigint, smallint, and tinyint (Transact-SQL) Integer (whole number) data from -2^31 (-2,147,483,648) through 2^31 - 1 (2,147,483,647). Storage size is 4 bytes, bigint (whole number) data from -2^63 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808) through 2^63-1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807). Storage size is 8 bytes. compared to char and varchar Fixed-length non-Unicode character data with length of n bytes. n must be a value from 1 through 8,000. Storage size is n bytes. Also, once you query against this, you will have degraded performance if you use ints compared to your char column, as SQL Server will have to do as cast for you...
