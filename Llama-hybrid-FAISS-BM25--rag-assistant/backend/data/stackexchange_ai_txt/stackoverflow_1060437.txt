The same rule is working fine on my server. The problem should be something else. I added the same rule on my server and I get the following redirect http://mysite.com/services/agents/foo?foo=bar => https://services.mysite.com/agents/?foo=bar Please note that you don't need to add the QSA flag since the target doesn't include any query string. This article might contain some useful information to help you dealing with Htaccess and Query String.
