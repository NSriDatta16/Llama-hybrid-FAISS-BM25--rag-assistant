p-value and standard error of logistic regression betas calculated from reciprocal of odds ratio

I am trying to double check whether beta values calculated from odds ratios and beta values calculated from the reciprocal of the same odds ratios have the same p-values and standard errors (I am calculating them from same population and using logistic regression). Regarding standard errors I have already found a question on here ( What is the standard error of the inverse of a known odds ratio? ) but I am not sure of the reliability of the answer. I have tried to verify this using statistical software plink and it looks that p-values and SEs stay the same (or very similar, differing only after a few decimal points) for both original betas and betas calculated from reciprocal of odds ratios. If anyone has any mathematical/statistical explanation it would be great.
