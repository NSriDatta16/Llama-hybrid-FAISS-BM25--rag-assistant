Evaluating results of VAR (Vector Autoregression) using R

I am trying to evaluate the results of a prediction obtained with the R function VAR. I have reproduced an example with two time series so that others can also implement it (the data set is read from a url). After seeing the code, I have several questions: When I use ndiff, I find different integration for the two variables (0 and 1), this causes a problem when using the function VARselect. For this reason, I have decreased the window size. Is this a correct approach? (see flag 1) After applying several statistical test,I only consider cases with no autocorrelation AND when a granger test of causality is passed. How can I prove that predicting with two time series is better than one time series? Should I compare with AR? How can I show this? Could someone tell me how to plot the comparison? (see flag 2) How does the predict function work? In my case, the granger test is passed for "views granger cause unemployment." When I use predict, are the values of the "views" used in the prediction of the unemployment (in this case 5 months) similarly to when you use exogenous regressors? Should I do this? How? Should I consider any other test for VAR? At this time, I am only using VAR, later on I will consider other models. Thanks. rm(list=ls()) library(vars) library(forecast) library(lubridate) library(fUnitRoots) library(urca) library(vars) library(aod) library(zoo) library(tseries) paired.ds 0 ns.unemp 0) { print(sprintf("Found seasonality in unemployment of %s", ns.unemp)) s.unemployment 0 ns.views 0) { print(sprintf("Found seasonality in viewst of %s", ns.views)) s.views 0 if (lag.unemployment >0){ print(sprintf("Found integration in unemployment of %s", lag.unemployment)) d.unemployment = diff(d.unemployment, lag=lag.unemployment) } #### Integraate of ndiffs > 0 lag.views = ndiffs(s.views, alpha = 0.05, test = c("adf")) d.views = s.views if (lag.views >0){ print(sprintf("Found integration in views of %s", lag.views)) d.views = diff(d.views, lag=lag.views) } #Model 2 #### Make it stationary model2.ts 0.05 if(p.value$serial$p.value > 0.05) { ### Test for Granger causality ### It is is a statistical concept of causality that is based on prediction. According to Granger causality, ### if a signal X1 "Granger-causes" (or "G-causes") a signal X2, then past values of X1 should contain information that helps predict #### X2 above and beyond the information contained in past values of X2 alone ### does unemployment causes views? ---> NO result F)`[2] YES result F)`[2]
