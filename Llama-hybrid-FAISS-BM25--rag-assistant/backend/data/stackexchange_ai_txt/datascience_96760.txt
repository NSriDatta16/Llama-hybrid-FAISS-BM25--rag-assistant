I would recommend you to use German Bert for embeddings: https://huggingface.co/bert-base-german-cased Together with a cosine similarity, like described in this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/keyword-extraction-with-bert-724efca412ea Bert is very powerful to extract knowledge from text efficiently, I used to reach extraordinary results thanks to that library.
