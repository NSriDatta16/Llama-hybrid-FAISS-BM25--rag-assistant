Problem while building a .dll (Visual C++)

I am trying to build a .dll in order to link it to one of my projects. But the build always fails : I got these messages in the output and I don't know what it means. It seems that something is missing, but I couldn't find what. I am trying to link a Mesher called Netgen http://www.hpfem.jku.at/netgen/ 1>adfront2.obj : warning LNK4075: ignoring '/EDITANDCONTINUE' due to '/OPT:ICF' specification 1> Creating library D:\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\converter/lib\nglib.lib and object D:\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\converter/lib\nglib.exp 1>Embedding manifest... 1>Performing Post-Build Event... 1>Environment variable NETGENDIR not found.... using default location!!! 1>POSTBUILD Script for nglib ........ 1>Installing required files into XXX\Netgen\windows....\nglib-instNoOCC_Win32 .... 1>File not found - nglib.dll 1>0 File(s) copied 1>POSTBUILD Script for nglib FAILED.....
