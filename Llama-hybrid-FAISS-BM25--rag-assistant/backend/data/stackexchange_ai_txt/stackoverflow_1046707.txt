Lucene "Apache Lucene is a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library written entirely in Java. It is a technology suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text search, especially cross-platform." Lucene never fails to astonish me, with its performance, clean implementation, and overall elegance. It's a wonderful piece of work.
