How to put a prior on parameter "x" instead of parameter "y" if x and y are related

Background: I'm new to the Bayesian approach and thus am trying to better understand the multi-level (i.e., hierarchical) nature of the Bayesian approach. Question: Suppose I have a parameter called $\delta$. The parameter $\delta$ can be defined as $\delta = \mu / \sigma$. Why if we place a $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ prior on $\delta$, this is equivalent to placing a $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ prior on $\mu$?
