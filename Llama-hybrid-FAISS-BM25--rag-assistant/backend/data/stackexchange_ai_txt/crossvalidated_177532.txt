Rotate PCA components to equalize the variance in each component

I'm trying to reduce the dimensionality and noise of a dataset by performing PCA on the dataset and throwing away the last few PCs. After that, I want to use some machine learning algorithms on the remaining PCs, and therefore I want to normalize the data by equalizing the variance of the PCs to make the algorithms work better. One simple way is to simply normalize the variance to unit values. However, the first PC contains more variance from the original dataset than the following ones, and I still want to give it more "weight". Therefore I was wondering: is there a simple way to just split its variance and share it with the PCs with less variances? Another way is to map the PCs back to the original feature space, but in that case the dimensionality would also increase to the original value. I guess it's better to keep the resultant columns orthogonal, but it's not necessary at this moment.
