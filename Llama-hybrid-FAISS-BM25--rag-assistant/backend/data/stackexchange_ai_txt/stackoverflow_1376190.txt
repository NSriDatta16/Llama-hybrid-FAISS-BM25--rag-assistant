var paragraph is giving me "unterminated string constant" error

I have this file var paragraph = "Abandon| give up or over| yield| surrender| leave| cede| let go| deliver| turn over| relinquish| depart from| leave| desert| quit| go away from| desert| forsake| jilt| walk out on | give up| renounce| discontinue| forgo| drop| desist| abstain from| recklessness| intemperance| wantonness| lack of restraint| unrestraint| abandoned |left alone| forlorn| forsaken| deserted| neglected| rejected| shunned| cast off | jilted| dropped| "; with a lot of spacing, so it's giving me that error at the spacings. then running a loop and alerting the output var sentences = paragraph.split("|"); var newparagraph = ""; for (i = 0; i how do I read from a file that doesn't get errors from spacing?
