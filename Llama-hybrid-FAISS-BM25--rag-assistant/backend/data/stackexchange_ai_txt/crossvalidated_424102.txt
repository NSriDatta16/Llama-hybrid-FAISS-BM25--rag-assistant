The value in mod\$results\$Accuracy is the CV-score: for each of the 5 train/test splits, a model is fitted on the training fold and scored on the test fold, and these five accuracies are averaged. After that, a final model is trained on the entire dataset, and that is the model that is used for predictions. So, what you compute directly at the end is the training score of the final model; this is obviously very optimistically biased, so the first quantity is the one you should be using for an estimate of performance.
