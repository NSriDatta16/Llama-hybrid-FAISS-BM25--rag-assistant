Small-sample binary logit and linear models - response to referees

Background: This is a cross-sectional study that collected 30 thrombosis samples. We assessed the presence or absence of MP components (dependent variable), with 24 cases having MP (1) and 6 cases without MP (0). We carried single- and multi-factor logistic regression analyses, with clinical indicators as independent variables, and the presence or absence of MP as the dependent variable. Comments from the reviewer : The main concern raised is the small sample size, which is common in the field of microplastics. The odds ratios (OR) in the multi-factor regression model ranged from 6 to 12, with wide 95% confidence intervals (CI), indicating that the logistic regression model is unreliable. Furthermore, with 80% of the results being positive (24 out of 30 cases), the association in OR calculation may be exaggerated. Given the small sample size, caution should be exercised when selecting variables to include in the regression model. I have the following questions: Can we still use a multi-factor logistic regression model? The results of the single-factor logistic regression analysis suggest that the D-dimer concentration index has statistical significance (P=0.034) in relation to the presence or absence of MP, while the other indicators have p-values greater than 0.05. Can we include variables such as gender and age in the multi-factor logistic regression model? How many variables should be included at most in the multi-factor logistic regression model? If the multi-factor logistic regression model is not feasible, can we only perform a single-factor logistic regression analysis to demonstrate the influence of D-dimer on the dependent variable? If logistic regression is not used, can we utilize the adjusted Poisson regression (robust Poisson regression) mentioned in the referenced article ( https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1EQjsKvLyWXRVFMX_u0y-w ) and website ( https://mengte.online/archives/11695 )? Can the 95% CI of the odds ratio converge to single-digit values? If none of the above approaches are suitable, what other statistical methods can be employed? Bayesian function？Exact logistic regression？ Thank you very much! Welcome everyone to discuss any issues and provide valuable suggestions.
