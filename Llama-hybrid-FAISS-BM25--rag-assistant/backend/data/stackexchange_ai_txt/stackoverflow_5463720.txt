I can't say about exact format of Quake3, but there are several approaches to do what you need: archive files (ZIP, Tar, etc) compound storage of different kind. On Windows there's Microsoft Structured Storage embedded single-file database virtual file system, which implements an actual file system, but stored not on the disk partition, but somewhere else (in resources, in memory etc). Each of those approaches has it's own strengths and weaknesses . Our SolFS product is an example of virtual file system mentioned above. It was designed for tasks similar to yours. Archives and some compound file implementations usually have linear sequential structure - the files are written one by one with some directory at the beginning or at the end of file. Some compound file implementations, databases and virtual file system have page-based structure ("page" is similar to sector or cluster in FAT or NTFS) where files can be scattered across the storage.
