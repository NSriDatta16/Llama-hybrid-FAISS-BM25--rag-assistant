Hybrid classification neural network

I have product data and I need to classify products to categories (for example Lenovo laptop to Laptops category, etc.), each product has properties such as: description list with image URLs (typically 4 photos) product-specific properties (watches have a mechanism type attribute, etc.) manufacturer category ID Category ID is my target variable, do you know some resources (articles/books) where someone did something similar? I heard about the transfer learning (answer to this question Hybrid Convolutional and Conventional Neural Networks , is it a good approach?). My biggest problem is that I don't know how to connect CNN for images similarity and conventional neural network. Thanks for the help.
