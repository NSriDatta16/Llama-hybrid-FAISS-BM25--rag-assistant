The answer from @G.Vece gets at most of the major considerations. One that deserves a bit more attention than a simple comment on that answer is how you performed the replicate analyses. You say: A treatment (of cells in in-vitro culture) has been applied to 3 identical cultures (3 repetitions) with each accompanied by its control. Yet these can't be "identical" cultures, as even the control mean values differ substantially among the 3 replicates, based on your comment on that answer. Thus there seem to be some uncontrolled differences among the replicates that need to be taken into account. Say that there might be day-to-day variation in culture conditions (e.g., how often the incubator door was opened) or in the operation of the measuring instrument. One way to control for that would have been to do strictly paired experiments, each involving 1 control and 1 treated culture, on each of 3 days. If you did the experiment that way, you could use the day of the experiment as a separate categorical factor in your analysis. That's effectively treating each day's combination of control/treated as a paired experiment, with a correspondingly paired analysis. In that case you could model your results as follows: value ~ treatment + studyDay to control for systematic differences in mean values among the 3 study days. That will make it easier to detect true treatment effects in the face of substantial day-to-day variation. If you didn't do the experiments in such a strictly paired way, however, there isn't much choice other than to combine all the controls and all the treatments separately, and compare.
