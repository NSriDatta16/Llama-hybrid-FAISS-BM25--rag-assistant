What is the best way to store images in python for machine learning

I am currently working on a classification problem that requires me to classify whether an image contains cancerous tissue cells or not. Each image is 50x50x3 pixels, the 3 is for RGB values. So far I have a pandas dataframe that contains the target value, patient id, image id and the path to the corresponding image. I can access the image by using io.imread(df['path']) So it is possible for me to loop through all the images to access them. The question now is, where do I store the images so that I can apply principle component analysis on them? If I were to simply store it in a dataframe it would contain 7500 columns; 1 for each pixel value. My dataset contains 280,000 images. That means my my dataframe would need to be 280,000x7500. I Feel that there is a better way to approach this problem. Your input to this matter would be highly appreciated.
