Sharing ASP.NET session cookies with a Java applet

I have a Java applet that runs inside a forms-authenticated aspx page. In the .NET 1.1 version of my site, the applet has access to the session cookie and is able to retrieve a file from the server, but in the .NET 2.0 version it fails to authenticate. I have seen a couple of forum posts elsewhere that state that 2.0 sets cookies to HttpOnly by default, but the solutions given haven't worked for me so far. I also read somewhere that 2.0 may be discriminating based on user-agent. Does anyone have any experience or insight into this?
