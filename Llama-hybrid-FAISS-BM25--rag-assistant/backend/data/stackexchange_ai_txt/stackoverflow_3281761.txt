I had this same issue. Strangely, for me it would run in integrated mode but not in classic mode for .NET 4. After enabling the .NET 4 extensions via the Isapi and Cgi restrictions section in IIS 7, it then began working in both modes. The Isapi and Cgi restrictions section is located at the server level node in IIS manager. This option should not be confused with the Isapi Filters section at the site level.
