Your understanding is correct. The latent-variable representation is convenient because you can express various models in this form. The LVM in your question corresponds to a probit model. If the errors come from a standard logistic (instead of standard normal) distribution, you get a logistic regression model. If instead of a single threshold at 0 you have multiple cutpoints at $\zeta_1 , you get an ordinal probit model (or ordinal logistic if you have logistic errors).
