I use a product (that I wrote, it's my micro-isv), called Transactor Code Agent. Its a backup tool designed specifically for programmers. It watches your source code, and every time you save a change it backs it up and keeps a local history for you. I think it works a lot better for backup than source control does for several reasons: Source Control is meant to be a change management tool, to help your program move from one consistent state to another You don't have to worry about maintaing a private branch You don't have to interrupt your work to make checks purely for backup purposes. You can just focus on writing code, and checkin your stuff when its done. You can download a demo of it here: http://www.transactor.com/download
