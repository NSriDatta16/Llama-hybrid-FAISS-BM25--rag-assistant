Levels in a mixed effect model with interaction representation

I am trying to understand how to stratify two different mixed effect models. For this, I am reading this guide for mixed effect models. https://rpsychologist.com/r-guide-longitudinal-lme-lmer#conditional-growth-model-dropping-intercept-slope-covariance In this article, they mentioned that in a Conditional three-level growth model of the form. m1 I want to apply a similar reasoning for my two models : fit 1 fit 2 In both models, I am interested in the prediction of exp(fitted) (I fit an exponential model, that is why I took lVolume). For model fit1, if I am not wrong, what I am estimating is : $$ \begin{aligned} \operatorname{lVolume}_{i} &\sim N \left(\alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{Day}), \sigma^2 \right) \\ \alpha_{j} &\sim N \left(\gamma_{0}^{\alpha} + \gamma_{1}^{\alpha}(\operatorname{Country}_{\operatorname{England}}) + \gamma_{2}^{\alpha}(\operatorname{Day} \times \operatorname{Country}_{\operatorname{England}}), \sigma^2_{\alpha_{j}} \right) \text{, for Rat.ID j = 1,} \dots \text{,J} \end{aligned} $$ For model fit2, if I am not wrong, what I am estimating is : $$ \begin{aligned} \operatorname{lVolume}_{i} &\sim N \left(\alpha_{j[i]} + \beta_{1j[i]}(\operatorname{Day}), \sigma^2 \right) \\ \left( \begin{array}{c} \begin{aligned} &\alpha_{j} \\ &\beta_{1j} \end{aligned} \end{array} \right) &\sim N \left( \left( \begin{array}{c} \begin{aligned} &\gamma_{0}^{\alpha} + \gamma_{1}^{\alpha}(\operatorname{Country}_{\operatorname{England}}) \\ &\gamma^{\beta_{1}}_{0} + \gamma^{\beta_{1}}_{1}(\operatorname{Country}_{\operatorname{England}}) \end{aligned} \end{array} \right) , \left( \begin{array}{cc} \sigma^2_{\alpha_{j}} & \rho_{\alpha_{j}\beta_{1j}} \\ \rho_{\beta_{1j}\alpha_{j}} & \sigma^2_{\beta_{1j}} \end{array} \right) \right) \text{, for Rat.ID j = 1,} \dots \text{,J} \end{aligned} $$ So, I doubt how I can interpret my two models in terms of the organization chart from the guide and get the level equations similar to the guide lecture. I really don't understand the differences in (1 + Day | Rat.ID) and (1 | Rat.ID) because, to me, both models estimate the amount of variation in the rate of change of volume between rats. Is this correct? I really appreciate any kind of thoughts and help/hints for this. Thanks.
