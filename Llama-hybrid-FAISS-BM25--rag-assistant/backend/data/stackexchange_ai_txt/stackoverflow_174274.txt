I'm currently using T5 in a project that is about to go live with the beta version, which is not exactly what we intended - we thought the first release would be out by now. T5, IMHO, is stable and mature, apart from a few rough edges and a rather small community. If you're only getting started, I wouldn't bother using T4. I found T5 quite elegant and fun to work with, so if you have some time before the planned release, go for it!
