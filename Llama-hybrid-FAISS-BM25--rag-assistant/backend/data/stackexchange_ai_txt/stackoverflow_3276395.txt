Haskell related note: triaList2 is of course faster than triaList because the latter performs a lot of unnecessary computations. It will take quadratic time to compute n first elements of triaList , but linear for triaList2 . There is another elegant (and efficient) way to define an infinite lazy list of triangle numbers: triaList = 1 : zipWith (+) triaList [2..] Math related note: there is no need to check all divisors up to n / 2, it's enough to check up to sqrt(n).
