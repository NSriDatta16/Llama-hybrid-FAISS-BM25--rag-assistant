Log-likelihood skew-t

I am trying to write down the log-likelihood for the multivariate skewed student-t distribution, but I don't really get how to define it exactly. Could someone please tell me the definition as in how it is written down? I am using the following univariate skewed student-t (see below). I believe that it follows from: Fernandez, C., Steel, M.F. (1998). On Bayesian Modeling of Fat Tails and Skewness. Journal of the American Statistical Association, Taylor & Francis Group, 93(441), 359--371.
