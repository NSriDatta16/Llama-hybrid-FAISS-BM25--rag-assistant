best data structure for sorted time series data that can quickly return subarrays?

I'm in need of a datastructure that is basically a list of data points, where each data point has a timestamp and a double[] of data values. I want to be able to retrieve the closest point to a given timestamp or all points within a specified range of timestamps. I'm using c#. my thinking was using a regular list would be possible, where "datapoint" is a class that contains the timestamp and double[] fields. then to insert, I'd use the built-in binarysearch() to find where to insert the new data, and I could use it again to find the start/end indexes for a range search. I first tried sortedlists, but it seems like you can't iterate through indexes i=0,1,2,...,n, just through keys, so I wasn't sure how to do the range search without some convoluted function. but then I learned that list<>'s insert() is o(n)...couldn't I do better than that without sacrificing elsewhere? alternatively, is there some nice linq query that will do everything I want in a single line?
