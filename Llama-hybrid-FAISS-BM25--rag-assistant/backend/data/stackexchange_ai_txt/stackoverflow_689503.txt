for a similar project i did 2 verifications ... i placed a cookie and also saved on the server a hash from users ip + user agent. this seemed to be pretty effective since even if there are more people that use the same IP the hash with user agent will be different most of the times since it differs for same browser depending on the operating system and other extensions installed.
