For accessibility: Organize your radio buttons as a fieldset and give it a legend attribute, so that screen-readers understand what each group of radio buttons means. Give each radio button an ID, and use the ID in the for="" attribute of an associated label element. This isn't just good for accessibility - it also means you can select a radio button by clicking the label (which is much bigger and easier to hit than the radio button itself) Then, use CSS to style your fieldset , legend and label attributes to match your site design, as in this example: body { font-family: arial; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4em; } fieldset.radioGroup { border: none; } fieldset.radioGroup legend { font-weight: bold; } /* Make each radio/label render on a new line */ fieldset.radioGroup label { display: block; } /* add some horizontal spacing between radio buttons and their label text */ fieldset.radioGroup label input { margin-right: 32px; } Skill Level Never Played Unorganized Pickup Organized Pickup / League Play
