The AVL tree is inefficient because you have to do potentially many rotations per insertion/deletion. The Red-Black tree is probably a better alternative because insertions/deletions are much more efficient. This structure guarantees the longest path to a leaf is no more than twice the shortest path. So while less balanced than an AVL tree, the worst unbalanced cases are avoided. If your tree will be read many times, and won't be altered after it's created, it may be worth the extra overhead for a fully-balanced AVL tree. Also the Red-Black tree requires one extra bit of storage for each node, which give the node's "color".
