Drag and Drop (plus snapping to grid)

Is there a way in Silverlight, to make elements draggable - but also allow these same elements to "snap" to the others? I've followed a few drag-drop tutorials for this, but none of them seem to allow the snapping :( Any ideas SO gurus? Clarification: I would like a 32px x 32px "rectangle" to be draggable and snappable to other draggable elements.
