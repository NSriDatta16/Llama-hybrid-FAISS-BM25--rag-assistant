If you use std::vector instead of std::string , the underlying storage will be a C array that can be accessed with &someVec[0] . However, you do lose a lot of std::string conveniences such as operator+ . That said, I'd suggest just avoiding C APIs that mutate strings as much as possible. If you need to pass an immutable string to a C function, you can use c_str() , which is fast and non-copying on most std::string implementations.
