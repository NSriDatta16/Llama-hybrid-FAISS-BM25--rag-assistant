One reason to go from one language to another (Python -> C++) is an optimization issue. By compiling to native code you get rid of any interprittation or JIT'ing step. That might normally occur with Python; you would also remove any reliance on having Python installed locally on a machine. Additionally, the program can now make use of any optimization capabilities of the destination compiler. I've heard this is fairly common when writing a simple compiler; to go from the 'nice' language to an intermediate language with an optimizing compiler. And finally, as others have said, the reason for using Python over C++ is because it should easier to work in; from Epigrams in Programming , "A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant."
