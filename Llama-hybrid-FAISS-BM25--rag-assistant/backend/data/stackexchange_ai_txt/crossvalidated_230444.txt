For a deep neural network that you mention, finding an effective local minima is the key. As per the paper, Gülçehre, Çağlar, and Yoshua Bengio. "Knowledge matters: Importance of prior information for optimization." Journal of Machine Learning Research 17.8 (2016): 1-32. It says Deeper Networks are Harder Hypothesis : Although solutions may exist, effective local minima are generally more likely to hamper learning as the required depth of the architecture increases.
