Yes, this is my question that I am answering, but I found this technique to be useful, and am sharing for anybody else struggling with the similar problems. I have found socat to be very useful in waiting for a socket or port. An init.d script like: case “$1″ in start) echo '--benign phrase' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/path/to/socket,retry=10,intervall=1 ;; will wait until the socket becomes writable, then return. There is no daemonization involved, so it blocks execution of higher numbered init.d scripts until it finishes. Use of such waiter scripts will slow the boot sequence, and are thus non-optimal, but are a big improvement from the very fragile approach of sprinkling 'sleep n' statements in the scripts.
