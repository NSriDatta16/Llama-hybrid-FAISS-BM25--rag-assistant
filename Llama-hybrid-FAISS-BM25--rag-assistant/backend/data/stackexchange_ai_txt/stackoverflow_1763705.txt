moving files and database I assume these two steps are obvious: copy all of your local files to production server dump your magento local db and import it into your production server db editing in production server now on your production server you need to follow these two steps: edit app/etc/local.xml file and change database info in production db,in its core_config_data table, you should find every records containing the url of your local installation, then you need to update those values;which can be found with this query: SELECT * FROM `core_config_data` WHERE `value` LIKE 'http://%'; edit (thanks to comments): 3. Do not forget to delete var folder contents 4. Optionally remove this file too app/etc/use_cache.ser
