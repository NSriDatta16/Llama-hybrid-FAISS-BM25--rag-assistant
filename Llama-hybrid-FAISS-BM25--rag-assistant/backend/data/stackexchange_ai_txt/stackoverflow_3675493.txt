UIElement in layered fashion

Technology : Silverlight Platform : Windows Phone 7 foreach(Rectangle rec in listrect) { Layoutroot.Children.Add(rec); } Done some mouse move capture events and made these rectangles draggable. Each child element is added to the layout in some layered fashion I guess,where the first rectangle goes to the bottom layer next on top of that and on and on. How can I avoid this and make all the UIElement s in same plane irrespective of the order in which they are added to child of the canvas?
