Calculate how big a variable is in relation to others

This will sound weird, but I'm trying to calculate something that I don't know the name. I want to calculate how big/low a variable is in relation to the others. Like Google webmaster tools says "your site loads in 3s, this is slower than 59% of sites". How can I calculate this? For example, the points a player has. He has 4440 points and he is ranked on #437 out of 16801 players. The average of points in 976 and the top player has 30076 points.
