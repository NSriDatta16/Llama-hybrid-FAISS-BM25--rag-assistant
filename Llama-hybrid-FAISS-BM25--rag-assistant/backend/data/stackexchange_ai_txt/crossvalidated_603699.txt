I would encourage you to try Option 1 as it's simpler. It seems that you are most interested in what is happening during the busy months of April-September, and I imagine are probably interested in the form the model takes (e.g. if you fit an AR(1) model you may be very interested in the value the AR coefficient takes). The issue with including October-March observations is the data generating process is likely quite different, and even if you properly transform your data to correct for constant variance in the errors, it could still impact your model fit for the part of the data you actually care about. For example if April-September was AR(1) with AR coefficient $\phi=0.5$ and October-March was AR(1) with $\phi=-0.5$ , then the fitted model would end up with $\phi\approx0$ , which may lead you to make incorrect inferences about the data generating process during the busy months. When fitting the model you probably want to try two ways of dealing with the gaps. In the case of the AR(1) model you could try either of $$\begin{align}X_{\text{April2021}}&=\phi X_{\text{March2021}}+\epsilon_{\text{April2021}}\\ X_{\text{April2021}}&=\phi X_{\text{September2020}}+\epsilon_{\text{April2021}} \end{align}$$ and see what looks best. Also you can modify the equations accordingly if you want to incorporate seasonality.
