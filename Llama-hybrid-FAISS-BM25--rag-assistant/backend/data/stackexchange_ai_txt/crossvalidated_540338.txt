I would go for Statistics, 4th edition from Freedman et al. https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/8130915871/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=statistics+david+freedman&qid=1629053359&sr=8-1 Why? Because they start with: What went wrong in the world before statistics were invented. And they show how a simple example of not working with control/treatment group and double blind random selection of study participants can mess all up, and what the consequences were. And all the previous references calling upon Bayesian...no one starts with that when you start with statistics basically, well we all probably use some of it, but don't name it. I made you a few scans from my book: They start the preface or first chapter with (I hope you can read something, my scanner sucks and the book is over 500 pages): And then they make it really simple with mini chapters e.g. on the average : and slowly increase the pace with a lot of stuff, and there is also hypotheses testing as you wanted it: You have to keep in mind that this book shows everything practical, it weighs not heavily on math, but YOU WILL FIND a lot about the motivation behind statistics; I can guarantee that. There are even a lot of questions for students/graduates etc. in this book. I would go for it.
