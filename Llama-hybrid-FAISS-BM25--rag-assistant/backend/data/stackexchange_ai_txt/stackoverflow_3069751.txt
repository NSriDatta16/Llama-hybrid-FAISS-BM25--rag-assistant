If you are referring to the breadcrumbs in the help file of a RCP application, there is only a manual way to do it . Since Ganymede 3.4M5 : Michael Borgwardt mentions the toolbar icon Slava Semushin provides a native shortcut based on Ctrl + 3 + bread , which points directly to the Toggle Java Editor Breadcrumb option. Shachi reminds us below that you can right-click on any icon on the breadcrumb, and select the entry named " Hide Breadcrumb ". Original answer (manual way, through key mapping) Find the file org.eclipse.help.webapp\advanced\breadcrumbs.css and replace its contents with. .help_breadcrumbs { display: none; } For the Java Editor breadcrumb, you need to assign a shortcut to the "Toggle Java Editor Breadcrumb" command (I have tested Alt + B , for instance) That shortcut will make the breadcrumb bar appear/disappear at will.
