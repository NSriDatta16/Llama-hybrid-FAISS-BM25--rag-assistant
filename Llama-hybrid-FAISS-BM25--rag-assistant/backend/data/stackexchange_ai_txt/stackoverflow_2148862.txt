In finding a good ratio, weather it be 5:1, 10:1, etc. I would lean more heavily on the developer side than what you think the average needs will be. If PM/BA shortages crop up, we as developers can "reluctantly" step into a "PM" role to fill the gap. (temporarily, hopefully) It is easier to turn a developer into a PM than a PM into a developer. This makes the team more adaptable.
