What are the steps involved in developing a dotnetnuke website? Pick your version (if you're starting now, pick 5.1.1) Installation (use Source package locally, Install package everywhere else) Settings Configuration (performance, security, user info, etc.) Adding & configuring core/third party modules Adding & configuring third party skins Custom Extension (typically module or provider) Development Custom Skin Development How different is it from a developers perspective to develop a dotnetnuke cms website from a cms website which was developed from scratch? Very. When you're starting with an established CMS you're inheriting solutions to tons and tons of solved problems. In the case of DNN, you have a substantial framework at your disposal. The focus will be more on learning and leveraging the existing API/features. If you're starting from scratch you're providing that foundation yourself. Using an established CMS is not necessarily better than the other - it depends on what you're trying to accomplish. If you require fine-grained control over everything and you want a great learning experience, rolling your own may be the best way to go. When it comes to the database do you add tables to the database incrementally as you develop new functionality or do you plan everything in advance and create tables and stored procedures at once? No matter what your project is, I'd suggest doing things as they are needed and not before. I think "doing everything in advance" would be impossible/horrible anyway. The heart of this question is really going to be defining your development process - I don't think this would necessarily be any different than in other projects. I like to define the features I want, organize them based on their relation to each other (which should come first due to dependencies, etc) and start implementing them one at a time and give each one the attention it needs.
