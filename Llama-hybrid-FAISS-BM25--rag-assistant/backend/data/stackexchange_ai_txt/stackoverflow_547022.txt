How do I store orders?

I have an app which has tasks in it and you can reorder them. Now I was woundering how to best store them. Should I have a colomn for the ordernumber and recalculate all of them everytime I change one? Please tell me a version which doesn't require me to update all order numbers since that is very time consuming (from the executions point of view). This is especially bad if I have to put one that is at the very top of the order and then drag it down to the bottom. Name (ordernumber) -- 1Example (1) 2Example (2) 3Example (3) 4Example (4) 5Example (5) -- 2Example (1) * 3Example (2) * 4Example (3) * 5Example (4) * 1Example (5) * *have to be changed in the database also some tasks may get deleted due to them being done
