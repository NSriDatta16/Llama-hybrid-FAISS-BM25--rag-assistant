I'm assuming you've already checked for basic things like correlation. People usually just fit a very flexible non-parametric model (such as random forest) and see if it can do better than chance on some hold-out test set. If it can, it suggests the two variables are not totally independent. Another approach is the calculate the empirical mutual information. For example, in R, this can be done via infotheo::mutinformation or entropy::mi.empirical . No (currently available) approach will be able to detect all possible relationships though. Consider stenography - we could hide mutual information in the least significant bits of the numbers in such a way that no one could ever detect it.
