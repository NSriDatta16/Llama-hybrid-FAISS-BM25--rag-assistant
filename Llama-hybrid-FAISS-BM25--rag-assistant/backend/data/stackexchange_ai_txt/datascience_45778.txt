The original slide in question "Scale drives deep learning progress" is possibly what you currently can find at https://cs230.stanford.edu/files/C1M1.pdf (page 13). It may be roughly interpreted with " low bias learners [in that plot, larger neural networks] tend to benefit from more training examples ".
