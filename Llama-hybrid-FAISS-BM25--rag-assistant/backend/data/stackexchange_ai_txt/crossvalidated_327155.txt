The Markov chain determines $X_n$ which takes values in $S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. The $6 \times 6$ transition matrix $P$ will determine the probability mass over $S$ for $X_{n}$ when $X_{n-1}$ takes a certain value. That is, you need the matrix $P$ that defines for all $x \in S$ and all $i \in S$, $$\Pr(X_n = i \mid X_{n-1} = x)\,. $$ Note that since $X_n$ counts the number of 6s till time $n$, it cannot decrease. So in the transition matrix, the probabilities are zero for whenever $i$ is less than $x$. So let's start filling the transition matrix, starting from the bottom row. When $x = 5$, that is $X_{n-1} = 5$, then the next state must be 5 because all dice are out of play, so all the mass is on state $5$. $$ P = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ 0 & 0 & 0 &0 &0&1\\ \end{array} \right]\,. $$ Now, lets fill the 5th row (that is $X_{n-1} = 4$. Since the number of 6s so far is four, that means, that the number of dice still in play is 1. When I roll do the experiment this $n$th time, I am only rolling the one die. So $\Pr(X_n = 5 \mid X_{n-1} = 4) = \Pr(\text{rolling a 6 for a single die}) = 1/6$. The rest of the probability goes to the state $4.$ So, $$ P = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{5}{6}& \frac{1}{6}\\ 0 & 0 & 0 &0 &0&1\\ \end{array} \right]\,. $$ I'll fill one more row for you. for when $X_{n-1} = 3$, then there are two dice to roll. For $X_n = 5$, both dice should be 6, which happens with probability $1/36$. For $X_n = 4$, exactly one die has to be a 6, which happens with probability $2 \times \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{10}{36}$. The rest of the probability goes to the state $X_n = 3$. $$ P = \left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ . & . & . &. &.&.\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{25}{36} & \frac{10}{36}& \frac{1}{36}\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{5}{6}& \frac{1}{6}\\ 0 & 0 & 0 &0 &0&1\\ \end{array} \right]\,. $$ Since this is self-study, I will let you fill in the rest of the rows. EDIT Seeing Chaconne's comment, here I check the final matrix $P$ obtained by looking at $P^t$ at $t = 1000$. I know that eventually all the mass should be at the state $X_n = 5$ irrespective of the starting value. The output matches this result. > Pt for(t in 2:1000) + { + Pt Pt [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [1,] 0 9.418588e-317 2.859314e-237 4.340182e-158 3.294003e-79 1 [2,] 0 1.883718e-317 1.143726e-237 2.604109e-158 2.635202e-79 1 [3,] 0 0.000000e+00 2.859314e-238 1.302054e-158 1.976402e-79 1 [4,] 0 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 4.340182e-159 1.317601e-79 1 [5,] 0 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 6.588005e-80 1 [6,] 0 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 0.000000e+00 1
