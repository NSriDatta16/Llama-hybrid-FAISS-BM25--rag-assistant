What is the best multivariate analysis method to study data with missing values and outliers?

I'm working with a dataset of elemental concentrations in polluted soils. Using the same units, some elements have high values and some have low values. If the concentration of some element is too low in any given soil it can't be determined, so I have missing values (they could be approximated, though), and polluted places have much higher values, so they are outliers and most variables are not normally distributed. I want to group soils with similar profiles, and if possible know what elements (variables) make them similar or different. The methods I know (like PCAs) can't be applied here, so what method could be?
