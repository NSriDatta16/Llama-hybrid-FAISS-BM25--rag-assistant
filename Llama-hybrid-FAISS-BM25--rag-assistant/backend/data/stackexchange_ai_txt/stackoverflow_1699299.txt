Anurag's answer is correct. However another problem here is you can't for certain know the encoding of the files that users upload. It may be useful to loop over a tuple of the most common ones till you get the correct one: encodings = ('windows-xxx', 'iso-yyy', 'utf-8',) for e in encodings: try: data = f.read().decode(e) break except UnicodeDecodeError: pass
