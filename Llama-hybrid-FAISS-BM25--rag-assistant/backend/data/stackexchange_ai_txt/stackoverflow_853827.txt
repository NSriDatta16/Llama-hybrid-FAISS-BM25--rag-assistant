Unit testing is more useful to verify the functionality of given methods, not to assert coverage. Unit tests that care more about what method got called know way more about the classes they are testing than they probably should, not to mention will be confusing to the reader. Coverage tools like Cobertura or EMMA will tell you whether you properly covered your code.
