multiple logistic regression - relative change in the predicted probabilities with unbalanced classes

I have a multiple logistic regression with continuous variables (dist_fs, slope, min_dist), one binary variable (exp), and one interaction between the binary variable and a continuous variable. The response variable is not balanced, I have n=273 for "1" and n=13847 for "0". The summary of the model provided these coefficients: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.25942 0.24478 -13.316 Using plot_model() I obtained this plot for the interaction: My question: I understand that the low predicted probabilities may come from the unbalanced sample size of the response variable. But I see that the difference between the probabilities of the binary variable is very small (~2-3%, when x=0). If the sample size would be balanced, and the trends similar, could we expect the difference in the % between the two categories to be different as well (that is, also higher)? Or this difference would be the same, independently of the balanced/unbalanced sample size? Or we can't conclude anything about this, without a balanced dataset? Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this.
