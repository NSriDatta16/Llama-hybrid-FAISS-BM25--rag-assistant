Updating/ adjusting theoretical growth curves when raw data becomes available

The research group I work for have developed a theoretical growth model for a particular species of fish. The idea is that if you provide some initial starting values for the model you then generate an expected growth curve along with 95% confidence bands. To extend the model we would like to be able to update the model and recalculate the curve when real data becomes available. For example, imagine that at age 6 the model predicts an average weight of 34g, but in a random sample of fish we find that the mean age is, say, 24g, we would like to be able to use this new data to 'tweak' our previously estimated curve. At the moment I am not sure quite how to address this problem so any suggestions would be much appreciated.
