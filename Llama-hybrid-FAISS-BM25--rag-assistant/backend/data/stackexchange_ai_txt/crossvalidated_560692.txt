There is no general rule saying that at least one of the ARIMA orders must be nonzero. There are time series for which ARIMA(0,0,0) is a suitable model. In your case, it seems there are no ARIMA patterns beyond deterministic seasonality that you already have modelled using dummy variables. That is in line with the ACF and PACF plots. If you did not include seasonal dummies, you would probably have a seasonal AR(1) model, but that need not be the better alternative compared to seasonal dummies. You are probably fine the way you have done it now.
