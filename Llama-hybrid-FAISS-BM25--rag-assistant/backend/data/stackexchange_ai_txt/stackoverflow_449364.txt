A dictionary is a table. The hash is a question of what kind of index is used. Most RDBMS assume that tables are big and densely packed, making a hashed index not appropriate. table SpaceQuadrant { ID Primary Key, -- whatever other attributes are relevant } table Space { SpaceCoordinate Primary Key, Quadrant Foreign Key SpaceQuadrant(ID), SpaceObject -- whatever the object is } Your Space objects have FK references to the Quadrant in which they're located. Depending on your RDBMS, you might be able to find a hash-based index that gets you the performance you're hoping for. For example MySQL, using the HEAP storage engine supports HASH indexes.
