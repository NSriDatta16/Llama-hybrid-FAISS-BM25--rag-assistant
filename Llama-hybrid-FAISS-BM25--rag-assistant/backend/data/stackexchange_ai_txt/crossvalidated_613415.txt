Interpretation of interaction terms in R

I have conducted OLS with interaction terms in R and used emmeans package to examine further. I am not sure whether I am on the right track to interpret the interaction terms. My research question: Does depression moderate the association between abuse and delinquency? Hypothesis: Abuse experience will have a greater negative impact on delinquency for people with high levels of depression compared to those with low depression. IV: abuse (yes=1, no=0); Moderator: depression (high depression=1, low depression=0); DV: delinquency (continuous) Here are my codes: reg And, I got these results: Call: lm(formula = delinquency ~ abuse + age + depression + NBsafety + abuse * depression, data = test) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -8.494 -3.130 -1.424 1.780 28.770 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 6.90783 0.41027 16.837 > reg_a reg_a abuse depression emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL 0 0 3.95 0.111 2714 3.73 4.16 1 0 4.84 0.268 2714 4.32 5.37 0 1 5.30 0.251 2714 4.81 5.80 1 1 7.32 0.437 2714 6.47 8.18 Results are averaged over the levels of: NBsafety Confidence level used: 0.95 > > contrast(reg_a, "revpairwise", by="depression", adjust="none") depression = 0: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value abuse1 - abuse0 0.898 0.289 2714 3.107 0.0019 depression = 1: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value abuse1 - abuse0 2.021 0.504 2714 4.011 0.0001 Results are averaged over the levels of: NBsafety > > emmip(reg, depression~abuse, CIs=TRUE) > emmip(reg, abuse~depression, CIs=TRUE) > > reg_b reg_b depression abuse yvar SE df LCL UCL tvar xvar 0 0 3.95 0.111 2714 3.73 4.16 0 0 1 0 5.30 0.251 2714 4.81 5.80 1 0 0 1 4.84 0.268 2714 4.32 5.37 0 1 1 1 7.32 0.437 2714 6.47 8.18 1 1 Results are averaged over the levels of: NBsafety Confidence level used: 0.95 > > ggplot(data=reg_b, aes(x=depression, y=yvar, fill=abuse)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") If I assume that the interaction term was significant (although it was not, p=0.05247), can I interpret that the impact of abuse on delinquency is stronger for people with high levels of depression than those with low depression. This was because emmeans contrast showed the greater difference in depression=1 (abuse1 - abuse0 2.02) compared to the difference in depression=0 (abuse1 - abuse0 0.898), and the slope in the graph is steeper for depression=1 compared to depression=0. Could you please guide me whether I am correct?
