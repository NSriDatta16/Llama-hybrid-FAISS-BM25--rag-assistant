Cucumber pickle's path_to_pickle usage

I'm just having a look at pickle (on Rails 3) for simplifying my steps and paths in cucumber. I'm having trouble using the path_to_pickle for creating edit paths. I installed pickle with: rails g pickle --paths --email I have a Scenario for editing a ledger: Scenario: Edit a ledger Given I have a ledger with name "Digitech" When I go to the ledger's edit page And I fill in "Name" with "Test Ledger" And I press "Update Ledger" Then I should be on the ledgers page And I should see "Ledger was successfully updated." I'm using the standard paths which pickle generates: when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? page$/ # eg. the forum's page path_to_pickle $1 when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? #{capture_model}(?:'s)? page$/ # eg. the forum's post's page path_to_pickle $1, $2 when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? #{capture_model}'s (.+?) page$/ # eg. the forum's post's comments page path_to_pickle $1, $2, :extra => $3 # or the forum's post's edit page when /^#{capture_model}(?:'s)? (.+?) page$/ # eg. the forum's posts page path_to_pickle $1, :extra => $2 # or the forum's edit page I get this error when trying to run cucumber When I go to the ledger's edit page # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:19 Could not figure out a path for ["the ledger"] {:extra=>"edit"} (RuntimeError) ./features/support/paths.rb:32:in `path_to' ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:20:in `/^(?:|I )go to (.+)$/' features/ledger/manage_ledgers.feature:61:in `When I go to the ledger's edit page' I read on the mailing list that path_to_pickle needed attention but that was back in September, is this still the case? Should I be using something like polymorphic_path(model($1))?
