Obj-C circular buffer object, implementing one?

I've been developing for the iPhone for quite some time and I've been wondering if there's any array object that uses circular buffer in Obj-C? Like Java's Stack or List or Queue. I've been tinkering with the NSMutableArray, testing it's limits... and it seems that after 50k simple objects inside the array - the application is significantly slowed down. So, is there any better solution other than the NSMutableArray (which becomes very slow with huge amounts of data). If not, can anyone tell me about a way to create such an object (would that involve using chain (node) objects??). Bottom line: Populating a UITableView from an SQLite DB directly would be smart? As it won't require memory from an array or anything, but just the queries. And SQLite is fast and not memory grinding. Thank you very much for you time and attention, ~ Natanavra. From what I've been thinking it seems that going for Quinn's class is the best option possibly. I have another question - would it be faster or smarter to load everything straight from the SQLite DB instead of creating an object and pushing it into an array? Thank you in advance, ~ Natanavra.
