Well, if you really want human readable, you can use BubbleBabble . Create a Perl script like the following: #!/usr/bin/perl use Digest::BubbleBabble qw(bubblebabble); use Digest::SHA1 qw(sha1); print bubblebabble(Digest => sha1(join(' ', @ARGV))), "\n"; Then feed it any command line argument you want to get output like the following: xogan-nydut-zogiv-kotyn-ledah-taseb-gyhib-tucel-vudul-mykom-mexax Or if Perl's not your preference, you can use PWGen ( also available online to get output like this: aiCee5om Ohxai2is tae3Gael Gaeth7ei ooCh0ish Honestly, this level of human readability is overkill; RickNZ's answer should work just fine (and is pretty close to what we did for some software keys). But BubbleBabble is kind of fun.
