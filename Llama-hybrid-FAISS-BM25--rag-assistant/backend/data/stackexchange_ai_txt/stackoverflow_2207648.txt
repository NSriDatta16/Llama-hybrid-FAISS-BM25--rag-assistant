So, we're through and I'd like to share how we did it finally. We were in the lucky position that noone had a custom branch at a certain moment. So what we basically did, was, that all pushed a last time their stuff to the central repository. Then we used filter-branch like described by the GitHub crew on it. We had then a clear central repository. Finally (and that worked only because noone had a local branch as mentioned) we deleted our local repositories and cloned new ones from the now clean central one. To put it in a nutshell: This way it was quite a fast and painless procedure. Not elegant, but it worked.
