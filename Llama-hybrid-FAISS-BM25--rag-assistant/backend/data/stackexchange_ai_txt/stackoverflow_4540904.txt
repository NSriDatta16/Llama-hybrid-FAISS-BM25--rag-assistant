SQL query not returning desired result in group by having clause

I have a table with member_information and their referring agent. I want to run a query which returns all information in the table (select *) where the agent appears more than 3 times. my initial query is: SELECT agent FROM activity GROUP BY agent ASC HAVING COUNT(agent) > 3; this returns the agent id's needed but not the rest of the data within 'activity'. I modified to: SELECT * FROM activity GROUP BY agent ASC HAVING COUNT(agent) > 3 this only returns one of the results for each agent number needed instead of all rows with matching agent numbers. What am I missing? edit assume table structure is as follows: id | agent | name | address -------------------------------------------------------- 1 | 1 | (name) | (an address) 2 | 1 | (name) | (an address) 3 | 2 | (name) | (an address) 4 | 3 | (name) | (an address) 5 | 3 | (name) | (an address) 6 | 3 | (name) | (an address) 7 | 1 | (name) | (an address) 8 | 2 | (name) | (an address) 9 | 4 | (name) | (an address) the results of the query should return: id | agent | name | address -------------------------------------------------------- 1 | 1 | (name) | (an address) 2 | 1 | (name) | (an address) 4 | 3 | (name) | (an address) 5 | 3 | (name) | (an address) 6 | 3 | (name) | (an address) 7 | 1 | (name) | (an address)
