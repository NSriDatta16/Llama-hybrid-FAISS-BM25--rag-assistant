What you are actually looking for is a technique called Content-Based Filtering As Wikipedia defines it: Another common approach when designing recommender systems is content-based filtering. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the userâ€™s preference. In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research. More can be found Here .
