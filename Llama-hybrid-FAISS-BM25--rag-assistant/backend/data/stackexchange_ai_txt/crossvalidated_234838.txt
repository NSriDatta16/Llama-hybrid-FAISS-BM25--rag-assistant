R classifier that handles NA's at prediction time

Are there any high performing classifiers implemented in R capable of handling NA's at prediction time? By high performing I mean models that in general produce good results (random forest, SVM, Boosting, etc.). Currently, I was trying with randomForest package but when trying to predict an observation having in some of its columns NA's then, the result is just NA. At training time I have no problem since I can guarantee that the training data will not have any NA's. For my use case imputation is not an option, so I am looking for a classifier that just can handle NA values (maybe by ignoring them) at prediction time. Note: my predictor variables are numeric and categorical.
