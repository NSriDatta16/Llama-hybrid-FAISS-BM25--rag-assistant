I recently had this problem also and I found that the solution lies in the specificity of your jQuery selector. Assuming: Just doing this causes the issue in IE/Chrome: $('.draggable').draggable(); Instead, be more specific: $('.albumItem.draggable').draggable(); Not sure what is going on in IE/Chrome behind the scenes that is causing this issue, but more specific jQuery selectors did the trick for me.
