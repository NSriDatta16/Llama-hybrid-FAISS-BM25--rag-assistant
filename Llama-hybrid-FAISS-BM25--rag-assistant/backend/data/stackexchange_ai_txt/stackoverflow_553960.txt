I am a bit unsure of what you want to do since the jsp tag is basically compiled into code. But the tag (and its body) produces an output which is known as a jsp fragment, and this can be manipulated. Pardon for using the simple tag syntax but you can basically use the This defines a variable that you can manipulate with other functions. You can later emit the contents of this variable to the output stream.
