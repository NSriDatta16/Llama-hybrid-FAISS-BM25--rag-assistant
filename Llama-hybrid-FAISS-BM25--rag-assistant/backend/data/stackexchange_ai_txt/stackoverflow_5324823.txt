If you are looking for a PostgreSQL-based data warehousing solution, I would also look at GridSQL. It is a parallelization layer over multiple PostgreSQL instances, and is free and open source. Like mentioned in other comments, it will not perform well for many small millisecond queries, but will help you greatly for long running queries. GridSQL also will not include DW optimizations like columnar storage that Greenplum has, but you can take advantage of constraint exclusion partitioning (ex: subtables by date range) combined with parallelism to get your query results faster. You can also even use it on a single multi-core server, as PostgreSQL will only use a single core when processing a query.
