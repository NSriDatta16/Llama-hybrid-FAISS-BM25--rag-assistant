Redmine best practices

What tips and "standards" do you use in your Redmine project management process? Do you have a standard wiki insert template you could share or a standard way to work a project using bugs features tasks and support issues? Do you let issues and updates get emailed into Redmine? Do you use the forums? Do you use SVN repository? Do you use Mylyn in eclipse to work the task lists? I'm trying to drag our dept. into some web based PM instead of emailed Word docs of vague requirements followed by Word docs explaining how to QA and Deploy that all get lost in a pile of competing updates and projects so that by the time I have to fix something, no one can find any documentation on how it works.
