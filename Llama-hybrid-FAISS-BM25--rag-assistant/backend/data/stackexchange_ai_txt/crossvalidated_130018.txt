Correlation and coefficient with overlapping data

I have a time series data, with 5-period rates sampled at 1 period intervals. Essentially $$r_i = x_{i+5} - x_i ; ~~ i=1,...,N-5$$ This creates an overlapping data problem for regression. As far as I understand OLS estimates are unbiased but inefficient in this case. And we have methods like GLS or Newey-West to correct this. Are there similar properties of the correlation coefficient as well? Are there good ways to estimate the coefficient other than simply bootstrapping? I face this in a primarily learning scenario, and don't want to go for Newey-West like estimators.
