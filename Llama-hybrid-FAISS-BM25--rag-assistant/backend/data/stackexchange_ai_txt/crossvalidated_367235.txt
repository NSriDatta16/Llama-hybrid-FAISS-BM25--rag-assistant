However much it pains me to say this, Deep learning is slow, get used to it . There are some things you could do to speed up your training though: What GPU are you using? A friend of mine was doing some research on LSTM's last year and training them on her NVIDIA GTX7?? GPU. Since this was going painfully slow, they tried to train the network on a more modern CPU, which actually led to a speed-up by a non trivial factor. What framework are you using? While most frameworks are somewhat comparable, I have heard rumors ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07249.pdf ) that some frameworks are slower than others. It might be worthwhile to switch frameworks if you're going to be doing a lot of training. Is it possible to train your network on your company/university hardware? Universities and research companies usually have some powerful hardware at their disposal. If this is not an option, maybe you can look into using some cloud-computing power. All these solutions obviously assume your model itself is as optimal as it can be (In terms of training time and accuracy), which is also something you need to consider, but is outside of the scope of this answer.
