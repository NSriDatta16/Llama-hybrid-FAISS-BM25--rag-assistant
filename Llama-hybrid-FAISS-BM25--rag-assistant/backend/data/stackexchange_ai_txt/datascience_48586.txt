This can be solved with "text segmentation". NLP libraries have code for breaking given text into : Sentences Phrases Words With this, you can break text into sentences and insert . or ? for each sentence. Similarly, dependency tree will help with inserting some punctuation marks (not all). Example (breaking text into sentences): import spacy nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') text = "I was expecting a surplus of cute close-ups but Burton does surprisingly little to win us over He's never been big on treacle but a bit more warmth in this chilly movie which barely follows the outline of the 1941 original would have gone a long way" text_sentences = nlp(text) for sentence in text_sentences.sents: print(sentence.text) Output is : I was expecting a surplus of cute close-ups but Burton does surprisingly little to win us over and He's never been big on treacle but a bit more warmth in this chilly movie which barely follows the outline of the 1941 original would have gone a long way More details : https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features
