I'll bet you a beer that the provider has error_reporting set to 0, or errors redirected to a log file, and thus some error occurs but doesn't get reported. Can you make a test output of $_REQUEST["type"]? Could it be that it's empty or not in your switch statement? Can you deliberately insert something that will cause a fatal error, and see whether is stays blank? As RageZ suggested, can you set error_reporting to E_ALL? Maybe errors are by default not shown in the output, but redirected to an internal error log file. Can you check with your provider whether that is the case? Maybe you have a login area to view error logs in, or they are stored somewhere in your directory structure?
