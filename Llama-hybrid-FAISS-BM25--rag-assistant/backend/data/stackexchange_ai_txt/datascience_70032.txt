Average n 2D clusters into one finale result

I have n clusters run on 3D data, resulting n 2D clusters, I couldn't run the clustering model on a one year satellite mages time-serie. So I did chunks of one month and run clustering which finally gave: 12 sets of 2D clusters like: Set 1: lat, lon, class 10, 10, 1 10, 20, 2 20, 10, 3 ... Set 2: lat, lon, class 10, 10, 2 10, 20, 2 20, 10, 3 ... ... I would like an approximate for what it would be to run the clustering model on 365 data, in other words the best average of the clusters. Even if it does not take into consideration the time order between these clusters. It would be less correct for a clustering on all data but still fair.
