I take it that by "most influential" you mean "the node that most contributes to the overall connectivity" of the module. There isn't a single topological parameter that summarizes all the information about a node in a single number. 1) If your module is moderately to densely connected, you could measure how many (or what %) of edges are lost if you remove a node. The larger the % of edges lost, the more important the node. 2) If your module is not very densely connected (I'm thinking about linear- or tree-looking networks), another method is counting in how many submodules a module is fragmented after removing the node. The larger the number of fragments, the more important the node is for keeping the whole structure together.
