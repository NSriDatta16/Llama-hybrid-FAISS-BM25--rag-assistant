Does PCA helps to include all the variables even if there is high collinearity among variables?

I have a dataset that has high collinearity among variables. When I created the linear regression model, I could not include more than five variables ( I eliminated the feature whenever VIF>5). But I need to have all the variables in the model and find their relative importance. Is there any way around it?. I was thinking about doing PCA and creating models on principal components. Does it help?.
