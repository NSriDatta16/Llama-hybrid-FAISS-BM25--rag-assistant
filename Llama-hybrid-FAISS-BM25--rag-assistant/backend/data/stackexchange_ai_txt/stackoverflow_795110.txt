Parameter missing a value

I am new to reporting services and have a reporting services 2005 report that I am working on to use as a base report template for our organization. I am trying to place the date that the report was last modified on the report server into the page header of the report. However, I keep getting a 'ParamX' parameter is missing a value error when I try to This is what I have done: Set up a Parameter ReportName with a default value of Globals!ReportName. It is also hidden and internal. Set up a Dataset ReportHeader that calls a stored procedure that returns the date the report was last updated or another date, if the report is not on the report server. It has a parameter @ReportName assigned to the Parameter!ReportName.Value. The Dataset returns values when run on the dataset tab in the BI tool. Set up a Parameter ReportVersion that has a default value Query From based on the dataset ReportHeader and picking the ModDate column. It is the last parameter in the report parameters list. I assign a textbox to the parameter. When I preview, I get "The 'ReportVersion' parameter is missing a value whether I place it in the report body or page header (which is where I want it). I have deleted and added the parameter again, toyed with the hidden and internal settings on it. What does this error really mean, what I am missing, and can I even do this with parameters? Thanks In Advance Jim
