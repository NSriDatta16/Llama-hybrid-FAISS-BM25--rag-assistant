MongoDB or CouchDB - fit for production?

I was wondering if anyone can tell me if MongoDB or CouchDB are ready for a production environment. I'm now looking at these storage solutions (I'm favouring MongoDB at the moment), however these projects are quite young and so I foresee that I'm going to have to work quite hard to convince my manager that we should adopt this new technology. What I'd like to know is: Who is using MongoDB or CouchDB today in a production environment? How are you using MongoDB/CouchDB? What problems (if any) did you come across when you adopted this new storage mechanism (and how did you overcome them)? How did you deal with any migration issues that you had to deal with? Do you have any good/bad experiences with either of these solutions that you'd like to share?
