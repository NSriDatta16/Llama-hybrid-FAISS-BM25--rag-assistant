What technology problems arise from creating a markup language for email?

I am wondering what technology problems arise from associating a markup language to email? Without examining the language let us assume a hypothetical markup language exists with the following conditions: It meets all possible user-agent needs for properly structuring and defining content in email. It properly sanctions communications in a single document to allow multiple author contributions in representation of an email thread. It properly associates RFC 5322 similar header data to each instance of communication in the document using markup conventions. It solves all possible problems associated with accessibility, semantics, and other issues confined solely to the markup technology itself. It solves all possible security conditions with regards to application layer processing and solves absolutely no problems associated with transmission. The language may or may not be written in some derivative of XML and is immediately available XML derived technologies. The language instances require validation from the user-agent before they are allowed to be transmitted as email. With that being said what technology problems are associated with such a project? Will this present programming problems to user-agents? Would such a project prove incompatible to RFC 5322 form email where the content is to be only 7bit ASCII? Would such a technology prove harmful to email servers? Are there additional security problems associated with such a project? What are your other technology specific general thoughts about such a project? Please keep answers and responses as technology/programming focused as possible. I will down vote any comments related to business opinions or adoption.
