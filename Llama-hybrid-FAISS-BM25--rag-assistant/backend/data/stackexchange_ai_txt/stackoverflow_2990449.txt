When modern computers are said to be Turing Complete there is an unspoken exception for the infinite storage device Turing described, which is obviously an impossibilty on a finite physical computation device. If a computation device can do everything a Turing machine can do (infinite storage not withstanding) it is Turing complete for all practical intents and purposes. By this less strict definition of Turing completeness , yes, its possible that many neural networks are Turing complete . It is of course possible to create one that is not Turing complete .
