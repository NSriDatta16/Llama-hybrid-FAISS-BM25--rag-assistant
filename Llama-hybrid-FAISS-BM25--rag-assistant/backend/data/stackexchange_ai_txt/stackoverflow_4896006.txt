Something odd is happening in your service. First I think that insertEntityDate should not be callable because it is missing WebGet or WebInvoke attribute. Another strange thing is that getById is defined as WebGet but it is called as POST JSON request - I just checked it with FireBug and Fiddler: POST http://luiscarlosch.com/WCFProxy/ContactProxy.svc/getByID HTTP/1.1 Host: luiscarlosch.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.16) Gecko/20101130 Firefox/3.5.16 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-gb,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Proxy-Connection: keep-alive X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Referer: http://luiscarlosch.com/WebFormClean.aspx Content-Length: 15 Cookie: ASP.NET_SessionId=puzd3ulsj4em4ufd21b4lkjr Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache {"IDContact":1} The service works for me but it is not the same service described by contract you have shown us. Btw. there is no reason to enable serviceMetadata behavior and add Mex endpoints if you are not going to use SOAP endpoint as well.
