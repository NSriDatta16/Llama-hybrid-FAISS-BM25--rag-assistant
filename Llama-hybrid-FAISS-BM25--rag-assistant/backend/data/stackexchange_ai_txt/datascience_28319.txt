Convolution neural network: small dataset affecting accuracy

I have dataset of 36 folders 1 image each(total 36 images) the dataset is too small but these are character images which i want to train my val_acc= 0.0229 and y_pred=model.predict(x_test) always predict class=4 . How I can improve this accuracy for such a small dataset? Why does it always predict class 4?
