There are two approaches you can take. The first solution is to randomly pick k values from N values, which will ensure that you always have k points chosen. The second solution is to pick values randomly with each having an average probability p of being chosen, which could result in as little as 0 or as many as N being randomly chosen. Picking k from N values: You can use the function RANDPERM to create a random permutation of the integers 1 through N , then pick the first k values in the permuted list and replot them as red: index = randperm(N); plot(x(index(1:k)),y(index(1:k)),'r*'); Picking values with an average probability p : You can use the RAND function to pick a random value from 0 to 1 for each of your N values, then choose the ones with a random value less than or equal to your average probability p and replot them as red: index = (rand(N,1)
