I would install Aptana as an Eclipse plug-in. Allows you to latter down the road install GWT or Flex with no fuss. Plus, Aptana as a plug-in has worked much better for me. Both in terms of stability and of usability. I used to have Aptana crash on me every two days and since I'm running Eclipse with Aptana as a plug-in it never again crashed . Eclipse with Aptana as a plug-in also has some handy features, like spell-checking, that Aptana did not have and has greatly improved my comments. That said, I must agree with you on the great level of detail and attention Aptana team has put in their software.
