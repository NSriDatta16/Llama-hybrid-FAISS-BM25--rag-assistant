Text in tables?

I like to organize a lot of information from literature reviews in "tables" (information not unlike product comparisons, but for scientific research), but often the information I enter can contain lines or paragraphs of text and becomes unwieldy in a spreadsheet. I've heard SQL relational tables are often used for this purpose; for data analysis I use Python or R to parse data from a flat text file and enter this into SQLite. Should I just create a "marked up" text file and do the same thing? I wonder what interfaces people use to enter and also view such text-heavy tables? Or I wonder if there is another software that might be suited for this purpose.
