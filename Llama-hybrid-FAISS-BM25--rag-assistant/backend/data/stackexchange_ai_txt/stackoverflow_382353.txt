How can I set up Eclipse to use ssh-agent for cvs?

Several ways to ask this question: How can I get eclipse to use my ssh-config? How can I get eclipse to use /usr/bin/ssh instead of the internal implementation? (I am not completely sure it does, but it does not read Host-entries in .ssh/config) This is what I have tried: have CVS_ROOT in the environment eclipse starts in (I am asked for username and password, I know this setup works with command-line cvs) create a new repository location, with connection-type ext (message: unknown response received from cvs server: ) same, with extssh (error: cannot locate host, which means that .ssh/config is not being read, I refer to a Host-alias defined there) same, but with the dns-name of the server, this time I'm asked for the passphrase for my id_rsa-file, so eclipse seems to be aware of atleast parts of my ssh-setup. The passphrase-dialog is from eclipse, not the usual ssh-agent-dialog. I am using eclipse 3.4.1 on ubuntu 08.10
