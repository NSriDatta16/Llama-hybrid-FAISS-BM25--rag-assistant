vertical-align is only supposed to work on elements that are rendered as inline . is rendered as inline by default, but not all elements are. The paragraph block element, , is rendered as a block by default. Table render types (e.g. table-cell ) will allow you to use vertical-align as well. Some browsers may allow you to use the vertical-align CSS property on items such as the paragraph block, but they are not supposed to. Text denoted as a paragraph should be filled with written-language content or the mark-up is incorrect and should be using one of a number of other options instead. I hope this helps!
