NLTK includes support for using the MaltParser , see nltk.parse.malt.MaltParser . The pretrained English model for the MaltParser that's available here parses to the Stanford basic dependency representation. However, you would still need to call Stanford's JavaNLP code to convert the basic dependencies to the CCprocessed representation given above in your example parse.
