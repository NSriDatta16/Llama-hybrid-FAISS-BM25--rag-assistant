Reading a file via open().read() vs storing it in a variable

I've written this small app in Python that will generate paragraphs of dummy text, kind of like this site , except it'll work offline. Right now you're supposed to provide a reasonably long text file (I'm currently using books from Project Gutenberg), which it will call open() and then read() on to get the initial string for the operation, but what's to stop me from just including the whole text file in the program, as a variable? i.e lorem_ipsum = """ ***full text of De finibus bonorum et malorum*** ***no seriously*** ***yeah...*** """ Are there any disadvantages to doing this versus reading it in from a separate text file?
