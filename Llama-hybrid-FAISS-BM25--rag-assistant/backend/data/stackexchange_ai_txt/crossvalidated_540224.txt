Estimate argmax of function that is measured at discrete points

I have gathered simulation data of a function $f(x)$ , where $x$ is a continuous variable. I measure $f$ at discrete points $x_k$ . Since the underlying process is stochastic, I performed Monte Carlo simulations, and computed the mean of the function over several independent trials (seeds) (see the figure, left is the mean, right the different seeds). I am interested in the value of $x^*$ that maximises $f(x)$ on the given domain. Now, normally I would try to fit a curve to either the average quantity or each separate instance, however in this particular case I cannot find a function that fits the data. Additionally, I can imagine that finding a function that fits the data is in general either difficult or impossible. Where I can crudely estimate $x^*$ by simply computing the mean value of each separate instance, i.e. $x^* \approx 1/N \sum_i^N x^*_i$ , I have a feeling that this is either wrong on inaccurate. What method can generate an estimate of the value of $x^*$ that approximately maximises $f(x)$ ? If possible, I would like to have an estimate that includes error, i.e. that I know that $x^* = x_0 \pm \epsilon$ . Any source, direction guidelines or other help is greatly appreciated! To help with this particular example, the data points are the following: x = [1.05 1.1 1.15 1.2 1.25 1.3 1.35 1.4 1.45 1.5 1.55 1.6 1.65 1.7 1.75 1.8 1.85 1.9 1.95 2. ] f_x = [2.289e-09 7.491e-04 1.249e-02 3.193e-02 5.061e-02 6.281e-02 6.701e-02 6.735e-02 6.625e-02 6.451e-02 6.225e-02 5.955e-02 5.683e-02 5.384e-02 5.095e-02 4.811e-02 4.530e-02 4.238e-02 3.983e-02 3.727e-02] and the function values for each separate seed instance can be found on this Pastebin (if needed).
