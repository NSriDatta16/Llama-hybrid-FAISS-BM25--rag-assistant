Maybe you should refactor all the common domain-related classes to their own new project that can then be referenced by the other projects. On the other hand I could suggest a very bad workaround for the error you encounter by defining an explicit conversion between the structurally identical classes that only differ in name. But please don't do so. Put all the domain stuff (i.e. entitiy-related classes like Contact, Person, Organization, Customer etc.) to its own project and reference this from the projects that need the classes.
