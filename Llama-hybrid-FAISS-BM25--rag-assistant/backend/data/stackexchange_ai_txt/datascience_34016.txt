Binary Classification

I wanted to start off by saying this is not an exact duplicate of the other question. I checked it and it didn't have what I urgently need. So here is the problem. I have a dataset with 30 features and 100000 rows of train data. I want to make a Binary classification model which determines whether the person is eligible or not for membership at our club. I am a rookie data scientist, and binary classification is a first for me. So please help me and tell me which model would be the most accurate for this purpose. Also, the time taken by the model to train doesn't matter... Thank you so much update: Ok, I have used logistic regression and instead of giving some members as accepted(1) it is showing me al members do not get the membership...So I thought there might be a mistake in choosing the Model, so I am looking for other models...
