If you really want use it. Here is answer From: http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=523641 If you use a reasonably recent version of gcc, you can use: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "your option here" For example, if those headers produce a "floating point comparison is unsafe" error, you would use: #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wfloat-equal". Unluckily, you cannot disable "-Wall" that way (that would be too easy, wouldn't it...), you have to do the individual warning options which -Wall enables by hand (at least, the conflicting ones). Docs: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas EDIT: But it seems not work for gets warning... I tried on my pc.
