specaccum(..., model="random") will accumulate sampling units exactly in the same way with weights or without weights. With the same random seed, the sites will be in the same order. Element perm in the result object gives the accumulated species number of each random accumulation, and with the same random number seed this accumulated richness is exactly similar with and without weights! What is different is how these raw results are summarized. Without weights, the summarized results are direct row means and row SD's of these data. It is a bit more complicated with weights. Firstly, we find the accumulated weights for each permutation (column of perm ) and then we interpolate the accumulated richness at equally spaced accumulated weights when summarizing the mean and SD. The equally spaced accumulated weights are returned as element effort , and this effort can be used as the x -axis when plotting the results. In documentation (see help(specaccum) ) this is expressed as For weighted ‘"random"’ method the effort refers to the average effort per site, or sum of weights per number of sites. With weighted ‘method = "random"’, the averaged species richness is found from linear interpolation of single random permutations. Therefore at least the first value (and often several first) have ‘NA’ richness, because these values cannot be interpolated in all cases but should be extrapolated. The ‘plot’ function defaults to display the results as scaled to sites, but this can be changed selecting ‘xvar = "effort"’ (weighted methods) I would expect the average accumulation be rather similar with and without weights, but variance (or sd) increase when variable weights are used.
