You can profile this yourself by overriding the following UIResponder methods: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; Save a date stamp when a touch begins, increment a static counter when a touch moves, save another time stamp one when a touch ends, and then do some simple division: rate = (# of touches)/(time interval)
