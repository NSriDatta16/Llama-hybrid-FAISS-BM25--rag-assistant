PowerShell: best way to ensure function name uniqueness?

What's the best way to ensure your PowerShell function name is unique? The standard since version 1 is to put in a short unique id after the verb dash and before the noun. For example, with my initials I could create function Get-DWServer; this is fine until someone creates a function in a different module for getting an object reference to a datawarehouse and uses the same function name. Two or three letters just isn't sufficient but more than that gets ugly to read. I'd prefer to have a unique prefix* similar to .NET namespaces. It's better for organization, easier on the eye and works with tab completion. And it expands gracefully so you could name it DW.Get-Server or DW.Network.Get-Server. The downside of doing this is it runs afoul of PowerShell's proper verb check during module import/Export-ModuleMember. You can get around this by specifying DisableNameChecking during import but I'm wondering if doing this is sloppy and might be bad if PowerShell 3 comes out with a better solution. I know PS verb purists (are there any?) will complain that this probably 'hinders discovery' but I can't think of a better option. What do you do? (*You can refer to an exported function using module_name\function_name notation but this won't work with tab completion and still doesn't get around the problem of the function name being unique).
