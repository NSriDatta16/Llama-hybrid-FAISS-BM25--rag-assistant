Why is Standard Deviation used to evaluate the effect of a change in an independent variable on the dependent one?

I'm reading some economics papers about the relationship between inequality and growth and some of them have sentences like these: an increase of 0.07 (one standard deviation in the sample) in the income share of the top 20 percent lowers the average annual growth rate just below half a percentage point and the estimated coefficients imply that an increase in, say, the land Gini coefficient by one standard deviation (an increase of 0.16 in the Gini index) would lead to a reduction in growth of 0.8 percentage points per year Why is "one standard deviation" used? Why is it preferred to a unitary change? Thanks
