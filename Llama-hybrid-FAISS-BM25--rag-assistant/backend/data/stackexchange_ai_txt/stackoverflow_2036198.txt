In Visual Studio for an ASP.NET page you can use the DetailsView control to perform an insert. Follow these simple steps: Create a new Web Form in Visual Studio Make sure you're in Design View (and not Source View) Drag and drop a SqlDataSource onto the form (in the toolbox's Data category) Click on the little |> arrow next to the SqlDataSource's gray blob and run the Configure Data Source wizard Select the database and table and fields that you want On the last page of the wizard you can test the query to make sure it works Drag and drop a DetailsView onto the form (also in the toolbox's Data category) Click on the little |> arrow next to it and in the list of data sources choose the SqlDataSource that you just created Now you're done! Regarding your sample about raw HTML - that's generally not the recommended approach when using ASP.NET Web Forms. With Web Forms there are rich "server controls" that worry about most of the HTML rendering for you. They also have logic in them to help make a site more secure such as HTML encoding values.
