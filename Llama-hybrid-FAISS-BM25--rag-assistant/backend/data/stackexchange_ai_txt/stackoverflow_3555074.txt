I do not think this has an easy answer. I see two options: To trigger a re-run of cmake if an input changes, you might be able to make your input file depend on CMakeLists.txt . To run a cmake command as part of and add_custom_command , there is the variable ${CMAKE_COMMAND} , which will give you the path to the running cmake . You could, as part of the configure step, generate a fragment of CMake code (that calls configure_file ) that is invoked using the -P option. Either pass substitutions on the command line using -D , or write them to the CMake fragment.
