MVC ActionResult to use when returning html content

I have a some html fragment in memory that I need to render using RenderAction. For instance my action method looks something like this: var html = "some html code How do I make it render this html by using RenderAction, I don't want to create a view file because this is dynamic html. And I can't use any of the file results because this is not coming from a file. What other ways are there to accomplish this?
