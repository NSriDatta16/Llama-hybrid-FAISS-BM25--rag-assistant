Simplest way to explain why CLT require independence and not uncorrelatedness?

I am studying time series, and I am trying to understand why the CLT (central limit theorem) applies for independent observations, but not uncorrelated variables. What is the easiest way to understand that uncorrelated variables is too weak?
