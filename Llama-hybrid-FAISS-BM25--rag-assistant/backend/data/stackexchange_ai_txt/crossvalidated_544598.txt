A simpler answer - you could communicate confidence in a regression prediction using any of the following. For clarity, let's say your regression model is $\mu = \alpha + \beta X$ (Expected value) $y = \mu + \epsilon$ (Observed values are expected values plus residuals) $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$ (Residuals are Normally distributed with SD $\sigma$ ) You could report Mean absolute error, mean(abs(Îµ)) : In the training data, how far, on average, was each point from the regression line. Mean squared error, $\sigma$ : In the training data, what's the standard deviation of distances from the line. Confidence Interval: Reflects uncertainty in the the expected value $\mu$ . Prediction Interval: Reflects both uncertainty in $\mu$ , and the spread of the data due to $\sigma$ .
