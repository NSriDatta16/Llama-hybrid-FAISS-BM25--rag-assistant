Finding embedded namespace uri's

Given the following: You will note that embedded in this xml sample is an Organisation node with its' own namespace declared with xmlns="" This is declared like this rather than using a prefix. Is there any way of finding all the namespaces declared in an xml document using xpath? I have tried a few variations, unfortunately xmlns is not treated like any other attributes of a document (for obvious reasons) and I cannot find a way to get them out using xpath. //@* does not include them for instance. I need a list of all the xmlns attributes in the document.
