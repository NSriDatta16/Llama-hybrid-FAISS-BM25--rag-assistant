Text embeddings for words or very short sentences with a LLM

I tried to compute the semantic similarity between words or short sentences. Ex : inflation vs price raising I have tried the openai embeddings API and cosine distance but the results are very poor. I would prefer not to train a model on my own data but to rely on a pretrained LLM. Any alternative to openai embeddings API ? Thanks a lot
