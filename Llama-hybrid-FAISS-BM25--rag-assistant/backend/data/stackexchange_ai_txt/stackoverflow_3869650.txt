CSS getting distorted while using the custom WebUserControl in an ASPx page

I have a very simple Web UserControl derived from System.Web.UI.UserControl. At Design Time the user control looks perfect in the VS2008 Pane with all CSS styles. When I drag n drop this control on an aspx page, the CSS style gets applied but some texts get hidden and the CSS looks distorted. I have checked the path of the CSS, UserControl and the ASPx page. All are in the same level under root. The aspx page just contains the UserControl in a FORM tag. Any idea what is going wrong ?
