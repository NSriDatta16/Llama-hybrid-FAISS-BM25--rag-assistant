Biological replications with one extreme outlier

My problem is I have 3 biological replications (reps) withe each having 4-5 technical reps with two of the biological reps having comparable results for the treatment and control. These values represent the colonization of donor stem cells. (Treatment is about 50% of control) whereas in the third rep I still have ~50% drop from control but the values for both treatment and control are drastically reduced. Is there a statistical method to analyze this data because using a t-test obviously results in a non- significant p value? Or would it be best to just do an additional rep and throw out the last rep as an outlier as results from other experiments are comparable to the last 2 reps? Example - Biological reps below, average of technical reps Rep 1 control 300 treatment 150 Rep 2 control 230 treatment 112 Rep 3 control 24 treatment 11
