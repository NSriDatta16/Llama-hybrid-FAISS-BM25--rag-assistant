With a year of programming experience, I won't suggest Design Patterns (or Head First Design Patterns), as I think Design Patterns (the concepts) is best processed once you have more programming experience, perhaps more like 5-10 years of experience . I think the book, The Pragmatic Programmer: from Journeyman to Master by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas is perhaps your best bet for the most bang for your buck at the level you are at currently. Here is an excellent summary of the topics and contents (from Jeff Atwood at Coding Horror). Use inter-library loan if you cannot afford to purchase your own copy. Two other titles that are also language-agnostic yet classic books highly recommended for new programmers that you can keep in mind are The Mythical Man-Month (anniversary edition published in 1995) by Fred Brooks, and Code Complete (second edition) by Steven McConnell. These books will help expand your programming knowledge without overwhelming you at your current stage of development, and make for a solid foundation for becoming a better programmer. All of these books are constantly on the top of recommended programming books for serious programmers, and they are all "old" enough that they are clearly not a fad, but enduring recommendations not limited by a particular language, environment or tool-set.
