Questions about Excel worksheet embedding in WinForms application

I embed Excel worksheet in a WinForms C# application in two ways - using WebBrowser control and using dsoFramer control. In both cases i'm facing the following two problems: 1. How do i make my embedded spreadsheet read-only? The only way i discovered is by protecting the underlying Excel file, but it causes annoying message boxes to pop up all the time. 2. If i launch MS Excel in a separate process prior to launching my application, the standalone Excel freezes after my embedded worksheet is shown. Any thoughts?
