When you do game.CurrentCreature = unicorn; You overwrite the pointer in game.CurrentCreature with one to the unicorn object. The array still has a pointer to the dragon object. It shouldn't be changed, this is how pointers work. Edit: A little explanation of what happens with the pointers: First you created 2 objects Creature dragon = new Creature(); dragon.Name = "Dragon"; Creature Unicorn = new Creature(); dragon.Name = "Unicorn"; This made dragon have a pointer to your dragon object, and unicorn have a pointer to your unicorn object. Then you set the pointer of game.CurrentCreature to dragon's pointer. game.CurrentCreature = dragon; Then you add a pointer to dragon, the current creature, to the list List list = new List (); list.Add(game.CurrentCreature); Then you replace the pointer in game.CurrentCreature(was dragon) with a pointer to the unicorn object. game.CurrentCreature = unicorn; This will in no way affect the pointer held in the dragon object. Cheers,
