GLM Prediction Variance with Average Observations

Suppose I have data set where the observed values are averages and not necessarily individual data points. For example, suppose record 1 has the observed value of $Y_1 = 2.0$. However, I know that the number of observations for this record is 3. That is, $Y_1$ is an average of three data points say $1.0, 2.0, 3.0$ or even $2.0, 2.0, 2.0$. It is unknown how much variance is associated with record 1. Further suppose that I have 25,000 records and I can build a design matrix with all these averages as the response. Keep in mind that the observed weight is correct. I believe a GLM with a design matrix as described would produce similar averages to a GLM where the design matrix contains all the underlying data points. The problem lies with the variance of the prediction. My question is -- can I rely on the standard errors produced? Not in the conventional way, however. I would need to make some adjustment because the variance of the prediction has got to be smaller. Thoughts?
