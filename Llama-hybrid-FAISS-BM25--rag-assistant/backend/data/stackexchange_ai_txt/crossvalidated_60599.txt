Based on only the context we can get from the URL name, they are most likely using 15 SVMs, each of which tries to classify one class "versus" the rest (one-vs-all). Thus you need 15, and thus 15x15 confusion matrix. You make a good point - more than one of these might declare a new point as their own. What then? A simple way is to use the hyperplane that is output as the model for the SVM and compare the distance to the plane in all +1 class labelings and accept the class for which the distance from the point to the plane is the greatest (ie, was most confidently classified). The off-trace (incorrect) labelings the classifier makes are still done in the same way, ie, C_ij = count(we declared i, but was actually j)
