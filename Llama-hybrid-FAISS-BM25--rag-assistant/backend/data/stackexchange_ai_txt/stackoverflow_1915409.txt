I think it best just to have three UIView* references to the subviews in the parent view or view controller, all initially null, then to have subroutine to hide the other two views if they are visible and either construct and show or just show the new view. Assuming no extraordinary memory requirements. I think with such a small screen area load/unload concerns at the subview level are unlikely to be a concern, but if the parent views need to be loaded/unloaded, the subviews should all go (be both hidden and unloaded), and on reload, loadView should call the routine described in the last paragraph at startup. If there is in fact a great deal of memory or resource use by any of the three subviews, then my advice is reversed and each of the subviews and/or any memory-intensive objects behind them should be not only hidden but unloaded whenever possible. I think with your use of Google maps there, a need to unload when hidden might apply to that. Is this th right point to make? Is there some extra detail I'm missing?
