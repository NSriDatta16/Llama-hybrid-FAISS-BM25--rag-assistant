where can i find VARIANT type codes? (vboxapi problem)

I'm using vboxapi through the COM, and I noticed a bug... calling IMedium.CreateBaseStorage as they have defined it yields an error, "Invalid VARIANT type: 20". I changed the value of 20 to 19, which was the VARIANT of the other (integer) parameter: def _patch_createBaseStorage(self, aLogicalSize, aVariant): from win32com.client import Dispatch LCID = 0x0 ret = self._oleobj_.InvokeTypes(1610743844, LCID, 1, (9, 0), ((19, 1), #used to be: (20, 1), (19, 1)),aLogicalSize , aVariant) if ret is not None: ret = Dispatch(ret, u'CreateBaseStorage', '{A163C98F-8635-4AA8-B770-A9941737F3EF}', UnicodeToString=0) return ret however, this doesn't work, as the value is the size of the hard drive in bytes, meaning it can be at most 4 gigabytes, while I need to make 80, 120, 250 GB hard drives, etc. So what's the VARIANT type of an 8-byte integer? I assume it is VT_I8 , but what is the numerical value? And for future reference, where can I find them? If the value is 20 then i'm screwed, since that is the value that is failing... in that case, anyone else have advice?
