Any tutorial for embedding Clang as script interpreter into C++ Code?

I have no experience with llvm or clang, yet. From what I read clang is said to be easily embeddable Wikipedia-Clang , however, I did not find any tutorials about how to achieve this. So is it possible to provide the user of a c++ application with scripting-powers by JIT compiling and executing user-defined code at runtime? Would it be possible to call the applications own classes and methods and share objects? edit: I'd prefer a C-like syntax for the script-languge (or even C++ itself)
