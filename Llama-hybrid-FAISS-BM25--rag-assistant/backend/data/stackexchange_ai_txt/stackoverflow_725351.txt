You would want to migrate stuff that doesn't work in the transition from 1.4 to 5 (not sure what that would be), but I'd be wary of migrating stuff for the sake of it. If you do take this route, some questions: Do you have comprehensive test coverage ? If not, you should write unit tests for the code you're going to be migrating. Do you have components that are widely used within your codebase ? If so, they are probably candidates to be migrated in terms of their API (e.g. using generics etc.) In terms of what's widely used from Java 5. Generics is important and makes your life a lot easier. I don't see autoboxing too much, nor enums (this is all relative). Varargs almost never. Annotations are useful for frameworks, but I consume these. I don't think I've ever implemented one myself.
