What is probability distribution for a machine learning task?

I am new to machine learning. I feel confused of how to understand the probability distribution of the training set, like $p(y|x)$ and $p(x)$ , where $x$ is a training sample and $y$ is a label. Is there any concrete example to understand this? Further, it's said that the "ground truth" distribution is unknown and once you know it, there is nothing to learning. Could you help me clarify these words? Moreover, is it fair to say that a neural network or a deep learning model is learning the distribution of data? Thank you!
