While I am not a data scientist, I am an epidemiologist working in a clinical setting. Your research question did not specify a time period (ie odds of developing CKD in 1 year, 10 years, lifetime?). Generally, I would go through a number of steps before even thinking about modeling (univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, colinearity checks, etc). However, the most commonly used method for trying to predict a binary event (using continuous OR binary variables) is logistic regression. If you wanted to look at CKD as a lab value (urine albumin, eGFR) you would use linear regression (continuous outcome). While the methods used should be informed by your data and questions, clinicians are used to seeing odds ratios and risk ratios as these the most commonly reported measures of association in medical journals such as NEJM and JAMA. If you are working on this problem from a human health perspective (as opposed to Business Intelligence) this Steyerberg's Clinical Prediction Models is an excellent resource.
