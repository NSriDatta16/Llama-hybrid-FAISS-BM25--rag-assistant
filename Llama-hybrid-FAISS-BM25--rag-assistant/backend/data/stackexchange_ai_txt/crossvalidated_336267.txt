Why is the correlation coefficient a limited measure of dependence?

To quote Kevin Murphy in his book "Machine Learning - A probabilistic perspective" , correlation is "a very limited measure of dependence". He talks about this before he introduces the concept of mutual information. Why is the correlation coefficient "a limited measure of dependence"? Are there some assumptions associated with its computation?
