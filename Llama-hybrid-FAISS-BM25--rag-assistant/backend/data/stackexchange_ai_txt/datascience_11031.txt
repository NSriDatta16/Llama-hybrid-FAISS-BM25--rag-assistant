Any Master Thesis Topics related to NoSQL and Machine Learning or Business Intelligence?

Im currently in the last year, and I want to do a masters thesis on a topic that has NOSQL and Machine Learning or Business Intelligence. In my topic i want for defintely NOSQL, so I want to add a complementary topic (machine learning or business intelligence) to it. From my research i know that NOSQL: provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. And there are currently 4 types (key/value, column, document and graph). Machine Learning: is a subfield of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. So in short, for example can there be a thesis topic where i can evaluate which machine learning algorithm can be better implemented using data from a nosql database, or something like that. I would like to know your opinion. If you can't give NOSQL related to machine learning, also NOSQL related with Business Intelligence would be a great help aswell, since Business Intelligence "is a set of techniques and tools for the acquisition and transformation of raw data into meaningful and useful information for business analysis purposes".
