Interpretation of C hyperparameter in support vector classifier?

I found a contradiction between inteprpetation given by university book "Introduction to Statistical Learning" and all the other web sources. In the first one it is said that the larger is C the wider is the margin, while everywhere in the web (DataCamp, Towards Data Science, etc) it is said that the larger is C the smaller is the margin. Which of the two interpretations is correct? And which one is used by R and Python?
