Minimization parameters on machine learning

Hello I'm studying machine learning processes and I'm beside of a misunderstanding.. Is this right? "Minimization is a process that minimize the error rate of Y (output of the feature) to be a valid limiter and this is followed by an optimization process that acts on the parameters to find the best ones for the best model to choose" The only parameters I know in my head now are the FEATURES (X inputs). Which are the parameters to optimize? Technical parameters? Thanks for help!
