The wikipedia reference is excellent. It has a number of references to several books. My book Chernick (2007) covers time series. But the most thorough text on dependent data is Lahiri's text. I will provide these additional references. The two references are 1) Bootstrap Methods: A Practitioners Guide 2nd Edition, Michael R. Chernick (2007) Wiley. www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471756210.html 2) Resampling Methods for Dependent Data, S. N. Lahiri (2003) Springer. www.springer.com/us/book/9780387009285
