MySql - getting a row from latest non-null values in each column

I have a table and I would like to get a row containing all the latest non-null attributes for each column (without combining separate queries for each column, which doesn't seem elegant to me). Example: A B C Time 1 a 7 0 NULL NULL 3 1 3 NULL 4 2 NULL NULL 6 3 Result I seek: A B C 3 a 6 As I said, I know how to select what I want for each column separately, but I was wondering if there's a better way to do it. No need to tax the poor database if it isn't needed.
