Not really. Even though random forest promises to give you an OOB estimate of error rates, this is valid only for one run of the model. If you run the model repeatedly to get better results, you need a cross-validation strategy -- k-fold or LOO cross-validation -- to estimate your true error rates. Otherwise you are just throwing the dice as long as it takes to throw a six.
