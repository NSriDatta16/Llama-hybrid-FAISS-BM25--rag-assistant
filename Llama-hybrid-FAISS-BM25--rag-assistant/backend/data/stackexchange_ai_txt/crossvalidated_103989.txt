Ways to understand 2-dimensional time-series data

I'm working on 2D time series data where two attributes are depth and temperature. When I plotted depth-vs-temp curve and saw its variation over time, the fluctuation occurs at few places only. I'm not saying temperature is dependent on depth. But given these data, what should I look into to establish relationships between depth, temperature, time? Ideas: Look for depth regions where fluctuation in temperatures occurs over time. And develop time series prediction for these given regions. What models/papers should I study to get insights out of the data? I want to understand and study what are the various methods that could be tested and visualizations built over these data. It's a data exploration problem. Data shape: (2000,2,100) (samples,depth-temperature,time-sample) .i.e 2000 depth,temperature samples for each of 100 time stamps. Thanks.
