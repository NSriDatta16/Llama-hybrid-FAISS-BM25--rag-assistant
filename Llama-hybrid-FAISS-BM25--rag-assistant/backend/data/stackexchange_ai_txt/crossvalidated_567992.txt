Elastic net unfortunately doesn't produce standard errors for coefficients. It's actually pretty difficult to get standard errors when the problem isn't well-suited for OLS / GLM, for example when there are many predictor variables and/or predictors have multicollinearity. One option is to perform bootstrapping + elastic net to produce distributions of coefficients which can be used as estimates for standard errors. This has been a useful tool for me in practice, although I'm sure there are legitimate concerns from a theoretical perspective about bootstrapping in combination with a method that performs variable selection. Another option is a gaussian process model or Bayesian model as alternatives to elastic net. Either one should (I believe!) have ability to control overfitting and produce standard errors, although going this route will require more model specification and deliberate decisions. On a separate note, I recommend preparing a table of standardized coefficients from elastic net sorted by decreasing magnitude. This is a great and simple way to rank the importance and display the directionality of the predictor variable effects.
