You have basically two ways of doing this: ImageResource Article 1 Article 2 You can just drag and drop your image into the war-folder of your project. If you want to display that image you would just create an HTML object and use the setContent()-function to display it(using the img-tag you know from HTML) I would use number 1 because it uses css sprites to optimize the loading time of your application.
