C - how to check whether all required fields of a structure are filled? (most elegant method)

I have a function, which has a pointer to some structure as its argument. How can I check within this function, whether all required fields of the structure have been filled before a function call? example: //lib.c void f(X_type *x) { ... } //user.c main(){ X_type object; object.name = "I am X"; object.ID = 1; ... f(X_type &object); }
