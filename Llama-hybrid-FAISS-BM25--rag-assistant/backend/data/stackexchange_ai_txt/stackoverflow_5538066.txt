Building kd-tree in cuda

For example I have array of (x,y) points and I want to organize them in kd-tree Building kd-tree includes sorting and computing bounding boxes. These algorithms work fine on CUDA, but is there any way to build kd-tree utilizing as many threads as possible? I think there should be some tricks: Usually, kd-tree is implemented with recursion, but as far as I know, CUDA processors don't have hardware stack, so recursion should be avoided. How can I build kd-tree in Cuda effectively?
