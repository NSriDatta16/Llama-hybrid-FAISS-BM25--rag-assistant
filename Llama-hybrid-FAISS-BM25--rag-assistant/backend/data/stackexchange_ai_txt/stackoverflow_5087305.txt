in .h file declare UITableView *myTableView and the property as @property(nonatomic , retain) IBOutlet UITableView *myTableView finally synthesize the variable in .m file. Now only build your project and go to IB. You will be able to see the IBOutlet in File Owner Attribute Inspector. Connect it to the table you dragged from Library and then connect the datasource and delegate to the owner. save and exit the Interface Builder. Now Build and Run the project, ur should work fine Hope this works!!
