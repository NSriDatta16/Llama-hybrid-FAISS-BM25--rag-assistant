Some influential journals in machine learning: IEEE TPAMI Journal of Machine Learning Research Neural Computation Neurocomputing Pattern Recognition Letters Note that in machine learning some big conferences are considered equivalent to journal publications (NIPS, KDD), similar to computer science. I don't know if this trend also occurs in stats, I think not.
