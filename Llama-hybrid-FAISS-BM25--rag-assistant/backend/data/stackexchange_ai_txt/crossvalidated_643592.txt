Regression with depended predictors, animal study sample size

I have a few questions for help, One of my predictors is for treatment and control. Another predictor is dosage. Treatment group has 4 dose levels which control group only has one. Can I still use regression, and model treatment/control and dosage as two predictors? Is it better to include an interaction? Similarly, one predictor genotype has two levels: TG and WT. Both treatment and control can apply to TG animals, whereas WT animals only receive treatment. Should I use two predictors or merge them into one, e.g. TG treated, TG control, WT treated? are the standard sample size calculation from power analysis, or newly developed approaches e.g. Hsieh 1998, applicable to animal studies? Due to ethnical reasons, people try to lower the sample size for animal study as much as possible. The general rules from linear regressions, 10 observations per variable, should not apply to animals right? Hsieh, F. Y., Bloch, D. A., & Larsen, M. D. (1998).
