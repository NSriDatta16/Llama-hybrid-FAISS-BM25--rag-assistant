Hastie and Tibshirani defines that linear regression is a parametric approach since it assumes a linear functional form of f(X). Non-parametric methods do not explicitly assume the form for f(X). This means that a non-parametric method will fit the model based on an estimate of f, calculated from the model. Logistic regression establishes that p(x) = Pr(Y=1|X=x) where the probability is calculated by the logistic function but the logistic boundary that separates such classes is not assumed, which confirms that LR is also non-parametric
