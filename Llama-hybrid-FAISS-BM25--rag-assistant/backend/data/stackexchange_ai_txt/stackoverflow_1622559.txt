New to iPhone SDK: touchesBegan not called

I created a very very basic iPhone app with File/New Projet/View-Based application. No NIB file there. Here is my appDelegate .h @interface MyAppDelegate : NSObject { UIWindow *window; MyViewController *viewController; } .m - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { // Override point for customization after app launch [window addSubview:viewController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; } And here is my loadView method in my controller - (void)loadView { CGRect mainFrame = [[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]; UIView *contentView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:mainFrame]; contentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor]; self.view = contentView; [contentView release]; } Now, in order to catch the touchesBegan event, I created a new subclass of UIView: .h @interface TouchView : UIView { } .m - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"Touch detected"); } and modified the second line in my loadView into this : TouchView *contentView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:mainFrame]; Why is touchesBegan never called?
