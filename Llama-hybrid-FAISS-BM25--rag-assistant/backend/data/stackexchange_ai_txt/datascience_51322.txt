First of all, welcome to the data science Stack Exchange. You should really use what you like. Half of my colleagues use Linux, the other half including myself OSX. It really comes down to what you are familiar with. For me, OSX provides a good balance of good user experience while still being easily able to work with bash and use all of the features of UNIX based system. Also, the MacBooks are a great build quality, but a quality which is kinda pricey. I have also installed Debian on my MAC as a dual boot, however, I have not started it up for the past few months. It is really hard to find any tool which does not work on OSX. You can use pretty much any system and computer to do DS.
