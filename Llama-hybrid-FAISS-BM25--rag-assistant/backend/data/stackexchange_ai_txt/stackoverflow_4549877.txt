The error means the system closed the socket. This could be because it detected that the client disconnected, or because it was sending more data than you were reading. A parser for network protocols typcally needs a lot of work to make it robust, and you can't tell how much data you will get in a single read(), e.g. you may get more than your operation code and packet size in the first chunk you read, you might even get less (e.g. only the operation code). Double check this isn't happening in your failure case.
