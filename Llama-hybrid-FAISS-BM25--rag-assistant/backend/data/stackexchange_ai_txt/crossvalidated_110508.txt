Questions on PCA: when are PCs independent? why is PCA sensitive to scaling? why are PCs constrained to be orthogonal?

I am trying to understand some descriptions of PCA (the first two are from Wikipedia), emphasis added: Principal components are guaranteed to be independent only if the data set is jointly normally distributed . Is the independence of principal components very important? How can I understand this description? PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. What does 'scaling' mean there? Normalization of different dimensions? The transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance under the constraint that it be orthogonal to the preceding components . Can you explain this constraint?
