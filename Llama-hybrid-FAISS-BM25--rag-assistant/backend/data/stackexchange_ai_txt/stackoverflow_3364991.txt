Deprecated Date methods in Java?

What is really meant when using Java Date utilities and something has been deprecated. Does this mean that it is discouraged to use, or does it imply that it is forbidden? I am guessing it is bad practice to use deprecated methods, but am not sure and wanted to find out. For example, I am trying to use code such as the following String date = request.getParameter("date"); model.setDate(new Date(date)); Of course...this is a high level example, but in this situation, my model uses type Date and I need to pull the date off the request as a String and create a date with it. It works fine how I have it, but it is using a deprecated method. EDIT - I have gone back and used SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(); model.setDate(formatter.parse(request.getParameter("date"); The date is in the format MM/DD/YYY like 07/23/2010 but I am getting a ParseException What could this be from?
