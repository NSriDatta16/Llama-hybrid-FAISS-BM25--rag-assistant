You cannot efficiently store and manipulate thousands of rows of data in Javascript. Database engines such as MySQL have all sorts of gubbins (indexes, caches), to speed up searching (queries). Javascript has none of this, and you can optimize your method of storage and searching algorithms as much as you want, but you will never accomplish an efficient solution. Pagination should be on the server. The server sends you 30 rows of data, when you want more, you request more from the server; usually in the form of either a new page load to replace the current contents with another set of results, or an AJAX request to append/ prepend the new content to the existing. When you want to search the data, using Javascript is fine for searching within the content you have on the page (~10's of rows), but for searching the whole dataset, send the query to the server and let your database engine do the work.
