No, this is afaik the only official way to get user agent string. Btw, the string returned is something like this: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 1.1; en-gb; dream) AppleWebKit/525.10+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0.4 Mobile Safari/523.12.2 â€“ G1 Phone Http servers use user agent string to serve browser-specific versions of documents. This would only make sense if you want a mobile version of some page and/or if you want to display this later in Android's browser.
