I wouldn't say that I always have class per table, especially when you have many to many relationships. Based on your table above I would have 2 classes... I am not sure why you have both and id and a person_type_id, to me they would be the same thing but here are the classes. Person { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public List { get; set; } } PersonType { // I would discourage from using Type as property name as it is a keyword... public string [Type] { get; set; } }
