You need to add a set of data values to insert. These would be in the form ("Robert","Brown","Robert.Brown@uni.com","34")("Robert","Smith","Robert.Smith@uni.com","33") What version of PHP are you using? for php5.3 you could try: $values = array(); foreach($corporate as $line){ $values[] = "('".implode("','",array_map(function($x){ return addslashes($x); })) . "')"; } $query = "INSERT INTO students ('fname','lname','email', 'age') VALUES"; $query .= implode($values); $record = mysql_query($query); Otherwise, try: $values = array(); foreach($corporate as $line){ foreach($line as $i=>$item) $line[$i] = addslashes($item); $values[] = "('".implode("','",$line) . "')"; } $query = "INSERT INTO students ('fname','lname','email', 'age') VALUES"; $query .= implode($values); $record = mysql_query($query); To solve the second part of your problem, you need to edit the table definitions and remove the "NOT NULL" definition that sits on each field. Do you have php my admin on the server? you could do it through that by editing the table and fields, otherwise you could run the sql using ALTER TABLE. Let me know if you want more information on that.
