WLST: Remote deployment of an application on weblogic

I am trying to deploy an application remotely on WebLogic. I am using WLST in a python script. I am using deploy command to do that. When I give the path of my war of any location which is accessible to my remote machine all goes well, but when I give any location which is not accessible to remote machine it fails. Now I know the solution that by default upload is false hence the remote WebLogic needs an access to the war location, but I have tried it with setting upload true but still deployment fails with an error like: Deployment Message : weblogic.management.ManagementException: [Deployer:149003]Unable to access application source information in '/app/jamagentAdminServer.war' for application 'jamagent_AdminServer'. The specific error is: No application files exist. No stack trace available. Am I missing something? I am using the command: deploy('jamagent_'+ServerName,jamagentwarpath+'/jamagent'+ServerName+'.war', targets=ServerName, timeout=600000, upload='true') so if I remove upload='true' clause and make sure that jamagentwarpath is a location accessible to remote machine, then everything goes fine. I hope I am clear with my question.
