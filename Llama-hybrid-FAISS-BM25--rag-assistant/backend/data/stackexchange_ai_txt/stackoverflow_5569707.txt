Java Transformer with parameter

I'm using Java (JAXP) for XML transformation and I need to pass a fragment of xml as parameter to the transformer: Passport Proof of identity Driving License Proof of address Let's say xmlfrag contains the above piece of xml. I pass it to the transformer: transformer.setParameter("orset", xmlfrag); What is the type that xmlfrag needs to be so I can access it as xml during the transformation? I tried string and xmltype but no luck.
