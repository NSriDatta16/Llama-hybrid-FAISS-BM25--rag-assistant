Ingredients, Recipes and recipe ratings. I would like to predict the rating based on combination of ingredients

I would really appreciate some help on the first steps to my problem, suggestions of modeling techniques i could use or relevant research (i could not find any). I have a list of ingredients (150 in total) and a list of recipes (100 or so) with data on which combination of ingredients are present in each recipe (on average 4-5 ingredients per recipe). My output variables are 4 metrics of ratings of those recipes (taste, smell, look, and texture) for each of those 100 recipes from a scale of 1-10 for each. My aim is to predict the 4 metrics based on a new combination of ingredients (picked from the list) that i specify. What modeling technique should I look at to help solve this prediction problem?
