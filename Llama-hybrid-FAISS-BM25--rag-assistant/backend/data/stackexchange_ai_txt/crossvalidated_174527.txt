How can I estimate the influence/significance of the every observation on classification?

There are many ways to estimate the significance of the features on the classification model. But how I can estimate the influence of the every observation on the classification quality ? My thinking is that for every observation the feature significance is not equal, but how to estimate this (if possible)? I use different algorithms for classification: random forest (+GBM) and SVM mainly. Probably, leave-one-out ? Can you please suggest the reading material on the topic?
