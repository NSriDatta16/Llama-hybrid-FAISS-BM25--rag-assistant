My blasphemous 2 cents: Text-based messages work really well on the web, like, HTTP for example. It's easy to create, send, debug systems where the messaging is done in human-readable text. So, maybe the same thing with the messaging between your SQL Server layer and the layer above it. Using text as part of the messaging might be making your development more agile and your debugging easier. Maybe the senior developers are being pragmatic and you should maybe be open to setting aside pre-conceived notions of correctness. Debate the design choice on its own merits, not based on notions of correctness. (There is fashion in software development too)
