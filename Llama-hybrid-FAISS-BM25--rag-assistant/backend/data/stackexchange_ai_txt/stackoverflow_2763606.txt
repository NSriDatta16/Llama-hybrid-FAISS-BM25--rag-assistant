You probably mixing two different questions: How to organize data in your program (in-memory) - this is the part about using structures. How to serialize data, that is to store it in external storage e.g. in file. This is the part about "tabular" format that implies text with fields delimited by tabs. If IP and domain often come together in your program then it is reasonable to use structure or class (in C++) for that. Regarding your example I do not know restrictions on domain name lenght but "20" would be definitely insufficient. I'd suggest using dynamically allocated strings here. For storing IP (v4) address you may use 32 bit unsigned int - char is insufficient. Do you intend to support IP v6 also? then you need 128 bit for address. In C (and C++) there is no built-in serialization facility like one in virtually every dynamic (or "managed") language like C#, Java, Python. So by defining a structure you do not automatically get methods for writing/reding your data. So you should use some library for serialization or write your own for reading/writing your data.
