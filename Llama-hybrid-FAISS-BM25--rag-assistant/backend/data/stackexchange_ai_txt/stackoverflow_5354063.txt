How to initialize an std::string using ""?

I'm facing problems with initializing a std::string variable using "" (i.e. an empty string). It's causing strange behavior in code that was previously working. Is the following statement wrong? std::string operationalReason = ""; When I use the following code everything works fine: std::string operationalReason; operationalReason.clear(); I believe that string literals are stored in a separate memory location that is compiler-dependent. Could the problem I'm seeing actually be indicating a corruption of that storage? If so, it would get hidden by my usage of the clear() function. Thanks.
