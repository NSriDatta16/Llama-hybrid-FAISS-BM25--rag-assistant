The usual way of dealing with this is to make them pointers and then dynamically allocate them or even just assign the pointer from the address of a static instance of the other struct. struct a { struct b *bb; }; struct b { struct a *aa; }; struct a a0; struct b b0; void f(void) { a0.bb = &b0; b0.aa = &a0; } I would suggest, however, that you look for a tree-structured organization. Perhaps both objects could point to a common third type.
