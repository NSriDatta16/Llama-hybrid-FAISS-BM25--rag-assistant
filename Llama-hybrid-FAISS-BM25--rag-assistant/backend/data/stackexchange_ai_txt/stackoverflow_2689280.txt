Under reasonable assumptions, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the power/energy/variance of a time series into scales. It is an energy-preserving transform in that the total variance contained in the original time series is contained in the squared wavelet coefficients (properly normalized), just like the DFT! I think the text Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis by Percival and Walden is an excellent resource for this type of information. Now, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is a redundant transform and the energy-preserving property (in the DWT) no longer holds. However, you can still look at the squared wavelet coefficients to produce the "scalogram" which is similar to the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT; aka spectrogram). Torrence and Compo have some nice wavelet software to do this, with a paper to explain the method(s) in the context of atmospheric time series. I'm sure the matlab wavelet toolbox also performs the CWT and associated scalogram.
