How to find out or where to specify path of the JavaEE project?

I develop Java EEapplication and I have to create some files in the src folder in the my application. But I dont where or how to specify the path. I want my application to be portable. It means just to say TestProject/src/.... and not C:/bla/bla/TestProject/src/... do we specify this in some app file like web.inf, meta-inf or its just some trick. Thanks!
