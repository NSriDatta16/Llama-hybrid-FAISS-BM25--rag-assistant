Inspect each prediction in random forest

When we use elastic-net model for classification, we can check the coefficients and feature observations for each prediction, especially for those misclassified samples. For random forest, what are the methods to inspect each prediction? Besides looking at the variables that have top importance, is there any other way to get insights on which feature may be problematic in the model? It seems not quite convenient to print out some specific tree path to follow the prediction rules. Any suggestions on this?
