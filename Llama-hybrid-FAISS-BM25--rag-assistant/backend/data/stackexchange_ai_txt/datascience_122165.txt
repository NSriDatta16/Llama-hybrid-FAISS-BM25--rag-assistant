This seems like a time series problem. So I suggest you look into statistical methods like ARIMA. You could also try using the prophet library. Otherwise, you could also try deep learning approaches using LSTM models. The choice of model would also depend significantly on whether your data shows trend and seasonality, whether you want light or complex models.
