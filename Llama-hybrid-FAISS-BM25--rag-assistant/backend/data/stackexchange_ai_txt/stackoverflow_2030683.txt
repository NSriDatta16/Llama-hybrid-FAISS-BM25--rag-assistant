To prevent this change from completely breaking independent parts of your program (such as other ruby gems you are using), make a separate class for your insensitive hash. class HashClod 1 you_insensitive['CLod'] = 5 puts you_insensitive['clod'] # => 5 After overriding the assignment and retrieval functions, it's pretty much cake. Creating a full replacement for Hash would require being more meticulous about handling the aliases and other functions (for example, #has_key? and #store) needed for a complete implementation. The pattern above can easily be extended to all these related methods.
