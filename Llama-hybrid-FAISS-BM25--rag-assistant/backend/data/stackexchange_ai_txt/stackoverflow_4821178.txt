Organizing by module allows developers to focus on feature sets as the unit of delivery rather than technical infrastructure. Scaling your code base is probably easier if you break things up based on modules - some open source projects whose code I have looked at (such as Artifactory and Continuum) organized things this way, but I haven't looked at enough to know if this is the general trend. It probably does depend though, depending on your code base size.
