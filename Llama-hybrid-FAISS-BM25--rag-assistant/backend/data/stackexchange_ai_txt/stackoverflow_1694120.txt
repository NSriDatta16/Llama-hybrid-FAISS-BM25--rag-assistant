You can store your Room objects in a List or a Set or (as Lars D suggested) an array. Within Room, I think a nice way to store exits (considering they could be other than just the 4 cardinal directions) would be in a Map, with an Enum for the direction and the adjoining Room as the value. That's pretty efficient in storage space and should also be quick enough to navigate through.
