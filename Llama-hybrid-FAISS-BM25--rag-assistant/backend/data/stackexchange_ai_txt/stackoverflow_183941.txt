It appears that this is a FAQ , and the resolution offered is: Simple search (Ctrl+H) without regexp You can turn on View/Show End of Line or view/Show All, and select the now visible newline characters. Then when you start the command some characters matching the newline character will be pasted into the search field. Matches will be replaced by the replace string, unlike in regex mode. Note 1: If you select them with the mouse, start just before them and drag to the start of the next line. Dragging to the end of the line won't work. Note 2: You can't copy and paste them into the field yourself. Advanced search (Ctrl+R) without regexp Ctrl+M will insert something that matches newlines. They will be replaced by the replace string.
