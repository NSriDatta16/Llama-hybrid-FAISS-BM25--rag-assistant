jQuery based file tree - How to drag and drop files in directories

I am creating a file tree using PHP & jQuery, but I'm having trouble setting it up so I move files around. How might I go about doing this? So if my directory is: parent/ images/ css/ js/ js-test.js I can move js-test.js to css folder using jQuery. I figure it involves sortable, draggable, and droppable but I cannot get it to work. Right now I'm using a simple $(".php-file-tree ul").sortable({ connectWith : ".php-file-tree ul" }); The main problem being I don't want to re-order items and it's a little glitchy. I also want standard behavior allowing me to drop a file into a closed folder, which doesn't work using this code.
