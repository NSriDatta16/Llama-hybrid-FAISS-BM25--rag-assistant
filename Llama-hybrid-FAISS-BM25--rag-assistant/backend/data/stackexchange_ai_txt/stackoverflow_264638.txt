The only way I can think of doing this is not elegant: Create a hidden form with it's timer interval set to 10 seconds (or whatever interval you need). When the Forms' timer event fires, iterate through the open reports collection and close and re-open each one found. Something along the lines of: Public Sub RefreshOpenReports() Dim rpt As Report With Reports ' Iterate over all open reports... For Each rpt In Reports rpt.Requery Next End With End Sub
