I am not so sanguine about assuming 1 to 3 = bad and 4 to 5 = good. But, if you do that, then you can do logistic regression with "marital status" as the dependent variable and "group" as one of the independent variables. You may want to add covariates. Indeed, I'd be very suspicious of an analysis that a) was not randomized and b) Did not include covariates. You mention a bunch of independent variables (without saying what they are) and these may be good candidates.
