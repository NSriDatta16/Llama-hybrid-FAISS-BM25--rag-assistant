session expiring is not caused by the url structure. have you check? Configure::write('Session.timeout', '3600'); in core.php. make it longer Configure::write('Security.level', 'high'); in core.php. make it medium or low Configure::write('Session.checkAgent', false); in core.php make it false. can cause problem with ajax calls
