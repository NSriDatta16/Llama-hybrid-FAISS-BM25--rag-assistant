An idea is split the 10 years of data into 10 separate datasets which span a single year. Then, only use the portion of each year where the bird population is increasing. Perhaps you just select a date range to use in each year. With these 10 sectioned data sets, divide them by their maximum value such that they are normalized (only range from 0 to 1). Now, use logistic regression (fitting tool may be available in excel) to fit the 10 data sets separately. The function you are fitting looks like this: $$ a(d) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(d-\mu)/s}}. $$ The fitting tool should provide a $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to make the above function fit each of your data sets. $\mu$ roughly indicates the value of $d$ where your bird behavior has "transitioned". You can plot $\mu$ for each of the 10 years to see how it has changed!
