How can I determine a file extension given a file path in LaTeX?

I am attempting to write a LaTeX package which leverages the minted package's \inputminted command. My \mycommand command takes two parameters, the first being a path to a file, and I want to pass the file's extension to the \inputminted command: \newcommand\mycommand[2]{ \inputminted{#1}{...} } Note that the above won't work since the full path is passed to \inputminted. Example: \mycommand{/path/to/Test.java}{blah} should invoke \inputminted{java}{...}
