Content Delivery Systems, and reducing file size. The first one lets them have their files stored in servers in data centers around the world, thus having a lower transit and storage cost to the user. This means faster downloads/streaming. The second comes in many forms. Most notably reducing resolution, adjusting the bitrate, and using advanced codecs. If you reduce a 640x480 resolution video to 320x240, you need aproximately 1/4th the space to store it. Likewise, using a lower bitrate makes a video blockier, but that loss of precision is also a loss in file size. Finally, more advanced codecs like h.264 can compress the same video, at the same visual quality, smaller than older or simpler codecs, like MPEG1 or DivX.
