Retrieving time series from a smoothed periodogram

If I were to smooth a periodogram and then filter out low level frequencies, how can I derive the filtered time series? For example, in the case of a non-smoothed periodogram: https://folk.uib.no/ngbnk/kurs/notes/node107.html For example: ##MWE set.seed(100) funct 200&t $spec[t]>10){dstar[t] spec[t]}else{dstar[t]=0} } plot(dstar,type="o") That is, how would I in this case retrieve the time series from the filtered (smoothed) spectral density?
