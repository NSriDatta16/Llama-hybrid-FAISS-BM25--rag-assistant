In some cases, you have to normalize/standardize the input data, especially if there are different large scales between the features. A use case I faced recently, trying to fit a logistic regression to the data in the figure below: Here are the values of the intercept, w1 for the Age and w2 for EstimatedSalary, (array([-2.24944689e-10]), array([[-2.10415172e-09, -2.69301403e-06]])), The model has dismissed/neglected the age feature, Decision boundary in this case is illustrated in Figure below Now, let's apply MinMax normalization on the Age and EstimatedSalary columns, Here are the intercept, w1, and w2 values (array([-4.55319723]), array([[5.535191 , 2.77997059]])) and below the new decision boundary That's all, I hope this can help you guys to understand that sometimes scaling (normalization / standardization) is very important! Thank you
