Optimization taking into account the shape of the optimization surface

I want to find the maximum of my multidimensional optimization surface, but I want to find not just the local maximum (highest), but the maximum that seems to me the most stable from my point of view. He should be not only tall but also wide I will explain in the picture with one-dimensional space The picture shows two maximums, red is the global maximum but I would not like to take it, it looks more like an outlier. I would like to take the green maximum as it is more suitable for me My question is: how can this be done in R or is there a ready-made package that does this UPD======= This should be the maximum point around which also gives good results in terms of the fitness function. the wider the area from these points, the better the higher the values of the fitness function in this area, the better UPD======= fitness function probably stochastic UPD2======== I am trying to find neural network weights for very unstable data with my fitness function.. Data transformations, cross validation doesn't work for me. I assume that the model will work if I find a fairly stable maximum when optimizing the weights. I assume that if the maximum is wide, then the model will work better with unstable data. The picture is just an example (I have no idea what the optimization surface looks like) The bottom line is that I do not need global maximums, I need a wide maximum for the stable operation of the neural network
