When you are trying to recognize objects, edges, etc., the algorithms generally look for deviation from nearby or summed/averaged elements. The deviation could be negative or positive, but in most cases it is a "recognition" regardless of the polarity. The algorithms impart polarity due to the mathematics, but the interpretation doesn't care if it is a deviation up or down. However, some filters and algorithms do carry information in the polarity. If you combine one where polarity matters with one where polarity does not, then you want to be sure you are adding a "recognition" properly, so the filter is augmented appropriately and not inappropriately pushed more negative or more positive.
