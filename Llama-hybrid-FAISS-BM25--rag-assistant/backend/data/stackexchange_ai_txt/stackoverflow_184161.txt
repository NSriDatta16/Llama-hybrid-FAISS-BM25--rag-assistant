The number of codes added for a given task largely depends on who is writing the code. It shouldn't be used as a measure of productivity. A given individual can produce 1000 lines of redundant and convoluted crap while the same problem could be solved by another individual in 10 concise lines of code. When trying to use LOC added as a metric, the "who" factor should also be taken into account. An actually useful metric would be "the number of defects found against number of lines added". That would give you an indication of the coding and test coverage capabilities of a given team or individual. As others have also pointed out, LOC removed has better bragging rights than LOC added :)
