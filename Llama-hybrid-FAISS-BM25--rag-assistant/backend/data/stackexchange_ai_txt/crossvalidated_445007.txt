does propensity score matching apply when the treament group was selected not naturally occuring?

I think of propensity score matching as a method for finding a comparison group for a naturally occurring group like students who attend private school. But if you have a group that was selected for an intervention (not randomly) but by application does it make sense to use propensity scores to find a comparison group? Also an entire organization was selected not individual students.
