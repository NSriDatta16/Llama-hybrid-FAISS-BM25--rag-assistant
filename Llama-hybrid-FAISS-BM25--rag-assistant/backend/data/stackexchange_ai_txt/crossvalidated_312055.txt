Is there a way -- a rule of thumb procedure -- to deflate time series that is agreggated yearly without a yearly deflator?

Suppose I have yearly nominal data -- sales in US$ at the end of december -- and monthly CPPI. Since I cannot attain the right distribution of sales accross the months of the year, deflating the variables could produce different results in comparison to monthly data. Is there any discussion on this topic that could lend some help? My approach has been to use the yearly variation of CPPI, but I was trying to figure out how to approach this in order to approximate the value if I had monthly sales.
