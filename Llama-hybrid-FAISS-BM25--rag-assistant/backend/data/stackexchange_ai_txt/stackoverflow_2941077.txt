The general process would be something like this: Set a cookie using js. Then create a function that retrieves the cookie and redirects. Then trigger an onclick or an onmousedown even like onmousedown='retriveAndRedirect()' Check out there resources. QuircksMode's JavaScript Cookies Reference. W3School's JavaScript Cookies Reference. UPDATE: I see what you're trying to do here. In order for your redirection to work from any site, that site has to host your redirection and preference method somehow using js, html, serverside script, etc... Your other option would be to build a plugin which the user would have to download, that way you wouln'd need any site host your redirection and preference methods for you. As far as your link retrieval methods go you can either use cookies, or store the links in a database and then call on trigger.
