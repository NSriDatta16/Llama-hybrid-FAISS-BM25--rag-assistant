You seem to be asking a lot of questions on Information Theory. Please can I just recommend some books I've found very helpful rather than try to regurgitate what they say: (in order of historical importance) "Concepts in Statistical Mechanics" - Arthur Hobson "The Mathematical Theory of Communication" - Claude E. Shannon & Warren Weaver "The Uncertain Reasoner's Companion" - J. B. Paris "Elements of Information Theory" - Thomas M. Cover & Joy A. Thomas "Information Theory" - Robert B. Ash
