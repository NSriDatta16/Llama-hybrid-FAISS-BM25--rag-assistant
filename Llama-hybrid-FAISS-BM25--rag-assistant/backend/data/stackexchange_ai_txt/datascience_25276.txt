How does neural network solve XOR problem

I'm reading a wonderful tutorial about neural network. This is the best tutorial I've ever seen but I can't understand one thing as below: In the link above, it is talking about how the neural work solves the XOR problem. It says that we need two lines to separate the four points. But I don't know the second table. XOR: input1 input2 output 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 First table: input1 input2 output 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 In my opinion, the first table is OK because it includes the XOR, which means that what the second table need to do is to remove the forth input. So I think the second table should be as below: input1 input2 output 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 How in the link it says the second table is like this: input1 input2 output 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 In a word, I can understand why the single layer neural network can't solve the XOR problem but I can't understand how the two layers neural network work to solve it.
