Can I compare coefficient values from different models?

I'm modeling conversions with a logistic regression. Each conversion can have up to 3 events (page visit, fill questionnaire, and call). I have 3 domains let's call them A,B, and C. Rather than using the domain as a model variable, I want to create 3 models modelA By comparing the models like this, I'm hoping I can draw insights such as "visits in A were more important than visits in C". i.e. Basically compare the coefficients of visit/quest/call across the different models. Is this sound analysis?
