I have the same issue. Whatever JSP editor is in Ganymede does not like my if/else scriptlets: Please login to view your account information. It tells me: Syntax error on token "}", delete this token Syntax error on token "catch", Identifier expected Syntax error, insert "Finally" to complete TryStatement ...on the final closing brace. I have the same file associations as the original poster. I suppose I will try to find another JSP editor in the WTP toolkit, but I was under the impression that came with my build.
