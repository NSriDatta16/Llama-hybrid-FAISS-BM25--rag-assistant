See the answer to another post, on using RTEFC or RTMAC at Multivariate time series clustering This would eliminate the separate batch processing step. You don't really need a separate classifier either - a new condition is either "close enough" to the closest centroid, and declared a member of that cluster, or otherwise it's declared "novel". When a novel new condition is detected, an algorithm like RTEFC would normally start a new cluster centered at the new condition. But really you have a choice: either start a new cluster or don't start a new one. For outlier rejection, just declare the condition as an anomaly and don't start a new cluster or save the data. There may various reasons to start a new cluster centered at the new point: (1) You're still in a training period, (2) you want to label it as an anomaly that might be of interest and repeated in the future (for instance, as a fault condition when fault detection is one purpose of the application) , or (3) treat it as a previously undiscovered normal condition. Unfortunately, for some applications like plant monitoring, it may take years after installation before certain unusual operation conditions occur. In any case, any cluster can be labeled when you want to introduce the supervised learning component.
