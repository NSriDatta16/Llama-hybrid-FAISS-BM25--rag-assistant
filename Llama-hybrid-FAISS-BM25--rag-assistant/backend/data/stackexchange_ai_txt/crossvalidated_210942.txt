Exercise in Bayesian Statistics

What I want to do is the first part of the exercise : It is for chapter 14 of the book, an introduction to regression. I have minimal experience with regression and is the first time I see a vector being used as the mean. I am stuck and would like your help. My goal is to solve the next exercise that uses the model from this one. So if you could help me with this one I can try on my own the next one. So far I have that the likelihood can be written as a product $p(x) p(y|a,b)$. I know I need to find a formula for $p(y_i|a,b)$ but I am not sure how.
