Besides obvious answers like "Go get a book" or "Go to a AS3 game dev forum" (both of which should definitely be done), here's a couple of "kicking off points" to help guide your research. First, get a good understanding of design patterns. Development can get messy, and game development even more so. Keeping your code well structured and organized is essential. Following good design patterns will help enormously with that. Learn about developing with MVC (Model-View-Controller) in mind, which will help you keep your data (model) separate from your views (what you see). This organization will help you not get a bunch of ugly entangled spaghetti code that becomes too difficult to read or decipher. Additionally, getting a good understanding of the Command Pattern can be very useful for game development, since you can set up commands that are fired in response to user-interaction. Next, take a look into the theory of game development. This is a humongous topic, so it isn't something I can effectively summarize here, but in general, do some research in the game event-loop. This is the loop that fires at regular intervals and tells your game to do calculations and drawing to the stage. Though highly debatable, it is common practice to separate your math calculations and drawing into two separate loops. In AS3, there's good arguments to have your calculations fire on a Timer-based loop and have your drawing be based on an Event.ENTER_FRAME loop. Lastly, never underestimate how helpful looking at samples can be. There's a ton of AS3 game dev sources online, so it should be pretty easy to find some samples to learn from. Oh, and have fun! Game development can be frustrating, but as long as you keep having fun you'll come back for more. Good luck!
