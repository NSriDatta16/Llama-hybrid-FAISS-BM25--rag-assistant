Kent Beck coined the term User Story and he wasn't using the template you're mentioning but some kind of free form to capture requirements on a card : So I say, "Tell me the stories of what the system will do. Write down the name of the story and a paragraph or two." But it's Dan North that suggested the User Story Template on the eXtreme Programming Yahoo Group . And Mike Cohn ( who recommended using the template in his User Stories Applied book) contributed to make it popular.
