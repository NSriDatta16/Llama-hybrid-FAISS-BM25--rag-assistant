Will Boosting reduce variance?

I've seen two conflicting arguments: In a Stanford cs229 note, the author claims that boosting will increase variance (see section 2.5): http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes-ensemble.pdf Prof. Yoav Freund said that boosting will reduce both variance and bias in his lecture. From my understanding, since we are averaging over weak rules, the variance should decrease. But I'm not completely sure. Could someone provide some insights? Thank youÔºÅ
