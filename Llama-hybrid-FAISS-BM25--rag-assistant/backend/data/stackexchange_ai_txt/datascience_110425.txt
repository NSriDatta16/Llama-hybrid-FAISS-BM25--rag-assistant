It is not possible to find synonyms by starting with word embeddings. Word embeddings group words by co-occurrence. For example "and" and "but" will be near each other in embedding space, even though those words have opposite meanings. One option to find semantic clusters is to use WordNet, a large lexical database of English. WordNet models the meaning of the words.
