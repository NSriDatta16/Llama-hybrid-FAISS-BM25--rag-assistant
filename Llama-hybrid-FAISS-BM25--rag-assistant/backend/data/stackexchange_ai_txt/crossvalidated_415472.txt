Choosing error bars when the random variable has asymmetric distribution

I have a simulation data for a random variable $X$ , and also a parameter $p$ . I am plotting the average $\langle X\rangle$ vs $p$ . Now, I also want to show error bars on the plot to show the spread of $X$ . When I plot the histogram of $X$ , it looks far from Gaussian (it isn't even symmetric), and so I think that symmetric error bars using standard deviation $\sigma_X$ doesn't make much sense. For example, $\langle X\rangle -\sigma_X$ sometimes goes below $0$ , whereas $X$ is known to take values in $[0, 1]$ . I think that percentiles would make more meaningful error bars here because the distribution is not symmetric. However, what percentage would be a better option option for error bars: $68, 95, 99$ ? Also, since an error bar's lengths on the two sides of the average are going to be unequal, how would I choose them ( $95\%$ on each side or $95\%$ in total or what)? Thanks in advance.
