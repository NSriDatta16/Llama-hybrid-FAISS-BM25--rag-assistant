TeamCity for Python/Django continuous integration

I've set up TeamCity on a Linux (Ubuntu) box and would like to use it for some of Python/Django projects. The problem is that I don't really see what to do next - I tried searching for a Python specific build agent for TeamCity but without much of the success. How can I manage that?
