Random forest with nonnegative dependent variable

I have a modeling framework with an outcome that must necessarily be positive. In the training data, the outcome ranges from close to zero to much higher (approximately 0.05 to 100). Is there a way to fit a random forest model for positive outcomes? Prediction accuracy is important in this problem, and I want to model the data with more flexible, nonparametric methods like random forests.
