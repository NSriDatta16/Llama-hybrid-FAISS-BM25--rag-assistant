Does Anomaly Detection Algorithm works when the features are not correlated?

I am working on an Anomaly Detection Problem and the algorithm I used is an Autoencoder Multivariate Gaussian. The problem with my data is that it is unlabeled and not correlated. For example, let's say I want to predict anomaly in my system and I have features like: vibration, temp, pressure, catalyst Out of these features, only vibration is a good indicator of an anomaly, but other features (e.g. temp , pressure and cat ) are independent of vibration . So even if there is an anomaly, the vibration feature will only show us some indication, but not the rest of the features. I built the above-mentioned algorithm! Autoencoder gave me 99% accuracy during training time, but during testing, it totally failed (similar case with MVG). So, do I need correlated features or do these algorithms should work on this data? Please suggest any other approach to solve this kind of problem.
