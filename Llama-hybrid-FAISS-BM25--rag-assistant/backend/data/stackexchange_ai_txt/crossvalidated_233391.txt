The Wikipedia pages for " Kernel Method " and " reproducing kernel Hilbert space " both refer to Mercer's theorem , which is the connection. If the kernel used in a kernel method is a "Mercer kernel" (that is, it satisfies the Mercer condition), then the method works "as if" it was operating in the Hilbert space (a function space) corresponding to the kernel. This is called the kernel trick . Note that kernel methods can be applied with a non -Mercer kernel however. To quote the Wikipedia page: "Empirically, for machine learning heuristics, choices of a function $k$ that do not satisfy Mercer's condition may still perform reasonably if $k$ at least approximates the intuitive idea of similarity."
