Classifying clusters using discriminant analysis

Suppose I've data for 100 individuals for 5 variables, say Var1, Var2,...Var5. I run the cluster analysis using these 5 variables on these 100 rows & got 3 clusters. Now, I want to differentiate these 3 clusters based on 5 variables. That is, which among these 5 variables has been loaded more for which cluster, in order to get a meaningful interpretation of the clusters. Here I don't want to do PCA or other factor analysis. I've heard that I can do that using discriminant analysis . Can anybody suggest me the method to do it?
