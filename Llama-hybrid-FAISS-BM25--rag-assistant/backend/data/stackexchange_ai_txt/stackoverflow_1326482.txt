The statement int StaticClass::a = 0; actually allocates storage for the variable, this is why it should be only written once. As for your remark, you are probably confusing two different uses of the static keyword. In C static used to mean "use internal linkage", this means that the name of a variable or function would not be seen outside the translation unit where it was defined. In classes, static is used to define class members, that is variables or methods that don't refer to a specific instance of the class. In this case the storage for a static variable must be allocated somewhere (as it is not part of any instance), but only in one place of course.
