Rich calendar component for Swing application

My company is adding some rich calendar functionality to our Swing application. We want it to work like Outlook's calendar. Here are some of our requirments: Views for day, week, and month The ability to specify calendar items down to the minute level The ability to drag and drop calendar elements into different slots Editing of calendar details directly on the calendar Printing support Customizable look and feel 508 compliance support would be a big plus At the moment, we're planning on going with MiG Calendar , but I was wondering if anyone had any experience with other Swing components with similar functionality.
