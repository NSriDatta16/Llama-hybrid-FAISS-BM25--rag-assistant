If you don't have different types of financial years (e.g. US starts Jan, UK starts Apr) then I would simply use an integer and adopt a standard. e.g. Fin_Year = 2010 implies Financial Year Ending Mar 2010 (2009/2010). This would not need an extra table or storage, the meaning is implicit and your code should understand that Fin_Year is a special kind of date. EDIT: UK Government data standard uses ending year to represent a particular financial year.
