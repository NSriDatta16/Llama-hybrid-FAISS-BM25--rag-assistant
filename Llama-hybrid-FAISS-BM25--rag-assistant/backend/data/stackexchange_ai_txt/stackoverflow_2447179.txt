attaching multiple files to a domain class

I've seen various Grails plugins which allow easier handling of file uploads, however these tend only to support a single file per form-submit. I'd like a multi-attach form where as soon as you pick one file, an extra field and button is added using JS (various sites do it like this). Do you know of any good plugins which provide elegant uploading of multiple files without excessive coding? A progress bar either per-file of for the whole process would also be very nice. I don't know to what extent I can allow GORM to handle a java.io.File field (or in this case a Collection ).
