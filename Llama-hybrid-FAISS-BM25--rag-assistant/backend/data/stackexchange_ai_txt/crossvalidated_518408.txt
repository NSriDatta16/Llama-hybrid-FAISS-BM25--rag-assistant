How to deal with standard deviation using percentage values

I have the following issue: I have calculated a mean value of customer engagement over a sample of 30 individuals. We present them with material to consume and calculate the engagement as (number of videos/texts clicked on)/(number of videos/texts sent). My values are a mean of 88.9% of all content has been consumed, so on average, 88.9% of the content sent to the customer (videos, texts etc.) have been clicked on, but my sdev is +/- 28.9%. Now I am wondering a) if I have an error in my calculations since in my head that does not make that much sense, you can't consume more than 100% of the content provided, and b) how would I show this as a graph? Again, in my head it does not make sense to show error bars that go beyond 100%? Thank you all for your guidance!
