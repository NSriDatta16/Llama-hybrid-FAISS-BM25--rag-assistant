This is one seriously wacky bug. Now, if you really must organize your html the way you have, then IE needs to have the following placed inside the a tag to get it to register with the image. But this would be better (have not tested completely across browsers). Organize the html like (no need for a wrapper div ): Make sure the a is not position: absolute (IE7 didn't work with it so), and then set the image to: img {position: absolute; z-index: -1} I hope these head you in a direction to solving your problem.
