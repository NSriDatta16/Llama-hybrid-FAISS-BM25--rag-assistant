Is it possible for me to create a regular Web Form that uses an MVC View Master page? I don't know for sure, but it might work, as long as it's just markup and doesn't use any MVC-specific features. If so...is it possible to use the Html helper methods such as RenderPartial? Nope. If you use it this way, the Html property will not be set automatically, and I don't know of any way to hack it in. We began a project in WebForms and realized partway through that MVC suits our purposes far better, so until we can finish migrating away from WebForms we have to maintain two separate versions of each of our "portal" elements (tabs, logout buttons, etc.). It's a pain, but it's doable.
