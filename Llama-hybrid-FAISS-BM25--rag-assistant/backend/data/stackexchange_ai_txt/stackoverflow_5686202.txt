Relational db SQL and standards easy to model can use only standard and vendor types referential integrity (matematically solid relational set theory ) lot of tools and database implementations data separate from program storage management and high end infrastructure support transaction and concurrency management done within Relational Model is Value-Based ie rows are identified by primary keys Cons no custom type no extensible data types impedance mismatch cannot express nested relationship cannot use complex entities as a single unit need to define keys and various types of relationships at the data model level write procedures for versioning, transactions if needed Object DB High performance Faster as no joins required Inherent versioning mechanism Navigational interface for operations (like graph traversal) Object Query Language retrieve objects declaratively complex data types object identity ie. equals() in which object identity is independent of value and updates facilitates object sharing classes and hierarchies (inheritance and encapsulation) support for relationships integrated with a persistence language like ODL support for atomicity support for nested relationships semantic modelling Cons No mathematical foundation as RDB (refer Codd) cons of object orientation persistence difficult for complex structures, some data must be transient Object-Relational databases (You might have seen UDTs!) support for complex data types like collection, multisets etc object oriented data modelling extended SQL and rich types support for UDT inhertance powerful query language Different approaches (OO, Relational DB or OODB) may be necessary for different applications References The advantage of using relational databases for large corpora Relational Database Relational Database OODMS manifesto ODMG Benefits of a relational database The Object-Oriented Database System Manifesto Object Oriented Database Systems Object Relational Databases in DBMS Completeness Criteria for Object-Relational Database Systems Comparisons http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_object_database_management_systems http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_object-relational_database_management_systems
