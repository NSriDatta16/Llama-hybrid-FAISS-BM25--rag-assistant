15 attributes with 30161 instances are not much to cause this delay, I've trained with much more. Your system config also plays a major role in this. For instance if you are using anaconda on chrome and you have multiple processes going on then it would cause delay as distances are calculated on the fly which will be heavy on memory. You can also try SGD as you are going for linear. It is faster than SVM.
