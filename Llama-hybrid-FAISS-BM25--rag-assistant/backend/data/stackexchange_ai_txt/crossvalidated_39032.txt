When you do the Bayesian analysis are you allowing x1, x2, and x3 to vary/be updated? or are they fixed throughout the analysis? Most analyses that I have seen, Frequentist or Bayesian, will treat the observed data as fixed and compute the estimates of the coefficients conditional on the observed data. So in that case you can think about the x's as being fixed and not worry about products of normals. You should also note that while regression models (both Frequentist and Bayesian) assume that the "True" errors are iid Normal, or than the respones is independent normal with mean based on the regression equation, neither assume that the observed residuals are iid Normal (else why would there be standardized, studentized, etc. residuals?). Focusing too much on the distributional properties of the observed residuals may lead away from enlightenment rather than too it.
