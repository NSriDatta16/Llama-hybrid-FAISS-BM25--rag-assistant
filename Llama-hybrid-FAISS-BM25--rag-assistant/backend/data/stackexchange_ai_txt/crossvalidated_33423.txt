To expand a bit on @Procrastinators comment: If you are doing classical/frequentist statistics then your question is fairly meaningless. In frequentist statistics the true (population) coefficient is either greater than 1 or it is not, therefore the probability is either 100% or 0% (we just don't know which). Since it is a fixed value (though unkown) it is meaningless to talk about its probability of being in certain ranges. If you are doing a Bayesian analysis then your question is completely reasonable and easily answered, just fit the regression using Bayesian techniques and compute/estimate the posterior distribution of the coefficient and see what proportion of the posterior is greater than 1. You will need to choose a prior for the coefficients, but don't need to specify hypotheses. You need to decide which approach to take, it does not work well to try both. Trying to eat the Bayesian omlette without breaking the Bayesian eggs usually leads to you having egg on your face and still being hungry. You can also change the question to something more frequentist, basically doing a one sided test of hypothesis of $H_0: \beta \le 1$ vs. $H_a: \beta > 1$. Just do the standard frequentist analysis and compute the t-value as $\frac{\hat\beta - 1}{se_{\hat\beta}}$ where $se_{\hat\beta}$ is the standard error of the slope that most statistics packages will compute for you. Look this value up on the t-table (or computer program) using $n-2$ degrees of freedom. Other ways to do this are to include an offset (R lets you do this directly) or to use $Y - GDP$ as the response variable (but still include GDP as an explanitory variable and use the test of it being different from 0).
