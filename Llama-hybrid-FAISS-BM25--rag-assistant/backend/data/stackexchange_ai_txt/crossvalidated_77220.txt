How to explain this unit root process?

I have a time series $X_t$ (shown below) with a structure break. The stationary test kpss.test() says it has a unit root. How to explain this? Why does $X_t$ have a unit root? Sure it is not constant in mean, so it is non-stationary. But I can not relate its non-stationarity to the concept of unit-root. x=c(rnorm(1000,0,1),rnorm(1000,10,1)) kpss.test(x) The $p$-value of the test is 0.01, so we reject the null hypothesis of a stationary process. For example, a random walk has a unit root but it is constant in mean. So any relationship between unit root and constant-in-mean? Any comments about this?
