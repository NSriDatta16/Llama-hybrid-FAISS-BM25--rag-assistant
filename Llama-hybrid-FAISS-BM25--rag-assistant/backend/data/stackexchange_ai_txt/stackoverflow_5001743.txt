If the initial state of the set is randomly ordered, you will get the exact same constant factor for randomly picking three items to calculate the median as when picking three items deterministically. The motive for picking item by random would be that the deterministic method would give a result that is worse than the average. If the deterministic method gives a good median, you can't improve on it by picking items by random. So, which ever method gives the best result depends on the input data, it can't be determined for every possible set. The only sure way to lower the constant factor is to increase the number of items that you use to calcuate the median, but at some point calculating the median will be more expensive than what you gain by getting a better median value.
