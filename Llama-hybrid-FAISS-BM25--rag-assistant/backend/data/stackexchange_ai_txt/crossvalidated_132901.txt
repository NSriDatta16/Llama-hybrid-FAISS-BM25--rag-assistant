You need to read more about properties of an AR(1) model such as its mean and variance. So first see Example 1 in here . You can see that the mean of an AR(1) becomes zero if $\mu=0$, which is your case. Right? So this means that your time series should fluctuate around zero if it is coming from an AR(1) with a zero mean. Now lets look at your generated x x As you can see, before time 20, it is not alternating around zero! Therefore, you should NOT expect to see a coefficient of .8 even if you fit it with an arima function. R does not check whether it makes sense to fit an AR(1) to your data or not. Basically, this is your job! To do it correctly, first you need to simulated an AR(1) time series of data as follow: > z=arima.sim(n = 101, list(ar = c(0.8))) > ts.plot(z) As you see, right now it is now almost mean stationary. So let's try an arima function on z > arima(z, order = c(1,0,0),include.mean =FALSE) Series: z ARIMA(1,0,0) with zero mean Coefficients: ar1 0.7922 s.e. 0.0612 sigma^2 estimated as 1.175: log likelihood=-151.96 AIC=307.93 AICc=308.05 BIC=313.16 Now the AR coefficient is correctly estimated as 0.7922 ... Cheers!
