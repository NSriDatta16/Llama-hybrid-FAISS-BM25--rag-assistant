Say you observed daily data over months of 7 different features (like weather, pressure, ..). Now you want to use one month of data, i.e. a sequence of 30 observation with 7 features each to predict one week of some other feature, i.e. your output is a sequence of 7 observations with 1 feature. This output feature does not have to be included in the input features!And as you see, the dimensions are completely independet of each other. Have a look at https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-multi-step-time-series-forecasting-of-household-power-consumption/ This side really helped me a lot in understanding the forecasting of time series with neural nets and he provides lots of code examples as well
