There is at least one definite reason to go for storing in the database. You can use INSERT DELAYED in MySQL (or similar constructs in other databases), which returns immediately. You won't get any return data from the database with these kinds of queries, and they are not guaranteed to be applied. By using INSERT DELAYED, you won't slow down your app to much because of the logging. The database is free to write the INSERTs to disk at any time, so it can bundle a bunch of inserts together. You need to watch out for using MySQL's built in timestamp function (like CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or CUR_DATE()), because they will be called whenever the query is actually executed. So you should make sure that any time data is generated in your programming language, and not by the database. (This paragraph might be MySQL-specific)
