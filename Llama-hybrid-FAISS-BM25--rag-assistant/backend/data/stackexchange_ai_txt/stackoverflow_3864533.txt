Renamed packages and now activity cannot be found

So today I had a bright idea to rename my packages, now my android application which I have schedule for release on thursday is not working. I am getting a similar error as follows: Error: Activity class {org.me.androidapplication2/com.albertrosa.DEMO.MainActivity} does not exist. I have modified the manifest to reflect the change: there is more to the manifest but this is all that I have changed. is there something I am missing or doing wrong. I am using netbeans to build this app.
