How to identify unique user?

Question How can you determine if a user is unique or not? I understand there are many ways to do this using cookies, but what about methods that don't use cookies? For example, go to Urban Dictionary and click one of the up/down vote buttons. Even if you delete your cookies and come back to the page, you will not be allowed to cast a vote on the same definition. How do they do this? Purpose Eventually, I'd like to use this unique user detection method on a site where users create accounts. New signups are given a type of "reward" and I want to prevent people from creating multiple accounts in order to exploit the reward system. Ultimately, I don't really care what techniques are used to achieve this. I understand that no method will be 100% reliable. Even preventing this for 70-90% of users with an average computer skill level would satisfy me.
