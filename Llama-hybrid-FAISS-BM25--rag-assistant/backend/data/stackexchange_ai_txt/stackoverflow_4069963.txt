It sounds like you're already pointing in the right direction by looking at job postings and seeing what current needs are in the way of data storage and management, if this is your passion. I wouldn't be surprised if interviews will start asking about the advantages/disadvantages of nosql just to see if you're familiar with the latest developments (and if you're applying for a dba position, they might also ask about ACID compliance and the CAP theorem). Lots of companies are starting to use NoSQL technologies, so it's valid in that people are using it. And not just small startups either, but companies like facebook (cassandra), yahoo (hadoop), google (bigtable), and etsy (mongodb) believe that nosql solutions fit certain needs.
