It won't have anything to do with the size of the file. Check and see if you've spelled the file name correctly in your code. The file names are case-sensitive, so if the file is named original.PNG, then you'll need to make sure it is written that way in code as well.

When you drag the file into your project, make sure the option "copy files..." is checked.
