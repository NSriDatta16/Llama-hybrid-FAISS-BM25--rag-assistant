I don't think the fact that the proportion of "True" guesses is constrained to be 50% changes the statistical problem in any meaningful/complicated way. I think the null hypothesis that subjects can't distinguish between the two classes can still be tested using a pretty standard logistic regression model. Specifically, let the outcome be a vector of 0s and 1s that indicate whether a subject responded with "False" or "True," and regress that on a predictor consisting of -1/2 if "False" is the correct answer and +1/2 if "True" is the correct answer. The slope from this logistic regression gives the increase in log-odds of responding correctly vs. responding incorrectly. Chance performance implies that this coefficient should be 0. And the constraint that you mentioned in your question simply makes it so that we know in advance that the intercept will be 0. So we could technically omit the intercept if we wanted, but I think it shouldn't matter much. If you do this as a probit regression rather than a logistic regression, then it's equivalent to fitting the standard, equal-variance, two-choice signal detection theory model. So fitting this model with random effects for subjects would amount to fitting a multilevel signal detection model. See the following reference: Wright, D. B., Horry, R., & Skagerberg, E. M. (2009).
