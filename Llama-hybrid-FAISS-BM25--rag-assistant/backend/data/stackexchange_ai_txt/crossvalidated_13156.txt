How to predict shares?

Lets say I know what is the overall budget for some units and I want to predict share of budget each unit will get. I have historical data and could do regression analysis. Is it better to predict shares directly with logistic regression or to try to predict amount and then get calculate its share in overall predictions? Or something else? One more thing, I would like to spread entire budget at the end.
