The User model uses ActiveRecord validations, so this isn't specific to Authlogic. If you want to run the validations on a model you can call user.valid? . This will return true or false depending on if the entire model is valid. However it also fills up the user.errors object so you can then check if a given attribute is valid. Here is some code that uses RJS to do the AJAX. But you can use anything and organize it however you want. user = User.new(params[:user]) user.valid? # we aren't interested in the output of this. error = user.errors.on(:login) if error page.insert_html :before, "user_login", content_tag(:span, error, :class => "error_message") end You may be interested in my Mastering Rails Forms screencast series where I cover this topic in the 2nd episode.
