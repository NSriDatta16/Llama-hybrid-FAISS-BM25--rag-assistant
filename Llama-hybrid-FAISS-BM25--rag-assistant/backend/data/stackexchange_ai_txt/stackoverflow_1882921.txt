You can re-use variables over and over on a single page. This would be a good idea for at least the database connection. Define $con just once at the top of the page and use it multiple times. Just because you close your php tag (?>) doesnt mean you lost your variables. For code re-use, I would take a look at defining functions for common code fragments. Ideally, you would create classes to encapsulate logic. For example, it is typical to have a database connection object (or framework) which encapsulates connecting, querying, etc. You may benefit from taking a look at the Zend Framework. It is a great tool for learning PHP developers to see industry standards on how to do many of things you are asking. http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart
