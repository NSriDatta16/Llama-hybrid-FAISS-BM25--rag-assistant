Which method should be used to determine the class ID of multiple SVM models?

I'm using Support Vector Machine(SVM) with image classification. Each SVM model results a linear model $$y = wx + b$$ Where $w$ and $b$ is the SVM parameters. If I have multiple SVM models, I will get a vector $Y$ and matrix $W$ and vector $B$ $$Y = Wx + B$$ In my current case, I have a activation function called sign $$Y = sign(Wx + B)$$ Now, $Y$ can holds values such as 1 or -1 only. In my case, $Y$ has $n$ dimensions (rows) and therefore $W$ and $B$ are a $n$ -class SVM model. The index of $Y$ that holds the number 1, is the class ID of vector $x$ . The problem: The problem is that what if I get two number 1 inside vector $Y$ like $Y = [-1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1]$ ? I can solve this by using propability. But my data is small, about 150-200 $Y$ vectors. Assume that we are removing the activation function sign and using the pure data of $Y$ instead. Which method sould I use here to determine which $Y_i$ for a given $x_i$ , is giving the user the class ID of vector $x_i$ ? Decision trees (multiple if-statements) Naive Bayes Classifier Markov chains Linear regression Other? The goal here is to find an integer number as class ID for vector $x$ .
