Found a workaround myself. Based on some code changes made in rst2pdf , I was able to get my code working reliably. The solution, although ugly, is to wrap all my Paragraphs in the section of the code that creates Paragraphs for the student comments inside KeepTogether . For example, I changed one relevant line to: reportDocContent.append(KeepTogether(Paragraph(commentParagraph, style=commentParagraphStyle))) and now it works (at least, I haven't been able to break it yet after trying lots of sample data).
