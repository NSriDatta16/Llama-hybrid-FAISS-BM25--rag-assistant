Once you have the solution, you can of course check that it is correct by verifying that $(a)\cdot (b)$ is equal to the identify matrix, which is standard matrix algebra. Of course, the more interesting question is how to find such an inverse in the first place. The result seems to have first appeared in "The Use of Error Components Models in Combining Cross Section with Time Series Data", Wallace and Hussain (1969), Econometrica 37 (1), 55-72 , who are refreshingly frank about having found it via "trial, error and generalization". A more systematic account is given in "A Note on Error Components Models", Nerlove (1971), Econometrica 39 (2), 383-396 .
