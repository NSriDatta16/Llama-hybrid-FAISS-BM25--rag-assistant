IRT analysis: duplicate columns?

I am trying to create a 2-parameter logistic regression model. My data has no NA 's, 233 rows (plus 1 header row), and 458 columns of 0's and 1's only (but many columns are duplicate). I am able to create a Rasch model: > library(ltm) > ds m0 summary(m0) Call: rasch(data = ds) Model Summary: log.Lik AIC BIC -13074.27 27066.55 28650.58 ... But I get an error with this: > m1 (Exactly the same problem was reported earlier on StackExchange and on GitHub , but the suggested fix applies only when columns have many NA 's.) If I keep only distinct columns and remove duplicate columns (i.e., items with identical responses for all 233 subjects), it seems to work: > m1 summary(m1) Call: ltm(formula = ds ~ z1) Model Summary: log.Lik AIC BIC -2273.663 4671.326 4885.29 ... So my question is: Is it OK to drop duplicate columns in an IRT analysis (i.e., keep one copy only)? Note: I also tried running the 3-parameter model and I get the same warning with and without duplicates: m2 Any help will be much appreciated!
