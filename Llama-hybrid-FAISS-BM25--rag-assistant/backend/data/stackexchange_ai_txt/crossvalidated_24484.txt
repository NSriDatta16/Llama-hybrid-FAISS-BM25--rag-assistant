How can I test for a difference between ordered groups?

Let's say I have a questionnaire about a toy and I ask: The person to rate the toy on a scale of "bad, medium, good" How much the person thinks it cost to make the toy I want to test whether there's a (monotonic) relationship between the two variables. What's the best way of doing this? One way is to run two different one-sided t-tests, comparing (bad, medium) and then (medium, good), but I guess this loses some information. Another way is to use an ordinal logistic regression, where cost is the explanatory variable and the toy rating is the response. Another way is to maybe use something like Spearman rank correlation? This seems kind of funny to me, though, so I'm not sure. Something with (ordered) ANOVA? (I've never really understood ANOVA that well, so I'm not sure.) What's a good approach to try? Bonus 1: What are the pros/cons of the different approaches above? Bonus 2: points for pointing to an R function I could use.
