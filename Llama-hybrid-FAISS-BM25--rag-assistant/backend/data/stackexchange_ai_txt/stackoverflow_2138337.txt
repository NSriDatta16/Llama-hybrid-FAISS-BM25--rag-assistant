How to access a structure variable which is inside a cpp class,from c?

Sample eg: messageStruct.hpp class MessageStructure_t{ public: struct MsgData_t { float a; int i; }__attribute__((packed))msgdata_m; };//classs end I have a file in my project Application.c. I need to access the structure variables here. Both are different, one .hpp and the other .c How can I do this ? Hoping your kind attention.
