With Mongodb here's what I know. 1 - You have your traditional master/slave and replica sets . 2 - On 64bit I dont think there is a limitation. On 32bit, I believe the data size can be a maximum of 2.5g 3 - Depends on your needs. Lots of social networking sites still use mysql or postgresql ALONG with NoSQL. A lot of start ups are looking at deploying just NoSQL by itself. If it's ecommerce and you need ACID or transaction, stick to RDBMS. 4 - You mean to backup the data on the server? I think there are traditional export/import tools. I guess you could write a script to do all that and then have an agent backup from the filesystem.
