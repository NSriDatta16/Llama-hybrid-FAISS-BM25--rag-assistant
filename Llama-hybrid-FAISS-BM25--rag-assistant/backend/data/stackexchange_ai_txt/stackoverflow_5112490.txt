Front-end prototype/skeleton in Django

Often I create a static html prototype/skeleton for back-end developers I work with. This helps to find mistakes in the UI/IA and costly re-writes before the site is implemented. I would like to take this a step further and create these prototypes/skeletons in Django . By a prototype/skeleton I mean linked static pages that can be easily hooked up to back-end later. I would like to get some suggestions/ideas how I should set up my templates/links so they are easy to work with later during the implementation stage. Short list of requirements that come to my mind: Organization of templates while the entire project will consist of multiple apps Clean URL dispatcher and link creation Ability to display logged-in/ logged-out states
