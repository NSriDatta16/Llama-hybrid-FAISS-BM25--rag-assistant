terminology: I'm chemist. I have many samples which together form one sample in the statistical sense . see also: How to define what a "sample" is? Maybe a list with easy cases is a start: if your samples are correlated, they are not independent (but you cannot conclude the other way round). (kind of obvious): if one sample influences the other, they are not independent if you know a cause that influences both samples, they are not independent if you are able refine a prediction of whatever you are interested for one sample once you know the result for another sample (i.e. better than guessing from the overall distribution), then samples are not independent. it is always difficult to argue independence: Imagine you study hair color and to do that you grab people every 30 min from the street in front of your office. You may consider the persons independent: no way to predict another persons hair color better than guessing the average hair colour. But how do you know (prove!) that you did not just miss the right model to predict hair colour? (In)dependence may be discussed with regard to the scope of the study: now your colleague at the other side of the globe joins your study and sends you hair colors of people in front of his office. Now you can predict upcoming hairs better than general guessing from the last hair color you collected: hair colour is not independent of geographical region. You may say that the population to be studied needs to be well defined in order to argue (in)dependence: is it "hair colours appearing in front of my office" or is it "hair colour of humans"?
