InnoDB tables are clustered, that means that all data are contained in a B-Tree with the PRIMARY KEY as a key and all other columns as a payload. Since you don't define an explicit PRIMARY KEY , InnoDB uses a hidden 6-byte column to sort the records on. This and overhead of the B-Tree organization (with extra non-leaf-level blocks) requires more space than sizeof(int) * num_rows .
