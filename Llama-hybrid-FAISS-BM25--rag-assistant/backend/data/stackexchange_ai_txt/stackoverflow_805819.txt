Blackpool Community Church Javascript Team has an excellent example of exactly this ( direct link to the fourth example ). Check out their other examples as well. (disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with them, but have learned a lot about GMaps from their examples) Edit: I suspect the map events fire somewhat like this (pseudocode, for real event names etc. check the GMaps docs): map click: mousedown, mouseup, click:{set red marker} drag red marker: mousedown, dragstart{red marker}, mouseup, click:{set marker b} (mousedown+mouseup), dragend both markers are set? Yes, get directions What I'd suggest: in red-marker and marker-A dragstart functions, set some flag "dragging a marker", reset it in dragend function; in the Set marker B function, only set marker if we're currently NOT dragging something (flag is not set).
