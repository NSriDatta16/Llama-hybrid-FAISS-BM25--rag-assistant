Is there any intuitive explanation of why logistic regression will not work for perfect separation case? And why adding regularization will fix it?

We have many good discussions about perfect separation in logistic regression. Such as, Logistic regression in R resulted in perfect separation (Hauck-Donner phenomenon). Now what? and Logistic regression model does not converge . I personally still feel it is not intuitive for why it will be a problem and why adding regularization will fix it. I made some animations and think it will be helpful. So post his question and answer it by myself to share with the community.
