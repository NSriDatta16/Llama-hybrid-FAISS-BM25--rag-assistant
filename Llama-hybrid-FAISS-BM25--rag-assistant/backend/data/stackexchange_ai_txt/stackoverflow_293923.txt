Writing apps in C for microcontrollers

What resources do you know dedicated to software development in C for PIC microcontrollers? I would like to see some kind of framework that handles both IO (buttons for input and LCD for output) and application logic. You can think of it as a VERY simple OS. I understand that PIC's memory can be small for such frameworks so I think it could be a code generator that creates a specific code based on a config file. Then you add code fragments specific to your app. Have you seen something similar?
