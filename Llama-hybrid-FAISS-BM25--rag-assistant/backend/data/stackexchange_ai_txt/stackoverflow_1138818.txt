If that is the actual error you get, it's not a problem with cookie_jar . That just happens to be the first method you try to call. Check that you actually get an object when when make the user-agent. Remove all the cookie stuff and try the agent method: use strict; my $ua = eval { LWP::UserAgent->new } or die "Could not make user-agent! $@"; $ua->agent("TestAgent"); If anything goes wrong in the constructor, you should be able to catch it. However, if your script isn't already die-ing, I think you have something else wrong. If LWP::UserAgent::new runs into a problem, it already croaks. The only thing it can return is a defined value that it has already called methods on.
