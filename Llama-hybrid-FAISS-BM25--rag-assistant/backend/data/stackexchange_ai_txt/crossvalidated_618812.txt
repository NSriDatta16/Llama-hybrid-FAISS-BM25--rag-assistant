This is not a full "how to do it" answer, but some thoughts and leads. You need to account for there being 10 individuals. This could be done either by a multinomial model (more complete), or binomial (less complete, but simpler). Using a Poisson, which does not have an upper limit, can give nonsensical results. You should test for autocorrelation (i.e. if in a five minute window $i$ , there are $n_{A(i)}$ individuals in territory $A$ , there may be a relationship between that and the next window $i+1$ 's count, $n_{A(i+1)}$ . The $V$ variables are likely highly correlated and it might be difficult to elucidate the impact of them simultaneously. It might not be feasible to account for all three points at once, but I'll try to get you on the right track. 1. Upper limit of individuals There are always ten individuals. Therefore, you should use a model which accounts for this. The two obvious options are binomial, and multinomial. In a multinomial model, the response variable would be the vector $(n_A,n_B,n_C)$ and your predictor would be some combination of the $V$ variables, depending on the particular thing you explore. This properly accounts for the relationship between $n$ for territories - e.g. we know if $n_A$ and $n_B$ are "high", then $n_C$ is going to be "low". It also allows you to model all three counts at the same time, which maximises the amount of information available. The downside is that it's a more complex method, and it's harder to find packages which implement it. In a binomial model (let's say for territory $A$ ), the response is a vector $(n_A, n_B+n_C)$ , while the predictors again are some combination of the $V$ variables. There are many more ways to implement this in R, but it's a simpler model. 2. Autocorrelation This should at least be tested for. If autocorrelation exists, and it's not accounted for, your estimates will be overly confident. A number of R GLMM (generalised linear mixed model) packages have options for AR-1 autocorrelation. 3. $V$ variables' correlation There may be a multicollinearity issue. There may not be. But watch out for high correlation between the various $V$ variables, because that is something that can lead to estimation problems and model reliability issues. I'm not super familiar with techniques to deal with this - some ways off the top of my head are PCA, and regressing predictors against each other to remove multicollinearity. Or, just simplifying the model so that you don't have a model with both correlated variables in it. How to implement this? You would look to fit models that look like (this is pseudocode, not working code). A good start might be: mdl_1 You can test whether things like AR-1 is necessary, via things like AIC(c) or the goodness of fit of DHARMa residual plots. R packages that might support this: mgcv::gamm - this supports multinomial or binomial response, and AR-1 autocorrelation glmmTMB::glmmTMB - this supports binomial (not multinomial) response, and AR-1 autocorrelation VGAM::vglm - this supports multinomial or binomial repsonse, but no autocorrelation (I think) One more note: you have a lot of thing that you want to explore. If you are doing formal hypothesis tests, you need to account for multiple comparisons . If you are not doing formal testing, then using a combination of AICc/ DHARMa residual plots should be adequate.
