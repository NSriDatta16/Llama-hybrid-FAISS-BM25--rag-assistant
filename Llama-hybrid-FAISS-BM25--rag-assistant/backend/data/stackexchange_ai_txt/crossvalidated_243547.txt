Approximated relation between the estimated coefficient of a regression using and not using log transformed outcomes

Consider the two regression equations: \begin{align} Y &= \alpha+\beta X+\varepsilon \\ \log Y &= \gamma+\delta X+\eta \end{align} Is there a "simple" approximated relation between the coefficient estimated using the first equation ($\hat{\beta}$) and the one got by the second ($\hat{\delta}$) that can be used to get a sense of how approximately $\hat{\delta}$ looks like without running the regression? e.g. something like $\hat{\beta} \sim \hat{\delta}/\bar{Y}$, at least for some range of values of the variables or some hypothesis on the true DGP. It was suggested to me by a fellow student, I cannot see why this should hold but I was not able to disprove it neither. EDIT: I found this other related question Using results of regression on raw observation values to approximate results of regression on relative change between observations (Simple, Linear) , where the asker in the similar case in which the second model is a log-log: $$ \log Y=\gamma+\delta \log X+\eta $$ proposes the formula: $$ \delta=\beta\times \frac{x_T}{\bar{y}} $$ where I guess that $T$ is the last observation (it is a time series example). There is a similar answer to the one of Ami Tavory, but not much discussion too.
