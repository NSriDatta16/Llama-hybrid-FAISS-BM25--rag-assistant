What do you mean by reported speech? It might be easier to help out if you could elaborate on the end goal. What are you trying to do? EDIT I see so what you are looking to do is to translate between active and passive voice. When it comes to techniques to do this I found several options: You can train a model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) model to detect whether it is an active or passive model. From there you can then work on the translation part. Example for model here and translation here . It looks like you will need to familiarize yourself with the Spacy python library . An example of how this can be used in your case can be found here . Another, though more unorthodox approach is through the use of the program language Prolog. A paper on this subject can be found here with the accompanying code here . Here is a short primer on using Prolog for your specific task.
