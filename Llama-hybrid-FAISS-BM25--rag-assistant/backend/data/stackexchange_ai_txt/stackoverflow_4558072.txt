You can use to replace all non-translatable classes with your version. Take a look at http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/1.6/DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html , look for "Overriding one package implementation with another". OTOH, if you only need to transfer this object through GWT-RPC, then use the new RequestFactory that solves this issue altogether - there are no common classes on server and client, proxies are used instead.
