How to verify hand written signature?

I trying to create a model for determining whether a questioned hand written signature matches known signature samples, and predict if the signature is genuine or forgeries . I'm guessing I'll have to use a CNN and probably some variation of PCA. How would you tackle the "signature verification" problem? Is there an already trained models for that? or datasets? All I could find are research articles, but: no GitHub projects. no AWS/Azure/Gcloud service. no Kaggle completions or datasets. Maybe I not searching for the right thing! Any dataset of signatures I could use, and ideas on how to approach that kind of problem would be very helpful. tnx :)
