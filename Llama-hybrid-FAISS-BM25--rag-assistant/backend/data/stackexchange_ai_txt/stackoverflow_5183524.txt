The webserver or a man-in-the-middle e.g. a proxy is killing your connection. I take it this request works fine in a browser. I'd do a few things: It's a lot of data - make sure your timeouts (Timeout and ReadWriteTimeout) are set suitably high. Make this request look like it originated from a real browser- use a tool like Fiddler or Netmon to extract and copy the headers from a browser making the same request - UserAgent, Accepts, Content-Encoding etc. Seen lots of sites vomit when standard headers are missing. Cookies may be important (some sites use it for basic DDoS prevention) - again use Fiddler to observe the real browser interaction. Fiddler NetMon Let us know how you got on.
