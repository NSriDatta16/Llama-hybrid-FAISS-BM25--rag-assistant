I like to look through the code in Java's standard libraries too. Start off small with the methods that you actually use; then move on to classes like String, Integer, and other basic types, and move on slowly to entire packages, the Collections package, for e.g. Looking at a method or two, is probably not going to be that enriching an experience compared to looking at different classes and figuring out the design. Open source libraries are good too. Pick those that you actually use in your daily work and were developed by programmers/organizations you respect.
