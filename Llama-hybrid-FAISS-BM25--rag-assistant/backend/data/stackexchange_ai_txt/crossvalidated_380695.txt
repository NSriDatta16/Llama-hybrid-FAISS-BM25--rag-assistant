From what you are saying it is very difficult to judge. You could apply a lot of different machine learning methods (for example a Gaussian Process, linear/kernel regression, neural networks...) depending on the structure and the size of your dataset. But what all will have in common, that it will be difficult to predict for "time regions" where you have no data. Here I assume, that the behavior of the costumers is variable over the year (christmas shopping etc.). If you assume that there are no significant changes, the problem of having only 6 months of data would decrease.
