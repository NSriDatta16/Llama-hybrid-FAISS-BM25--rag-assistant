Update My original answer was written when django was still 1.1 or so. This answer is no longer relevant. See @daveoncode's answer for a better solution. Original Answer I did an experiment to test this. I changed the MESSAGE_STORAGE setting in one of my projects to 'django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie.CookieStorage' and executed a test that I had written to check for messages. It worked. The key difference from what you were doing is the way I retrieved messages. See below: def test_message_sending(self): data = dict(...) response = self.client.post(reverse('my_view'), data) messages = self.user.get_and_delete_messages() self.assertTrue(messages) self.assertEqual('Hey there!', messages[0]) This may be worth a try.
