which neural network topology to learn correlations between time series?

I have two (or more in principle) 1xN time series, and I would like to train a NN to predict the next value of both. I can arrange them as a 2xN matrix and feed a window from this matrix as input to the NN, but I'm not sure how to structure the NN itself. I have made a NN with convolutions that can do a pretty decent job with a single series, but I'd like to exploit cross-series correlations. What topology works to let the NN notice correlations between the time series?
