Eclipse Ganymede and MinGW in Windows

I'm trying to get eclipse to work with MinGW. I've done the following: Downloaded CDT for eclipse. Installed MinGW. Added C:\MinGW\bin to my path. Opening a command prompt (CMD) and typing g++ or alike works fine. I run eclipse, create a "New C++ Project", and only get the option saying "other toolchains". There's a MILLION tutorials out there saying eclipse should identify MinGW on its own. It doesn't, and I don't know what to do. I've tried reinstalling everying in just about every order posible. Still no luck. I've also noted some tutorials say something about creating a "Managed C++ Project". I've no such option, all I get is "C++ Project" and "C Project" edit: I have eclipse ganymede, windows x86_64, version 3.4.2 http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.4.2-200902111700/index.php Running the "Eclipse IDE for C/C++ developers" fails, since there's no x64 version for windows. The x86 version requires x86 JAVA installed as well, and installing two versions of java, gave nothing but trouble in the past.
