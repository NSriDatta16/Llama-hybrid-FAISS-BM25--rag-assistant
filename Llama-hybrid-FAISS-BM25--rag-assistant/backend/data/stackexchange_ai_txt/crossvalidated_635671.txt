Approaches for forecasting higher frequency data with mixed (high and low) freq exogenous variables?

I have y data at a daily frequency and a number of x variables at daily, weekly and monthly intervals. I'm looking to create a multiple linear regression from these. I'm familiar with MIDAS methods, but these typically prescribe using higher frequency x vars with lower freq y variables. Have considered simply up/downsampling approaches, but averages or linear interpolation is likely to defeat the purpose of attempting the regression in the first place. There appear to be a few applicable R packages ( tempdisagg , tsibbledata ) and also found this and this , but wonder if someone more familiar with this kind of work can advise what tends to be de facto aside from trying a bunch of approaches and seeing what works/is feasible. As this seems like a common enough problem wondering if there are common enough approaches to start with. Working primarily with Python but seems like R may be more appropriate for actual implementation.
