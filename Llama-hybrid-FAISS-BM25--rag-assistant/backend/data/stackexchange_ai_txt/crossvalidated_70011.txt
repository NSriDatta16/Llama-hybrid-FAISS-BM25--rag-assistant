HMM s are a special case of probabilistic graphical models ( PGM ), which include very broad range of more or less related (in terms of particular application) models. There are at least to generic models that you could give a try: Conditional Random Fields ( CRF ) Bayesian networks It is also worth noting, that on the coursera platform one can find a good introductionary course regarding PGMs: https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm Neural Networks on the other hand are quite generic term, which includes dozens of actual models. The most common understanding of this term ie. Multi Layer Perceptron (also refered as Artificial Neural Network, Feedforward Neural Network) is a different concept, which is rather a regression method then actual probabilistic model. On the other hand there are some probabilistic versions of neural networks which can be used in the similar tasks.
