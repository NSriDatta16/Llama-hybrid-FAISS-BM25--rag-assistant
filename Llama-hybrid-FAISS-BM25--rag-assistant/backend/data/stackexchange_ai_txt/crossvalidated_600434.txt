Marginal effects in logistic regression and subgroup analysis

I am conducting a research project implementing exact matching to seek to isolate a marginal effect of a binary exposure variable on a binary outcome (via MatchIt in R). I am using logistic regression as the model after matching, however, I feel confused about some aspects of the analyses. Is it correct to say that by using logistic regression (with covariates to avoid confoundedness) I cannot estimate the average marginal effect, but only the conditional effect? If so, is it correct to say that, for the exposure, the conditional effect, e.g., in the form of ATE, ATT, ATU, etc., is XX? Given that my matched dataset following the exact matching procedure discarded some treated units, is it correct to say that I cannot estimate the ATT, but instead, I can only try to isolate the ATM (Average Treatment on the Matched)? If so, when computing the conditional/marginal effect via: comparisons(model_matched, variables="exposure", newdata = subset(matched_dataset, exposure== 1))|> summary() am I computing the average treatment on the treated in the matched sample (which we can call ATTM)? Or should we call it differently? I am also confused concerning subgroup analysis. To understand whether the impact of exposure varies based on different levels of a specific categorical covariate, should I use comparisons in the form: comparisons(model_matched, variables="exposure", by="covariate", newdata = subset(matched_dataset, exposure == 1))|> summary() or should I compute interactions via: comparisons(model_matched, variables=c("exposure", "covariate"), newdata = subset(matched_dataset, exposure == 1))|> summary() Thanks a lot for the patience and help!
