(Writing in the answers section since I cannot comment yet) A couple of points and sanity checks: Are you dealing with linear dynamical systems? Even the simplest non-linear ones, such as the Duffing oscillator, can exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and a time-series analysis involving initial conditions would not be the way to go. For linear dynamical systems (LDS), some aspects of the governing "physics" are important in determining its trajectory: initial conditions, forcing, damping and error. For example, the steady-state solution of a sinusoidally forced linear oscillator can be indistinguishable from the undamped free-vibration of another: both have the form $x(t)=x_0 \sin(\omega t + \phi)$. It would be best if you could answer the following questions to help both yourself and readers with the problem: What sort of time-series data are you looking at? Financial, electromechanical, molecular, astronomical, speech/acoustic or other? Each domain has its own relative scales of numbers, complexity and wisdom in getting to solutions. Could any of your systems be non-linear? Or are you comparing different linear dynamical systems? How many degrees of freedom does each have (what is the size of your state-space vector)? In other words, how many series do you need to describe one system? Do you expect forcing in your dynamical systems or are they autonomous? If forced, do you have a periodic force and steady-state data or just data from a transient excitation? Do you expect damping or dissipation in your dynamical systems? Can you roughly quantify the error in your time-series signals? This might happen if you have real data where there is a significant measurement error involved. As for the machine learning aspect, could you elaborate a little on what this clustering/segmenting step is? I do not think it would be easy to distinguish between completely arbitrary dynamical systems. It might be possible if you make certain assumptions: perhaps that they are all linear and / or autonomous (unforced).
