You will have to bring the data together somehow. There are things like server links (though that is probably not the correct term in mysql context) that might allow querying accross different DBs. This opens up another set of problems (security!) The easier solution is to bring the data together in one DB. The last (least desirable) solution is to join in code as Padmarag suggests.
