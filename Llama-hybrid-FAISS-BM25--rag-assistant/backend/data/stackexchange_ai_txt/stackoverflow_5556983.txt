reading in text file and organising by lines using MATLAB

I want to read in a text file (using matlab) with data that is not in a convenient matlab matrix form. This is an example: {926377200,926463600} [(48, 13), (75, 147), (67, 13)] {926463600,926550000} [(67, 48)] {926550000,926636400} [] {926636400,926722800} [] {926722800,926809200} ... All I would like is a vector of all the numbers separated by commas. With them always being in pairs and the odd lines' numbers are of much greater magnitude each time, this can be differentiated by logic later. I cannot figure out how to use textscan or the other methods. What makes this a bit tricky is that the matlab methods require a defined format for the strings separated by delimiters and here the even lines have non-restricted numbers of integer pairs.
