pcap why always packets of 8 bytes... why?

I'm using the pcap library but I don't know why I get always this output: new packet with size: udata= 8 hdr=8 pkt=8 This is the code: void handle_pcap(u_char *udata, const struct pcap_pkthdr *hdr, const u_char *pkt) { DEBUG("DANY new packet with size: udata= %d hdr=%d pkt=%d", (int) sizeof(udata),(int) sizeof(hdr),(int) sizeof(pkt) ); ... stuff } and in another file I use: status = pcap_loop (pcap_obj, -1 /* How many packets it should sniff for before returning (a negative value means it should sniff until an error occurs (loop forever) ) */, handle_pcap /* Callback that will be called*/, NULL /* Arguments to send to the callback (NULL is nothing) */); Is it normal that output? I think not because sometimes my program works sometimes doesn't..
