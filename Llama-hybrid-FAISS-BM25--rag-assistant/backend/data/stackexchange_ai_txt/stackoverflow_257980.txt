To respond to your extra information, moving from PHP 4 to PHP 5 is probably a golden time to rewrite your framework to address some of the problems it has. You can also use the opportunity to increase layer separation, too. For instance, you say it has some slowdowns, possibly related to over-normalization. Well, if your framework is abstracting data access away enough, you should be able to add some caching (such as memcached) to that layer and the application doesn't need to know anything. You could also use the same effort to add logging in a fairly easy way. If you use an object layer, you can add logging to the generic data storage and get a whole lot of logging practically for free. Other slowdowns might be due to inadequte database indexing. And this is unrelated to your framework. If you are using MySQL, turn slow query logging on and run EXPLAIN over some of them. You should see which columns need indexing that aren't. PHP in and of itself is not a slow language. Slowness will be elsewhere. :-)
