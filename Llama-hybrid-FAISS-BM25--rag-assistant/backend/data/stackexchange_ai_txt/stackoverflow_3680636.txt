ASYNC postbacks happening when SupportsPartialRendering is set to false

We're getting a confusing error on two of our pages in our ASP.NET application. Both pages originaly had tags to reload the page every so often if a user sat on it for a while, but opted to remove those in favor of some AJAX flavoring. Specifically, we created timer controls on the page and wired the timer's tick event as a trigger for an update panel to reload a portion of the page. The page(s) also have scriptmanagers on them as we don't have one on the master page. This largely works great except we're getting a lot of these errors: "The page is performing an async postback but the ScriptManager.SupportsPartialRendering property is set to false." It is my understanding that if the .NET framework detects a browser doesn't support partial rendering it will set the ScriptManager.SupportsPartialRendering value to false and we're NOT overriding this in any fashion. Therefore, the pages shouldn't be by performing async postbacks if that value is false, but based on the error the postbacks are still happening and the page is throwing an exception. Curiously, the user agent always seems to be GoogleBot or "Mozilla/4.0 (Windows 98; US) Opera 10.00 [en]". I'd apperciate some insight. We've toyed with the idea of forcing the SupportsPartialRendering to true, but that doesn't explain why ASYNC postbacks are even occuring if the .NET framework is setting this to false based on the the browser caps.
