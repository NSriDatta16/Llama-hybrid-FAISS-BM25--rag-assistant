Parameters to change for different kernels for SVM

I am carrying out SVM and was interested in knowing the parameters that could be varied for each kernel. I am using 3 kernels: RBF, linear and polynominal. These are the parameters that i think can be changed: For Linear : C For RBF: C and gamma For Polynominal : C and gamma Would like to hear some feedback whether i am wrong or correct. If there are any other parameters, do tell me... Thanks.
