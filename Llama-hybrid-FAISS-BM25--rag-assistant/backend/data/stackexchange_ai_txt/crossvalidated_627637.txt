Users of binomial and Poisson models are often surprised to learn that semiparametric models work extremely well for count data while making no assumptions about the distribution of counts for any one type of observation. The question about how one can model an entire distribution empirically, which may require thousands of intercepts when there are thousands of distinct $Y$ values, comes up frequently. Consider the special case where there are no covariates (predictors), and no ties in the data ( $n$ observations). The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) estimates the $Y$ distribution unbiasedly, without assumptions. It is a nonparametric estimator with $n-1$ parameters. In ordinal semiparametric models such as the proportional odds model, the ECDF is just the estimated cumulative probabilities when there are no covariates. If there are $k$ distinct $Y$ values there are $k-1$ intercepts (here $n-1$ if there are no ties in the data). The intercepts are exactly the logits of the ECDF values. The effective number of parameters in this model is low because of the order restrictions in the intercepts, and because the ECDF has effectively about 3-5 degrees of freedom. This can been seen by comparing widths of confidence bands from the ECDF for the unknown cumulative distribution with widths from fitting 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-parameter parametric distributions. Now consider covariates. You can easily estimate more parameters than there are observations without problem, as intercepts are order-restricted so effectively only have a few degrees of freedom. Computationally thousands of intercepts are handled (in R rms::orm and SAS JMP only) by respecting the sparse nature of the information matrix, which is tri-band diagonal). Intercepts are like covariate-adjusted ECDF values. Interestingly, Bayesian ordinal models do not need to invert information matrices so they automatically handle lots of intercepts without special programming (see R rmsb::blrm ). Intercepts encode the whole ECDF so distribution assumptions are gone. Ordinal models can handle extreme ties in the data (the limiting case is the binary logistic model which is a special case of the proportional odds model) so they handle zero inflation as well as ceiling effects and upper limits of detection.
