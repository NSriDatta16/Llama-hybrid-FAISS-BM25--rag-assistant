PCA creates new axes based on your data's variance distribution. It's like rotating x-y axes with respect to your data. New axes will be linear combinations of the old ones, e.g. $a_1=0.2\hat{x}+0.5\hat{y}$ . I didn't use Weka, but it seems the four entries in the form $\sum{a_kA_k}$ represents your principal axes, in decreasing order with respect to explained variance.
