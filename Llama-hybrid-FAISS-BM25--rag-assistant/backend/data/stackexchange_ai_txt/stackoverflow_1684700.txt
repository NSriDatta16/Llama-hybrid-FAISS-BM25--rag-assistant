Update: I've looked back at my notes when I first set this up - your "Base SDK" has to be the same as your current build target, otherwise the options you need won't appear: http://iphonesdkdev.blogspot.com/2009/05/xcode-gcc-section-missing-in-build.html FYI, my "Instrument Program Flow" and "Generate Test Coverage Files" options show up underneath heading "GCC 4.0 - Code Generation". I remember similar problems with build settings being hidden - usually it is because of a dependency on another build setting, e.g. two from my project that I know matter are: -C/C++ Compiler Version = GCC 4.0 -Base SDK = iPhone Simulator 2.1 (missing)
