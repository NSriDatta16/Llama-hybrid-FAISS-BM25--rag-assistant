Intuition behind PCA decorrelation and whitening

1) Is there an intuitive explanation for why data becomes correlated once rotated into the principal component basis? 2) Is there any intuitive explanation behind why rotation doesn't affect the whitening of data? Specifically, I want to understand why $x_{ZCA} = U x_{PCA}$ where $x_{PCA} = D^{-1/2} U$ for the eigen decomposition of $X X^T$ works.
