Is it possible to train two neural networks combined with same output?

Say I have two kinds of input that I want my neural network to learn a possible from: one 2D image some 1D metadata about the image This case and similar cases seem problematic to me because the two input data isn't easily put in the same input tensor due to their potentially different shapes and sizes. I gather it could require convolutional layers for the 2D-image but only fully connected layers for the metadata. I would like to train one network to learn from both these inputs simultaneously. Is this possible, or what is the standard approach to this kind of problem? (I've tried to illustrate the idea below)
