I followed the instructions from the following post to upgrade from 1.4.1.1 to 1.5.0.1: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/219720/#t301761 Then flushed the cache and reindexed everything. Everything worked. Don't forget to change magento folder ownership to your web server user. In my case I had to run chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/magento
