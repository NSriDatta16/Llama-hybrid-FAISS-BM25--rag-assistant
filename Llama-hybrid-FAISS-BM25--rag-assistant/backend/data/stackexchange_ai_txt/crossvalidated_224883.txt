Can I use PCA (or should I use regression) for testing the effect of multiple variables on one dependent variable?

I have 2000 soil property measures and 14 different variables like rainfall, temperature, slope, etc. I want to check the effect of those 14 variables on soil property measures, including which variable affects my soil property the most. Is PCA a suitable solution to this? Or should I try multiple regression instead?
