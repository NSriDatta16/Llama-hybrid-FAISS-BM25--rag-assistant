How to get labels in face recognition in Keras

I am building a facial recognition system. The model is complete but I am having minor issues during prediction. I used the Image data generator to load images from train and test folders and trained the CNN with 98% accuracy. However, when I predict the images, instead of labels, logits are being displayed. I tried the manual method of assigning labels to each logit, but that appears to be a tedious task and requires more time to be processed. E.g., what is being displayed is: [[1 0 0]] What I need is: recognized person is "steve rogers".
