I will not suggest any programming languages. Which one is easier, is an matter of opinion and perspective. Its up to each developer to draw his own conclusion. But for a new developer you should probably leverage some existing solutions. Look for a cms solutions (content management system) like joomla, that already have a solution for a use case like catalog listing.(Looking for samples will help) For you to come up with a good enterprise solution, you need to optimize data store, have some mechanism like Lucene searching to enable faster searching experience and the complexity does not stop there. ( no matter what language you use)..
