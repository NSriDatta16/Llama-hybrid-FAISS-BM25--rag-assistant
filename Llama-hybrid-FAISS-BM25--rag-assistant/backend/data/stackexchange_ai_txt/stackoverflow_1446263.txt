I'm not expecting this to be the correct answer, but I thought I'd chime in anyway. My approach has been to use the drag-n-drop feature for creating the initial DBML file. Then, any changes I make in my DB are also then made, by hand, in either the designer or in the DBML file (as XML) itself. (You can right-click on the DBML file, select Open With, and choose XML editor.) Sometimes it is much easier/faster to work with its XML instead of messing around in the designer. I would only consider the deleting and re-adding, as you have been doing, if the changes were significant. For adding a new column, however, I'd suggest working directly with the dbml's XML, it's probably faster. Good luck!
