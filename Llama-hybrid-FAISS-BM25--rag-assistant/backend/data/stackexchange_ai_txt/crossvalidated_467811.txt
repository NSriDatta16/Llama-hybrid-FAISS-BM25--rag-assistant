I think we can treat this as an instance of online (or incremental) machine learning . That is, given this new data use assume that the training data arrives in a continuous manner and we need to tune our hyper-parameters on the fly. In a way, we are doing a "warm start" in our problem. There are quite a few papers on the matter particular for SVM: Fast kernel classifiers with online and active learning (2005) by Bordes et al. Incremental Support Vector Learning: Analysis, Implementation and Applications (2006) by Laskov et al. Online SVM learning: from classification to data description and back (2003) by Tax & Laskov. Please note that this is definitely not confined to SVM. Most algorithms that are trained in an iterative manner have been presented within an online/incremental learning framework.
