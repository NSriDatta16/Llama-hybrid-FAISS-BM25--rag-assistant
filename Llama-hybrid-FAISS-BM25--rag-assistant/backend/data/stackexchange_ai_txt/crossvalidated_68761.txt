Partial Least Sqaures Regression(there are R packages such as caret can deal with Binary classification problems too ) is the first thing that comes to my mind. Y ~ X I like PLS because it automatically finds a lower-dimension space (like-PCA does, but it tries to find components which capture most variation across both X & Y ). If you spend enough time then you should be able to extract meaningful patterns from the loading/score plots from the PLS model.
