Programmatically sending e-mail doesn't go through Template.php?

I recently asked a question as to how to send e-mails programmatically in Magento and I got some great replies. The post is here: Is it possible to send an e-mail programmatically in Magento? . There were a couple of methods suggested. I implemented the one here: http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/magento-custom-emails/ and I made the changes to Template.php suggested in this post: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/1073/P30/ because I could find nowhere to enter credentials for my email server (I really can't believe I have to change that file. Why can't I enter those details in the system admin in the same place as the smtp host?). I still didn't get my e-mail. So I put a Mage::log call in getMail() and the message did not appear in my system.log. Is the method of sending the e-mail, taken from inchoo.net, wrong? Thanks.
