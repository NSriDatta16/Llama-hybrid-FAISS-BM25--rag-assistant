I would recommend your approach #2. Storage space is cheap (and region codes are short), and datastore performance does not degrade with size, unlike most databases. Using a single app also makes for easier management and upgrades, and avoids any issues with the TOS (which prohibit sharding your app to avoid billing charges).
