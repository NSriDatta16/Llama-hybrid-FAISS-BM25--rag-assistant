GET is intended for retrieval of a resource without making any modifications or incurring any side effects, and POST is intended for adding information to a resource (but not creating a new resource, that would be a PUT ). These are just guidelines and are not functionally enforced; you can use a POST request to retrieve a resource, and GET requests can have side effects. So, you could put the mode information into the body of a POST request; you could also do something simpler and assign numerical values to your modes, such that you had Response.Redirect("~/Page1.aspx?mode=2"); and only the server would know that mode 2 is "Create". If you want to prevent the user from (easily) being able to modify the mode value directly, then the POST body would be a better solution than the query string.
