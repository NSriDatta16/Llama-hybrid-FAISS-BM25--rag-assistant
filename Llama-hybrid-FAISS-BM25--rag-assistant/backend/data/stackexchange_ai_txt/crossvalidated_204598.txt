The ARCH-LM test (be it multivariate or univariate) with $q$ lags tests whether there are ARCH effects at lags from 1 up to $q$. It tests the joint significance of coefficients $\alpha_1,\dotsc,\alpha_q$ in the equation $$ x_t^2 = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_{t-1}^2 + \dotsc + \alpha_q x_{t-q}^2 + \varepsilon_t $$ (I use different notation than in the Wikipedia article linked to above to stress that the dependent variable need not be a residual from an ARIMA model and to match your notation). For $q=1$, it tests for ARCH effects at lag 1: $\text{H}_0:\alpha_1=0$. For $q=2$, it tests for ARCH effects at lags 1 and 2 jointly: $\text{H}_0:\alpha_1=\alpha_2=0$. These are different hypotheses so one could not say the result of the first test is in conflict with the result of the second test. In your case, you do not find an ARCH effect at lag 1 but you do find them at lags 1 and 2 jointly. That suggests that the squared time series is autocorrelated at lag 2 but not lag 1. If I continue increasing the lags.multi parameter, the p-value closes to zero. That suggests the squared series has significant partial autocorrelations (significant ARCH effects) at higher lag orders as well; if that was not the case and the only significant autocorrelation was at lag 2, the $p$-values of the ARCH-LM test would decrease with increasing lag order as the single effect would be "diluted" in a test of joint significance of an increasing number of coefficients. In sum, you seem to have an ARCH effect at lag 2 and likely higher lag orders, which means your data is conditionally heteroskedastic.
