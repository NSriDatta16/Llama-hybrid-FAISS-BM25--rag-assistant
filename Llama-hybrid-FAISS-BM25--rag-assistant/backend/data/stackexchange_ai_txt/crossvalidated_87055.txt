The Bayesian approach to computing estimator bias and variance

From what I understand, jackknife and bootstrapping are frequentist methods for computing statistics (bias, variance, etc.) of an estimator. Given a sample of my data and an estimator, and assuming little about the generative process, how can I compute the same statistics of my estimator using a Bayesian approach?
