Recall that in hierarchical clustering, you must define a distance metric between clusters. For example, in hierarchical average linkage clustering (probably the most popular option), the distance between clusters is define as the average distance between all inter-cluster pairs. The distance between pairs must also be defined and could be, for example, euclidean distance (or correlation distance in your case). So the distance between clusters is a way of generalizing the distance between pairs. In the dendrogram, the y-axis is simply the value of this distance metric between clusters. For example, if you see two clusters merged at a height $x$, it means that the distance between those clusters was $x$.
