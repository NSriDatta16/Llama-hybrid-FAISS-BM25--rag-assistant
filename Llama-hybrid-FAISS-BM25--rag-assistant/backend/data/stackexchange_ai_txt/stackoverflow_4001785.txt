Can I identify intranet page content using Named Entity Recognition?

I am new to Natural Language Processing and I want to learn more by creating a simple project. NLTK was suggested to be popular in NLP so I will use it in my project. Here is what I would like to do: I want to scan our company's intranet pages; approximately 3K pages I would like to parse and categorize the content of these pages based on certain criteria such as: HR, Engineering, Corporate Pages, etc... From what I have read so far, I can do this with Named Entity Recognition. I can describe entities for each category of pages, train the NLTK solution and run each page through to determine the category. Is this the right approach? I appreciate any direction and ideas... Thanks
