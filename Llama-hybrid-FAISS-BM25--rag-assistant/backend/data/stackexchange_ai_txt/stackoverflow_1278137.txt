SQL Efficiency with Function

So I've got this database that helps organize information for academic conferences, but we need to know sometimes whether an item is "incomplete" - the rules behind what could make something incomplete are a bit complex, so I built them into a scalar function that just returns true if the item is complete and 0 otherwise. The problem I'm running into is that when I call the function on a big table of data, it'll take about 1 minute to return the results. This is causing time-outs on the web site. I don't think there's much I can do about the function itself. But I was wondering if anybody knows any techniques generally for these kinds of situations? What do you do when you have a big function like that that just has to be run sometimes on everything? Could I actually store the results of the function and then have it refreshed every now and then? Is there a good and efficient way to have it stored, but refresh it if the record is updated? I thought I could do that as a trigger or something, but if somebody ever runs a big update, it'll take forever. Thanks, Mike
