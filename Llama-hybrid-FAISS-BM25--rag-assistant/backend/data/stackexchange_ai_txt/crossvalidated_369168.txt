Prediction of multiple time series of different lengths

I have multiple store sales time series where seasonality is, or should be, correlated, but the time series are of differing lengths (e.g. 6 months vs 3.5 years). Forecasting the longer time series works well, but for the shorter time series obvious seasonality components are missing. Is there a straight forward way to "borrow" seasonality information from the longer time series and apply it to the shorter time series?
