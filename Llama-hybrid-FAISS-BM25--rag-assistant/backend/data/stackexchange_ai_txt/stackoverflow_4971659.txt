PHP error: Indirect modification of overloaded property

I am trying to build my own session handler for (currently) database storage. When calling it as a normal OOP as shown below in the first example, everything works as intended. Data is stored to the database without any issues. However when putting it together with the session_set_save_handler function to be able to use the $_SESSION global variable, PHP goes bananas like never before and start outputting multiple Notice: Indirect modification of overloaded property errors. What am I doing wrong to cause these horrific errors? Working code example: class session extends sessionBase { private $db; function __construct() { parent::__construct(); $this->db = database::get()->connection(); } function write() { // Query to database } } $session = new session; session->write(); // Writes to database perfectly Non-working code example: class session extends sessionBase { private $db; function __construct() { parent::__construct(); $this->db = database::get()->connection(); } function write() { // Query to database } } $sessions = New session(); session_set_save_handler( array($sessions,"open"), array($sessions,"close"), array($sessions,"read"), array($sessions,"write"), array($sessions,"destroy"), array($sessions,"gc") ); session_start(); // This is bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S!
