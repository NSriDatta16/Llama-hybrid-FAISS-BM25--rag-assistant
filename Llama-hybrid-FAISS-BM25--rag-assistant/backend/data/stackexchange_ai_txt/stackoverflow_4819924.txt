How to make chrome remember the one tab(or a window) information that can be used in other tabs

In a chrome Extension , How to make chrome remember the tab information that can be used by other tabs. For example or being more specific., I've a button in one of the tabs that when clicked opens another tab and i used chrome.createtabs for this in Background.html. I also created a variable which will save the tab id of the new tab created (say tab1). I want to use tab1 in myscript.js(content script) to place the information in parent tab. So how can i send the request from background.html to content script? Or Is there any way to post the content to the webpage using background.html? btw I used localStorage['tab1'] to save the new Tab ID. Lemme know if i'm not clear. Thanks
