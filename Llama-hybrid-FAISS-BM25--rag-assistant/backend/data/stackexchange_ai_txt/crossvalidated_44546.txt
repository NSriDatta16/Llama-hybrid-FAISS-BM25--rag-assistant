How do important and insignificant variables impact model?

I am working to build a model using logistic regression. There is one variable which has strong predictive power. But based on business rule, I cannot include this variable in the model. On the other hand, there are some variables which are insignificant in the model. But from business decision, they are added in the model. So my question is how the model will be impacted if I remove an important variable? And how will it be impacted if I add some insignificant variables? Is there a way to measure the impact?
