Uniformly sampling principal component scores to explore response surface

New simpler version of the question Consider a sample $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^p$ with $p$ small, say $p=5$, and $n$ large, say $n=3000$. Because they are actually scores of principal components, the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ are uncorrelated. I would like to sample uniformly the domain covered by the rows of $\mathbf{X}$. The meaning of “covered” here is not formally defined. The resulting sample should explore as efficiently as possible the domain of possible realisations of the scores. For instance, a point clearly outside of the convex hull of $\mathbf{X}$ is probably useless. Older version with more context Consider a model $y = f(\mathbf{x})$ with $f: \mathbb{R}^p \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. The components of $\mathbf{x}$ are correlated. More precisely, $\mathbf{x}$ is of functional nature, say time series or power spectra. I am interested into the sum of the responses of the model $f$ to a big sample of inputs $\mathbf{X}$ : $\sum_{\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbf{X}} f(\mathbf{x}_i)$ However, $f$ is very expensive and only a few dozens of evalutations are feasible. Because the elements of $\mathbf{X}$ all share an air of ressemblance, I reduced the input dimension to something low (say 5) using principal component analysis. Now I would like to explore the response surface of the model $f$. For that purpose, I need to sample the 5 principal component scores I retained with a space filling design of experiment, a low discrepancy sequence or a Latin hypercube. As I want to characterise the whole reponse surface, I am inclined to sample them uniformly. I could also use their empirical marginal distributions inferred from $\mathbf{X}$. Their is no correlation to account for because they are principal component scores, and are thus uncorrelated. However, they still relate to one another in the sense that the empirical sample $\mathbf{X}$ covers a restricted domain of the input space, which is the region of interest. What strategy would you recommend to sample the principal components scores in an efficient manner while enforcing this restriction?
