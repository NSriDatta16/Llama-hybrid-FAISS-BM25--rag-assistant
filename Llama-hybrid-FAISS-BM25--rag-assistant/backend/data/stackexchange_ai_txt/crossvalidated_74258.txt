If I understand it, your data is $\{(i_m,j_m,x_m,y_m) : m=1,\dots,n\}$, in which, for the $m$-th match, $i_m$ is the index of the home team, $j_m$ is the index of the away team ($i_m\neq j_m$), $x_m$ is the number of goals scored by the home team, and $y_m$ is the number of goals scored by the away team. If we have $t$ teams disputing the $n$ matches, the likelihood $L(\rho,\gamma,\alpha_i,\beta_i, i=1,\dots,t)$ is proportional to $$ \prod_{m=1}^n \tau_{\lambda_m,\mu_m}(x_m,y_m)\,\lambda_m^{x_m} \,\mu_m^{y_m}\,e^{-(\lambda_m+\mu_m)} \, , $$ in which $\lambda_m = \alpha_{i_m} \beta_{j_m}\gamma$ and $\mu_m = \alpha_{i_m} \beta_{j_m}$. This likelihood is a function of $2(t+1)$ parameters. You will probably need to implement some conjugate gradient method to solve this constrained optimization problem. I wonder what happens if we put some priors on the parameters and MCMC the posterior with a random walk Metropolis. You said that you know the values of the parameters, except for $\rho$ (and I wonder how...). Hence, your first step is to write an R function that computes the product above for each value of $\rho$. Then, plot it and use the optimizer to see what happens.
