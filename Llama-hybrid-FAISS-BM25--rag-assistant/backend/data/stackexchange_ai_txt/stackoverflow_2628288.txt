Arguments to convince to switch from CVS to SVN

The UNIX department of my company currently uses CVS as source-version control system. They use it in a very strange way : different repositories for development/testing/production code (for the same project), no one tags anything, weird directory architecture, and so on. The system has been set for ages but now, I have an opportunity to organize a meeting where I have to suggest changes. I'd like to make them change from CVS to SVN (Mercurial or Git might be even better, however I can't really recommand using a system I don't know well, and switching to SVN will already be a great step forward). I don't have much experience with CVS so I can't compare them efficiently: I just know it doesn't support atomic operations and that it is deprecated . What killer arguments would you use to convince my collegues to do the switch ? Thank you very much.
