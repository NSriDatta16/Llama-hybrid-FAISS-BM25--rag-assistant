In Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al, the authors write on page 232: [ $\mathbf{X^\top X}$ ] can be singular whenever the data-generating distribution truly has no variance in some direction, or when no variance is observed in some direction because there are fewer examples (rows of $\mathbf{X}$ ) than input features (columns of $\mathbf{X}$ ). This questiton/answer, from which the previous paragraph was taken, can be useful. Sometimes, the sample covariance matrix will be singular and you have to face it. There are approaches to handle such situations, as can be seen here , with $\ell_1$ regularization.
