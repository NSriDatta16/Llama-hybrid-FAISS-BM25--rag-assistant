If you need to do a lot of this kind of search on a given text, you could begin by indexing the whole text into a database containing the word, its position in the text, and the paragraph number (if needed). Then, you could select all the Word1 and Word2 positions, and it shouldn't be too hard to infer the minimal distance. Edit: Here is a try for a simple algorithm for a one-shot, without using database. Remove any html and punctuation to keep only the words Search for the first occurrence of Word1 Count the number of words (or chars, or spaces) until you reach next occurrence of Word2 If you reach Word1 again before reaching Word2, restart the counter Record the distance, then continue to repeat steps 2-5 to get other occurrences of Word1 and Word2
