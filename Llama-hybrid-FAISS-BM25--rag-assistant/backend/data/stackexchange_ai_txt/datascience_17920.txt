SOM initial values for learning rate and neighborhood sigma

I am using SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) of Kohonen, or more specifically, the MiniSom, found here to cluster and visualize my data. As you can see in the above site, the example given is: from minisom import MiniSom som = MiniSom(6, 6, 4, sigma=0.3, learning_rate=0.5) # initialization of 6x6 SOM print "Training..." som.train_random(data, 100) # trains the SOM with 100 iterations print "...ready!" the three parameters of sigma and learning rate and number of iterations are hardcoded, and apparently it is working for the given examples. However, my data is bigger and different in size, so when I use these hardcoded parameters, the results is awful. Or even worse, when I change my corpus and implement it on another corpus size, the results get worse... however when I try to find the "best initial values" by trial and error, I get something that is meaningful! Question: How can I determine the initial values of these parameters? Is there any other SOM implementation that facilitates this? Your comments and answers are welcome. thanks. annex: There is an article on this, but apparently no right answer...
