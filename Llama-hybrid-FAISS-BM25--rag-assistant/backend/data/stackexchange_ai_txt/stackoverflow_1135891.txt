In older versions of Windows, it used to be possible to implement your own winlogon.exe, that's the application that presents the log-in user-interface. It's not so easy now, and for good reasons, Microsoft have invested a lot more effort in security than the average Joe Coder would! Once you are past the login, the operating system becomes a little bit of a free-for all, but only because winlogon's first task is is spawn EXPLORER.EXE, if you replace the shell with your own that in turn spawns explorer when your entry criteria have been met, you will get the behaviour your want. You will, as you commented, need to disable the task-manager as this gives an opportunity to launch other applications. Changing the default shell (all users): open regedit (start menu > run, and type in regedit) go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon. Change Shell from explorer.exe to the new shell path e.g your application log out and log back in. Changing the default shell (only current user): open regedit (start menu > run, and type in regedit). go to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon. add a new string value (Edit > New > String Value) called shell. and set the value to the path of the new shell e.g your application. log out and log back in.
