BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development. It is related to, and derived from, TDD (Test Driven Development) and ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development). It differs from them in its language, preferring "example", "scenario" or "specification" to "test". Unlike TDD, BDD is not focused on functionality but on behavior. It improves communication between team members and it bridges the gap between non-technical and technical people working on the same project by using a common language. Whereas TDD focuses on "how" to implement the functionality, BDD explains "what" functionality to implement.

BDD is also known as... ... sbe (Specification by Example) or atdd (Acceptance Test Driven Development). It is derived from tdd (Test Driven Development). It differs from them in its language, preferring example , scenario or specification to test . The language is intended to encourage questioning and conversation around the scenario or example, as BDD works from an assumption that we don't know enough to write an accurate test in the first place. Scenario-based BDD tools use a Given / When / Then format to capture and automate the conversations. TDD and mocking tools are commonly used at a class level.
