How do I find the center of multiple points? Android

I have multiple points placed on my MapView and would like to centre the map on these points i.e. not any particular one, just the averaged centre of the lot of them. I know there's a method for this in the Javascript G. Maps API. I was wondering whether there was a prexisting method to do this in Android?
