WPF Multiline TextBlock LineBreak issues

I have the following code txtBlock1.Inlines.Add("This is first paragraph \n This is second paragraph"); then TextBlock would display: This is first paragraph This is second paragraph But, if I have the following (which I though is equivalent); txtBlock1.Inlines.Add("This is first paragraph"); txtBlock1.Inlines.Add("\n"); txtBlock1.Inlines.Add("This is second paragraph"); TextBlock display: This is first paragraph // but second paragraph missing If I separate out the linebreak then the rest of text after the linebreak doesn't show. Why? I have to use run: Run run1 = new Run(); run1.Text = "First Paragraph"; run1.Text += "\n"; run1.Text += "Second Paragraph"; txtBlock1.Inlines.Add(run1); Then it produce the result correctly. Why I cannot add inline text to Textblock and require me to use Run ?
