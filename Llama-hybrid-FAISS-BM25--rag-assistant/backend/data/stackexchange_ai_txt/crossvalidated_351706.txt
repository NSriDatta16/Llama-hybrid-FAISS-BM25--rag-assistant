Hosmer-Lemeshow recommendations

During lectures I came across following statement: If you want Hosmer-Lemeshow test to be valid, number of expected events ($E_1g$) should be >5 in most of $g$ groups Then after few lectures, lecturer said: If you want Hosmer-Lemeshow test to be valid, number of expected events($E_1g$) and non-events ($E_0g$) should be >5 in 80% of cells. I googled whole internet, read 3 most popular books about logistic regression and still can find answer about which version is correct. The question is: which recommendation for Hosmer-Lemeshow test is proper one? Or maybe you know another one and can give some papers about it?
