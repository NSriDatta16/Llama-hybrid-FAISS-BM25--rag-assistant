Reloading resources loaded by getResourceAsStream

Following best practices, I'm using Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream to load resources in a web application (like text files or xml files), instead of going through the file API. However, this has the disadvantage that if the resource changes on disk, a following call to getResourceAsStream keeps returning the old version indefinitely. I would like it to pick up the new version though. In my debugger I see there's a simple HashMap called resourceEntries in the classLoader. Using reflection I've been able to remove a specific entry and this seems to work. This method is however fragile. Is there a more standard way to do this?
