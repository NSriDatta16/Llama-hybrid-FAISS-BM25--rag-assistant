CNN with Multi channel input or CNN with Multi instance learning?

I have 500 Dicom images of medical scan of patients. These are 3 dimension scans , shape = [300 x 300 x 3]. From these I have extracted Front and side views. So, for each patient I have 2 images of shape [300 x 300]. In order to build a classifier, Should stack these 2 views and train a CNN {[300 x 300 x 2] x 500} -> Multi channel input, Or should i pass each view as a new data altogether {[300 x 300 x 1000]} -> Multi instance learning?
