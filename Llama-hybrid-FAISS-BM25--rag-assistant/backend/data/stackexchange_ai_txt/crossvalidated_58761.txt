Proportion classified correctly is an improper scoring rule, i.e., it is optimized by a bogus model. I would use the quadratic proper scoring rule known as the Brier score, or the concordance probability (area under ROC curve in the binary $Y$ case). Random forest works better than SVM in your case.
