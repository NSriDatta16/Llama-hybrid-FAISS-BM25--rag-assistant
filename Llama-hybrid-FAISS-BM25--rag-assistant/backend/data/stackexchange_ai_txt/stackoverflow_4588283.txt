How to make a .pkg that the Mac Installer will simply install (copy) files from?

My goal is to create a .pkg that will simply instruct the Mac Installer to simply install files, like fonts, from the .pkg to a directory when run. I've tried using Xcode, but it seems more application oriented. How do I configure Xcode with a generic document so I can Build and Archive, then Share using the Organizer to create the .pkg? The Copy Files Target appears to be in use only at build time, so that doesn't seem to be much help.
