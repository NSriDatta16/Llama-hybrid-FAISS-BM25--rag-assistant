refresh setCellEditor for JTable

I was looking for an answer for a previous question and had an ingenious idea to overcome a limit on JTable . I need the editor to be different on a row by row basis, whereas JTable can only handle a single editor for each column. So my idea is to use a MouseListener to check the row and column on the JTable and set new editor each time. But, calling setCellEditor() a second time do not have any effect. The editor remains to be the first one that was set. So how can I make "setCellEditor" work a second time for the same column? Here's the code in MouseListener . public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { int cols = resultTable.columnAtPoint(new Point(e.getX(), e.getY())); int rows = resultTable.rowAtPoint(new Point(e.getX(), e.getY())); StorageObject item = (StorageObject) resultTable.getModel().getValueAt(rows, cols); TableColumn col = resultTable.getColumnModel().getColumn(cols); col.setCellEditor(new MyComboBoxEditor(item.list)); }
