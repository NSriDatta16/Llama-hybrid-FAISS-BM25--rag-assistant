mkdirs returns false for directory on sd card while the parent directory is writable

When starting my android application, I need to create a directory on the sd card, for a small number of users this fails and I can't figure out the reason for it... (I've found similar problems caused by the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission missing, it's there and it works for almost all users so I don't think this is reason) I've simplified the previous situation to make it easier to explain, if creating a directoy fails, I run a test case where I try to make a .test directory on the sdcard: new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), ".test").mkdir() -> false new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), ".test").mkdirs() -> false File properties of the relevant directories: /sdcard/.test (exists=false canWrite=false canRead=false canExecute=err isDirectory=false isFile=false) /sdcard (exists=true canWrite=true canRead=true canExecute=err isDirectory=true isFile=false) / (exists=true canWrite=false canRead=true canExecute=err isDirectory=true isFile=false) getExternalStorageState=mounted (canExecute returns err because the test is run on sdk Suggestions and ideas are very welcome...
