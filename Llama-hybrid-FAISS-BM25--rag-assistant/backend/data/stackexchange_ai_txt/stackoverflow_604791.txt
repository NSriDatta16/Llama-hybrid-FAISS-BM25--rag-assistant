Two things: first -- get the javascript local to your site when developing. Loading it from elsewhere to take advantage of caching is an optimization that I'd leave to the end. I'd also only load it from highly available remote sites, like Google, to minimize problems. Second, make your site at least minimally usable without javascript enabled. Use form postbacks that get replaced with Ajax functionality from javascript that runs when the page is loaded, for example. You might not be able to get everything, but I've found that I can make most things work without javascript in at least a workable, if not elegant fashion. I realize this doesn't solve your immediate problem, but I think it would help your site to remain available in the face of situations like this.
