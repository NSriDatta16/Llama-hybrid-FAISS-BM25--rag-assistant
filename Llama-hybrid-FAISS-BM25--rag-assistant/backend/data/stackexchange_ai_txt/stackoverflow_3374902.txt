I agree with Pedro. Your first example test (ImportService_ProcessQueuedData_CallsDataAccessLayer_ToLoadQueue) isn't necessary, because the other tests will implicitly test that LoadQueuedData was called -- if it wasn't, they would have no data to operate on. You want to have a test for every path, but you don't need a separate test for every line of code in the method. If there are six paths through the conditional branching, you want six tests. If I wanted to get really fancy, I might also consider leveraging object polymorphism to reduce the number of if statements and simplify the tests. For example, you could have a different "handler" for every QueuedImportItemType, and put the logic for what to do with an item of that type there, instead of your big Process method. Splitting up the logic of iteration and of what to do with each type of item makes them easier to test separately.
