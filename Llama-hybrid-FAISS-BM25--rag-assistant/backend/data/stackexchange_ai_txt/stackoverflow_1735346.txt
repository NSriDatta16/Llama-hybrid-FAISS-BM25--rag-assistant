Jamie - Unfortunately, as I'm sure you have discovered, Magento doesn't do this out-of-the-box. The layered navigation is built based upon the available attributes (that have been set as filterable nav) for the category listing you are viewing. You would have to write a custom module to override the layered nav output. A place to start could be /app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Block/Layer/Navigation.php. Good luck!
