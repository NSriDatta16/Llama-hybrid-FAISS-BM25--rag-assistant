Choose binary classification algorithm

I have a binary classification problem: Approximately 1000 samples in training set 10 attributes, including binary, numeric and categorical Which algorithm is the best choice for this type of problem? By default I'm going to start with SVM (preliminary having nominal attributes values converted to binary features), as it is considered the best for relatively clean and not noisy data.
