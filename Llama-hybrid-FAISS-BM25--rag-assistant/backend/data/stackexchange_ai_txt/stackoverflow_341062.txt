The value after the hash is not transmitted to the server. There's another SO question about that somewhere, but I'm having trouble finding it. Likewise it's taken me a while to find a decent reference to cite, but this Wikipedia article has some confirmation: The fragment identifier functions differently than the rest of the URI: namely, its processing is exclusively client-side with no participation from the server. When an agent (such as a Web browser) requests a resource from a Web server, the agent sends the URI to the server, but does not send the fragment. I assume you want to respond to it on the server side rather than the browser side? (Given that you're asking about doing it in C#...)
