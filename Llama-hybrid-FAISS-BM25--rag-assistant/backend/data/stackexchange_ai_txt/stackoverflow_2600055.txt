I used to work for a hospital on the Data Warehousing team (building cubes used by the whole organization) and we had visit numbers to go by and from there we could determine if it was an appointment set (or re-admission as you refer to it). Do you have any appointment numbers and visit numbers, it may be useful to add those to your SQL table.
