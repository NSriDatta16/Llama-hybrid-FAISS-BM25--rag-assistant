Universal encoding and TF-IDF are two different beasts. I assume you mean the Vector Space Model transformed by TF-IDF. Either way: Neither tell you directly what the similarity of two texts are. Usually You'll use something like cosine distance to do that. For the VSM there are scores of techniques to transform it. To name a few: Rocchio Transformation, LDA/LSI, stemming, stopping (or filtering on count and document count). It sounds like you have a sparsity problem: Rocchio and LDA could help.And don't forget on some less elegant techniques in which you transform words using list of synonyms.
