The model is a mixture of Bernoullis, with likelihood $$L(p)=\prod_{t=1}^n \{pa_t+(1-p)b_t\}$$ a polynomial of degree $n$ in $p$ . Since this distribution is not an exponential family, there is no sufficient statistic of fixed dimension and hence no way to update the maximum likelihood estimator in the way you describe. As an aside, the Bayesian estimation of $p$ allows for a sequential update of the posterior distribution, if one uses a particle filter. Bernardo and Giròn (1988) have an updating mecchanism that is quite simple but also very approximate: @InCollection{ bernardo:giron:1988, author = "J.M. Bernardo and F.J.
