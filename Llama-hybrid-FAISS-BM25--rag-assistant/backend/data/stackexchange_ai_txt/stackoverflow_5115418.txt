If you are going to change (or create!) the database schema at runtime, note that LinqToSQL cannot update it's database representation at runtime as well. It can only be updated by Drag-And-Drop in Visual Studio or using SQLMetal via command line (a rather obscure method) and recompiling your application. However, you could create a well-defined database schema with the ExecuteQuery at runtime and use the same existing database schema on your development machine to generate your LinqToSQL DataContext via drag and drop as usual.
