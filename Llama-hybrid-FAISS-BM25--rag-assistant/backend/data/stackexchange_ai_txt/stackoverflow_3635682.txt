if i connect it to wifi then this check does not work correctly Yes, it does, by your own admission. actually when wifi is connected to network and internet coverage is not there above check say ok That is what it is supposed to do. Your WiFi network is active, meaning Android is in communication with your access point. That is what "connected" means. The only way you can tell if you can communicate to some host is to try to communicate to some host. Note that requestRouteToHost() reportedly has issues, so you would need to try something else (e.g., make an HTTP connection to a known good URL).
