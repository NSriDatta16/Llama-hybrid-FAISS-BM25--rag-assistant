Queuing theory question

Waiting line : M/M/3 with $\lambda = 24/u$ and $\mu = 10/u$ vs M/M/1 with $\lambda = 24/ u$ and $\mu = 30/u$ I'm doing some exercises on waiting line theory, now I've got a question to which I did not note an answer during class. Will the waiting line increase ? The question is : a company can do 24 jobs / hour at an average waiting time of 6 minutes / job on a cpu of type A. Now we have a new cpu B that can do the job three times faster than a type A cpu. Now they want if they change their 3 cpu's to one, if there is going to be an increase in the waiting line ? I think changing will have a negative effect : I did a run in ORSTAT which gave me an average waiting time for 1.30 with the $u = 30$. However I don't know how to do a simulation with MM3 in orstat... I think that the average waiting will be lower than 1.30, since there are 3 work units, you will have less impact of changing a job than when there is only one cpu. Can anyone confirm this ?
