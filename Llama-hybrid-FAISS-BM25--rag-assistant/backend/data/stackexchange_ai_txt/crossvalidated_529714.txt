Is every time series that is not predictable a random walk?

The title already reveals my question. I was wondering how specific the characterisitics of a random walk are defined and if every time series that is not predictable belongs to the class of random walks. Edit: unpredictable in a sense that the past observations provide no information which makes predictions of the future feasible.
