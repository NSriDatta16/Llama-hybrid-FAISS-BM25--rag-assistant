I'd suggest starting out by taking a look at MOA (Massive Online Analysis) from the University of Waikato in New Zealand. This is the same group behind Weka. (As an aside both Moa and Weka are New Zealand native species.... though the former is now extinct...) https://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/ "MOA is the most popular open source framework for data stream mining, with a very active growing community (blog). It includes a collection of machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems) and tools for evaluation. Related to the WEKA project, MOA is also written in Java, while scaling to more demanding problems." There is an R wrapper but I've not tried it; based on Git history it may be a bit out of date. COre MOA is actively maintained. HTH Chris (from New Zealand...)
