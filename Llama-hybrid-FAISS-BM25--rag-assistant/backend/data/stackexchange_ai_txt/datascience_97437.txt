If you don't have any way to obtain negative instances, the standard option is one-class classification : one-class classification (OCC), also known as unary classification or class-modelling, tries to identify objects of a specific class amongst all objects, by primarily learning from a training set containing only the objects of that class. I think the most common method is One-Class SVM , there might be others as well.
