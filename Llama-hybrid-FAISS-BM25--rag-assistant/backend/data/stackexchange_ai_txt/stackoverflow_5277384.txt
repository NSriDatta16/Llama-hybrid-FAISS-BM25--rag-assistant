Email with PHP after conditional statement

So, I'm trying to do a very simple thing - send an email using PHP. I've looked through other queries on stack and none of them involve a conditional statement, so I wanted to check and see if I could get some quick advice. See the conditional below that then send a confirmation / thank you email to someone who donated to my organization. Could it be that I first have the code echoing / printing a statement and then running the mail() function? if ((isset($_POST['submitted'])) && ($ack!="SUCCESS")) { $_SESSION['reshash']=$resArray; $location = "https://globalcitizenyear.org/wp-content/themes/deMar/APIError.php"; header("Location: $location"); } elseif ($ack =="SUCCESS") { echo (" Thank You Thank you for your generous donation of $$amount. You will receive an email confirmation with an attached tax receipt. "); $body = "Dear $firstName, /n/nThank you ... /n/nAs I travel the country, ... /n/nPlease accept my deepest gratitude for your contribution. /n/nSincerely, /n/nAbigail Falik /n/nFounder and CEO /nGlobal Citizen Year"; **$body = wordwrap($body,70); mail("$email",'Thank you for your donation to Global Citizen Year (Important tax receipt)', $body,"From:donations@globalcitizenyear.org");** } else { // Display Form ?>
