There is a lot of possibilities on this subject. We had a customer that updated both their AD and their SAP user list from SAP HR. The idea was that the OM module contained all employees. You could export daily a list of all active employees to the LDAP, with basic informations (firstname, lastname, employeeId, login...). For the SAP system, unit/function/job needing a sap access where tagged and user where created/removed daily. In fact, all employees had a SAP account, but only those tagged had a "dialog" one. Those account are allowed to connect via SAPGUI, others had to use the portal, which is a less costly licence. A set of rules allowed to set the roles for the managed users. The goal was to minimize user management and limit the inexorable grows of autorisation that comme from moving from job to job an organisation. (this was for 105000 employe, with a lot of personnel movement). Thus SAP was not directly linked to the AD, but they where synchronised. Depending on the system (Development, qulity, integration, production), SAP was configured with time-out. You could also have diff√©rent password for separate systems. Of course the reverse is also possible : interrogate a LDAP from SAP to manage SAP's accounts, without beeing directly linked to the LDAP. transaction LDAP can problably give you some informations. hope this helps Edit : the synchronisation was done by an ABAP program. that program was run every day at four, and created/deleted/modifed some accounts in the LDAP. After that, another program added some technical informations to the LDAP entries, informations that where not available to the SAP RH system (such as the mail server to use for a given employee, depending on its location around the world). The entries where then checked for consistency, and send to the master LDAP. This program only managed personnel and units. Groups (authorization for others application) where managed either manually, or by others programs. Thus non SAP data were also stored in the LDAP. Regards
