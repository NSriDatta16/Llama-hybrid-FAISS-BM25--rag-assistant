Maximum number of epochs and validation frequency in deep learning networks

I read in one article that the number of epochs in a deep learning network are varied according to a validation frequency of 300. I am not sure what it means. Does it mean after every 300 weight updates, a round of validation is performed? Also how are epochs related to that, as epoch count stays fixed. What is the relation between the maximum number of epochs and the validation frequency?
