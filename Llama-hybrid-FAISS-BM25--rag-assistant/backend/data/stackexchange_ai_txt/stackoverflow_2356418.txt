I have been tinkering with a tool called 'Basher' that allows you to write "tasks" that are picked up by the system and subsequently run for a configurable amount of time (to allow the JVM to warm up for example) and then performs a run, recording task execution time, averages and the like. The 1.0 version has been quietly around for a while and if you care to take a look, it is available at http://basher.sourceforge.net The trunk version contains some improvements - there is maven integration, with configurations being specified in the pom.xml, the bare bones of a reporting framework, etc.
