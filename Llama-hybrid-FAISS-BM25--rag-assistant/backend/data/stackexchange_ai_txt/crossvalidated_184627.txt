No. There are two sorts of asymptotics here: $N$ items of data, and $T$ samples from the posterior. For most priors, as $N$ gets large the posterior distributions should become close*. For large $T$ you simply get a more accurate picture of the posterior under a particular prior for a fixed amount of data. *Asymptotic consistency of Bayesian models has some twists, I found a brief discussion in the intro here: http://www.stat.ufl.edu/archived/casella/Papers/AOS606.pdf . The case of whether the prior is parametric or nonparametric is important.
