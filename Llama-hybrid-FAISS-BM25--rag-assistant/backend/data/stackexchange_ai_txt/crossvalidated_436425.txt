Stationary Time Series (Conditional moments)

I am reviewing the fundamentals of time series modelling and came across the following question regarding the concept of stationarity: A time series is strictly stationary if its unconditional distribution (all moments) is invariant in time. Consider the following stationary time series $\{{X_t}\}_{t\in{Z}}$ and let us focus on the first two moments of the distribution, namely: $E[X_t]= constant$ $var[X_t]= constant$ The time invariant unconditional moments does not imply that the conditional moments ( $E[X_t|X_{t-1}]$ and $var[X_t|X_{t-1}]$ ) are time invariant as well. I understand that the conditional expectation is random, due the random nature of conditioning part of $X_{t-1}$ . But, I am not sure about $var[X_t|X_{t-1}]$ . If we show a typical path of time series generated by an $AR(1)$ model, we observe a time-varying conditional distribution. Notice that the One realized path has a time varying conditional mean. Given that a time series is strictly stationary, what can we say about the conditional distribution? How is it possible to determine that a time series is stationary based on a single realization path? EDIT I believe the conceptual issue I am facing relates to conditioning. Moreover, I think that the question may be answered by: Law of total expectation: $E(x)=E[E(x|y)]$ Law of total variance: $var(x)=E[var(x|y)] + var[E(x|y)]$
