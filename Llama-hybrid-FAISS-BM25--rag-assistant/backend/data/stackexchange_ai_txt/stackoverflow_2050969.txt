Grails WebFlow with Ajax

I am trying to transition to next state of a WebFlow using Ajax requests. But it stays in the same state and returns the GSP as response for that state while I am expecting the GSP for the next state. Following is the WebFlow code: def gettingStartedAjaxFlow = { flow1 { on("next") { println "flow1" }.to("flow2") on("skip").to("flow2") } flow2 { on("next") { println "flow2" }.to("flow3") on("skip").to("flow3") } flow3 { on("next"){ println "flow3" }.to("finish") on("skip").to("finish") finish { redirect(action:"index") } } } Following is the Ajax call I am making for the state transition: $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "/UN/user/gettingStartedAjax", success: function(data) { $("#wizardDiv").html(data); } }); The GSPs for each state (flow1, flow2, flow3) contains a a code fragment having remoteForm & required next and skip submit buttons to transition to next state and as a result update the "wizardDiv" div. Following is the GSP fragment for flow1 state: You are in flow 1
