SQL Server DMV - sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats - What do these columns mean?

I am tinkering with creating a query to find missing indexes. I've taken a base query created by the Red-Gate folks in their SQL Server DMV Starter Pack eBook and am modifying it a bit. There are a couple columns in sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats which I don't know how to interpret. They are: avg_total_user_cost avg_user_impact According to documentation I found avg_total_user_cost is defined as Represents the average total user cost each time when the user query was executed . And, avg_user_impact Represents the value as a percentage. It shows the amount of improvement which you can get if the index is created. An index my query says should be added shows a 2.22 average user cost and a 99.82 user impact. What do these numbers really mean? Does this mean by adding an index, I can improve the speed of the associated query by 99.82%. I have no clue what 2.22 might mean. Thanks.
