Detecting 'unusual behavior' using machine learning with Redis and Python?

I am developing client application using python . It will listening the redis queue (subpub) and doing some suppression and aggregations . Eg msg from redis :- CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full recovered CPU 90% full critical CPU 90% full critical CPU 90% full recovered After the client it's look like below CPU 80% full critical count 3 CPU 90% full critical count 2 after recovering I am not keep track any messages Problem is,due to application unusual behavior sometimes i am getting more alerts frequently , it's like below . CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full recovered CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full recovered CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full recovered CPU 80% full critical CPU 80% full recovered I need to identify this . how can use machine learning for this ?
