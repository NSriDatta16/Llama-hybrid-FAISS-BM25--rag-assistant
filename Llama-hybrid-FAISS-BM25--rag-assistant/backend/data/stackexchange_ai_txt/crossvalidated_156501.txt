How to uniquely define the credible interval?

Consider we are in the Bayesian paradigm and consider that we know the posterior $P(\tau|d)$ of the single parameter $\tau$, whose max of the posterior is given by $\tau_{\text{best}}$. The credible interval $[\tau_{\text{min}}, \tau_{\text{max}}]$ is defined by defining the indicador function $$I(\tau) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \tau_{\text{min}} and solve $P(I|d) = 0.95$, right? My issue is that this does not uniquely define the interval since there is only one condition to compute two independent variables (i.e. the system is underdetermined). Given this, I tried defining it using two conditions $$P(\tau_{\text{min}} which is to say that I want the mass "0.95" equally distributed on both sides of $\tau_{\text{best}}$. However, I'm working on an example on which 0.95/2 is not on the left side of the distribution (i.e. the distribution is not symmetrical). So, my question is: how do I define a unique credible interval that is generic? Is it even possible to define it generically and uniquely?
