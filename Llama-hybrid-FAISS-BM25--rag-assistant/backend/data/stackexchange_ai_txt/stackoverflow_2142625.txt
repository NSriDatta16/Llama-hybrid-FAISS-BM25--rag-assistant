If you got the latest, then HEAD = default selected revision number. If not, then HEAD > default selected revision number. In either case, you should be aware of specifically which revision you are branching from and what changes have made it into that revision. So this means you should usually use a specific revision number, unless you're the only committer and are therefore certain that nobody checked in changes after your last update. This is probably why Tortoise defaults to a specific revision: to encourage this behavior.
