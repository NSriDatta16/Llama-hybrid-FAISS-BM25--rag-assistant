One could use Monte Carlo and some reasonable prior assumptions to quantify the uncertainty in your costs, at the least. Here I make some very rough assumptions: Guests will drink at a steady pace for all six hours We pretend we've seen six guests, four of which were moderate drinkers, two were light drinkers. Moderate drinkers consume 1 per hour (sd = .3) Light drinkers consume .5 per hour (sd = .2) We pretend we've seen twenty-five drinks served: five sodas, ten beers, ten wine/liquor. No guest will earn you money by consuming negative beverages. library(truncnorm) # for truncated normal, so guests don't have drinks You can see there's a lot of uncertainty, even in this crude model. You might expand the uncertainty further by better modeling of your prior assumptions.
