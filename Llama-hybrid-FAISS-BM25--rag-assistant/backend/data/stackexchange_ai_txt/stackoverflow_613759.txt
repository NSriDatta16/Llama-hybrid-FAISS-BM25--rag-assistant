How to show a title of document window without icon?

Now I drag a file to the app icon in the dock, this app is based on document . I found that no little image on the left of window title after the app is run and the mainwindow is open . but when I drag a file to the dock icon before the app run and use this method to run the app , a little image on the left of window title to show the file ,just like the xcode etc. Now I want to show the little image both way or not to show the little image both way , How to do ? I think that it maybe the window property based on document , but I don't know how to fix it ? Thanks! alt text http:///Users/jinxin/Desktop/Mydocument.png I used the [mainWindow setTitle:tmp]; , but icon still appear. when I used setTitleWithRepresentedFilename: I found that both icon and window title name both are modify, in the document class I overload the -(void)displayName; so I want to the window title is fixed anytime.
