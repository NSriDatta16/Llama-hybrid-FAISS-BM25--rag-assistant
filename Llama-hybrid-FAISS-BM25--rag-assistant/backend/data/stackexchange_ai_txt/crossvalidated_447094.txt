Average time ant needs to get out to the woods

An ant has three passages to choose from: Passage A takes 7 minutes to get ant out of the ant house to the woods. Passage B takes 8 minutes to get ant back to the starting point where he is. Passage C takes 12 minutes to get ant back to the starting point where he is. The ant chooses a passage randomly until it gets out of the ant house to the woods. How to calculate the expected average time ant needs to get out? Does simple mean value (7 + 8 + 12) / 3 = 9 answer the question?
