Given the end goal of simple lookup conditional on a specific version of a specific product, a table may be suitable. Graphs are good to finding patterns, but tables are better for finding exact values. Here is a quick and dirty mock-up in an ascii table that I think would be alright for the job. Here you would just have different tables given a different starting software product. B C D ---------------------------- A 1.1 2.2 2.3 A 1.2 3.4 1.5 3.5 3.6 A 1.3 3.6 1.6 3.7 1.7 3.8 A 1.4 3.8 1.7 3.9 Graphs are good though for seeing patterns, so a set of graphs may be useful in helping customers choose which software best suits there needs given the compatibility constraints. Here is a simple paneled scatterplot approach, with the A version of the software on the Y axis, and different panels show different software version compatibility pairs. I bet you could make a fairly nice planar (i.e. few lines crossing) network diagram to depict it using an irregular layout (if you have products cluster with one another and then lines between the clusters), but the scatterplot is easier to whip up in a few minutes, and organizing the panels I imagine will do just as good a job as a network diagram.
