Weird result from R regarding structural break test

I'm trying to detect structural breaks in time series of NAV using 'strucchange' in R. I have created the NAV by using a simple annualized return of 5% and 10% (no random term). However, after using 'breakpoints' test in R the result is that the break point is not on the point I have changed return from 5% to 10%. My code is like: library(readr) test The data I use is Here Did I do something wrong? Why isn't it break on time ~500 where the return changed from 5% to 10%?
