Best practices for 'InProc' vs 'StateServer' for ASP .NET session state

We have a single ASP .NET application running on a single web server (no farm). For now, we're using the default 'InProc' session storage. Is it worth considering using the ASP .NET state service instead? If we went that route we'd likely just run the service itself on the same machine as the application, so making calls out over the network to get and set session info wouldn't be an issue. The reason we are considering this at all is to help avoid session data being lost when the app pool recycles. Also, using SQL Server is off the table for now, so we're just talking about in-process vs state server. What are the pros and cons to each mode in this scenario?
