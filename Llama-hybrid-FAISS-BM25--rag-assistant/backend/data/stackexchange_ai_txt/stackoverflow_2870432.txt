How can I get jQuery UI's Draggable and Sortable functions to work on the iPhone?

I have a page that uses JQuery UI; in particular the Sortable interaction. The page works fine for desktop web browsers with mice, however I can't get the drag-drop functionality to work on Mobile Safari on the iPhone. Any dragging action simply scrolls the page. The functionality on my page is extremely similar to the Sortable Empty-Lists demo on the JQuery UI site. This page also doesn't work on the iPhone. Is there any way to get the drag-drop functions working on the iPhone?
