Do I have a censored variable or not? What is the mean of my data?

I have a variable variable from a survey, which has a range from never (0) to always (100) in 10 steps (0 -100). It is obviously a discrete (ordinal) variable, but I want to try to treat is as continuous (or at least not ordinal), because I want to aggregate this variable to the area level. I want to aggregate them to the area level, to be able to run a panel regression at the area level. (In other words, I want to use the mean value of this variable for each area as a variable in my actual regression). The ultimate goal, is to treat the mean as an endogenous variable in panel data and use an IV approach to examine how changes to the mean of this variable relate to changes in the dependent variable. I am conflicted on how to aggregate the data. If I insist on treating it as a discrete, how should I determine the mean by area ? I started out with just taking the "normal" mean, but I thought that distribution wise, my data is censored. Because it can take on only values between 0 and 100 (Although the range of interpretation goes from always to never). In case the data is censored, taking the mean would underestimate the mean of the "latent" variable. I have also been considering using a logistic regression because I read it also works for values between 0 and 1, which would perhaps be a good approximation for my data which ranges from 0-100 with values in between. In the end, I am unsure how to calculate the mean, considering the distribution of the data. I know that calculating the mean for censored data is quite troublesome (and I do not know how to do it ( link ). Is the mean of a logistic distribution simply the "normal" mean? # dat represents the first 100 values dat Taking the normal mean, by area , results in the following:
