How to use matching methods with multilevel data?

I am very new to matching and multilevel models, so I hope my question is not too na√Øve. I have a time series data set with a binary dependent variable measured at the individual level, a dichotomous treatment indicator (also at the individual level), and a series of country-related variables I would like to include. My idea is to use multilevel models with matching to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated. The data look somewhat like the example below. I would like to model one random intercept for year and another one for country with gdp as a predictor. ID depen age treat country year gdp 1 1 19 1 1 1999 10.01 2 1 23 0 1 1999 11.42 3 0 43 1 1 1999 12.48 4 1 27 1 1 2000 12.78 5 0 67 0 1 2000 13.22 6 1 34 1 2 1999 47.54 7 0 54 1 2 1999 47.99 8 0 22 1 2 1999 48.32 9 0 78 0 2 2000 48.55 10 1 52 0 2 2000 49.04 Is there any way to do it using R and, preferably, with matching techniques other than propensity score (e.g., coarsened exact or genetic matching )? Thanks!
