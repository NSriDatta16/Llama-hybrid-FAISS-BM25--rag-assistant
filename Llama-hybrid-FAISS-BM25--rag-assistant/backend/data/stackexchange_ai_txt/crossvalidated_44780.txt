Adjusted mortality rates

I have some data similar to this died age hospital 0 75 AA 0 88 AA 1 81 AA 0 77 AA 1 65 AA 0 41 AA 0 66 BA 1 81 BA 0 82 BA 1 64 BA 0 65 BA 1 52 BA I was asked to calculate "age adjusted mortality rates" for each hospital. There are around 150 hospitals and approx 1000 patients (observations) per hospital. Each row in the data concerns a particular patient. I was told how this could be done in Stata: Perform logistic regression of died on age . Use the predict function to get patient-level probabilities of death. Summarise the patient-level probabilities by hospital to get the mortality rates for each hospital. However, I am using R. Is this the correct approach ? Are the alternatives ? Can I do the same thing in R with glm and predict ? Edit: I should perhaps add that there are several other variables that are going to be adjusted for in the model. I have shown age above, just for simplicity.
