How to use a feature recorded in different unit?

I want to use hour as a feature in my random forest model. The challenge that Iâ€™m facing is that some observations are recorded based on machine operating hour while others are in engine hour. Without a clear cut conversion between the 2 unit of measurements, how can I include hour into a model without creating bias?
