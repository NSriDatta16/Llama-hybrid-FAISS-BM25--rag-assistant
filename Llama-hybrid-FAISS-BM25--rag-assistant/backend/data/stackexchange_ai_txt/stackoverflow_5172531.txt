Intuitively Understanding Android Tasks

Tasks and Back Stack is the definitive resource for understanding the mechanism involving tasks and their interaction with the Back button. In an early paragraph: A task is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job. The activities are arranged in a stack (the "back stack"), in the order in which each activity is opened. Tasks are then explained in terms of the home screen and how it launches processes. This makes sense. I'm curious, however: What should determine the use of multiple tasks in "user" applications? I'm interested in a intuitive understanding or heuristic guiding task usage rather than simply trying to achieve specific orderings of activities on the back stack.
