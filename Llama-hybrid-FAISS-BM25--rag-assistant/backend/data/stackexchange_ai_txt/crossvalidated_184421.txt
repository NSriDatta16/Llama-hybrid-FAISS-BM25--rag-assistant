reverse causality when dependent variable and independent variable are observed on different levels

Consider the following: $$ Y_{ijt} = \gamma \cdot P_{jt} +X_{ijt} \beta+\epsilon_{ijt} $$ The j dimension is only indicated for clarity, the regression is a panel regression on i-t dimensions. The dependent variable $Y$ is observed at firm i in country j. There is an independent variable $P$ which is a country level policy variable. The other variables $X$ are all at the firm level. Someone argues the policy variable could be caused by the dependent variable. For this to create a reverse causality problem does the firm level observation of the dependent variable have to cause the policy of a government to shift. Or does the average of the dependent variable have to cause the policy of a government to shift? For example does the following argument defend my methodology: Firm i is to small to give the government a reason to change the policy Or should I reason: The collective/average behavior of the firms could give the government a reason to change the policy
