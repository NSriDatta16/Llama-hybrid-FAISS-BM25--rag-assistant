The best approach to scramble CSS definitions to a human-unreadable state throughout an ASP.NET application

I'm not sure if it will bring anything beyond saving on traffic through the removal of long-worded names, but I would definitely want to hide my system of namings, declarations and their organization. The thing is that manual Find&Replace is going to take a very long time, and each slight modification could probably require the process to be redone in part or in whole. Has anyone thought of this problem? Maybe write a macros? Will it be intelligent enough to be able to discover names in a CSS file? Does anything better and simplier exist?
