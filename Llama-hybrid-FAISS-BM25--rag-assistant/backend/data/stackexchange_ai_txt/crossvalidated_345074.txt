Test for similar movements in time series

I'm currently doing a research and I am using multiple time series about the CPI of certain product categories in China. I want to measure which time series acts in the same way as the CPI of milk products. I first used Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping, but I just realised that there might be time series that act in similar ways as the CPI of milk, but always in a much bigger or smaller sense (so that we could model this specific time series as: constant * CPI milk products. For instance, I could imagine a time series to always have only 10% of the same positive/negative effect as CPI of milk, so that the model becomes 0.1*CPImilk.) Is there a measure for testing the similarities in movements?
