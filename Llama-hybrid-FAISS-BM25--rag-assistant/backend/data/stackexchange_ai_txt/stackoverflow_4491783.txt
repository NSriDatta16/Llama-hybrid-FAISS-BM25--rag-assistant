How to associate an event with only one object? jqplot

Im using jqplot to draw some charts. It is a great tool, but it lacks a simple clickhandler option for each chart. Its plugins like highlighter, draggable and cursor register their interest in capturing click/mouse-events from the jqplot canvas by adding themselves to jqplot.eventListenerHooks (eventListenerHooks.push(['jqplotClick', callback]); for example. or 'jqplotMouseDown' or such are also available. After making my plot with the usual $.jqplot(target, data, options); then I do this $.jqplot.eventListenerHooks.push(['jqplotClick', myFunc]); and sure enough myFunc gets called wherever I click on the plot, with event , neighbour , datapos and gridpos . Neighbour is the most interesting, it contains my data point if there was a click on it. This is the data I need to make a popup close to the gridpos with aditional information on the datapoint. But the problem is if I have two charts on the same page and want to register different callbacks for each jqplot. As it is now, when I register the second myFunc2, all the clicks on the second plot go through the myFunc aswell! Do I need to make changes to jqplot? Any directions, whatsoever? Thanks
