As a web crawler is just another client trying to access your site then the authenticated area will be inaccessible to the crawler too. If you want to tell web crawlers not to indexing other parts of your website, use a file called robots.txt that you place in the root directory of your site. For example: robots.txt User-agent: * Disallow: /hidden This will tell all web crawlers not to indexing content inside the directory 'hidden'.
