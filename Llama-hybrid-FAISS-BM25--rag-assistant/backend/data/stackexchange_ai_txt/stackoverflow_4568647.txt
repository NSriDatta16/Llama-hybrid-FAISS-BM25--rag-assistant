You are not seeing that exception because in your load(...) method you have the below System.out System.out.println("user fetched with 'load' inside transaction : " + user); And as you can see, you are printing the "user" by calling toString() on it (this is called automatically). And in the logs I see the below is being printed which means you have overriden the toString() method which internally is calling getter method of each of the given properties. And since this is all happening while the transaction is still open (you are commiting the transaction after the load(...) method has been called) you doesn't see this exception. user fetched with 'load' inside transaction : 1:Albert Kam xzy:abc
