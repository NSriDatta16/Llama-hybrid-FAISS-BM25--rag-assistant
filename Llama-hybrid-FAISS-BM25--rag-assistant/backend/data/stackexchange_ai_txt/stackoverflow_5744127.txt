Where can I find a full websocket example easily working with easyphp an/or wamp?

Also, my requirements : archive containing all the code so I just have to drag and drop it to easyphp any kind of example will do the job (chat, game...) I'm not a script kiddie. The way I work when attempting to learn a new techno is to retro engineer an example. So far, I haven't found annything meeting the 2 requirements. (Please don't downvote even if you think I'm too lazy) While any answers pointed me to a great internet resource, I manage to implement a pretty great example. It's a whiteboard. If you are interested, here are the links : My blog entry about it The github repo The video demontrating it. Just wanted to share. Any questions, I be glad to answer.
