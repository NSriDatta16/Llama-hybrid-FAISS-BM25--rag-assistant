You can use the BayesFactor package in R to easily compute Bayesian t tests. See the examples here: http://bayesfactorpcl.r-forge.r-project.org/#twosample for details. The web calculator at http://pcl.missouri.edu/bayesfactor uses the same models (see the Rouder et al 2009 reference on the web calculator page). Note that the Kruschke reference given above does not actually allow you to test a null hypothesis.
