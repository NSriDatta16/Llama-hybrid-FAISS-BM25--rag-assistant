One way I can imagine is to use a linked list to implement such a scenario, if you need all the numbers entered before the user enters something which indicates the loop termination. (posting as the first option, because have never done this for user input, it just seemed to be interesting. Wasteful but artistic ) Another way is to do buffered input. Allocate a buffer, fill it, re-allocate, if the loop continues ( not elegant, but the most rational for the given use-case ). I don't consider the described to be elegant though. Probably, I would change the use-case ( the most rational ).
