Forecasting an AR(2) model simply uses an iterative approach. Your first point forecast $\hat{y}_{T+1}$ relies on your last two historical observations $y_T$ and $y_{T-1}$ (since your AR order is 2). So plug these two in to get your point forecast $\hat{y}_{T+1}$ . Now, your next forecast $\hat{y}_{T+2}$ relies on $y_T$ (which you have, it's your last historical observation) and $y_{T+1}$ (which you don't have, it's your first forecast period). So instead of $y_{T+1}$ , we simply use the forecast $\hat{y}_{T+1}$ which we just calculated above. And so forth for $\hat{y}_{T+t}$ . Since you have a posterior distribution for your coefficients, just perform this within each MCMC run and take the average at the end. For quantile forecasts, draw additional noise terms $\epsilon_{T+t}$ , add these to your forecasts and finally take quantiles. More information can be found in this free online open forecasting textbook .
