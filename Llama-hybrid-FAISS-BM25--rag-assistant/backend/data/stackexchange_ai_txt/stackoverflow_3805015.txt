SQLite with Actionscript (AIR) for all users

I would like to save settings for an AIR application to a local SQLite database. Wherever I read, it's recommended that you use File.applicationStorageDirectory to save the database file. My problem is that in most cases, the AIR application will be first started by an administrator that configs and setup the application (and save the settings to database) and later used by different users. And what I would like to know is if there is possible to save the database to a location that every user can load it from? As I understand it, File.applicationStorageDirectory points to the user directory? There is probably possible too make the admins set correct permissions and stuff, but I don't want to make it difficult too install...
