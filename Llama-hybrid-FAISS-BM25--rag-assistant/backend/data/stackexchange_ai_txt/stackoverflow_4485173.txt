You are already using JavaScript object detection to determine the browser. You could continue to use this to either add the link dynamically on page load or set it's style to display none/true . I would recommend this approach as it keeps everything consistent (client side). However, if you want to do this with PHP, then check out $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
