Yes, you surely can do that. I donâ€™t know applications in ecology, but you may be interested to know that this is widely used in genetics (epidemiology and population genetics), with $n \ll p$, typically $n = 1000$ or $5000$ individuals and $p = 500\,000$ genotypes. To adjust analyses for population mixture, the first 10 or 50 PC are used. The first two PC give already lots of informations, as shown in Novembre J (2008) . Pay special attention to figure 1 where you see that the two first PC obtained from genomic data retrieve roughly the spacial arrangement off populations within Europe.
