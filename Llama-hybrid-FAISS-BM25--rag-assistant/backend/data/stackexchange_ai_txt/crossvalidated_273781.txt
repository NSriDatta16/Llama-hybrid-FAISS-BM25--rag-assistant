The justification to use a regression specification is to measure the "income gap" after controlling for various confounding aspects. By running separate cross-sectional regressions one entertains the possibility that this income gap changes through time (and so it cannot be represented by a constant coefficient over time, which would justify using the whole of panel data together). The fact that the cross-sectional dimension is large provides comfort that any variation over-time observed in the resulting time series of coefficients is not due to sample error/variation but largely reflects existing structural relationships. So what the OP thinks of doing can in principle be considered a valid approach. The general issue of using "derived" variables (in the subsequent analysis), is no different to when we use Instrumental Variables estimation -there too, we are using estimated variables as regressors (in the cases where instead of just substituting the instrument for the original regressor, we regress the regressor on the instruments and use its estimated value). By the way, having panel data but running many cross-sectional regressions instead of a single pooled one, looks like having some similarities with the "dummy variable method" and its "adjacent-period" variant, used in Hedonic Price Analysis (see for example the overview book by Jack Triplett, chapter 3 ).
