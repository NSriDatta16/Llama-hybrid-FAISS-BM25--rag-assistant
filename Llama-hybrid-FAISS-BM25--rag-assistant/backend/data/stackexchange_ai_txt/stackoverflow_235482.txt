You can't make that syntax work (because of static checking at compile time), but if you're willing to modify the syntax, you can achieve the same effect pretty easily. It would be fairly easy to have a dictionary member with a string->blob mapping, and have member functions like: template T get_member( string name ); template void set_member( string name, T value ); You could make the syntax more compact/tricky if you want (eg: using a '->' operator override). There are also some compiler-specific tricks you could possibly leverage (MSVC supports __declspec(property), for example, which allows you to map references to a member variable to methods of a specific format). At the end of the day, though, you're not going to be able to do something the compiler doesn't accept in the language and get it to compile.
