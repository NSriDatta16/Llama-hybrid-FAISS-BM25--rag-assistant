Logistic plot seems wrong

I'm a newbie to R and am hoping someone can show me the error of my ways. I'm getting what appears to be a logistic regression and plot but I wasn't expecting the slope around 25.2 to be so steep and was expecting a more typical logistic curve. Also, the glm function threw a couple warnings but I don't think it's necessarily indicative of a problem. Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred p1ShapeResponse
