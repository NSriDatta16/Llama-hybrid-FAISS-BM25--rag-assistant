Interesting question, I am also thinking of adding a forecast/backcast combination missing value estimation function to the imputeTS R package. What in this case would have to be done is, 1. Take Data from 2001-2006 and make a forecast for 2007 e.g. with forecast / auto.arima Take 2008-2009 Data reverse it and make a forecast for 2007 (this is then called backcast, because it is done in the reverse direction) The two results (from backcast and forecast) can be combined like wanted. The most simple solution would be the mean of forecast and backcast value. But you could also think of weighting them according to the amount of data that was used for model building. For your example this could look like: library(forecast) #Create data for forecast and backcast fcData More problems arise, if there are multiple NAs all over the time series. Then you can not just split into before and after a certain NA gap. Because the parts before will also contain NAs and thus making a forecast is not possible. You would have to go iterative over the dataset in this case. Always making the fore/backcast for next NA. But the other posters are also right, there are methods that might be better suited if you just want to replace/impute the missing values. library(imputeTS) na.kalman(x) Would be an example of a method from the imputeTS package. ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imputeTS/imputeTS.pdf for a detailed method description) Also the forecast and zoo package have some methods especially for time series imputation.
