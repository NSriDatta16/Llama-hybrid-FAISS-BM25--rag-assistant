We open a backdoor for Google and other search engines. We have a white-list of IPs used by major search engines. If we see the requests are from one of the IPs, we bypass authentication and display an abbreviated version of the page so Google can index it but not all information are available from Google's cache. We tried to use User-Agent but found people abuse it. IP is much harder to hack.
