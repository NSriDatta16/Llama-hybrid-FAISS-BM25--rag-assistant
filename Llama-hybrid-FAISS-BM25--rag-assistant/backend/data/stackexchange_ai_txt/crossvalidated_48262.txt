What is the difference between "limiting" and "stationary" distributions?

I'm doing a question on Markov chains and the last two parts say this: Does this Markov chain possess a limiting distribution. If your answer is "yes", find the limiting distribution. If your answer is "no", explain why. Does this Markov chain possess a stationary distribution. If your answer is "yes", find the stationary distribution. If your answer is "no", explain why. What is the difference? Earlier, I thought the limiting distribution was when you work it out using $P = CA^n C^{-1}$ but this is the $n$'th step transition matrix. They calculated the limiting distribution using $\Pi = \Pi P$, which I thought was the stationary distribution. Which is which then?
