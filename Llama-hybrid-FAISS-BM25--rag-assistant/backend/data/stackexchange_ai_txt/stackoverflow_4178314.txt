I had a similar issue, but I was not using ASP.Net 1.1 nor updating a control via javascript. My problem only happened on Firefox and not on IE (!). I added options to a DropDownList on the PreRender event like this: DropDownList DD = (DropDownList)F.FindControl("DDlista"); HiddenField HF = (HiddenField)F.FindControl("HFlista"); string[] opcoes = HF.value.Split('\n'); foreach (string opcao in opcoes) DD.Items.Add(opcao); My "HF" (hiddenfield) had the options separated by the newline, like this: HF.value = "option 1\n\roption 2\n\roption 3"; The problem was that the HTML page was broken (I mean had newlines) on the options of the "select" that represented the DropDown. So I resolved my my problem adding one line: DropDownList DD = (DropDownList)F.FindControl("DDlista"); HiddenField HF = (HiddenField)F.FindControl("HFlista"); string dados = HF.Value.Replace("\r", ""); string[] opcoes = dados.Split('\n'); foreach (string opcao in opcoes) DD.Items.Add(opcao); Hope this help someone.
