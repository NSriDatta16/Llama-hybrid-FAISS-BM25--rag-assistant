How to estimate 95% confidence interval for the mean of proportions in a very small sample (n=3)

I have a dataset composed of 6 independent observations, where values are percentages (proportions) of a specific element in a set. There are 2 groups of observations, and each has $n=3$ observations. Is there a procedure that is able to deal with this very low sample size and provide confidence intervals for the average proportions of each group?
