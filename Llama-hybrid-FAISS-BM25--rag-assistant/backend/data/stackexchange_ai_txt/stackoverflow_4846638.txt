How to Remove Excess Whitespace in String Using Regex

I have a series of paragraphs that I want to parse using regular expressions, but unfortunately, the paragraph is appearing with many white spaces in between sentences, and sometimes words. I would like to be able to remove all excess white space, but I'm unsure how... Anyone have any ideas? I don't want to remove all whitespace, which is the only thing I've found so far, but to keep regular paragraph format, as in after every word have a white space, and after every punctuation+word have a whitespace. I am coding in Perl. Any help would be appreciated!
