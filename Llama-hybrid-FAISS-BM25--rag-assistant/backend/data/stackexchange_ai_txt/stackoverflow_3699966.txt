Install Dev App on IPhone - Not in List

I have recently provisioned my IPhone to be a development device when I had version 3.1 of the firmware installed. I was forced to upgrade firmware last night due to 3.2 being the base supported firmware by the framework I am using. I am now running 4.1 of the iOS firmware. Before I did this the device showed up in XCode as a valid target to run my application aside from the simulator. Now when I open xcode I never see my device in the list. I also look at organizer and it is enabled for development as I am able to look at the console for the device. Also the provisioning profiles are still there. I am at a bit of a loss as to what is wrong. I appreciate any ideas people may have as to how I can fix this.
