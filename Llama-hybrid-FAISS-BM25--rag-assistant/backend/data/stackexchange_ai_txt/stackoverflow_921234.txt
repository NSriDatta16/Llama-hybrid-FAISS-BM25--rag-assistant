That's an individual question that could depend on how you're working. Some people like to put the variable type at the beginning of the variable, like "str_message". And some people like to use underscore between their words ("my_message") while others like to separate them with upper-case letters ("myMessage"). I'm often working with huge JavaScript libraries with other people, so functions and variables (except the private variables inside functions) got to start with the service's name to avoid conflicts, as "guestbook_message". In short: English, lower-cased, well-organized variable and function names is preferable according to me. The names should describe their existence rather than being short.
