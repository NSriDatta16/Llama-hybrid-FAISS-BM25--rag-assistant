Examining a correlation matrix is helpful, but it is not a sufficient check since variables may be correlated when taken together but not pairwise. I recommend examining tolerance or Variance Inflation Factor diagnostics in regression using a weighted regression where the weights are set to be equal to phat x (1-phat) where phat are the predicted values obtained from the logistic regression model fit with the same variables.
