Organising Javascript Files in Visual Studio

Interested how others are organising their scripts in Visual Studio ? Currently, the project I am working on has a large number of scripts and getting confused how to organise them into an arrangement without something like all over the place? Is there some easy way to organise scripts [or some tool] that allows easy packing, minification etc on release build ? Thx
