You can't change the type of a variable in C. You can use a little preprocessor trickery to get the illusion of what you want. i.e. int myvar = 10; // code using myvar as an int #define myvar _myvar char *myvar = "..."; // code using myvar as a char* That being said, I cannot discourage this strongly enough. Don't do it!
