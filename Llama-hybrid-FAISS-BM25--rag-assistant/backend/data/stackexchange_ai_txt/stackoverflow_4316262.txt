I had exactly the same problem. Additional problem was that i didn't want to loose attribute values. First of all you need to export products with attribute by magento dataflow system (System/ImportExport/Profiles). You need to create profile to export and mark in Export: 'only mapped fields'. You can use sku and attribute which you want to change for integer in database. Later you should create sql install file in any module to change database: mysql4-install-0.1.0.php $installer->startSetup(); $installer->updateAttribute('catalog_product', ' >', array( 'backend_type' => 'int', )); $this->endSetup(); ?> Later it is very important to reindex product_attribute and product_flat_data. Next step is to mark all product which use this attribute and using action "update attributes" you should set value by 100 for example. Now reindex again !!! and import file by another profile in dataflow. Good luck!
