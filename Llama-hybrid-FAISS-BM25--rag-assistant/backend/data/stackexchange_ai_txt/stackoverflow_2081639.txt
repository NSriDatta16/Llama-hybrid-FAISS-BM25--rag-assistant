Why do programming language allow assignment from integer to shortint?

program TypeCategory; {$R+} var sInt : shortint; iInt : integer; begin readln(iInt); sInt := iInt; writeln(sInt); end. Considering the above example,pascal language do allow assignment from integer to shortint ,or even longint to shortint without explict type casting.That is,pascal do allow assignment inside type category(here is the integer types). Pascal is famous for its strongly typed ,but why it allow this kind of weakly typed thing?I think this kind of syntax would encourage inconsistent code. What are pros for this kind of syntax?Are there any other languages which applied this kind of syntax,except the famous C and C++? thanks. EDIT : I have only tested turbo pascal and free pascal with fpc/objfpc/tp/delphi model .Also,the gcc/g++ and msvc produce the same result.That is,assigment from int (which is size of 4 byte on my computer) to short int (size of 2) will not triggger any compile errors,while you could set proper options to make the compilers generate possible lose of data warnings.
