Is there a good tutorial on cocoa touch automated UI testing?

Typically I find that nearly all my most important test cases for iPhone development revolve around UI testing rather than business logic or data testing. I'm not very familiar with automated UI testing in the XCode environment. Can someone point me to a good tutorial or book? UPDATE This question was written several years ago and UI testing has come a long way since then. Using the UI Automation is still an option, but the KIF Framework is a much better solution for functional testing now, IMO. From KIF's github page: KIF, which stands for Keep It Functional, is an iOS integration test framework. It allows for easy automation of iOS apps by leveraging the accessibility attributes that the OS makes available for those with visual disabilities. KIF builds and performs the tests using a standard XCTest testing target. Testing is conducted synchronously in the main thread (running the run loop to force the passage of time) allowing for more complex logic and composition. This also allows KIF to take advantage of the Xcode 5 Test Navigator, command line build tools, and Bot test reports.
