What is the actual use of GAN model? Is it only used to generate the data that closely resembles original dataset?

I am very new to tensor flow. I came across GANS. From what I understand in GANs there are 2 models, Generator and Discriminator. Generator job is to generate the data that will be able to fool the discriminator by producing data which closely resembles actual data (distribution of data). And we have Discriminator whose job is to tell if the data came from fake/generator or real/actual input data. In ideal situation, discriminator will not be able to tell if the data came from generator or real data set. This is what I understood GANS does. What I don't understand is what exactly is done after we have perfec Generator/Discriminator. Is it used just to produce extra data in case we have few data or is it used solely generate data to create fake result. Most of the implementation I have seen are in image classification where generator creates similar data ( mnist) dataset. In short. What do we do after we have generator/discriminator? What exactly is it used for other than creating "fake" data? Thanks, Sam
