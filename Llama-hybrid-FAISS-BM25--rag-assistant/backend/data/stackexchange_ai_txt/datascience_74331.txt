How can we use the cosine similarity formula on document feature vector without a direction?

In mathematics, a vector has both magnitude and direction. In data science, for identifying document similarity we convert the document into a feature vector. Then apply cosine angle formula between the source and target document's feature vector. However the cosine formula is applicable only for vectors. And a vector should have both magnitude snd direction. For a document that is represented as a vector, where is the direction?
