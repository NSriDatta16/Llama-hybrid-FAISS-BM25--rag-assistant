An element with more text pushes down other inline-block elements. Why?

This is super simple and I'm completely baffled by this behavior. I want my search results to display in a nice grid of blocks of 2 in a row. But instead it shows up crooked where the div with more text pushes others down with it's content. How can I fix this? Here's a simplified example that shows the problem in FF and Chrome: .search_result { border: thin solid; width: 250px; height:200px; display: inline-block; } Meerkats demonstrate altruistic behavior within their colonies; one or more meerkats stand sentry while others are foraging or playing, to warn them of approaching dangers ... one or more meerkats stand sentry meerkats
