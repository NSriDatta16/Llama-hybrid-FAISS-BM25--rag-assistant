Conditionals in WPF

I have the following question: I have a Boolean variable in a configuration file. If it is true I want a property in textbox control to be setup according to the value of that variable. Try the solution above but it does not work. What am I doing wrong? This is a fragment code: bool isKeyboardAvtive = true; //read from configuration file
