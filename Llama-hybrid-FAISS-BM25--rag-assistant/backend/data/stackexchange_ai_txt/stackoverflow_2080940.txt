The GET method is meant for data retrieval only and should not have any side-effects . But POST is meant for that specific purpose: altering data on the server side. GET requests can easily be foreged (see Cross-Site Request Forgery ) by just placing an image on a page while forging POST requests is not that easy (this is also a reason why you should only allow authorized POST requests).
