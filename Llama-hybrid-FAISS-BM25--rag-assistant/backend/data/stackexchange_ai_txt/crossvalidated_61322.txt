The error is a bug. I'll fix it in the next version of the forecast package. In the meantime, you can simply omit either the use.damped.trend or use.trend argument. A smoothing parameter of $\alpha=1.4$ is not incorrect. Even for a simple exponential smoothing model, the admissible parameter region for $\alpha$ is (0,2), corresponding to the invertible region of the equivalent ARIMA(0,1,1) model. However, it is common to restrict the region to (0,1) because it provides for additional interpretability of the equations in terms of weighted averages. For a TBATS model, the admissible parameter region is complicated but it also allows for smoothing parameters to be larger than 1.
