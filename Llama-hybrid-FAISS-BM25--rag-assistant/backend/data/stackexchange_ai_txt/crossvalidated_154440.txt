Run a Dickey-Fuller test for existence of a unit root (stationarity or integration), trend or drift in your time series. There are 3 basic tests based on the null hypothesis that the unit root=0: 1. Test for a unit root 2. Test for a unit root with drift 3. Test for a unit root with drift and a deterministic time trend In addition, the augmented D-F test can be used for more complex time series.
