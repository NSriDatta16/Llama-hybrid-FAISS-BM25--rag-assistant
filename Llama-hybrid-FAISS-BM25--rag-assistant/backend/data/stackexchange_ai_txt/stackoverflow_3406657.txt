I'd advice you to use a WebView String page = " "; webView.loadDataWithBaseURL("fake",page, "text/html", "UTF-8",""); So you're creating a simple HTML page with your picture and then display it in the webView. You can enable built-in zoom with zoomControl ( and maybe in the same time Multi-touch Zoom gesture for MultiTouch devices ?). You've also 2-dimension drag ( Vertical + Horizontal Scroll at the same time). That's why it's really faster to use a WebView !
