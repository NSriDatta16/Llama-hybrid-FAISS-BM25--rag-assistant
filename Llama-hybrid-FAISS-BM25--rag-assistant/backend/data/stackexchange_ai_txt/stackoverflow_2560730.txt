There is no such thing, as PowerPdf has never supported any fonts other than the 14 Standard Type 1 Fonts (see the source code ). There is no support for TrueType fonts, font embedding or such. What you can do is switch to the successor of PowerPdf, the Haru Free PDF Library . This supports encrypted TrueType fonts, font embedding and a few encodings other than the PDF WinAnsiEncoding . There are Delphi bindings. Together with a TTF that supports your barcode you should be able to make it work.
