A simple neural network for classifying datasets

I want to train a neural network that is as simple as possible, that is able to classify datasets. I have 5 MedMNIST datasets that each contain a number of labels, and with complex features. I'm seeking a simple neural network solution that is able to be able to just identify the source of an image, without the need to learn all complex representations. Optional details for use case: This network will be used in a federated learning scenario, where each node will train a simpler model that can classify it's own dataset, besides the model that classifies labels that it owns.
