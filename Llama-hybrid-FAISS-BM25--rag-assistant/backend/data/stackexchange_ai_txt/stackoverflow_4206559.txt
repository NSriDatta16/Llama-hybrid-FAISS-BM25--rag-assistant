Resume and Suspend are deprecated in Delphi 2010 and newer versions. Seems it is basically to discourage using them for thread synchronization. They are not meant for that. Anyways, if all you want to do is resuming a thread created suspended, then calling Resume in older versions is safe. If you need to use the same source code in both Delphi 2007 and Delphi XE, then you can use conditional compiling to avoid warning in XE. Also, take a look at this question which is related to your question: TThread.resume is deprecated in Delphi-2010 what should be used in place?
