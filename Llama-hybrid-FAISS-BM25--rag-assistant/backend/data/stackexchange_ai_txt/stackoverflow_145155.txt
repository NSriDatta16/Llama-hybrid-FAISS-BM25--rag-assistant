Something like Explorer's icon grid view in a Python GUI

I am making a Python gui project that needs to duplicate the look of a Windows gui environment (ie Explorer). I have my own custom icons to draw but they should be selectable by the same methods as usual; click, ctrl-click, drag box etc. Are any of the gui toolkits going to help with this or will I have to implement it all myself. If there aren't any tools to help with this advice would be greatly appreciated. edit I am not trying to recreate explorer, that would be madness. I simply want to be able to take icons and lay them out in a scrollable window. Any number of them may be selected at once. It would be great if there was something that could select/deselect them in the same (appearing at least) way that Windows does. Then all I would need is a list of all the selected icons.
