Two points First point: You could also perform a weighted average of the proportion of female instructors at the three schools (e.g., if A has ten times as many total instructors as B and C combined, one might argue that it should count more heavily). For example, $(n_{A}\times 0.23 + n_{B}\times 0.56 + n_{C} \times 0.8)/(n_{A} + n_{B} + n_{C})$ . If the total number of instructors at each institution is the same size, then the weighted average reduces to the simple arithmetic mean as in your example. Second point: If you recall that for Bernoulli distribution, the variance is determined by $p$ (the proportion), as in $\sigma^{2}_{p}=p(1-p)$ , so that $\sigma_{p}=\sqrt{p(1-p)}$ , and $\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$ (where $n = n_{A} + n_{B} + n_{C}$ ), one could readily generate a CI (say $\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sigma_{\hat{p}}$ ) under the assumption that A, B, and C are all drawn from the same population. Bonus point: Agresti and Coull have shown that the nominal coverage of the CI I just indicated performs suboptimally for small $n$ . They provide an alternative which gives better nominal CI coverage for $\hat{p}$ thus: $$\tilde{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\tilde{p}(1-\tilde{p})\tilde{n}}$$ where $\tilde{n} = n+2z_{\alpha/2}$ , and $\tilde{p} = \frac{\left(\Sigma x\right) +z_{\alpha/2}}{\tilde{n}}$ . Understand that the use of $\tilde{p}$ is purely instrumental , and the Agresti-Coull confidence interval is for $\hat{p}$ . As sample size gets big, the nominal coverage of the standard Wald-type CI and that of the Agresti-Coull CI converge.
