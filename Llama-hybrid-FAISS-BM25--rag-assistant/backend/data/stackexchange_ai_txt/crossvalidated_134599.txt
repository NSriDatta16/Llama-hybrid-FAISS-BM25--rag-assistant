How to classify a unbalanced dataset by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)?

I have a unbalanced dataset in a binary classification task, where the positives amount vs negatives amount is 0.3% vs 99.7%. The gap between positives and negatives are huge. When I train a CNN with the structure used in MNIST problem, the testing result shows a high False Negative Rate. Also, the training error curve goes down quickly in couple of epochs at the beginning but remains a same value in the following epochs. Could you please advise me a way to process this problem? Thanks!
