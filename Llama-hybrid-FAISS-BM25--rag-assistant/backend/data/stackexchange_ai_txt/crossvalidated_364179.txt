What is the relation between stationary distribution, limiting distribution, ergodicity and detailed balance equation in a markov chain?

I have studied them from various sources and I am not able to make a strong conclusion with respect to their relation with each other. This is what I understand by these terms Ergodic : If all states are positive recurrent and aperiodic Limiting Distribution : This talks about long term probabilities of being in particular states and is independent of initial distribution and is always unique. Stationary Distribution : This may depend on initial distribution and may not be unique. Detailed Balance : This means ${\pi_i}P_{ij} ={\pi_j}P_{ji}$. So my questions in case of Irreducible Finite MC are : What conclusion can be made about existence of a limiting and stationary distribution (and its uniqueness) if detail balance does or does not hold ? If a stationary distribution exists uniquely does it mean that detailed balance holds and that the distribution is also a limiting distribution ? Is it possible for non-ergodic MC to have a limiting distribution ? Do answers to above questions change if Irreducible MC has an infinite state space ?
