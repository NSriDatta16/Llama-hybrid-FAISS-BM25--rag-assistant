shb is a shortcut that opens a specific document in Windows when double-clicked; executed by the Windows Shell Scrap Object Handler (shscrap.dll). It's similar to a .LNK file, but not as commonly used; also known as a "Windows Shortcut into a Document." See here, maybe this thread will provide more info: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/12/6122832.aspx So, apparently, the shb file is created when you drag-and-drop a Notes document into a Windows context. What do you see when you open a shb file in text editor? If you can see some of the formats like this - Link description: Application 'MailDb', View 'Inbox', Document 'Doc Subject' - db replica ID: C125722E:00342CBB - View id / Document ID: OF38D45BF5:E8F08834-ON852564B5:00129B2C you could construct URLs that would open in either web browser or Lotus Notes client and open the database > view > document by appending this to your Domino server's url (for web browser) or to "notes://server" (for Notes client) : /Database/View/Document?OpenDocument See here for more info on Lotus Domino URL construction rules: http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/domhelp/v8r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.designer.domino.main.doc/H_ABOUT_DOMINO_URL_COMMANDS_4332.html
