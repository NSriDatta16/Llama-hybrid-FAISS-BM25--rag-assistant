XML transformation exception

I receive the following exception when transforming an XML file to pdf. The error seems specific to Java javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: Could not load the translet class 'GregorSamsa'. Cannot understand the reason. Any helpful suggestions greatly appreciated.
