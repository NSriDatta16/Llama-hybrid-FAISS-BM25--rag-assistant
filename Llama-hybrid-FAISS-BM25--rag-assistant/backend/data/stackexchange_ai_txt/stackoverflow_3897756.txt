Subtracting RGB values

I'm doing some work with images; I don't want to convert them to grayscale because I want to factor in the color. As you know, with grayscale, different colors can have the same grayscale value. If I were to subtract RGB values of one pixel from another, I assume that they will still have skew? That is to say, I would need to weight the resulting values using the luminance equation, rather than just adding/averaging them?
