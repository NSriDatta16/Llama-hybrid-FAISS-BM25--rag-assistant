Can you average categorical variables and then perform a two sample t-test?

I have a situation where I have two sets of apples. I want to show that one batch has more problems than the other. How could I go about doing it? The problems are things like: "Mold", "Worms", "Rotten" So far I looked at each apple and gave it a score where each instance of a problem counted as "1". So if an apple had mold and worms it had a value of 2 (for two problems). I then added the problems of the apples in each group and took an average, standard deviation, and performed a two sample student's t-test. Would this be the accurate way of assessing whether one group of apples had more problems than another group or is there a more accurate method?
