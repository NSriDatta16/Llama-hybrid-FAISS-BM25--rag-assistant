How can I write a simple pseudo assembler?

I have to write a series of testbenches for a simple cpu model written in VHDL. What I need is a piece of code that translates an instruction in assembly code (MIPS) into a binary string. I don't need anything clean or elegant. The only purpose would be speeding up the testing. I was thinking to write an emacs or vim script using abbreviations, or something like that. What do you suggest?
