I would suggest that you organize your domain model based on how the values are used (similar to how you would organize any OO model), and then persist those entities. For your example, you would have a Window object with width , height , and showall attributes, which you then persist to the database as a single row/object. This way you could have the following (hypothetical situation): id | layoutType | width | height | images ----------------------------------------------- 0 | widescreen | 1000 | 500 | true 1 | normal | 600 | 500 | true 2 | mobile | 320 | 480 | false
