Hint: The number $n$ of observations actually matters very little in the sense that, when observing $$(X_1,\ldots,X_n)\sim\mathcal N(\theta,1)$$ it is equivalent to observing a single Normal $$\bar{X}_n\sim\mathcal N(\theta,1/n)$$ since the sample average is sufficient . If this is unclear, think factorisation theorem .
