If you're trying to learn time series in R, I would suggest you to use real data and not simulated data. This is so because in time series there many effects due to time, such as seasonality and trend. I would suggest you to take a look at ?ts ?ts.plot ?decompose ?arima If you want to study this simulated data sets, you may find useful grouping your data as time series using male.age1, female.age1, male.age2, female.age2. For example m.age1.series This will create a time series object that you may analyze. Take a look at the following link: http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa2/R_time_series_quick_fix.htm I hope it helps! :)
