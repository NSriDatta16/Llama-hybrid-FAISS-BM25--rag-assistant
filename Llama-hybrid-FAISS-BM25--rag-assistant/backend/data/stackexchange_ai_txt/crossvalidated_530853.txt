it's a trivial algebra. you're chopping the continuous variable into a few chunks, which can be represented by integer numbers. It's a combination of three tricks: a) linear spline (min/max functions), b) scale and shift ( $s$ and $z$ ) and c) discretization (floor function). For instance, if you set $z=-10$ and $s=5$ , then $x\in[50,55)$ would be represented by $x_q=0$ . It's not much different from a standard scaling where for $s$ you use the standard deviation and $z$ is the mean. Here, $q_{min},q_{max}$ are simply the bounds of a discretized variable $x_q$ The trick with min and max functions is quite popular when you want to collar the variable between min and max value. It creates S-letter like shape of the resulting variable. It's used in linear splines in data science. For instance, when you want to have changing slopes in different sections of the regressors.
