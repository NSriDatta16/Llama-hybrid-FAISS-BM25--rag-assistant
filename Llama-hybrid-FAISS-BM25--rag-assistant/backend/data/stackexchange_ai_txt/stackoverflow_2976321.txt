It sounds like option A is immutable and therefore you cannot change it. ("Closed") Application M should be a windows service, as Lars describes. But, do not ever use the file system watcher unless you like to rip out code later and replace it with a polling mechanisim. Your best bet is to start one thread to poll application A, and another to poll the filesystem. There is nothing wrong with polling. Use a Thread.Sleep(10), and you will be fine. FileSystemWatcher will often give you a file that has been 'changed', but that has not completed writing. This results in you getting a truncated file. Don't bother with MSMQ, unless you absolutely need to. It's just another piece to maintain, and cant handle complex retrieval operations..
