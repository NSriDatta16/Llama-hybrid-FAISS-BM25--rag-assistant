NotifyIcon Events not firing

I'm new here and have a really mysterious problem to start off. I'm a software developer in the UK and have over 15 years of experience but have only been developing in .Net for 18 months. My NotifyIcon mouse events are not firing! I am using C# to write an application that starts as a NotifyIcon ('main app icon') and displays a ContextMenu on mouse right-click. This works fine: ContextMenu, forms launching and mouse click events firing. A tiny bit of background: the application is supposed to sense the insertion of a usb 'device' (it does), interrogate it and create another NotifyIcon ('device icon') to allow the user to interact with that device. The 'main app icon', mentioned in my previous paragraph, allows the user to interact with the database and to configure the software. To encapsulate these device interaction functions, I have constructed a 'device class' that contains the device NotifyIcon, ContextMenu, forms, mouse click events etc which allow interaction with the device. The Problem The problem starts when I instantiate my 'device class' from the ManagementEventWatcher EventArrived event. If I instantiate the 'device class' in my program Main then the events fire correctly when I click the notifyicon. So, please, can someone help me? Cheers, in advance Matthew
