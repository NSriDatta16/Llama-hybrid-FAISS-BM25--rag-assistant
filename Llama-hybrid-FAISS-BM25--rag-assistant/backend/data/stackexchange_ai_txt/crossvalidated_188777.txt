For each x, I observe A and know P(C). What can I say about E(A|C)?

For each subject x in a population, I observe x 's age, A(x) . I can calculate the probability that x has some property of interest c , $P[C(x) = 1]$, where C(x) is a binary variable indicating whether x has the property of interest (the measurement for c is quite noisy, which is why I know only the probability that x has this property, and do not know C(x) exactly. I can assume that the measurement error is independent of A ). I know the marginal distributions of age and c across the full population. Can I calculate the expected age of those who have c across the full population, $E[A|C]$? Update: I might have figured out a solution to this, though I would love a second opinion as to whether this works. By definition of expectation, $E[A|C] = \sum_kA_k*P(A_k|C)$, where the summation is over all observed ages. By Bayes rule, this equals $\sum_kA_k\frac{P(C|A_k)P(A_k)}{P(C)} = \frac{1}{P(C)}\sum_kA_k*P(C|A_k)*P(A_k)$ I can estimate the value of $P(C|A_k)$ for each $k$ by simply averaging the values of $P(C(x))$ across all subjects whose age equals $A_k$. I can substitute these $P(C|A_k)$ into 2 to find $E[A|C]$.
