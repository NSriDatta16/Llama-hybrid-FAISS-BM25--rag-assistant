Dimensionality reduction (we also term it "variable selection", "feature engineering", etc.) is a technique to reduce the number of explanatory variables in a statistical model, e.g., regression. It will reduce the number of column variables, not the number of rows. If there are too many rows and it has heavy computational burden, then we can sample the rows using a smart strategy, such as stratified sampling.
