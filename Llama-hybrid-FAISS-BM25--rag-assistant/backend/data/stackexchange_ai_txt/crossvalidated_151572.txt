average behavior of different data sets

I have $n=100$ different data sets, each of which are distributed as what it seems to be a power-law distribution with different exponents, i.e. $x^{-\gamma_{i}}$ for distribution $i$. What I am interested in is the average distribution of all of these data sets. The first solution that came to my mind is to find the power-law exponent for each of these distributions and find the average value for them. I would also like to have a distribution that would resemble as the average of these n distributions. In short I want to have a distribution that mimics the average of all these distributions and also find its exponent. (if it turned out to be power-law if not whatever the function is.) Apologies if this is a trivial question, I did not even know where to look for an answer or hint. I would really appreciate any help. Thanks.
