If it is for a repository, you may want to look at Visual SourceSafe and get the Access VSS addin (the link is for Access 2003, have not tried other versions) http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2ea45ff4-a916-48c5-8f84-44b91fa774bc&displaylang=en I am guessing that Access addin will expose a COM interface that you could extract the source reasonably cleanly into your C# app if you wanted to go that route. In either case, as Robert noted, Office is still required.
