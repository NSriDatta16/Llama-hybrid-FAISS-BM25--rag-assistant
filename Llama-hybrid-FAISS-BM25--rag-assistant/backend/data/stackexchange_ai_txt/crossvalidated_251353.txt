" It reminds me of this famous beta distribution answer. Is it possible to use a beta distribution approach to the viewing just as a batting average? " Definitely. Think of each of your categories as a batting average. Alpha + Beta should be the same for each category representing the total number of films viewed, alpha the number of films watch in that category. You should set alpha initially to reflect the average profile as a proportion of your chosen Alpha + Beta. You'll calculate a weighted score for each category which will only shift slightly as a film is watched that fits the category. The trick here is to choose what an appropriate "head start" is. If you set the denominator (Alpha+Beta) too high your model won't be sensitive enough, too low and you'll have an oversensitive model again. Hopefully you have a distribution like this of existing scores showing which film have been viewed by your entire population # sad happy angry surprised disgusted TotalViews # A Word 1 0 0 0 0 23 # Backstrom 0 1 0 0 1 30 # Good Witch Hallmark 0 0 0 0 0 10 # Shark Tank 0 0 1 1 0 55 # Above the Rim 0 0 1 0 0 65 # O'Reilly Factor 0 0 0 0 0 20 # Jack the Giant Slayer 0 1 1 1 0 12 # Late Night Snack 0 0 1 0 1 35 # Outlander 0 0 1 0 0 84 By multiplying total views by the flag you can get the population score for each category. So in the above example happy would get a score of 42 out of 334 (beta would be 334-42=292), angry a score of 251 out of 334 . These scores can be scaled so your prior isn't too large for example divide by 10. You then have your alpha and beta for each category.
