Converting to lowercase while creating dataset for NER using spacy

I am trying to make a custom entity model for an NER application using spacy. In several NLP projects, I have converted all the data to lowercase and applied several ML techniques. For NER also should I have to convert the data to lowercase. Or why it is necessary to convert to lower case. Is it a mandate one which will affect the accuracy of the model adversely if not converted to lowercase.
