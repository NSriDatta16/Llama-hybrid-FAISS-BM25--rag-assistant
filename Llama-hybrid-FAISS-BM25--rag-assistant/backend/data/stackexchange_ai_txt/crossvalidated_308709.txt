Stock returns is not the good place to start with learning PCA, because it will not produce you interpretable factors. If your objective is to understan PCA then it's better to start with interest rates, yield curves. There you often get first three factors roughly corresponding to the level, slope and the curvature of the yield curves. With the stock returns, maybe the first factor could be mapped to the market factors, i.e. similar to CAPM. Otherwise, you'll get a bunch of PCs that are hard to assign to any intuitive or usual risks.
