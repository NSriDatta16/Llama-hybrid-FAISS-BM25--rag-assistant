I think if you show that the difference of the peaks alone are different in a statistically significant way, then the distributions are different because of a systematic difference. But I have no proof for this, I'd like to be corrected by the Gurus please . I'd suggest to list all the peak values for each step. Probably exclude the outliers. Then represent each line (red, blue) by their average peak distance. Then measure the absolute difference between those means --- I suggest this absolute difference of the means to be your test statistic. Then identify the distribution of such test statistic under the null hypothesis in order to calculate the $p$ value. To do this, I suggest you to simulate it using approximate randomization .
