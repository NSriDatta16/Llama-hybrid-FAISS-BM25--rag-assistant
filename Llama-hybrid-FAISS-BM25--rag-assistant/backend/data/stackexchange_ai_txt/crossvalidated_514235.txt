Most likely, seasonality is present at the lower levels. It's just that the signal to noise ratio is much lower at these levels. Aggregation improves this ratio to the point where seasonality becomes detectable. A corollary: even if seasonality is present at lower levels, you may get better forecasts with non-seasonal models. These will be biased, but have lower variance, which is the bias-variance tradeoff. As a matter of fact, I wrote a little paper that used exactly this phenomenon to illustrate why a simpler wrong model can yield better forecasts than a more complex correct one. Specifically, I simulated a lot of seasonal time series with sufficiently high levels of noise that fitting seasonality yielded worse forecasts - but the seasonality was blatantly obvious on aggregate levels. Take a look at Kolassa (2016, Foresight ) if you are interested.
