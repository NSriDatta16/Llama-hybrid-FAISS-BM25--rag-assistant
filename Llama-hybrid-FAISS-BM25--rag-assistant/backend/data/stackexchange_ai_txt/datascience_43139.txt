Example of a problem with structured output labels

I'm studying SSVM (Structured SVMs). On my book is stated that Structured SVM is an extension of the SVM, in which Each sample is assigned to a structured output label z âˆˆ K, e.g. partitions, trees, lists, etc. It's not clear to me what a structured output label is. Could you provide me with an explanation of this term along with some tangible examples?
