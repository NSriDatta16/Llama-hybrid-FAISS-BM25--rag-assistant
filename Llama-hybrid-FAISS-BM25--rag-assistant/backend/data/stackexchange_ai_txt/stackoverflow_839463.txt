Not enough information to provide an answer, but that error means that something is wrong in your ACL trees, ARO or ACO, or you're sending the wrong parameter to allow(). Try using the acl console to find out whether your ARO/ACO trees are organized properly, as described in the tutorial. If they are not, truncate your ACL tables and start inserting from scratch. But very carefully this time! :-P
