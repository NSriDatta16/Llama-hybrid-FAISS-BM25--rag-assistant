This is an open question in Mathematics with direct application to chemistry and physics in using it to model polymer bonds. Some of the earliest work done on this was done during the Manhattan project (nuclear bomb WWII.) It is better known as the Self Avoiding Walk problem. I spent a summer at my university mathematics department researching a monte-carlo algorithm called the pivot algorithm to approximate the parameters of the asymptotic fit of the number of Self-Avoiding Walks of a given length n . Please refer to Gordon Slade's excellent book titled " The Self Avoiding Walk " for extensive coverage of the types of techniques used to approach this problem thus far. This is a very complex problem and I wonder what your motivation may be for considering it. Perhaps you can find a simpler model for what you want, because Self Avoiding Walks are not simple at all.
