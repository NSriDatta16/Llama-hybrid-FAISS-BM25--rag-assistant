I have the answer to half of your problem... If you look at the Draggable docs , you'll see that start, drag and stop events are triggered. $('.element').draggable({ axis: 'y', containment:'parent', stop: function(event,ui) { console.log(ui); } }); If you use the stop event as above, inside that callback function you can access ui.offset to get the mouse coordinates where the drag ended. From there, I don't know how you could figure out which element those coordinates are 'on top of', though.
