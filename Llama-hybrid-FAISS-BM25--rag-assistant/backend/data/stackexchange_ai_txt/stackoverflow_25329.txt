During an internship w/ a large company that had a lot of in house IT, I was paired w/ a mentor. The practice definitely aided my career development, both in terms of technical skills and business skills. Here are some of the reasons the mentoring worked out so well: Credible : The mentor had 8+ years of experience and an accomplished background to draw upon in leading and training. He'd been through different challenges, worked in different environments, so he had a great perspective. Genuine : The mentorship was encouraged by the supervisor, but not so formal as to make it an exercise in going through the motions. The mentor wanted to mentor, and I wanted someone to learn from. Passion : The mentor loved the field he was in, the problems he was solving, and the technologies he was using. When I came under his wing, I found this to be infectious. Sharp and Articulate : The mentor approached issues critically and framed them concisely. There wasn't a lot of fuzziness in our discussions; we got to the root of the matter and he directed me on wise courses of problem solving and action. Meaningful : The work I was doing w/ the mentor was meaningful work, not just an exercise to keep busy or ramp up in a skill set. By jointly working on a task that tangibly aided the organization, that helped focus my interest and legitimize the mentoring process.
