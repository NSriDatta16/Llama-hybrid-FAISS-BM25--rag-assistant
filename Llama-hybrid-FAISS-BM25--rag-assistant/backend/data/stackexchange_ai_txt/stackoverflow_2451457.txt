My advice would be to read this one: http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition to get a pretty much complete understanding of how rails works on the outside, if you haven't already. And then checkout the latest trunk and start reading a component you like, messing with files as you please and trying out the changes on a live project. Metaprogramming is a concept used a lot in Rails, so this book would definitely be good too: http://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr/metaprogramming-ruby . Hope that'll put you on your way
