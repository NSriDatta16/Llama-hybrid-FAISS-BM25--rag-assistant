Eager loading child collection with NHibernate

I want to load root entities and eager load all it's child collection and aggregate members. Have been trying to use the SetFetchMode in FluentNHibernate, but I am getting duplicates in one of the child collection since I have a depth of 3 levels. DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer unfortunately only removes the root duplications. return Session.CreateInvoiceBaseCriteria(query, archived) .AddOrder(new Order(query.Order, query.OrderType == OrderType.ASC)) .SetFetchMode("States", FetchMode.Eager) .SetFetchMode("Attestations", FetchMode.Eager) .SetFetchMode("AttestationRequests", FetchMode.Eager) .SetFetchMode("AttestationRequests.Reminders", FetchMode.Eager) .SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) .List (); Could I use multi queries or something similar to archive this? Furthermore, wouldn't this approach result in unnecessarily huge result sets from the database? Any suggestions?
