Setting PyMC model with two different time series data

I've been working with PyMC for a bit, and am stuck on this one. I see example on fitting time series, in the tutorial and others like: http://lighthouseinthesky.blogspot.com/2011/10/curve-fitting-part-5-pymc.html and http://healthyalgorithms.com/2010/10/19/mcmc-in-python-how-to-stick-a-statistical-model-on-a-system-dynamics-model-in-pymc/ However, in each case, we either have a single variable, or data for two or more variables for the same time points (so the vectors are all of the same length). What happens if my data is like: t=[1,2,3] x=[.5,.8,.2] and t=[1.5,2.5] y=[.1,.5] with some simple model, like x=a*t+b y=c*t+d the model isn't important. the point is that the "observed" data have different time points. I haven't been able to find any example like this, without perfectly aligned data. Are there any? Is there a simple example that someone could point out? thanks! Brian Blais
