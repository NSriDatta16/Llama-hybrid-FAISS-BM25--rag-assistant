The efficiency will certainly not be worse in your case, if not better. But if you're looking to be succinct , try lambdas with LINQ: lines.Aggregate((a, b) => Math.Max(a.Length, b.Length)); Btw, minor point: you can technically stop reading if the amount of data left is less than the longest line you've found. So you can technically save some steps, although it's probably not worth the code. Completely irrelevant, but just because I feel like it, here's the (elegant!) Scheme version: (reduce max (map length lines))
