are there any tutorials to help a proficient c++ programmer learn c?

I became a professional programmer in the era of object oriented code, and have years of experience programming in C++. I often work on large projects that have years of legacy code in a mix of c++ and c. I feel less comfortable working on pure c parts of systems. From programming in C++ I understand all the c syntax, but there's a hole in my knowledge about how to organise a complex c program without objects, and what constitutes best practise for managing memory that I would like to fill. I learnt c++ after working as a java programmer, and think a bit more c would make me a better c++ programmer, and a bit less of a java translated into c++ programmer
