How does .NET 4.0's design by contract compare to Eiffel?

I had the "pleasure" to be taught Eiffel at college by none other than Bertrand Meyer himself and just read that .NET 4.0 will include design by contract. Can anyone with some insight elaborate on how powerful this will be compared to Eiffel's existing feature set? Will contracts for interfaces be supported?
