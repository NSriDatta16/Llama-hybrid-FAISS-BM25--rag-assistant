heteroskedasticity of surrogate residuals for ordinal logisitic regression

I am fitting a ordinal logistic regression. The real model is multivariate, but I am using a bivariate version for simplicity in this question. Most references I have seen do not list homoskedasticity as a model assumption for ordinal regression. However, according to the paper Residuals and Diagnostics for Ordinal Regression Models: A Surrogate Approach , heteroskedastic (surrogate) residuals suggest model misspecification. My model is clearly heteroskedastic: What I would like to know is: Does this heteroskedasticity suggest model misspecification? What does this heteroskedasticity say about my data and what transformation if any might resolve it?
