I can't find a definitive answer, but the best guess I can come up with is that it is a concatenation of the individual vectors. This line in a Keras model is what prompted this guess: model.add(Merge([sentrnn, qrnn], mode='concat')). I've seen similar formatting here and there in other papers, sometimes like this: sigma([vec1,vect2], vec3). This would work for the equations above where the inner W(1) dimension equals the sum of the dimensions of the concatenated vectors.
