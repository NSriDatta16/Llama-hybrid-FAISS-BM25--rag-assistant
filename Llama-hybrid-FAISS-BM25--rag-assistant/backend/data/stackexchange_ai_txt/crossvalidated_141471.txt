I don't immediately see how PCA would be useful here, since PCA is more of an approach for characterizing an entire dataset in one go than a way of characterizing all the variables in terms of a single specially chosen variable. I think the simplest approach to this problem is to, given the input variable, calculate its correlation ( Kendall's Ï„ is a nice general-purpose notion of correlation) with every other variable. Sort these correlations by absolute value to make a list of the variables in order of how closely related they are to the input variable. Choose a threshold absolute correlation, or take the n most closely related, and you have a subset of the variables that are more related to the input variable than the other variables are.
