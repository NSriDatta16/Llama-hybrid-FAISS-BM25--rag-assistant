If you use annotations, perhaps the more elegant way to return no view is to declare a void -returning controller method with @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) or @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT) annotations. If you use Controller class, you can simply return null from handleRequest . To post a from to the controller via AJAX call you can use the appropriate features of your client-side Javascript library (if you have one), for example, post() and serialize() in jQuery.
