caveat untested code from the top of my head. But this should work... current = object for t in target current = (current[t] ?= {}) Or a more javascripty version: target.reduce ((o,t)-> o[t]?={}), object The first one is more legible, the second more elegant imho (and does not pollute the scope with current ).
