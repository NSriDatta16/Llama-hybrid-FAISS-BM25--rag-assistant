When using Bash, the first of ~/.bash_profile , ~/.bash_login and ~/.profile will be run for an interactive login shell. I believe ~/.profile is generally run by Unix shells besides Bash. Bash will run ~/.bashrc for a non-login interactive shell. I typically put everything I want to always set in .bashrc and then run it from .bash_profile , where I also set up a few things that should run only when I'm logging in, such as setting up ssh-agent or running screen .
