Check Student entity pid property in EDM: storegeneratedPatteren = None. Quite confused. Still has to do with the identity specification (is identity, identity increment, identity seed) for the table you are adding to, or the table column a relationship was mapped to. The error 'A dependent property in a ReferentialConstraint is mapped to a store-generated column' shows if: You pass a new object to addObject() with a field for which a value was set that should be generated by the database. Solution: Do not pass a value for fields that have an autoincrement id in the database. You accidentally mapped the primary key of a table to a wrong foreign column in your database. Solution: Review the foreign key relationship. The second case is less obvious, but it happens often if you quickly drag and drop constraints in a diagram.
