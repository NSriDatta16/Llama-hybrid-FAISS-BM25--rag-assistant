As @Vladimir and @Chirag just said, you don't have to use setContentView() twice, and in your case, you already have set you activity's layout to main.xml On the other note, I don't think you provide a reference to a TextView to the setContentView() method (as you've done in the last line of your java code), it is meant to be taking an id of a xml layout file only.
