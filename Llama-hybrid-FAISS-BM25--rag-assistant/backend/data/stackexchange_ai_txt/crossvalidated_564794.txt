It looks like you have $x_1$ and $x_3$ being I(1) and $x_2$ being I(2). This is what I would do. Take the first difference of $x_2$ to make it I(1) and call that $y$ : $y:=\Delta x_2$ . Inspect whether $(x_1,y,x_3)$ are cointegrated. If they are cointegrated, use a VEC model for them. Select the lag order as you would if $(x_1,y,x_3)$ were raw data. If they are not cointegrated, inspect whether any pair is cointegrated. ___ If no pairs are cointegrated, use a VAR on $(\Delta x_1,\Delta y,\Delta x_3)$ . ___ If one pair is cointegrated, without loss of generality say it is $(x_1,x_3)$ . Use a restricted VEC for $(x_1,y,x_3)$ where $y$ is absent from the cointegrating relationship. For details, see "VAR or VECM for a mix of stationary and nonstationary variables?" . ___ If two pairs are cointegrated, then the triple must be cointegrated, which contradicts the previous step. Instead of 2. and 3. you could also just use a VAR on $(x_1,y,x_3)$ , as this turns out to be a rather good option regardless of cointegration, according to Ashley & Verbrugge "To difference or not to difference: a Monte Carlo investigation of inference in vector autoregression models" (2009). What I would not do is difference each series twice and try to fit a VECM. First, two of the series will be overdifferenced and as such will contain unit-root moving average components. Second, VECM will not be appropriate as there can be no cointegration between variables that, after the differencing, are at most I(0).
