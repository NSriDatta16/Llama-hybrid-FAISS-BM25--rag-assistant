FYI, this is for a Magento site. In .htaccess, after #RewriteBase /magento/ After it I placed on their own lines: RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.website\.com$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.website.com/$1 [L,R=301] And it works. Dad with kids also had it right, just don't know what the second line was for.
