Linq2sql naming convention

I have just started using Linq2sql, it generates all of the Classes after my tables which is awesome. my problem is that i have a lot of objects that have the same name as my tables. this is forcing my to fully namespace everything which i donâ€™t really like as i think it makes my code look messy. Has anyone found an elegant way to get around this? ps: i know about namespace aliases and im not really a fan.
