I think what you want is this: #pragma unmanaged #include #pragma managed // managed code wrapping unmanaged opencv functions A C++/CLI project can contain both managed and unmanaged parts, and the compiler takes care of marshalling data between the 2 for you. The managed entry points will be callable from normal .NET apps (like C# and the rest) and will use garbage collection, and they'll call unmanaged functions to do the heavy lifting.
