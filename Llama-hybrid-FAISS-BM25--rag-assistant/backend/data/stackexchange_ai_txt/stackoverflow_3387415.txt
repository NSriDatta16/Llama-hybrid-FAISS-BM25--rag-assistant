People Picker AllowEmpty Property

I am using the people picker user control of SharePoint in my aspx page. I have set the AllowEmpty property of people picker control as false. But, still the required field validation is not occurring for the control. I don't want to use a required field validation control explicitly for validating this. Any insights? Regards, Raghuraman.V
