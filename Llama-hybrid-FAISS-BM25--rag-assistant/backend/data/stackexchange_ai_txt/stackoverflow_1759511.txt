Assuming the duplicates are adjacent you can use a generator like this. I guess you already have some code to average the pings def average_pings(ping1, ping2): pass def merge_pings(seq): prev_key=prev_key=None for item in seq: key = item.split()[:2] if key == prev_key: yield average_pings(prev_item, item) else: yield item prev_key=key prev_item=item
