First of all, I'd like to note, that it is best to avoid patching against specific web-browsers, unless as a last result -try to achieve cross-browser compatibility instead using standard-compliant HTML/CSS/JS (yes, javascript does have a common denominator subset, which works across all major browsers). With that said, the user-agent tag from the HTTP request header contains the client's (claimed) browser. Although this has become a real mess due to people working against specific browser, and not the specification, so determining the real browser can be a little tricky. Match against this: contains browser Firefox -> Firefox MSIE -> Internet Explorer Opera -> Opera (one of the few browsers, which don't pretend to be Mozilla :) ) Most of the agents containing the words "bot", or "crawler" are usually bots (so you can omit it from logs / etc)
