Are there any reasons to use SGML instead of XML?

As I understand it, XML is a subset of SGML conceived to simplify it and encourage a more widespread usage. I guess most useful features was brought into XML, but are there any features in SGML powerful enough to motivate using it instead of XML (and accepting the overhead in complexity)?
