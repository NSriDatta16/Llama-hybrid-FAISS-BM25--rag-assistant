How big is the file system? We have 10gb allocated to builds and zap snapshots older than 30 days every night. That seems to work Are you doing builds every X hours or when code changes? Switching to code changes will reduce the number of artifacts without reducing coverage. Are you installing all snapshots locally? You don't need to do this in all cases. In most cases, just those snapshots that are actively developed dependancies need to be installed locally. Are you installing EAR/WAR files locally? You probably don't need them either. How many workspaces are you keeping? We use hudson and keep only the last 5 builds.
