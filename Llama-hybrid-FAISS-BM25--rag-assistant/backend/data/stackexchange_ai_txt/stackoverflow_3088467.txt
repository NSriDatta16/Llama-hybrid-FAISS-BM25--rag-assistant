Get relative path in Javascript

I've got this app where I'm using an IHttpHandler to serve JSON data to my JavaScript method. var theUrl = location.href; var txtCity = '# '; var hidCity = '# '; var theSource = ' ?PID= '; This works fine on my "localhost" webserver, but I've also got a staging server for my clients to use. http://staging.infinitas.ws/ClientSite/ The problem that I'm having is that when the app is hosted on the staging server, the theSource is mapped incorrectly (contains /ClientSite/). I could do something like a String.Replace but I'm looking for a more elegant way of achieving this.
