MotionEvent: ACTION_UP: A pressed gesture has finished, the motion contains the final release location as well as any intermediate points since the last down or move event. ACTION_CANCEL: The current gesture has been aborted. ACTION_CANCEL occurs when the parent takes possession of the motion, for example when the user has dragged enough across a list view that it will start scrolling instead of letting you press the buttons inside of it. You can find out more about it at the viewgroup documentation: onInterceptTouchEvent . so use ACTION_CANCEL when the action is dragged out of the parent, and ACTION_UP otherwise.
