No, you're not using preg_replace properly. There's a lot of misunderstanding in your code; to correct it would mean I'd have to explain the basics of how Regex works. I really recommend reading a few primers on the subject. There's a good one here: http://www.regular-expressions.info/ In fact, what you're trying to do here with the str_replace and the preg_replace together would be better achieved using a single preg_match . Something like this would do the trick: $matches = preg_match('/Size: (\d+)/',$storage); $storage = $matches[1]; The (\d+) picks up any number of digits and puts them into an element in the $matches array. Putting Size: in front of that forces it to only recognise the digits that are immediately after Size: in your input string. If your input string is consistently formatted in the way you described, you could also do it without using any preg_ functions at all; just explode() on a space character and pick up the second element. No regex required.
