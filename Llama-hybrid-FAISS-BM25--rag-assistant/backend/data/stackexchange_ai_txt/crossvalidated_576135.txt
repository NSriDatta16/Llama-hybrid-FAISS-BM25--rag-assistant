Can Bayesian credible intervals adjust for multiple testing?

I am doing some bayesian regression and need to compute credible intervals for pairwise comparisons. I am wondering if the techniques for multiple testing (e.g. Bonferroni/Tukey HSD) are still appropriate in the Bayesian framework? Thanks in advance!
