How are the p-values of the GLM in R calculated?

I have been running some binomial logistic regressions in R on a data set and I realised that the p-values of the estimated coefficients are not computed based upon a Normal distribution. For e.g. I have the following result from the glm() function: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.6127 0.1124 -14.347 I previously thought that the beta hats (estimated coefficients) are asymptotically normal and the p-value should be calculated using the normal distribution. But it seems from the p-values here that a t-distribution is used to compute them (I think). I know that the asymptotic condition does not hold when sample size is small but if so, what is the process that causes the estimator to be distributed with a Students distribution? And how do I find out the degrees of freedom for such a distribution?
