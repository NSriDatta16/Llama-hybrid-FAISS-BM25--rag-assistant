Zend Cache supports different backend storage devices including memcache, file storage, APC, etc. Each one has its own implementation - as you can see in the Zend library - and apparently the memcache implementation doesn't support automatic cleaning. You can see the code here: Zend\Cache\Backend\Memcached.php
