Question is, would there be any lookups based on these values or not? Is there going to be updates for specific values at database level or not... Serilaized data or json is going to be faster and more efficient(storage wise) if all you do is pull the entire string and have no requirements to query or modify it. Based on how you scale though, you may want to keep a key/value structure along with a flat data representation for lookup purpose. Also consider using apache AB for some benchmarking and getting ideas on how your changes effect your concurrent output. Good luck :)
