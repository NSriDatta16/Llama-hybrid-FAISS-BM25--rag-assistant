Machine learning algorithms for tabular dataset

I have a dataset with 120 features and 5000 instances. The dataset is combination of categorical and numerical values. It is a tabular dataset. My problem is a binary classification problem. I trained my dataset with all classic classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Bayesian net, SVM, MLP, Random forest, Logistic regression etc. I would like to know is there any algorithms available in the machine learning field which is new and not the classic one and can be implemented using a tabular dataset. I heard about Convolution neural network, deep neural network etc but I believe they are used in image data not tabular data.
