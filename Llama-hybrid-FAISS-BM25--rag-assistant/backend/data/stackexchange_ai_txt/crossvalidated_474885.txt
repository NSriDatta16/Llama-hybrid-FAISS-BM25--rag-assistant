I have brain wave data for different subects aka voltages recorded every X sec. How do I deal with different wave frequency between subjects?

Brain wave data is really just voltages recorded every certain number of seconds; this becomes a wave with a certain frequency. I want to use the voltages recorded every, say, 10s in a model; this is essentially time series or sequential data. Problem is every patients' brain waves are recorded in a different frequency. This means that the voltage values in the 10s windows are "stretched" or "squished" depending on the frequency. I need to handle this between/within group variation. I'm new to dealing with wave type data so not sure if this is obvious question.
