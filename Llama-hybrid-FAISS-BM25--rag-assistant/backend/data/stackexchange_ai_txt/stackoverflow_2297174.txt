Java IDE Plugin or external tool (ant, maven, standalone) that convert bbcode to javadoc?

I want to format some part of my javadocs with a simpler syntax than the basic html we have to use (for things like bold and italic, also for paragraph and code). Is anybody knows a tool that let me use a kind of bbcode syntax in my source and will transform those bbcode comments into valid javadoc comments ? It could be an IDE plugin, a pre-compile ant task or even a stand alone app.
