In Object Oriented Software Construction 2 Bertrand Meyer calls this the "Uniform Access Principle" and the general idea is that when a property goes from a simple one (i.e. just an integer) to a derived one (a function call), the people using it shouldn't have to know. You don't want everyone using your code to have to change from int x = foo.y; to int x = foo.y(); That breaks encapsulation because you haven't changed your "interface" just your "implementation".
