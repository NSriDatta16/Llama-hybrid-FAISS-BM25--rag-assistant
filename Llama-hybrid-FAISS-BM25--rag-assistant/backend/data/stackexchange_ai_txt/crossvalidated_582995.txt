An offset is used when the nature of the study requires a slope of 1 to account for some extensive property of the data. That's true in your case for log(transect_length) , but it's not true for count of litter items . Think about why you used average house size instead of total size of houses as a predictor. Similarly, you should use some form of average litter item count as a predictor once you've dealt appropriately with transect_length . You are correct that the offset term won't do that for you.
