Measuring correlation of point processes

There is a huge literature on time series analysis. My data does not seem to fit into the standard model in that it consists of event times, that is the times at which an event occurs. What is a good way to measure the correlation between two sequences of event times? Is there any literature on analyzing event time sequences? The data might be the times at which a particular neuron fires, for example. So in this case I would like to say that the firing times of two different neurons are highly correlated ( or not). I found this question looks related Analysis of cross correlation between point-processes .
