It sounds like you are not using Interface Builder to design your UI. Since this is a new project, I would suggest doing that. You should not have to write any code like this at all. You will however need to describe your outlets and actions. The two most important things you need to know when dealing with IB are the IBOutlet and IBAction keywords. Sample class header: @interface MyClass : NSObject { IBOutlet UIScrollView* myScrollView; } - (IBAction) doWork; @end Now you can wire these two things up using Interface Builder by dragging sources to destinations with your mouse. YouTube has lots of tutorial videos on IB if you need a better description of how to do this.
