The reason for the password rules is to try and ensure a "stronger" password, which means, in effect, that it takes more trials on average to find the password with a brute force attack. Most people, even after the many examples, like the recent Twitter mess , will use a Joe password, or a dictionary word that's vulnerable to a feasible brute-force attack. The best thing to do is to ask what the value of the data behind the password is, and then what the cost (effort) of cracking the password would be. If the value is small, you dn't need complicated rules, and maybe you don't need a password at all. If the value is high, then you need to make it more difficult.
