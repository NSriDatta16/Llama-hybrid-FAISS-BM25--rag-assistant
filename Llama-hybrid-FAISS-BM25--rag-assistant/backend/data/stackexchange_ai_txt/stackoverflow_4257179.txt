Why does Perl say Global symbol "SYMBOL" requires explicit package name at PROGRAM.pl line X?

IÂ´m writing my first programs in Perl, and wrote this: use strict; use warnings; $animal = "camel"; print($animal); When I run it, I get these messages from the Windows command-line: Global symbol "animal" requires explicit package name at stringanimal.pl line 3 Global symbol "animal" requires explicit package name at stringanimal.pl line 4 Please, could anyone what these messages mean?
