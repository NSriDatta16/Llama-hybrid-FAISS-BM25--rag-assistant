You get the line with C-k, you make the next command happen ten times with C-u 10, then you paste the line with C-y. Pretty simple. If you always want C-k to do the whole line, you can set kill-whole-line to t. No more fiddling with C-a or C-e. There's a lot you can do with fancy kill rings, registers, and macros, and I encourage you to learn them, but yanking a line ten times doesn't have to be tough or strange.
