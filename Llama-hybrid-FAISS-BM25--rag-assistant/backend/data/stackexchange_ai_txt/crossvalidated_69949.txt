Would rotation of extracted components/factors after PCA/EFA affect results of a subsequent regression analysis?

To use the scores of the extracted components/factors in a further regression analysis, like mixed effects model regression as predictors to an outcome variable or DV. Would be there any discrepancies in the results coming out of the regression analysis when using scores of the following scenarios ( psych package in R): - none non-rotated principal components - varimax orthogonally rotated principal components - promax obliquely rotated principal components - promax obliquely rotated factors using ml (maximum likelihood) extraction - promax obliquely rotated factors using pa (principal axes) extraction? Would it be invalid to use any of the above scores in a further regression analysis? any known issues in this field? or previous similar experiences?
