LINQ, iterators, selecting and projection

What I would like to do is use the elegance of LINQ while maintaining an iterator.... essentially Class A { int Position; string Name; } if I have a list of strings, i want to project them into List but have the Position be populated in the projection... List names; //filled with strings something like List foo = (from s in names select s).ToList(); but have it also iterate over and populate Position.. is this possible? {{Position:0,Name: "name1"},{Position:1, Name: "name2"}, {Position:2, Name: "name3"}....}
