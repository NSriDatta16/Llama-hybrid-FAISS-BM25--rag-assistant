Can't use quick watch wile debugin in if statement Visual Studio

The problem looks like this: I have an if statements in my code. if (tcd.TrescWartosc != null) { var document = new ISDocument(); document.DocContent = tcd.TrescWartosc; int count = 0; int count2 = 0; count = count + 2; } It's just a fragment of the code inside the statement and some variables that I've added to test my errors (count and count2) The problem is that when i debug the project in this one "if" when i check any variable I'm getting 'don't exist in the current context' error. When I comment out the if fragment everything is ok. I've tried with if(true) and the problem remains so what could be the reason for this?? Pin to source also shows nothing...
