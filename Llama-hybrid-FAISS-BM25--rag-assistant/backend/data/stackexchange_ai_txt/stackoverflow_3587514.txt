In response to this comment I made a filter for Color Filter plugin for Compiz. Here's what I got: Howto: Go to /usr/share/compiz/filters/ Create new file "negative-low-contrast" (as root) Insert the attached code into it. Go to System->Preferences->CompizConfig ... Enter Color Filter Plugin Enable it and add newly created filter to the list Profeet!! Filter code: !!ARBfp1.0 TEMP temp, neg; # Dunno what's this... but every other filter starts with this :) ; TEX temp, fragment.texcoord[0], texture[0], RECT; # Applying negative filter ; RCP neg.a, temp.a; MAD temp.rgb, -neg.a, temp, 1.0; MUL temp.rgb, temp.a, temp; MUL temp, fragment.color, temp; # Lowering contrast and shifting brightness ; MUL temp.rgb, temp, 0.8; ADD temp.rgb, temp, 0.25; MOV result.color, temp; END You also can play with the filter. May be you will get something more facinating :) Feel free to share!
