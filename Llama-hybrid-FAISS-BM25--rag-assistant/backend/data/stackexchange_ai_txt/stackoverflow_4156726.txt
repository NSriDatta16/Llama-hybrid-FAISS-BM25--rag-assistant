It seems that it's possible to pin the memory location of the delegate/function, but this obstructs a major advantage of the .NET GC: compacting. Once a GC sweep is done, every object is relocated in memory to be contiguous. This makes both access and allocation faster that it would be if the heap were fragmented. If you have to pin an object in place in the heap, the GC would have to work around it and if it were done multiple times, it could lead to some nontrivial heap fragmentation. (By the way, this is addressed with GCHandle in the article linked by Ron Warholic. I'm not sure if that is available outside managed C++.)
