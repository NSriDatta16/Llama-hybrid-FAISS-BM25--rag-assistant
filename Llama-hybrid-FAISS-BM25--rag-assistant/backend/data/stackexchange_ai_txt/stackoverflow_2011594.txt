Your php functions do not retrieve the data, they print it out immediately. Instead of 'echo' you should use 'return'. The reason it shows the rating double is the fact that both functions echo the average rating, only evaluateRatingText appends some more data. Maybe you'd be better of by starting with some basic php tutorials regarding functions, variables and handling return values before mixing php and javascript.
