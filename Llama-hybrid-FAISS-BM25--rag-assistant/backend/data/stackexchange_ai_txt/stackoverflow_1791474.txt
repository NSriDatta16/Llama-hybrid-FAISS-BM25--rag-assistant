Kanban board plug-in for Trac

Is there any plug-in/app for presenting/managing tickets from Trac bug tracking system on Kanban board? For example, I want to be able to change the status of Trac tickets by dragging-dropping them accross the board. I tried some standalone tools like AgileZen but but I couldn't find a way to integrate them with Trac.
