You didn't say which networking library you are using. Presumably a 3rd party or internal library. I'm going to take a wild guess, but I bet your networking library expects IP addresses and not DNS names? Have you tried programming your app to just connect to "193.182.8.15" instead of "a3.spotify.com"? If that works, do a gethostbyname call to resolve the DNS name to IP address. Here's some other things to try Type this from the command line: ping a3.spotify.com If successful, the result will look something like this: Pinging a3.spotify.com [193.182.8.15] with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 193.182.8.15: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=49 Reply from 193.182.8.15: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=49 Reply from 193.182.8.15: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=49 Reply from 193.182.8.15: bytes=32 time=79ms TTL=49 Ping statistics for 193.182.8.15: Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds: Minimum = 79ms, Maximum = 79ms, Average = 79ms The output of this program tells me two things. That a3.spotify.com correctly resolves to 193.182.8.15. No hosts files hacks necessary. (Maybe on your corporate network you do need this). Since I got valid pings back, that means the host is likely reachable. But some machines are configured not to accept pings, so lack of a ping response it not a definitive answer. What is important to see if ping successfully resolved the hostname. Now type this from the command line to test connectivity to port 80. telnet a3.spotify.com 80 ( don't have telnet? see below ) Does it "connect" (and jump to a blank screen)? (Press CTRL+] to exit, followed by "quit") Do the same telnet, except for port 4070. ping and telnet are quick and dirty ways to test for DNS resolution and IP:port connectivity. These above commands may not work on your corporate network, because your firewall may require all traffic to go through a proxy. Your browser at work is likely configured to work this way either via auto-detect or by admin install. If this is the case, then your app isn't likely to work on the corporate network - unless your networking library can be configured to use a proxy. (Some network libraries auto-detect or read your browser settings). To install Telnet Client Click the Start button , click Control Panel, and then click Programs. Under Programs and Features, click Turn Windows features on or off. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. In the Windows Features dialog box, select the Telnet Client check box. Click OK. The installation might take several minutes.
