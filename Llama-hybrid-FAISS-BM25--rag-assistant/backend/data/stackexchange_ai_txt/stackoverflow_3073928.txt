I think there is a small chance you can actually recover source, but not from the binary itself: If you are really, really desperate, you can use a search application (e.g. Agent Ransack) and search your entire drive for string patterns that you know exist in the source code. In particular, search in your pagefile (pagefile.sys) if you have one - there might be some chance it's buried there somewhere. I have tried this method once when I was really really desperate, but my situation then was a bit different and more favourable for "search and recover" because I lost it when somehow the IDE crash and the entire source file is lost (!!!! nasty surprise!!!)
