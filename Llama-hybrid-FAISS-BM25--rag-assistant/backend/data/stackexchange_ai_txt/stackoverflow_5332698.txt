Display notification messages to users at specific intervals (Ruby on Rails)

I am working on an application with basic authentication functionality. When a user registers, I would like to display a javascript lightbox message containing a brief introduction to the application. Additionally, I would like to display notifications when a user logs in after a set time span (1 week, 1 month, etc). I'm not sure flash notifications will suffice as I plan on having slightly complex html in the messages, with forms/links/etc. I can think of a number of hacky ways to accomplish this, but none of them seem elegant and robust. Any ideas?
