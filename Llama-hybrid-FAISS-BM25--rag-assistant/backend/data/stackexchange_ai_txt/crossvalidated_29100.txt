Macro's point is correct the proper way to compare for relationships between time series is by the cross-correlation function (assuming stationarity). Having the same length is not essential. The cross correlation at lag 0 just computes a correlation like doing the Pearson correlation estimate pairing the data at the identical time points. If they do have the same length as you are assuming, you will have exact T pairs where T is the number of time points for each series. Lag 1 cross correlation matches time t from series 1 with time t+1 in series 2. Note that here even though the series are the same length you only have T-2 pair as one point in the first series has no match in the second and one other point in the second series will not have a match from the first. Given these two series you can estimate the cross-correlation at several lags . If any of the cross correlations is statistically significantly different from 0 it will indicate a correlation between the two series.
