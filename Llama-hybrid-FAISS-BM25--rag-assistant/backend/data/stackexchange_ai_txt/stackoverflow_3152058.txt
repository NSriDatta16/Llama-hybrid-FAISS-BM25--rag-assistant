jquery ajax call to JsonResult controller method results in 404 on IIS6

I've been pulling my hair out this morning trying to figure this out. I have a simple jquery json request to a jsonresult action on my controller. When I run this on my local machine (IIS7), it works fine. When I deploy to a dev machine running IIS6, I get a 404 error. script: $(function() { $('#search').click(function() { var zip = $('#zip').val(); $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "/Customer/GetCityStateFromZip", data: { zipcode: zip }, contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType: "json", success: function(msg) { $("#stateList").setCityState(msg); } }); }); }); Controller: public JsonResult GetCityStateFromZip(String zipcode) { List list = new List (); foreach (var item in dt) { list.Add(new CityState(){City = item.City, StateCode = item.StateCode, StateName = item.StateName}); } return this.Json(list); } Request Data: GET /Customer/GetCityStateFromZip?zipcode=85215 HTTP/1.1 Host: mydevserver User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefox/3.6.6 Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */* Accept-Language: en-us,es-mx;q=0.7,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Referer: http://mydevserver/Customer/Entry Response Data: HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found Date: Wed, 30 Jun 2010 18:01:06 GMT Content-Length: 1635 Content-Type: text/html Server: Microsoft-IIS/6.0 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET On my dev server running IIS6, I have set a wildcard mapping (C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll) and have the "Verify that file exists" unchecked. All other aspects of my MVC site work just fine. I'm using jquery all over the place (validation, animation, etc) and that's working fine. I just can't seem to get beyond this ajax issue. Is there some other setting or mapping issue that I need to address on the IIS6 machine? Perhaps IIS6 doesn't know how to route this request?
