logistic regression: the relation between sample proportion and prediction?

Suppose we have an dependent variable of 4 categories. The proportion of each of the four categories in the population is 4/10, 3/10, 2/10, and 1/10. The independent variables that we use are all continuous. I ran a multinomial logistic regression on a sample that reflect the relative porportion in the population. My result is not good and the misclassification rate is high. My colleague thinks that it is because I did not "standardize" or equalize the porportion, so that the first group is overpowering the others, causing bias in the estimation. My colleague's approach is to run three separate logistic regressions, A vs. Not A, B vs. Not B, C vs. Not C, D vs. Not D, and compare the estimated probability and pick the one with the highest probability. He thinks that it is important to "standardize" the good rate (defined as an event happening, so in the first model would be the rate of A, in the second the rate of B, etc) across the training set of the three models so that the probabilities are comparable across the three different model predictions. I have difficulty understand how the probabilities are comparable across. So my questions are Do we need to "standardize" or equalize the proportion for logistic, more specifically, multinomial logistic regression? Can you compare logistic regression model predictions across different logistic regression? Thank you! (Edit to clarify what "standardize" mean here.)
