There is no universally accepted "strength of evidence" scale for Bayes factors. Here is a side-by-side comparison of three proposed scales: Image from Held, Leonhard; Ott, Manuela (2018). On p-Values and Bayes Factors. Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, 5(1):593-419. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-031017-100307 The two more recent scales, by Goodman and Held & Ott, agree the evidence is (at least) strong if the BF is ≥ 30. This would suggest to interpret the BFs reported by the OP (between 10 and 46) more cautiously. That being said, I think that Bayes factors are something of a cop-out if one is interested in doing Bayesian analysis. BFs try to be a compromise between frequentist and Bayesian methods; in a way, to make the Bayesian approach more palatable to those who are used to classical statistics. (The OP suggests as much himself.) It may be more straightforward to plot the posterior distribution of the quantities of interest — here the four linear effects — and calculate relevant posterior probabilities; for example: $\operatorname{Pr}\left\{\beta_{kl} > 0\right\}$ and/or $\operatorname{Pr}\left\{- b where the region $[-b,b]$ designates a region of "practical equivalence" around the null hypothesis of 0. We can think of this as switching from evidence-based framework to estimation-based framework. See also Bayes factor (B) vs p-values: sensitive (H0/H1) vs insensitive data . PS. The specification of the priors and the model needs to be updated to test both one-sided (a > b) and two sided (a = b) hypotheses with newer brms versions. (I have 2.20.4.) prior There a couple of changes: 0 + Intercept turns off centering of the design matrix — the default behavior — so that a prior can be defined on the real intercept directly. Since the intercept is now another population-level parameter, its prior is of class = "b", not class = "Intercept". sample_prior is set to "yes" to draw samples from the priors for the hypothesis testing. save_all_pars is deprecated, so it's commented out.
