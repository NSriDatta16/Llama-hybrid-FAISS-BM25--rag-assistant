dataSet in Web Service

I am using UltraGrid for inserting data in table. The problem is that i need to do insert,update, delete with web service. I am getting dataSet from web service and display it into grid but when I do some changes on the grid for example insert or update data, I need also to send new dataSet to web service so that web service do update data. This is the table ID (PK,int,not null) Name(nvarchar 100,null) This is the code for client side: Public Sub Refresh() Dim p As localhost.Service1 = New localhost.Service1 'bind datatable to UltraGrid UltraGrid1.DataSource = p.GetData() End Sub This is the code for web service for getting data from table: Public Function GetData() As DataSet Dim custDA As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter("SELECT ID,Name FROM Btable", nwindConn) Dim custDS As DataSet = New DataSet() custDA.MissingSchemaAction = MissingSchemaAction.AddWithKey custDA.Fill(custDS, "Btable") GetData= custDS End Function This all working fine but now I want to insert new row to grid and send that to web service and insert it from there. How I can do that? Thanks!
