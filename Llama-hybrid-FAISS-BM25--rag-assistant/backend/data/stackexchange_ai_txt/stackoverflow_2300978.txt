Floating point mantissa bias

Does anybody know how to go out solving this problem? * a = 1.0 × 2^9 * b = −1.0 × 2^9 * c = 1.0 × 2^1 Using the floating-point (the representation uses a 14-bit format, 5 bits for the exponent with a bias of 16, a normalized mantissa of 8 bits, and a single sign bit for the number), perform the following two calculations, paying close attention to the order of operations. * b + (a + c) = ? * (b + a) + c = ?
