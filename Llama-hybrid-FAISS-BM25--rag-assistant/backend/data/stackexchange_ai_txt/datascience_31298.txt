How to quantify the numerical influence of categorical variables?

I have trained a simple neural net, to make predictions based on three inputs. For examples sake lets say I m trying to work out "how many days does it take to complete an accademic study", where the data could be: f1 = institution f2 = student age f3 = study topic and the label is the total number of days to complete. If you imagine the following data structure: f1, f2, f3, label A, D, G, v B, E, H, w C, F, I, x A, E, H, y A, D, G, z Is there anyway that I can work out how long each feature adds to the total number of days to complete, so for example I want to be able to say that if you choose f1 = A that 4 days will be added to the total days to complete the study. I can work out how much difference there is between each choice, eg choosing f1 = A might be 7 days quicker than if you chose f1 = B , but I do not know how to roughly ( maybe average ) identify how long each choice represents.
