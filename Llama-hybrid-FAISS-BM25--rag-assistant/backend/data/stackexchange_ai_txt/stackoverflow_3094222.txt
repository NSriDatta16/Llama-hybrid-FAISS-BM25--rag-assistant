How do I convert an XML RSA key to a PEM file?

I have two XML files, structured as follows: My Key ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... A Public Key ... ... I am using the xmlseclibs library by Robert Richards which requires a .PEM representation of the key in order to encrypt and decrypt things. As an encryption novice, I'm not sure where to begin, and a cursory Google search did not reveal anything particularly obvious... Thanks!
