jQuery is a JavaScript library aimed at eliminating differences between user agents. Ajax (Ansynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique to perform asynchronous requests to the host. jQuery (among many other libraries â€¦ and vanilla JavaScript) supports Ajax (and makes it easier by providing a standardized interface across user agents). So, the real question is: should you use jQuery to perform your Ajax requests? And the answer is: yes, if you're already using jQuery - if not, you can include jQuery or another Ajax-supporting JS library, or you can implement the Ajax functionality in vanilla JS.
