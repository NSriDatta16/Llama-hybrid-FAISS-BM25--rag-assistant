NN for an arbitrary learning

At the near past when I was a student NN concerned as an arbitrary function learner (13 Hilbert problem, Holmogorov stuff like that). But today I am seeing that vanilla Feed Forward NN is no more actual and complicated ones like LSTMs, GRU, CNN etc are come into live. For me this NNs are nothing more than just clever heuristic. But what about NN as arbitrary learners? For example can I take some NN architecture and learn it some data to become, lets say LSTM-like in one experiment and take the same NNs and another data and learn it to become ConvNN?
