Does anyone know if the latent variable approach proposed here would also work for a three-level logistic regression model? Yes, that should work. For clinics (level 2): $$ VPC_{\text{clinic}} = \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{clinic}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{clinic}} + \sigma^2_{\text{authority}} + \frac{\pi^2}{3}} $$ while for local authorities (level 3): $$ VPC_{\text{authority}} = \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{authority}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{clinic}} + \sigma^2_{\text{authority}} + \frac{\pi^2}{3}} $$
