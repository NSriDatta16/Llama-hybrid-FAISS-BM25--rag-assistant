I'll present an example to try to explain the regression to the mean. Let's assume that we have a random variable $X \sim N(0;1)$ that corresponds to the first measurement. And let $Y \sim N(0;1)$ be the random variable corresponding to the second measurement, independent to the first measurement. So, each student will be characterized by a pair of values $(x_j, y_j)$ , with the expectations of the measurements $\mathbb{E}(x_j) = 0$ and $\mathbb{E}(y_j) = 0$ . If we select the students that have a positive grade in their first measurement, i.e, those with $x_j > 0$ (blue circles on the figure), we may be tempted to think that these are the best students. However, if we compute the average of their second grade $y_j$ we should find that it will be close to zero, which is the expected value of the entire set of students. Likewise, the average second grade of the other students (black circles on the figure), that got $x_j \leq 0$ should also be zero. Of course that this is a very extreme case, where the second measurement is independent of the first. What if the second measurement was related with the first measurement in a linear way, e.g, let's assume that the second measurement is $w_j = \alpha x_j + (1-\alpha) y_j$ for some $\alpha \in [0; 1)$ . The case $\alpha = 0$ is the previous case, and if $\alpha$ is close to $1$ , $w_j$ will be close to $x_j$ . If we select the best performing students, i.e., those with a positive initial grade, $x_j$ (again in blue), the expectation of their final grade should be: $$ \mathbb{E}(w_j | x_j > 0) \\ = \mathbb{E}(\alpha x_j + (1-\alpha) y_j | x_j > 0) \\ = \alpha \mathbb{E}(x_j | x_j > 0) + (1 - \alpha) \mathbb{E}(y_j | x_j > 0) \\ = \alpha \mathbb{E}(x_j | x_j > 0) + (1 - \alpha) 0 \\ 0) $$ So, in this example the expectation of the second measurement is closer to zero than the expectation of the first measurement. So, the expectation of the second measurement is closer to the expectation for the entire set of students, that was zero.
