The number of input variables is the number of dimensions. You can reduce this number through feature extraction (i.e. creating new sets using transformations of the original set of variables, which can also augment the number of variables by the way) and/or feature selection (i.e. selecting some variables from the initial problem based on some rules, including collinearity and correlation for example). Some algorithms are more sensitive to high dimensional data than others. SVMs are notedly robust in that aspect .
