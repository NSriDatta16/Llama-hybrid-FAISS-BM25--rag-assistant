Notification Preferences Predicament

I am building a page which allows our members to select their notification preferences based on a number of options. For example sake, I am giving the option for the member to select notifications when a new message arrives and when an update has occured. They can receive the notification via email, sms, both, or neither. If I simply build it out as a number of: HTML code Alert me when a new message comes in: checked="checked" tabindex="15" />Email checked="checked" />SMS checked="checked" tabindex="15" />Both checked="checked" />Don't notify me Alert me when a new update to my site occurs: checked="checked" tabindex="15" />Email checked="checked" /> SMS checked="checked" tabindex="15" />Both checked="checked" />Don't notify me Variable Encoding and Storage I am left to code for 16 possible variables (and thus creating over 100 lines of code). Can anybody think of a better way to consolidate this code? Based on the selections made, I want the result to equal a single digit (i.e. 28 equals, send email and SMS notifications for both new messages and updates). Creating a new table or database and making reference calls is not a solution so please do not suggest that. Thank you!
