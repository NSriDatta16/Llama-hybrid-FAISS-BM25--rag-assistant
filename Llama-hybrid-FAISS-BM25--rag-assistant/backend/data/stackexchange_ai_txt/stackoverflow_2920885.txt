I think that this definition is quite clear. The variable is introduced by declaration and denotes the object. Who introduces the variable? You do of course, and thus it is you who uses it. A variable is really only a convenience for you the developer. It is a fundamental aspect of most programming languages not just C++. A variable mearly gives a symbolic name to a useable entity that occupies storage, such that it can be referenced and used at a future point in your source code. For example if you declare a variable in a method as such: int x = 5; This will be reduced by the compiler to some offset from the stack pointer, say SP + 0x003. At some point later you can say: x = 52; In this case the area of stack memory SP + 0x003 will contain the bytes that describe the number 52. You declare the variable to be of a certain type so that the compiler can work out how much space the data occupies in memory. Without variables, you would have to manage all of the arrangement of information yourself and you would probably be coding in assembly or lower.
