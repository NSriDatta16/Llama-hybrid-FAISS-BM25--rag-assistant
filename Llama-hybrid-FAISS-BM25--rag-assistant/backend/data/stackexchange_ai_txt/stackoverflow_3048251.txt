Depending on how you are doing your session handling the session storage class has two methods, sessionGC (called on garbage collection) and sessionDestroy. You can create your own session class extending what ever one you are using currently, we use Doctrine/PDO. The default is sfSessionStorage. To change what class you use edit factories.yml: all: storage: class: mySuperNewSessionStorageClass
