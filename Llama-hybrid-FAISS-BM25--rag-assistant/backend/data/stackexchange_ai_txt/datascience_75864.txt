According to the tests I have performed GPT2 model is strong enough to end the sentences with meaningful punctuation at the end. Basically its upto the size and quality of data you have used if you fine tuning it. Regarding length, if you are so sure you want you output to be N token long, then that can be be by editing the script's length argument in interact_model function. But fixing your output to certain length will not guarantee to generate a sentence with proper ending as it totally depends on the N-1th term of your output.
