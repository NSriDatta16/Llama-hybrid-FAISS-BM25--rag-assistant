What is global concavity of the (log-)likelihood worth in Bayesian estimation?

In maximum likelihood estimation there is a big emphasis on finding the global maximum, which is why likelihood functions that are provably globally (log-)concave are desirable (despite often being overly simple, like the Gaussian, logistic , Tobit, etc). Bayesian estimation, of course, is for the most part integration rather than optimization (INLA and others aside). But I wondered if a simple but provably concave (or log-concave) likelihood "buys" something extra in the Bayesian setting, say more leeway in the choice of (improper) priors?
