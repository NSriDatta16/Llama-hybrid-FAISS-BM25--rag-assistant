Embedding persistent login form Zend

I've seen this question asked already - but none of the answers really gelled for me, so I'm asking again: I want to embed a persistent login form (which will change into a nav bar if logged in) in the header bar for a site. Effectively, I want to be able to inject some controller logic into the layout. After much research, I can see several ways that might achieve this - none of which seem ideally suited. View Helpers seem suited to adding a suite of methods to the Zend_View object - but I don't want to write conditional code in the layout.phtml to trigger a method. Action helpers would help me remove that functionality and call it from a Controller - but that seems to be in poor favour from several quarters. Then there are plugins, which might be well suited in the dispatch/authentication loop. So, I was hoping someone might be able to offer me some guidance on which way might best suit my requirements. Any help is greatly appreciated.
