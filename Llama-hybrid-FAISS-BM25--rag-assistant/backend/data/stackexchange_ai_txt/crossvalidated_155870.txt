Generating t statistics from p values - binomial test multiple comparisons

I am using the binomial test to generate a series of p values. However, my method of multiple comparisons correction that I wish to apply to this series requires that I also have the corresponding t statistic for each p value. Typically in performing the student's t test, we use a lookup table to go from t statistics to p values. Does this go both ways? It seems like it should, but I am unsure. Thanks! Edit: Another good answer would be to tell me a good way to correct for multiple comparisons in my scenario: i have a time series of p values generated from the binomial test at each point. I want a multiple comparisons correction technique that will select contiguous windows of time. I was going with the cluster permutation test (aka the excursion test), but maybe that's not appropriate?
