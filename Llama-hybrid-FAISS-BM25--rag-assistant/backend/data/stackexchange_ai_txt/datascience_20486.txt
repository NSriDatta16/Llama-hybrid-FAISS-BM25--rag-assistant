I think you might have misunderstood the fixed number of inputs for the RNN. This is the number of inputs per timestep . All your examples have a fixed number of inputs per timestep: 1! You feed them one at a time to your neural network, finishing with a special "end" token (you could always have a second input for this). Teach it to give no output until it sees the end token, and then to output the components of the result one at a time, ending with a special end output token.
