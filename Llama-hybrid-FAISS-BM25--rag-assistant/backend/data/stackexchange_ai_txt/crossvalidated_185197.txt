As the RHS variables are generated by OLS, they are actually "generated regressors". It is perfectly fine to estimate the model by OLS, but you have to adjust standard errors. The classic paper by Pagan addresses this: "Econometric issues in the analysis of regressions with generated regressors." International Economic Review addresses this issue. Bootstrap is the way to go nowadays.
