I have also another take, based on the book by Anderson on model selection. The authors state as follows: It seems best not to associate the words significant or rejected with results under an information-theoretic paradigm. Questions concerning the strength of evidence for the models in the set are best addressed using the evidence ratio as well as an analysis of residuals, adjusted R2 and other model diagnostics or descriptive statistics. From this point of view, using AIC (or BIC for that matter) should not be mixed with parameters for significance. Both criteria are rooted in the information theory, so this is less "Bayesian vs frequentist" and more "frequentist vs information-theoretic". See also this answer .
