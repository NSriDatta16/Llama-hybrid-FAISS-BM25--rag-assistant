What is cloud computing?

Possible Duplicate: What is Cloud computing? I read the Wikipedia article on it and am still confused. I know there is a great deal of hype these days surrounding 'Cloud Computing', but what is it exactly? From a programmer's prespective : If I am creating a web service that process all my business rules and data storage on a web server, is that cloud computing? Are all websites examples of cloud computing? Just becuase I use WCF or Web Services does that automatically make it a cloud application?
