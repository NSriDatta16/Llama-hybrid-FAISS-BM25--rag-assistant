I have same setup & problem on VS2008. I found that if you declare you class with dllexport it will not optimize. class __declspec( dllexport ) Cxxx { . } However this generates a lot of warnings in my case because I must declare all classes used in this class also as dllexport. All optimizations are off (in debug mode), still this is optimized. Also volatile/pragma optimize off. On global variable created of this class (in same cpp file) etc does not work. Just found that dllexport does require at least to include header files of these classes in some other cpp file from exe to work! So only option is to add a file with calls to some static members for each class, and add this file to all projects used these classes.
