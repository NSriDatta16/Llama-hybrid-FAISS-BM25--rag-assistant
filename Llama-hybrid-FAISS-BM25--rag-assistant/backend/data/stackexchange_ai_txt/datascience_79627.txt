What are the true error and the sample error?

I am a student and I am studying machine learning. I am focusing on the concept of evaluation of an hypotesis. What I have seen is that there are two types of error: true error and sample error . The true error of an hypotesis $h$ with respect to a target function $f$ and a distribution $D$ is the probability that an hypotesis $h$ misclassifies an instance $x$ drawn according to $D$ , and it is computed as: $error_D(h)=Pr_{x\in D}[f(x)\neq h(x)]$ while the sample error of an hypotesis $h$ with respect to a target function $f$ and data sample $S$ is the proportion of examples that $h$ misclassifies: $error_S(h)=\frac{1}{n}\sum _{x\in S}\delta (f(x)\neq h(x))$ where $\delta (f(x)\neq h(x))=1$ if $f(x)\neq h(x)$ and $0$ otherwise. I ask this question because I have not clear what these errors are . Moreover, I have seen that the true error cannot be computed , while we can compute only the sample error . I don't understand why. Can somebody please help me understand?
