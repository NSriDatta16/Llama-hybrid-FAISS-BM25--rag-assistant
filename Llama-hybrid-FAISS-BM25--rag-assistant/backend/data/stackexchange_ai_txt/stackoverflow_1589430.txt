Securing .net Assemblies

I want to secure my assembly (dll) by binding it to a specific environment. Say I have a dll (BizLogic.dll), I want to make it available to my co-developers to use it within the organization. But I don't want others to use it outside my organization. Is there any way to address this issue? Thanks in Advance. -- Mohammed.
