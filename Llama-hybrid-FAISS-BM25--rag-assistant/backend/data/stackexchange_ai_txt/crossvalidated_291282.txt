How to model product ratings in Stan

Hi I've been recently introduced to Bayesian Analysis, and Stan. As a practice problem I was hoping to to model what is most likely average rating that a product will receive. By product ratings I mean and integer distribution with values bounded to [1,2,3,4,5]. Initially i thought that product ratings will be best described by multinomial distribution but I see in Stan's documentation that it accepts just one parameter theta which I cannot find information on on the web, wiki for example says that this distribution is described by p and N . So my question is what would be an appropriate distribution to use here? See bellow for my STAN model so far: data { int N; int[N] ratings; } parameters { real mean; } model { ratings ~ multinomial(mean); }
