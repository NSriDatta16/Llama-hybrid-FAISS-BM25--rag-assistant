Detect Typical Customer Mistakes in the Shopping Cart

I would like to ask your advice on solving this problem. Problem There is an online store which sells furniture. There are millions of products on the store like furniture parts and furniture itself. Customers in this store usually do the same issues when purchasing products: accidentally add one/two products in an absolutely different style/color/wood type than the rest of items accidentally duplicate qty of products. Let's say there are products which typically purchase in qty of 1 or 2 We need to be able to find this kind of issues in shopping carts and notify customers why and where they have issues, in our opinion. We can use store lifetime order history, but there are no labeled entities. However, we may assume that some set of orders are correct. My Thoughts It seems like a Neural Network may be a good solution here. We need to analyze different count of items per cart. Count of product items in a cart can be really different: from 1 to 100. It looks like RNN can help here. BTW, is there any alternatives? RNN pays attention to the order of sequence items. I think the position of products in the shopping cart is not really important. Different people may start purchasing their bedrooms from different sides. Is it going to be an issue? Also, a good question is data processing. We have just set of products per shopping cart/order that were added/purchased. Each cart/order item has qty and product. Each product has different features like styles, colors, wood type. Count of possible product is huge. How to convert all this information for NN? From examples I saw, people usually try to feed just a list of numbers to NN. It's hard to understand how can we transform all of cart item features to the plain array. Any thoughts about this? How to formalize this problem? I see it as the anomaly detection on a sequence of data with multiple features. Do you think it's fair? Finally, how to get more information about founded issues then 'this shopping cart is incorrect'? Ideally, we need to be able to say that this chair has a different color than the rest of the items and that wardrobe is not purchased in such qty usually. How would you tackle such a problem? Any advice, suggestions are appreciated
