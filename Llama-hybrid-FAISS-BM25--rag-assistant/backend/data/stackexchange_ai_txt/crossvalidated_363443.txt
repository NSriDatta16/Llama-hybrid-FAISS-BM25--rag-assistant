The question you link to Can multiple logistic regression be performed without a reference/baseline? has answers which clarify that this was about not having a reference category on the left hand side in multinomial logistic regression whereas you want to do it on the right hand side. Standard software will have converted your categorical variable into two indicator variables since you already have an intercept. If you try removing the intercept (in R -1 in your formula) this may give you the result you want. This will depend to some extent on exactly what you mean by leading to response 1 or 0 in your scientific question.
