As RSK says, it appears that your data has seasonality. Looking at the x axis, it looks to me as though you might have daily data, since it appears to have a cycle that's roughly 365 long. When you used ARIMA, it didn't know this. You need to indicate that you're measuring daily values and the natural unit of time is a year. Then it would be able to detect yearly cycles and your prediction line would reflect this. Unfortunately, I was never successful in using daily or weekly data with various ARIMA tools because there is no fixed frequency. You can't say a year is 365 days, because of leap years. You can't say there are 52 weeks in a year (only adds up to 364 days), especially depending on how you measure weeks (is it a seven-day period, or Sunday-Saturday). This appears to be accepted by R, but I'm not sure if it does what I hope it does. And some time series routines give errors and will not accept this kind of time series (daily for years): blah Bottom line to get a forecast, I'd recommend that you try StructTS and stl to see if they work for you.
