"method source containing it" (mentioned by Alexandre Jasmin) will include class comments, strings, selectors, and method source. If the string might be contained in a method protocol name, I think you'd have to check programmatically. Something like: Smalltalk allClasses select: [ :c | c organization categories anySatisfy: [: cat | '*substring*' match: cat ] ].
