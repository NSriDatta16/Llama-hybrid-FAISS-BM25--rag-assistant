In short : It can be any type of tree inside forest :) Random forest is an ensemble of many decision trees.The success of a random forest highly depends on using uncorrelated decision trees. If we use same or very similar trees, overall result will not be much different than the result of a single decision tree. Random forests achieve to have uncorrelated decision trees by bootstrapping and feature randomness. So what type of tree are inside ? This depends on implementation. Generally, any bootstrap-aggregated attribute-bagged learner based on trees (any of them) is called Random Forest. You get different flavors using different trees. For example : Function randomForest() in R uses CART algorithm CART, C4.5 or C5.0 , any of these can be used to grow a forest
