SVM algorithms sometimes have a difficult time of determining a good value of the offset. You should construct an ROC curve (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) from the scores that the SVM algorithm outputs. (Sort the scores and use each as a positive/negative classification threshold.) Then, based on the ROC curve, set the new offset parameter as the score that best balances the precision/recall. Alternatively, you could use one of the SvmPerf (http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_perf.html) options that allows you to directly optimize precision and recall.
