In reality we have simply come full circle in the computing world. The web browser of today is simply the green screen terminal of 30 and 40 years ago. It used to be that you would buy time on a University's computer to run your program and then pay for time it took for your program to process and run. This was inefficient from an end user stand point since it was done in a batch and queue process so your results would have to wait till the next day. From the University's point of view though they had more computing power than they knew what to do with, so farming it out made sense and gave a nice revenue stream. Flash forward a few years and desktops began to be as powerful if not more powerful than the University's computers and the days of batch and queue processing died off. But desktop centric applications suffer from a single fundamental flaw, multi-user needs. If more than one user needs to use the application at the same time, a server is needed in the mix to handle the multi session data needs. The client application is useful for doing things such as data validation, but the thicker the client, the larger the risk you run with different versions of the client populating data at the server wrong. The solution, the "web" client. Using the term web though is actually wrong in my personal opinion. The html/browser based client removes the issues found with multiple versions of a desktop client since all users are using the same version all the time. Gone are the days of deploying an upgrade across thousands of desktops. The browser based client simply needs updating on the server side and all users are instantly getting the new features.
