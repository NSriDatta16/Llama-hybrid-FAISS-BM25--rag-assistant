In your second paragraph you write Because when I attempt to do this I get different answers for $F$ and this is as it should be, you are led by your notation to think the limiting distributions should be the same. They are not. Let us first look at the marginals: $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \P(T_n \le t)=\P(n X_{1:n}\le t)=\P( X_{1:n} \le t/n) =\\ 1-\P(X_{1:n} > t/n)=1-\P(X_1>t/n)^n = 1- (e^{-\frac{t/n}{\theta}})^n=\\ 1-e^{-t/\theta} $$ which does not depend on $n$ at all, so in this case the limit when $n\to\infty$ is very easy to compute! So this scaled minimum has itself an exponential distribution. Then $$ \P(M_n \le m)=\P(X_{n:n} -\theta \log n \le m)=\\ P(X_{n:n} \le m+\theta \log n) =\P( X_1 \le m+\theta \log n)^n =\\ (1-e^{-\frac{m+\theta \log n}{\theta}})^n= (1- \frac1n e^{-m/\theta})^n $$ and we use the known limit: $\lim_{n \to\infty} (1-x/n)^n = e^{-x}$ to find the limit which is $e^{-e^{-m/\theta}}$ , a Gumbel distribution with scale $\theta$ . But we want the joint distribution of this scaled min and max. Rather than the joint cdf, we start with $$ \P( T_n > t, M_n \le m) = \\ \P(X_{1:n} > t/n, X_{n:n} \le m+\theta \log n) = \\ \P(X_1>t/n,X_2>t/n, \dotsc, X_n > t/n, X_1\le m+\theta \log n, \dotsc, X_n \le m+\theta \log n) =\\ \P(t/n and again taking the limit we get $$ e^{-t/\theta} \cdot e^{-e^{-m/\theta}} $$ and since this has the separated product form, asymptotic independence is proved.
