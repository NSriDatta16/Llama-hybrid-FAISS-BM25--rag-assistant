How to remove test set so that model uses all data as training data?

I have developed a RandomForest classification model and I am pretty satisfied with the results on the test set. Now, my next step is to deploy the model. Before deployment, I want to remove the test set, so the model learns on the whole dataset. It is then going to be used to classify new unseen data. How can I do this? I have used test_train_split to split the data into train and test , I have defined the random forest model and I have used it to fit(X_train, y_train) .
