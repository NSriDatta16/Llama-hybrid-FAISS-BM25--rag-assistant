As someone already pointed, if binaries are stored using some sort of XDelta, it won't guarantee "patches" will be smaller than the file itself... Sometimes the patches will be almost as big as the file itself. Try changing a RGB value on a Photoshop picture and run XDelta... the patch will be almost as big as the file itself. But, IMHO, you shouldn't worry about that. Most modern SCMs out there (GIT, Plastic SCM, ...) will zip your files so storage won't be a huge concern... Although I guess we will never buy the sentence "don't worry about disk space since it's cheap now" :-P
