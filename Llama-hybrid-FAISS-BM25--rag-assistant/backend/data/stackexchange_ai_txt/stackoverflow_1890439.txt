One way to do this would be to define a route for the controller action, eg the Route would be defined as "{controller}/{action}/". Then use something similar to the following to build your actual URL: Url.RouteUrl("MyRoute") + "#" + id Not the best method, but it works. Maybe someday Microsoft will add fragment support to routing.
