Well, it is "possible" but perhaps index is not the right approach for this. You can make use of html !--[if IE]> link to your IE script here which also has operators like for IE less than version 7 and so on. Then have something like jquery or plain javascript handle the rest. An example would be to make ie.js and have it simply do something like this: $(document).ready(function(){ $(body).html('Please download firefox or chrome to view this site. FF or Chrome '); }); but if you want to go raw PHP you can use $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to switch case and have index.php choose which php file to include based on browser. Call me crazy, but I'd suggest not doing things this way.
