First, to clarify, what you're dealing with is not quite a binomial distribution, as your question suggests (you refer to it as a Bernoulli experiment). Binomial distributions are discrete --- the outcome is either success or failure. Your outcome is a ratio each time you run your experiment , not a set of successes and failures that you then calculate one summary ratio on. Because of that, methods for calculating a binomial proportion confidence interval will throw away a lot of your information. And yet you're correct that it's problematic to treat this as though it's normally distributed since you can get a CI that extends past the possible range of your variable. I recommend thinking about this in terms of logistic regression. Run a logistic regression model with your ratio variable as the outcome and no predictors. The intercept and its CI will give you what you need in logits, and then you can convert it back to proportions. You can also just do the logistic conversion yourself, calculate the CI and then convert back to the original scale. My python is terrible, but here's how you could do that in R: set.seed(24601) data data_logits # calculate CI for the transformed data mean_logits Here are the lower and upper bounds on a 99% CI for these data: > ci_lo [1] 0.7738327 > ci_hi [1] 0.8207924
