There's some intricate cheating involved. The confidence interval $(s,l)$ does not use the information that the range of the uniform is 1, and is thus non-parametric, while the claim made about the sample with $l-s=0.9$ does, and is highly model-dependent. I am pretty sure one can improve either the coverage or the (expected) length of the confidence interval if this information is taken into account. For one thing, the end points of the distribution are at most $1-(l-s)$ away from either $s$ or $l$. Hence, a 100% confidence interval for $\mu$ is $(l-1/2, s+1/2)$. This particular problem falls into the domain of inference for partially identified distributions studied in the last 10-15 years extensively in theoretical econometrics. Likelihood, and hence Bayesian, inference for the uniform distribution is ugly, since it constitutes an non-regular problem (the support of the distribution depends on the unknown parameter).
