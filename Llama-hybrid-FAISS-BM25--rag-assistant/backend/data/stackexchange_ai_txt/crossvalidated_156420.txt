Defining cutoff point for logistic regression

I am experimenting with logistic regression to predict a binary target variable. Using Stata, I have generated predicted probabilities between 0 and 1. Now, I am trying to think about how to translate these probabilities into the binary classification. Using a rule like " =50%==1" feels arbitrary, but I haven't found a better solution so far. Any ideas?
