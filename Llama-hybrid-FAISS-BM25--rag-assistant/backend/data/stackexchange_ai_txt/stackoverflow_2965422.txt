Jerry suggested two very good choices. There are other options though, if you want a more formulaic form for the model. The curvefitting toolbox, in the current version, allows you to fit surfaces to data, not just curves. Or fit a 2-d polynomial model, using a tool like polyfitn . Or you can use a nonlinear regression, if you have a model in mind. The optimization toolbox will help you there, with lsqnonlin or lsqcurvefit, either of which can fit 2-d (or higher) models. Or, if you have the stats toolbox, then try nlinfit. Perhaps you might like a tool to fit Radial Basis Functions . Neural nets are another way to fit data, so use the Neural Network Toolbox So there are many ways to model surfaces, depending on your interests, your knowledge of a likely form for the model, what toolboxes you have or what you might choose to download. A very big factor in your model choice are your goals for the model. What will you do with it? How will it be used?
