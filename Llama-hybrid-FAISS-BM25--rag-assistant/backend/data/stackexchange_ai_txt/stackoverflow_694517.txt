Sqlite as a replacement for fopen()?

On an official sqlite3 web page there is written that I should think about sqlite as a replacement of fopen() function. What do you think about it? Is it always good solution to replece application internal data storage with sqlite? What are the pluses and the minuses of such solution? Do you have some experience in it? EDIT: How about your experience? Is it easy to use? Was it painful or rather joyful? Do you like it?
