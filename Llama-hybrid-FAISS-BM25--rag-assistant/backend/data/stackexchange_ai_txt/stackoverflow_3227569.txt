BOOL has no value as it is a type. You probably mean variables of type BOOL. There are different types of variables, which have different initialization semantics: Instance variables : Objective-C's alloc promises to set all instance variables to zero, which in case of BOOL means NO ; Global variables : Or, more precisely, variables with static storage duration are initialized to zero, as defined in the C standard. Local variables are not initialized. If you don't assign a value, their contents are unspecified. This is also from the C standard and probably what you stumbled upon.
