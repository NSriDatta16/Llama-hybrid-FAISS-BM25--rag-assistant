Silhouette statistic is computed for every object from the set of objects being clustered (what is objects in your case - probes?). Sole objects (objects remained unclustered) in the solution receive silhouette value 0. This of course affects the average silhouette value. You might want to consider quality of clustering only among those objects that were clustered. So, set silhouette value for sole objects to missing value rather than 0 before averaging. This trick implies that sole objects are treated as noise points only and not as clusters on their own. Please be aware I'm not R user and therefore can't comment on clara function.
