You do not need to estimate the distribution of $\text{max}(X)$ , as one can find the distribution exactly. In particular, there is a very simple and elegant result that: the cdf of the maximum is the product of the respective cdf's. Then, the pdf of the max is obtained by simply differentiating the max cdf wrt $x$ . Automated version While the above process is conceptually simple, it can get algebraically messy. An automated version exists as the Maximum function in the mathStatica add-on package for Mathematica . We are given parent variable $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with pdf $f(x)$ : To illustrate, let us suppose we have 3 variables $X_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma_{i}^2)$ , with parameter values as shown: Then, the pdf of $\text{max}(X_i)$ is: [ The parameters could just as easily be symbolic -- and the pdf's do not need to share the same parent distribution. ] The following diagram compares the theoretical pdf of the maximum just obtained (dashed red curve) with a Monte Carlo simulation of same (squiggly blue line):
