Does a logistic regression end up modelling linear relationships?

I have a question regarding logistic regressions. Meyers et al. (2013) say that "It is possible to create a linear relationship between the predictors and odds" (p.533). They are referring to the predictors in a logistic regression. However, they also say, after introducing the idea of log odds, that "This transformation 'bends' the data to fit the sinusoidal curve" (p.533). I'm left a bit unclear whether the relationships between predictors and the outcome variable is modeled linearly or not? I had assumed logistic regression uses a sinusoidal curve; however, the first quotation makes it sound as though it actually models a linear relationship.
