Creating a proxy to spoof iPhone user-agent in PHP?

I'm writing a web based iPhone simulator and I'm looking for a way to spoof iPhone's Safari browser so that web pages loaded within the simulator (iframe) to use the mobile versions. From my understanding I need to modify the user-agent. How do I go about creating a PHP proxy script to spoof the iPhone's user-agent?
