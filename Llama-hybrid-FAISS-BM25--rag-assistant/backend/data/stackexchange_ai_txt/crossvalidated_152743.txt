Regression multiple customers per month

I have a file with sales for one complete year. Multiple customers, month number and total sales (per customer): Customer | Month | Sales ------------------------ A | 1 | 100 A | 2 | 120 A | 3 | 90 B | 1 | 50,000 B | 2 | 49,000 B | 3 | 51,500 Now, I want to know if there's a pattern in the sales per month (for example, sales go up or down in a specific month). I cannot average the customers per month because that would lead to only 12 data points (one per month), plus the sales from a customer might be really different for another one. I thought I could calculate the year average per customer and use that as a base point for the regression analysis. Is it correct if I do the following? : Add boolean columns for each month: is_january, is_feb, is_march, ... Calculate the average for the whole year and for each customer Reduce all the sales to the same base (e.g., 100), by doing (Total sales of the month)/(year average) That way I end up with the following: IsJan | IsFeb | IsMarch | ... | CustomerAvg_base100 | ThisMonthSales_base100 ------------------------------------------------------------ 1 | 0 | 0 | ... | 100 | 97 0 | 1 | 0 | ... | 100 | 116 0 | 0 | 1 | ... | 100 | 87 1 | 0 | 0 | ... | 100 | 99.67 0 | 1 | 0 | ... | 100 | 97.67 0 | 0 | 1 | ... | 100 | 102.66 Is this correct? Or how should I do it? BTW, I don't know too much about statistics, only basic linear regression analysis and I am using Excel (but I could learn E-Views if needed). Thanks!
