You can indeed do that, see Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net . Pooling gives you some amount of translation invariance, which may or may not be helpful. Also, pooling is faster to compute than convolutions. Still, you can always try replacing pooling by convolution with stride and see what works better. Some current works use average pooling ( Wide Residual Networks , DenseNets ), others use convolution with stride ( DelugeNets )
