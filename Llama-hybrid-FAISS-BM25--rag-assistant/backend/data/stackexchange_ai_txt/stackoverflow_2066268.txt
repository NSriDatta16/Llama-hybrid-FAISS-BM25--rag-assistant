Basic algorithm: Find number of samples to fit into draw-window Determine how many samples should be presented by each pixel Calculate RMS (or peak) value for each pixel from a sample block. Averaging does not work for audio signals. Draw the values. Let's assume that n(number of samples)=44100, w(width)=100 pixels: then each pixel should represent 44100/100 == 441 samples (blocksize) for (x = 0; x Stuff to try for different visual appear: rms vs max value from block overlapping blocks (blocksize x but advance x/2 for each pixel etc) Downsampling would not probably work as you would lose peak information.
