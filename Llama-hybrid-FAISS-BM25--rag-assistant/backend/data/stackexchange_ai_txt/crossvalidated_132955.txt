MCMC sampling with sum constraints

I'm interested in sampling a collection of variables with a sum constraint on them. For a simplified example: Prior: $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ $Y \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ Observation: $X + Y = 1$ Proposed approach: Use augmented variables $S$, $x'$, and $y'$, defined as: $X = x' / S$ $Y = y' / S$ $S = x' + y'$ MCMC Algorithm: 1) Sample $x'$ given previous value of $S$ as being from $\mathcal{N}(0, S^2)$. 2) Sample $y'$ given previous value of $S$ as being from $\mathcal{N}(0, S^2)$. 3) "Sample" $S$ by setting it to $x' + y'$. This feels like it should work, but how can I prove that it is a valid data augmentation scheme? Specifically, when sampling $x'$ using Gibbs sampling, why are we not forced to choose $x' = S - y'$ since we are conditioning on $S$ and $y'$?
