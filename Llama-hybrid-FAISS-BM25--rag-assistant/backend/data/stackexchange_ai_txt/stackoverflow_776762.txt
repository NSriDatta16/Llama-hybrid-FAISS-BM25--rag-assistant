lastAgentIDAarhus = agents[index == -1 ? 0 : index % agents.Count]; The use of the MOD operator % atuomatically chops the index to the range of possible indexes. The modulo operator is the compliment to the DIV (/) operator and returns the remainder of a division of two whole numbers. For example if you divide 9 by 6 the result is 1 with a remainder of 3. The MOD operator asks for the 3.
