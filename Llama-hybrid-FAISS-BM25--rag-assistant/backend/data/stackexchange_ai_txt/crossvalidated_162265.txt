First Derivative / Maximisation Problem

It appears to be super easy, but I just cannot reconcile how Lambert et al. (2012) on page 8 come from (3) to (4) - please see screenshot! Particularly bothering: where does the "Lambda" in the denominator come from? Any help would be greatly appreciated - thanks a lot for all your support!
