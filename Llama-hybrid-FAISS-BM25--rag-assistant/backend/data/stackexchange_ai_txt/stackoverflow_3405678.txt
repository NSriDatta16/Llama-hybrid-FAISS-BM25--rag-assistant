The git protocol tries to send patches instead of whole files, but the git storage engine always stores whole files, and always keeps old versions of the files. git is probably not the tool for the job if you aren't trying to keep file history. rsync is a mature file distribution system that can work over ssh or its own protocol (the same as git), can make binary patches, and doesn't necessarily keep change history. Probably start looking there to see if you can get that work.
