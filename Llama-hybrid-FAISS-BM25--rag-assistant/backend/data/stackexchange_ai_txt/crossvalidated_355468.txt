Average precision when no relevant documents are found

I am building an algorithm that attempts to return relevant documents. If the query retrieves 10 documents but none are relevant how is the average precision calculated? Applying the AveP formula , it becomes an issue because it is divide by zero since the denominator is number of relevant documents.
