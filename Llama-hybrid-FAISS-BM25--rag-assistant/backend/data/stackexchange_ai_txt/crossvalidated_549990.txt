Causal modeling and DAGs in Python - where to start and what are the best sources?

I am very new to causal models (and econometrics) and need to pick up basics fast. I am comfortable with ML though. I did an extensive research during last several days on causality, DAGs, and modeling, but still not sure how to approach it properly. Having the same problem as this user . So far I have went through: Basics of Judea Peal and his work This cool book by Matheus Facure Several MOOCs like UPenn Crash Course and Brady Neal Course Python libraries like DoWhy , CausalNex , and others But still I do not see enough clear examples of modeling work (or maybe I am looking in a wrong direction). I do not touch Bayesian Networks for now, this is unnecessary for this project. What I am trying to do right now: I need to build a DAG and a simple and explainable causal model with a couple of numeric X variables only and a numeric Y variable. I think I can do it with some libraries above. But if I understand correctly, DAG is just a graphical representation of the relationship and I need a model behind. I googled a lot about ML, DAGs, etc, but still either do not understand it well (which is true), looking in a wrong direction). Facure's book is the closest I have seen so far about modeling and evaluation of causal models (where to read about evaluation more?) I would greatly appreciate some tips - feel free to share your favorite resources!
