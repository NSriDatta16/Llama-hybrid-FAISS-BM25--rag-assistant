What can explain large Odds Ratios 95% confidence intervals in multilevel binomial logistic regression (glmer)?

I conducted a multilevel binomial regression (glmer) and I obtain quite wide confidence intervals for my odds ratio. What could be causing such large 95% CI and what can be done to provide more precise CI? Is it right to assume that odds ratio can be interpreted in the same way for a multilevel logistic regression as for a normal logistic regression? formal_c I tried a bootstrapping method below but no difference was found...

Any advice would be appreciated, I'm quite new in those analyses. Thanks!!
