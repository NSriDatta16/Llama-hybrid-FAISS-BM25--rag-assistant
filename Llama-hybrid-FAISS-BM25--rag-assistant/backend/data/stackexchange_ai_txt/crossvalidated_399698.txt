You should be able to account for this in the volatility and return regressions by including the daily trading volume or turnover as an explanatory variable. A correlation of 0.4 should not cause collinearity problems. Obviously this will not work for turnover as a dependent variable. Personally I would just avoid using turnover as a liquidity measure, as there are better measures of liquidity available anyway. If you have quote data for this stock then you could compute the average quoted bid-ask spread and the average effective spread. If you only have trade prices you could use the Roll Measure.
