Why is the normalisation constant in Bayesian not a marginal distribution? The normalisation constant is a marginal distribution. "How is $z$ evaluated to be a constant when evaluating the integral becomes the marginal distribution $p(D)$ " The integral provides indeed a probability density of the observations ( $D$ can be any value). So $z$ , or better $z(D)$ , is a function of $D$ . But when you evaluate $z(D)$ for a particular given observation $D$ then the value is a constant (a single number and not a distribution). $$p(\theta |D) = \frac{p(D|\theta)p(\theta)}{\int p(D|\theta)p(\theta)d\theta} = \frac{p(D|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(D)}$$ Note that the posterior $p(\theta |D)$ is a function of $D$ . For different $D$ you will get a different result.
