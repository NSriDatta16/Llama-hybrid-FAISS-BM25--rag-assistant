Can PCA be used for independent variables?

Currently I've been carrying out a research on prediction of some thermal properties of steels from chemical composition only. For that purpose I have 13 inputs (for instance: C,Mn,Ni, etc). They are totally independent. If I apply a PCA analysis, 94.8% of the variance can be explained by 10 components, and my results improve largely,since I have few data points. The question that arises is: does the PCA analysis make sense for such situation? My intention was to perform a bias/variance trade-off, however I don't know if it is conceptually incorrect to use PCA in such case.
