This may be a design issue with your printer: as you're saying, it's dot-matrix. These types of printers have very low DPI, so they're working around it by printing bolded text as normal text, but several times in the same area, slightly offset each time (whereas normal text is only printed once). That means that a line in bold text will take a multiple of the time necessary to print a normal line. If this is a major issue, consider getting a laser printer - those print in near-constant time, regardless of page coverage.
