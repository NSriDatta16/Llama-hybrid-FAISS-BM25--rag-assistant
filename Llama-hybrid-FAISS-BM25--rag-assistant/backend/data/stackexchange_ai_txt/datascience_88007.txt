What is the name of this basic machine learning example?

Some time ago I was reading a book on machine learning in which they had an example that would take some data and try to determine based on weather, temperature, humidity and Wind if a sports team would play or not. It looked similar to this example and I was wondering if anyone could name this famous example so I can find a Python library that does the same thing.
