Yes you might have an analytical posterior distribution. But the core of Bayesian analysis is to marginalize over the posterior distribution of parameters so that you get a better prediction result both in terms of accuracy and generalization capability. Basically, you want to obtain a predictive distribution which has the following form. $p(x|D)=\int p(x|w) p(w|D)dw$ where $p(w|D)$ is the posterior distribution which you might have an analytical form for. But in many cases, $p(w|D)$ has a complex form that does not belong to any known distribution family nor in conjugacy with $p(x|w)$. This makes the above integrand impossible to calculate analytically. Then you have to resort to sampling approximation of the integrand which is the entire purpose of the advanced sampling technique such as markov chain monte carlo
