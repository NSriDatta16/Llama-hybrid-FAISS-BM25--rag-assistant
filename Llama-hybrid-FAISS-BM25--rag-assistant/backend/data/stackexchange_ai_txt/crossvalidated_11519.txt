Searching for car displacement data

I am starting a work on electric vehicle to see how the charging process can impact the local electricity network. I would like to know if there exists public data of driving "habits". Ideally, I would like time series data for bigh fleets of vehicles in a relatively big city. For a given car these data could be a series of date telling when and where the car stops and when it starts again. It could also contain the associated consumption of energy and driving distance between to stop. I know I am asking too much but would like to know if anyone is aware of an intermediate dataset. Thanks in advance
