"If Windows Mobile 7 phones (projected to be released in a year or so) gain market share...we might see gradual attrition of developers to Windows Mobile since most will prefer to develop with Microsoft's suite of tools." Let's posit that VS and the CLR provide a better programming experience. EVEN SO, it is not at all clear that the "gradual attrition" towards WM would occur. "Programming experience" is only one factor that developers will face; existing marketshare and perception is another (think about Amazon and eBay or, for that matter, iTunes' MP3 store). You talk about the "longer term" as being 2-4 years. In that time, is there any chance of WM7 gaining LARGER marketshare than Apple? Not realistically. Even if we take the far horizon of your timeframe, is it feasible that iPhone development will have COLLAPSED in 4 years in the face of a vastly-superior programming experience for WM7? What does MS have that's conceivably a platform-killer against the iPhone? C# 4, DLR, VS2K10? None of those things would be sufficient. What might ( might ) do it is Azure. But I would argue that if you think Azure is an iPhone platform killer, then you have to give equal attention to Google / Android. All of which is to say that, from a risk-management perspective, the least risky choice is clearly the iPhone. If you want to mitigate the risk of being wrong, factor your Cocoa programs well enough that you can re-implement them in, say, C#.
