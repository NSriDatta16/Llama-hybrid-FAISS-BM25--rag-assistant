Paperclip Amazon S3 setup with Heroku

has_attached_file :image, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/:style/:filename" I'm not sure what :path => "/:style/:filename" is. I also want to to include the style for this attached image, is that what the :path is? the style I want is this: :styles => { :medium => "275x275>", :thumb => "175x155>" } Basically what's going on here is that I'm setting up on heroku and I'm having to use S3 which seems straightforward just not used to this attachment convention stuff. Also, I just signed up for an S3 account... but heroku was spouting that its free or something. What's the deal with that?
