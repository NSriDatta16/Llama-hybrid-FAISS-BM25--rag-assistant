Sounds to me like your system is working, just not as well as you'd like. Is this a paid project? If it is, you could make pay be a meritocracy. Pay people based on how much of the work they get done. This would encourage cross discipline work. Although, it might also encourage people to work on pieces that weren't theirs to begin with, or internal sabotage. Obviously, you'd have to be on the lookout for people trying to game the system, but it might work. Surely testers wouldn't want to earn half of what devs do.
