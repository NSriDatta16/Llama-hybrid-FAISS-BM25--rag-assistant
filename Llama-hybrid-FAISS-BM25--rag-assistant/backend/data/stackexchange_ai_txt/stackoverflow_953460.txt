I don't know that there is a standard organization in XCode, especially since project organization inside the IDE often does not translate to file organization on disk. That said, I usually do something similar to your Option 1, for no better reason than that more closely resembles the folder structure in Rails, which is what I was most used to when I started messing with the iPhone.
