Can you do CFA with non-survey data?

I have a dataset with countries as observations and 33 country-level continuous variables. The information accompanying the dataset groups the 33 variables into 6 different 'categories', however I am not convinced that this categorization is correct as some variables from different categories are highly correlated with with each other. I beleve that some variables have been wrongly lumped together within these categories and that by performing CFA I would be able to remap the variables onto new categories. However, I have only seen EFA and CFA applied to survey data. Does it make sense to perform CFA on country-level continuous variables or would PCA be more appropriate here?
