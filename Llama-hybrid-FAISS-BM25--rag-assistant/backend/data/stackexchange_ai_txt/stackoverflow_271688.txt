Wrap an image in an a tag, but only have underline on text

My screenshot http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/240752/stars.gif I want to have it so that only the text is underlined. The only way I can see of doing this is this: .no-underline { text-decoration:none; } .underline { text-decoration:underline; } Average customer review rating Is this the best way? or does someone know a leaner way? Thanks.
