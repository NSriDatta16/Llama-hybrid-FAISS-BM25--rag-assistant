I am a newcomer at GIT, and after using it for a a couple of weeks have to say that its really great, once you get the hang of the command line prompts. To answer your question "Is Git ready?" => I think it is (except for the command line learning curve.) I think you and your team/company should ask yourselves "Are you ready for git?." Once you start using it you will clearly have alot of power at your fingertips. Your first steps to learning git are: Reading the git guides at github. Head over to Pragmatic Programmer s and d/l the "free" Insder to Github You can also pick up the Pragmatic Version Control Using Git
