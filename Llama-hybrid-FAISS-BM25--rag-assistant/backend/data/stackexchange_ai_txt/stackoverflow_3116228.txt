Yes it's possible. Your syntax was off though. The below seems to work. I have kept @PersonId as a separate scalar variable outside the table variable as that's how you have it in your question. And I have assumed that the Primary Key of SomeTable is PersonId DECLARE @PersonId INT DECLARE @variableTable TABLE ( SomeScore DECIMAL(10,7), SomeAverage DECIMAL(10,7), SomeCount INTEGER ) -- Insert or Update MERGE SomeTable AS T USING @variableTable AS S ON (T.PersonId = @PersonId) WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET T.PersonScore = SomeScore, T.PersonAverage = SomeAverage, T.PersonCount = SomeCount WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN INSERT(PersonId, PersonScore, PersonAverage, PersonCount) VALUES(@PersonId, SomeScore, SomeAverage, SomeCount);
