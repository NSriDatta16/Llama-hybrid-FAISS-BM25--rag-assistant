You are using "random variables" in a slightly nonstandard way. You'd probably be better off thinking of the single outcome variable (that is being predicted, on the left side of the model equation) as the only random variable. More specifically: Q1: "should I think of all three columns of 1's in the random effects design matrix as being part of a single random variable, the Subject?" This is certainly better than the 2nd option you mention, and almost correct. Subjects are randomly selected and they are all part of the same random component of the model, but that doesn't make that component a random variable. Q2: Yes, it is certainly possible to have a numerical predictor whose value is randomly determined, as in your rainfall example. In this case lmer (and ancova) will attempt to predict the random outcome variable as a linear function of this numerical predictor. It is not relevant to the model whether this numerical value was randomly determined (e.g., by nature) or experimentally controlled (e.g., by the experimenter's sprinkler system). Q3: Days is a fixed effect (and keep in mind that this fixed effect refers to an effect on the average across all subjects--not a fixed value that is the same for all subjects). The days:subject interaction term should be thought of like this: The day effect may vary randomly from subject-to-subject; this interaction term quantifies that random variation (which is extremely relevant in deciding whether or not the days effect in our sample can be generalized to the whole population average). Q4: See Q3. "Is each column's parameter treated as a separate random variable?" Model parameters are not random variables as far as lmer is concerned (though model parameters are generally random variables to Bayesians). The numerical values are used to estimate the model parameters (e.g., variance across Ss in the days effect). But the model parameters themselves are constants fixed in nature that we are trying to estimate from the data. Q5: I'm not sure how you are thinking that the interaction would be represented in a single column? But lets go back to the rainfall example of Q2. Maybe you measure one predictor that is the duration of rainfall and another that is the average rate of rainfall during periods of rain, so the "interaction" of these formed by multiplication is the total rainfall. Again, if you include them in the model then lmer will try to predict the outcome variable as including linear contributions of these variables as well as the total rainfall, again without regard to whether these amounts were determined randomly or not. It might really pay off to study ANOVA and ANCOVA models a bit more before getting into lmer. A lot of the same fundamental concepts are in play with those models, yet they are a bit simpler so it is easier to see how everything fits together.
