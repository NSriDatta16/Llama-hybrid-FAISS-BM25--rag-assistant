From Developer to Web Developer to Web Designer

Is it possible for a fairly experienced Java Developer to transition to being a Web Developer and then to Web Designer. I guess what I'm asking is - assume you have (Java) developer of above average aptitute - is it possible for that developer to acquire web development skills that will enable him/her to develop small business websites without the need to hire outside skills. If so, where does one start on the path to becoming a Web Developer/Designer? Skills required? Tools used?
