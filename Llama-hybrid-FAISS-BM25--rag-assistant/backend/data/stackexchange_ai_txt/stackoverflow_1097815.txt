Right reporting solution in a .Net environment

I have a reporting requirement in my web application for which I am looking for off the shelf solution. I don't have any experience of reporting softwares so thought of checking with SO community if anyone have any idea of reporting solution which fits my requirements. The application will be developed in .Net and apart from other functionalities, I need reporting capability. The look and feel of the entire app should look same. Is embedding a reporting software into a .Net application is possible or a separate server instance is required? Which one is better? I need to expose few tables from my database and user should be able to create any kind of queries(report) on that. User should be able to save the queries and name them. A query saved by a user should be only visible to him. A user belongs to a group. A User can create a report which is visible to whole group as well if he choose so. I am currently looking at izenda to see if it supports my requirement.
