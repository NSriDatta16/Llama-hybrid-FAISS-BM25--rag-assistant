BERT GENERATIVE MODEL

I am asking if bert can be used as a generative model.In fact I read the paper BERT has a Mouth, and It Must Speak: BERT as a Markov Random Field Language Model using MCMC sampling. However, I am asking if there is other techniques or ideas to sample from bert. In fact, I will explain the problem that I want to solve: I want to mask a span of tokens ( Contiguous tokens from a sentence) and generate a new span using the rest of the sentence, this span can be of any length. For example : I eat delicious pizza with friends, I am going to mask delicious pizza so the sentence will be I eat [MASK][MASK] with friends and generate suggestions instead of the MASK. Someone can help me with ideas?
