Organizing Haskell Tests

So I'm trying to follow the suggested structure of a Haskell project , and I'm having a couple problems organizing my tests. For simplicity, let's start with: src/Clue/Cards.hs # defines Clue.Cards module testsuite/tests/Clue/Cards.hs # tests Clue.Cards module For one, I'm not sure what to name the module in testsuite/tests/Clue/Cards.hs that contains the test code, and for another, I'm no sure how to compile my test code so that I can link to my source: % ghc -c testsuite/tests/Clue/Cards.hs -L src testsuite/tests/Clue/Cards.hs:5:0: Failed to load interface for `Clue.Cards': Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
