Guassian Process Regression - feature selection

I'm using guassian process regression to do some modeling. One issue I'm encountering is feature selection for some of my models, which often have many relevant features. I'm not sure what the best way to reduce the # of features is. I understand that some covariance functions in GPR use automatic relevance detection, but I believe there are some assumptions on the features that these methods require (I think independence between features for ARD). Anyone dealt with these issues before? Any suggestions on the best approach to reduce features or create independent features from existing ones? Is there a preprocessing method that might help? I've looked at PCA but features are only guaranteed independence if joint normally distributed, which I'm not sure my features are. I find GPR to be more accurate when there are fewer features, and I have hundreds of potential features that I could use. Thanks!
