The only fix I found for this is to run your code through a linked server in a 32-bit instance of SQL Server Express next to your 64-bit instance (32-bit instances can be installed on a 64-bit Windows server). Any version other than Express will do, but SQL Server Express adds no extra cost. Not the most elegant solution, but no problem so far.
