Take some time and look at other software products. Every year, companies like Google and Microsoft dump millions of dollars into usability testing. Take what they have learned about user interaction and apply it to your own products/projects. Infragistics also just created a nice reference for UI Design Patterns, it can be found at http://quince.infragistics.com/ .
