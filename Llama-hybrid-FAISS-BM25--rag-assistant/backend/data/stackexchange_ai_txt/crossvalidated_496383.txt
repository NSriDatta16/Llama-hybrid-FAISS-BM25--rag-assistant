How to model a sigmoid function?

I have a variable where Y ~ sigmoid(X). Y ranges between 0 and 1. Y, however, is not a probability, so I don't know if I can just get a logistic regression. What I do want is, for a change in X, how much does Y change. How would I model this? Obviously, different values of X leads to different changes in Y, depending on where you are on the sigmoid curve. Thanks!
