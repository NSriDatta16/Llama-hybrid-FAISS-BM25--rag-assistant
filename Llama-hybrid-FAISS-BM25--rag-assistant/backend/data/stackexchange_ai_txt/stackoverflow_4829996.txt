How to view actual error on Azure fastCGI?

I get a generic server error on Azure fastCGI on accessing a blob storage. The error is: 500 - Internal server error. There is a problem with the resource you are looking for, and it cannot be displayed. Below is the code. This code runs fine in local tests and all files uploaded on Azure as content work fine. Can anyone please tell me how to debug and view the actual errors? '; if ($client) { $client->getBlob('setup', 'folders.txt', $filename); echo 'Blob Load ok! '; } else { echo 'Blob Storage Error '; } echo ', END'; ?> thanks.
