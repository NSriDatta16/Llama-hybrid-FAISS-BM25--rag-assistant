How to get a piecewise linear function in MATLAB GUI

I want to implement a GUI in MATLAB 2010a that user be able to input a Piecewise linear function interactively (add/remove points by click and move point by drag and drop). Here is an implementation in C#. I am hope there is an similar implementation in MATLAB that uses axes or any other object that capture mouse events and update the piecewise function. Below is some examples of user input as a piecewise linear function:
