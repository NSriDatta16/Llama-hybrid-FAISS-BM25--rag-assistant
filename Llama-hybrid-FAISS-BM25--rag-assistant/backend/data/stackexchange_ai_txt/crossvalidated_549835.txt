When you have a factor variable in a regression model, that is, a categorical variable with multiple levels, that variable should be treated as a whole. So you should mostly disregard the t-tests for each separate level, and test the variable as a whole. In a linear regression model that would be an F-test. Such multiple-df tests are often called chunk tests , see What are chunk tests? . Most of these is explained in the post you linked. The post I linked above contains examples. As pointed out in a comment by user Frank Harrell, one specific reason to ignore the 1-df tests is tat they depend on the categorical encoding used. That is, they test specific contrasts, which might well be without any interest to you, especially if you only used some default coding. See my answer at categorical independent variable with three levels and binary logistic regression
