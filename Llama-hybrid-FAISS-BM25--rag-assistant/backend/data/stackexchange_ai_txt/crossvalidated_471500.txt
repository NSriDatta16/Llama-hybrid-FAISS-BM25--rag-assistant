How to apply svm to a dataset with a numerical (not categorical) dependent variable?

Context: I have some band values from a sentinel - 2 derived .tiff I now want to make a prediction regarding areas where i have no actual field data i.e. make a carbon map of sorts Libraries are: library("e1071") library("caret") IndependentVar I can't run a confusion matrix as ways of evaluating the model because the dependent variable is numerical. What can i run to valuate how my model did?
