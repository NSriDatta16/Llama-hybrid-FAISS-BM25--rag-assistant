Scroll a WPF FlowDocumentScrollViewer from code?

I have a FlowDocumentScrollViewer I want to automatically scroll to the bottom when text is added. In code I add Inlines to the Paragraph, but when there is to much text I would like to be able to simply scroll down using code instead of having the user doing so. Any suggestions?
