How to save/load a Model (Pickle) with a specific path/directory

I seems like a very basic think but I couldnt find an answer to it. I want to save my model to a specific directory using pickle. The two algorithms below work fine for saving it in the same directory as the code itself but I want to save all my models in a dedicated folder. I tried to just change the "filename" to "filepath" and well, make it a path but the world isnt that easy it seems. Example Path: C:\Learning\Python\Data Science\02_TrainedModels . # save the model to disk filename = 'Father_Son_Height_Model.pckl' pickle.dump(lm, open(filename, 'wb')) filename = 'Father_Son_Height_Model.pckl' loaded_model = pickle.load(open(filename, 'rb')) With This Code: # save the model to disk filepath = r'H:\99_Lernen\Python\Data Science\02_Trained Models\Father_Son_Height_Model.pckl' pickle.dump(lm, open(filepath, 'wb')) I get this Error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'H:\99_Lernen\Python\Data Science\02_Trained Models\Father_Son_Height_Model.pckl' In this line of code: pickle.dump(lm, open(filepath, 'wb'))
