How do you organize your temporary workfiles?

I do alot of bugfixing and implementing new features for several different customers. These customers all report their bugs, change requests and new feature request into our Trac system . Sometimes these requests result in me creating some SQL change scripts, sometimes there are Excel documents or Access databases with testdata, Word documents from the customer and so on. Alot of files that are used to fix one ticket and then can be deletede when the ticket is closed. I usualy do this by creating folders in the filesystem like this: /customerXX/TicketNNNNN and then just dumping everything in there. How do you organize your workfiles? Have you found some fantastic tool to do this?
