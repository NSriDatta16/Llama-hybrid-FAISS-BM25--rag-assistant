Macro expansion in Visual Studio macro or add in

I have a VS project with an IntermediateDirectory like this: "....\temp\$(SolutionName)\$(ProjectName)". I can read this value using a macro or add in, however, I would need the actual directory to manipulate files there. Right now, I manually replace the "$(SolutionName)" and "$(ProjectName)" with the respective values, which works fine but might become complicated when different macros or even user macros from property sheets are used. So my question is: Does the Visual Studio API have a built in function to expand macros like these? Or is there some other elegant solution?
