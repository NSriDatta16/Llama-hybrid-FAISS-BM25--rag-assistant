Hypothesis testing with 1 or 2 sample in ornithology

I am doing an experiment with birds. I have set up the experiment to measure how certain foods affect bird flying speeds. When I implement a control, for example food A, I want to claim that the average flying speed of Gulls is higher when they are fed with food A. I set up the 2-sample hypothesis, but I'm confused whether to compare food A with the average (include food A) or compare food A with the average (exclude food A, ie. all other foods). I really appreciate if anyone could enlighten me on this topic. Edit: Thanks for @ReneBt suggestion, I will make the experiment more clear. All gulls are fed with the same controlled diet. They are randomly selected to get food supplements A and B. Food A and food B were added in their diet but only one supplement for one bird throughout the experiment. I want to test the claim that the average flying speed of Gulls is higher when they are fed with food A. Hope it's clear.
