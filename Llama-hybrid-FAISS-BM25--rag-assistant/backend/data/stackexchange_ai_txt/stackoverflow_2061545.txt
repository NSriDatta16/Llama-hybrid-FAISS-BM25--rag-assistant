Dynamically size javascript popup based on embedded swf size

I am embedding a swf in a popup window using javascript's window.open function. I am currently passing in static values for the popup's height and width corresponding to the height and width of the embedded swf, like so: window.open(' http://whatever.swf ', 'popup', 'width=400,height=300,resizable=1'); A user can click on a button in the swf, and it changes the size of the swf from 400x300, to 400x600. Is there a way to dynamically resize the javascript popup window to account for this size increase without reloading the embedded swf? Any help is much appreciated....
