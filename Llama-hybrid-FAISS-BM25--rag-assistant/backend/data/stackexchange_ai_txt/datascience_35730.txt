What is a good approach for a lifespan?

Let's say I wan't to predict the lifespan of an ad in a listing. I know a bunch of thing from the ad like: the title the price the location etc The target value is the duration of the ad in the listing before it's being removed (item has been sold). What would be the best approach for engineering the target? I've tried categorizing the log of the duration, but it's not leveraging the cyclic pattern you can see in the histogram of the lifespan (in hours): x-axis : lifespan in hours
