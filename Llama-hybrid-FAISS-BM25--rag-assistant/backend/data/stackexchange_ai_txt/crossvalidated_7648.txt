Spam filtering using naive Bayesian classifiers with the e1071/klaR package on R

I'm looking at doing text classification/spam filtering using naive Bayesian classifiers with the e1071 or klaR package on R. Is there a good tutorial out there to describe this? I'm kind of stuck because I'm not sure what to use as the data to input into the NaiveBayes function. Some help very much appreciated, thanks!
