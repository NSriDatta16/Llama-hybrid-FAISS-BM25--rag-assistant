FileAge is not working with "c:\pagefile.sys"

Does anybody know why FileAge is not working with "c:\pagefile.sys"? It returns -1. Update: Found it: It is a Delphi bug fixed in Delphi 2010 ( QC Entry 73539 ), but the PDF I have found does not explain how they fix it. Does anyone know how they fix it so I can fix my Delphi 7? UPDATE: Elegant fix provided by Radu Barbu! Delphi 7, Win 7 (32 bits)
