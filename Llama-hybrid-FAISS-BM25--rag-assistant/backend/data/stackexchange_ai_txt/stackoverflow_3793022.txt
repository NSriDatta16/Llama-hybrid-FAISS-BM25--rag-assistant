How do you get to limits of 8060 bytes per row and 8000 per (varchar, nvarchar) value?

Comining from my question " 8078 bytes in 8060 B datapage (SQL Server)? " where it was explained to me how to derive 8078 bytes of data per page in MS SQL Server. If I calculate the number of bytes per page used for data storage (without overhead) of only one row with one column of non-indexed fixed-size type record (as per the MSDN article Estimating the Size of a Heap ), then I come to 8087 bytes (per page). How do I get to to the limits of 8060 bytes per row (mentioned in my other question's answers) and to 8000 bytes per (varchar, nvarchar) without buying and studying 1000+ page books? I am certainly missing something in storage allocation: the fewer chunks to manage, the more overhead...
