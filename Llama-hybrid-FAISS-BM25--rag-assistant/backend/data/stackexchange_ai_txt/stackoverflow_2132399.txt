Well for those interested: the only solution I found is get back to the Ganymede (The most recent version today is Galileo 3.5.1). I tried Galileo Classic and Galileo 3.5.1 Java EE, both freshly downloaded, neither worked with that project. Eclipse hangs up and uses 100% of CPU resource. Ganymede works fine.
