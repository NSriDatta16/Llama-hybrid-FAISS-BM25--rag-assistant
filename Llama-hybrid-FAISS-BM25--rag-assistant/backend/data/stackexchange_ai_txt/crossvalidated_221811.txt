If y is ordinal, you should probably explore ordinal logistic regression first. Ordinal independent variables are tricky; the usual choice is to treat them either as categorical or continuous and neither option is perfect. However, there are some other choices, although they are not widely known or used. In SAS, you can use optimal scoring for ordinal variables using PROC TRANSREG. This is probably also available in R, but I don't know which package. Essentially, this involves figuring out the optimal values to use fro 0, 1, 2 and 3 to make the regression as good as possible. I am not sure what you mean by "estimate the weight of each factor in percent".
