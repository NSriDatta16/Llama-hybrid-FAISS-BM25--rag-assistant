How would you transform a percentage dependent variable to fit a logistic regression?

I have a outcome variable that is a percentage (proportion). According to this, I should probably use a logistic regression: What are the issues with using percentage outcome in linear regression? My goal is interpretation and my goal is to interpret actually only a single variable . So for example, Y = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4, I only care about the coefficient of X2. Now, because my Y is actually a percentage and NOT a binary value, how would someone use a logistic regression to solve this problem? It doesn't make sense to transform my Y to 0s and 1s with a threshold of 0.5, partly because the range of Y is between 0 and 0.3 and Y is not a binary variable. It is literally a proportion (think how full a glass of water is) and so something binary just doesn't make sense. Is there a way to transform Y to fit a logistic regression? How would one model such a proportion? Thanks!
