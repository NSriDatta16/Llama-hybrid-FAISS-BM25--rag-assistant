Removing specific item from file in isolated storage

Is there a way to delete specific line in file that is in isolated storage, for example, I save a few lines of string in file, that is in isolated storage, and i want to delete specific string that i select in listbox(that lines of strings are read from isolated storage in listbox). here is the code for writing: StreamWriter writeFile; if (!store.DirectoryExists("SaveFolder")) { store.CreateDirectory("SaveFolder"); writeFile = new StreamWriter(new IsolatedStorageFileStream("SaveFolder\\SavedFile.txt", FileMode.CreateNew, store)); } else { writeFile = new StreamWriter(new IsolatedStorageFileStream("SaveFolder\\SavedFile.txt", FileMode.Append, store)); } StringWriter str = new StringWriter(); str.Write(urlHolder.Text); writeFile.WriteLine(str.ToString()); writeFile.Close(); urlHolder.Text = string.Empty; and here is the code for reading: IsolatedStorageFile store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); StreamReader readFile = null; try { readFile = new StreamReader(new IsolatedStorageFileStream("SaveFolder\\SavedFile.txt", FileMode.Open, store)); string fileText = readFile.ReadLine(); while (fileText==readFile.ReadLine()) { bookmarkListBox.Items.Add(fileText); } readFile.Close(); } catch { MessageBox.Show("Need to create directory and the file first."); } I cannot find anywhere nothing about removing something in specific file that is in isolated storage, so if anyone knows something, please reply, thanks!
