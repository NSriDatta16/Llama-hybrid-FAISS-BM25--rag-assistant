arcobjects can't draw dynamic draw screen objects

I enabled the map to allow dynamic objects Then I grab the IDynamicDisplay from an event which I wired up. void dynamicMapEvents_AfterDynamicDraw(esriDynamicMapDrawPhase DynamicMapDrawPhase, IDisplay Display, IDynamicDisplay dynamicDisplay) { if (DynamicMapDrawPhase != esriDynamicMapDrawPhase.esriDMDPDynamicLayers) return; IDynamicDrawScreen m_dynamicDrawScreen = dynamicDisplay as IDynamicDrawScreen; m_dynamicDrawScreen.DrawScreenText(myPoint, "Test"); } "Test" should be drawn on the screen but its not. I have the feeling I'm missing one line of code somwhere.
