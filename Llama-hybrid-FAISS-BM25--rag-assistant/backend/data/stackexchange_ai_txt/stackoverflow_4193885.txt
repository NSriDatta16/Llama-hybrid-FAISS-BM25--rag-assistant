Well this might not be a solution for vim but I think awk can help: cat testscript | LC_ALL=C awk '{printf "%s %s %s %s %.3f\n", $1,$2,$3,$4,$5+1.567 }' and the test this is a number 1.56 this is a number 2.56 this is a number 3.56 I needed the LC_ALL=C for the correct conversion of the floating point separator, and maybe there is a more elegant solution for printing the beginning/ rest of the string. And the result looks like: this is a number 3.127 this is a number 4.127 this is a number 5.127
