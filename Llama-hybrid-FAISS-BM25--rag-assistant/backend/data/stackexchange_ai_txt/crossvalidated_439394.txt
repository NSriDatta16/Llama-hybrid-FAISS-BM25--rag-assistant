There exist ways you can test seasonality. Though plots are useful you should test your assumed seasonality with cross validation. The topic of neural networks and forecasting is not as well developed as it is for other fields. DeepAR has shown some success, but with these methods come additional computational costs. You can also search for pretrained neural networks for forecasting for something cheaper.
