Use :include statement to find records

I'm working on Ruby On Rails 2.3.2 and I'm learning how to use the :include statement. I'd like to get all the announcements order by their rate. I've got two models and tables for that: Announcement and Rate. The models look like this: class Announcement I'd like to do something like the following, but using :include statement. Announcement.find_by_sql 'select * from announcements ann inner join rates r on ann.id = r.announcement_id order by r.average DESC' I already tried this: Announcement.paginate :page => params[:page], :per_page => 10, :include => [:rates], :order => 'rates.average DESC' but it's trying to associate rates.id = announcements.id , instead of rates.announcement_id = announcement_id How can I specify the correct relationship to make this work?
