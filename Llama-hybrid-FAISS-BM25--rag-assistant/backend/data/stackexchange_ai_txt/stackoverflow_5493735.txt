MimeMessage Content-Transfer-Encoding issue

Greetings all... I am hoping somebody can shed me some lights about the issue I am having. Reading the Javadoc of MimeMessage's getInputStream(), it says "Return a decoded input stream for this Message's content " However, this is not what I am experiencing. The output is not decoded. For instance, if I have a message a follows Date: Wed, 24 Feb 2010 11:29:13 +1100 From: xxxxxxxxx To: xxxxxxxxxxxx Message-ID: Subject: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="------------000801030004000206000901" Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Organization: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx User-Agent: Thunderbird 2.0.0.23 (Windows/20090812) This is a multi-part message in MIME format. --------------000801030004000206000901 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3DISO-8859-1; format=3Dflowed Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit ! --------------000801030004000206000901 Content-Type: text/plain; name=3D"bla.bla" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit Content-Disposition: inline; filename=3D"bla.bla" my.username =3D holly my.host =3D molly --------------000801030004000206000901-- Then, assuming that I have an object called 'm' constructed with the above content, then calling m.getInputStream() and dump the output to the screen shows those '=3D' charsets. What did I do wrong? If I used QPDecoderStream to decode the output of m.getInputStream() then of course the result will be correct. However, it defeat the purpose, because the Javadoc says getInputStream() returns a decoded input stream.
