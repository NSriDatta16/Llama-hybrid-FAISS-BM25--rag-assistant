You could use a combination of local logging, and you could sync the logs to a centeral database at successful log off. It depends on what kind of logging you want to do and how your application is running. If the application doing the logging is a client side application, then if you write to the event logs it may not be helpful. If you do want to write to the event logs, it's fairly straight forward: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307024 One more thing, if you are looking for a location that you know the user has access to for sure, you can use isolated storage, but the fact that you were trying to write to a shared folder makes me thing that you want one central location for your logs, in which case a DB is probably your best bet, and my top suggestion may be best for you.
