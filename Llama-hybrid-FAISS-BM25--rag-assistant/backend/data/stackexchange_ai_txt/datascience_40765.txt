These algorithms mostly are in classification such as SVM or using the result of clustering, and some learning method such as reinforcement learning. Although the nature of the ML is learning and finally you should predict something, it is not that all as you found. Some algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms exist in ML that are used to optimization problems and finally give you the optimization points of a target function which predict something in the middle of the algorithm, but finally give you the optimization points and there is not any predict on their final results (in contract with classifications and learning algorithms).
