Here's an example of the following. You can do this without any plugins as long as you cover a few specifics. First, let's set our draggable and droppable elements with absolute positioning: .draggable, .droppable { position:absolute; } .draggable { z-index:51; } .droppable { z-index:50; } Then, let's set up our images and disable the default drag behavior: Now we just need handlers for mousedown on a draggable element: var curDrag; $(document).bind('mousedown', function (e) { if ($(e.target).hasClass('draggable')) { curDrag = e.target; } }); Which stores the currently dragged object in a global variable, and now we'll add a handler for a mouseup event on the droppable image: $(document).bind('mouseup', function (e) { if (curDrag && $(e.target).hasClass('droppable')) { $(curDrag).css({ 'left': e.pageX, 'top' : e.pageY }); curDrag = null; } }); So that we'll only move the dragged image if we mouseup over the draggable area. This isn't cross-browser compatible, as you'd need to implement clientX and clientY for IE, but I'll let you figure out how to do that. Try dragging the beach ball around yourself.
