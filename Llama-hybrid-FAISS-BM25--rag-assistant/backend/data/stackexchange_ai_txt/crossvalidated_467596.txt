Treating responses as nominal. Treating your Likert scale of responses 1 though 8 as categorical data: at the 5% level of significance, a chi-squared test marginally rejects (P-value 0.048) the null hypothesis that responses for 'mit' and 'ohne' have the same distributions of Likert values. ohne = c(9,11,16,11,13,13,13,10) mit = c(5 ,6, 5,12,12,27,18,11) TBL = rbind(ohne, mit) out = chisq.test(TBL); out Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TBL X-squared = 14.213, df = 7, p-value = 0.04752 round(out$resi, 3) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] ohne 0.756 0.857 1.697 -0.147 0.141 -1.565 -0.635 -0.154 mit -0.756 -0.857 -1.697 0.147 -0.141 1.565 0.635 0.154 The largest Pearson residual $1.565$ points to Likert category 6, with more observed responses $27$ for 'mit' than would be expected if Likert scores were independent of whether or not your 'procedure' is used. The chi-squared statistic $14.2$ is the sum of $2(8)=16$ contributions $C_{ij}=\frac{(X_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}},$ where $X_{ij}$ are observed counts and $E_{ij}$ are expected counts based on the null hypothesis. Pearson residuals are signed square roots of the $C_{ij}.$ [The Fisher exact test for TBL in R simulates a P-value. I did not run this test. But you have enough data for a valid chi-squared test.] Treating responses as interval data. You suggest treating Likert scores as interval data. There is considerable controversy whether this is a valid assumptions. However, taking the data to be interval data, with sample sizes as large as 96, it seems OK to use a 2-sample Welch t test. x = rep(1:8, ohne) y = rep(1:8, mit) t.test(x,y) Welch Two Sample t-test data: x and y t = -2.7712, df = 186.92, p-value = 0.00615 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -1.4087369 -0.2370964 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 4.552083 5.375000 The average Likert score $(\bar Y = 5.375)$ for 'mit' respondents is significantly higher than the average score $(\bar X = 4.552)$ at the 1% level of significance. [The Welch test does not assume population variances to be equal.] Note: Once assuming Likert scores as interval, the justification for doing a t test with such data is that sample means of $n = 96$ observation are nearly normally distributed---even though the scores 1 through 8 are not. For example: Re-sampling with replacement groups of 96 scores from among mit shows that sample averages are roughly normal. set.seed(520) a = replicate(10^4, mean(sample(mit, 96, rep=T))) hist(a, prob=T, col="skyblue2", ylim=c(0,.6)) curve(dnorm(x, mean(a), sd(a)), add=T, col="red")
