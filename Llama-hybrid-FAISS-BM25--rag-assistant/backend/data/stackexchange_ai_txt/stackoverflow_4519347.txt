The java.util.pref.Preferences class, which was added in Java 1.4 is used to store and get persistent (remains on disk between program executions) hierarchical name/values pairs.These preferences are stored in an operating system dependent manner, e.g in the Windows registry or a Mac preferences file. So by using Preferences API, same thing is going to happen file I/O etc which you are doing already but will be in a better-manageable way. Instead, if possible you can try using Map, accessed by respective methods for insertion/retrieval of user state through a singleton class.
