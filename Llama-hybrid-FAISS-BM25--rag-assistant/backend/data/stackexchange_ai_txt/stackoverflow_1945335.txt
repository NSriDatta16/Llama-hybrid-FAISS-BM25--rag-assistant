Show mousepoint while doing drag and drop in WPF

I am using Lesters DragAndDropManager to get the drag and drop function in my application and i really like the way it's implemented, but I have one small problem and that is that I want to show the mouse cordination during the drag in my statusbar, so how do I send the mouseposition from the DropManager to my xaml code. I have tried to add a dependencyproperty in the manager that I can bind to in the xaml-code. public static readonly DependencyProperty MousePointProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached("MousePoint", typeof(Point), typeof(DragDropBehavior), new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(default(Point))); public static void SetMousePoint(DependencyObject depObj, bool isSet) { depObj.SetValue(MousePointProperty, isSet); } public static IDragSourceAdvisor GetMousePoint(DependencyObject depObj) { return depObj.GetValue(MousePointProperty) as IDragSourceAdvisor; } And in the Xaml I bind to it like this. But how do I set the mousecordintation to my dependecyproperty in the manager? private static void DropTarget_PreviewDragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { if (UpdateEffects(sender, e) == false) return; //-- Update position of the preview Adorner Point position = GetMousePosition(sender as UIElement); //-- Here I Want to do this, but that not posible because the SetMousePoint takes a dependencyObject and not my value. //-- SetMousePoint(position); _draggedUIElementAdorner.Left = position.X - _offsetPoint.X; _draggedUIElementAdorner.Top = position.Y - _offsetPoint.Y; e.Handled = true; } I think I am wrong here, but I have get stuck on how to get the mousecordination to the xaml-code by binding to the DragAndDropManager. Thanks.
