wantto learn something new, help me decide..zend, python, ruby or?

I have been coding procedural php for a while and I feel I got a pretty good hang of it. I feel like learning something new. Any ideas on what is good/hot to know? I have read some about zend mvc and it seems interesting, but im not sure.. I feel like procedural php is so unorganized and hard to debug when the project grows big. help me out thanks
