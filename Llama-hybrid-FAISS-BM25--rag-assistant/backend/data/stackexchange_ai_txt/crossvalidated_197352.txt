I can't find the quote but I read somewhere that: using Bayes Theorem doesn't make you a Bayesian, using Bayes Theorem for everything does. Bayes Theorem is used by frequentists all the time. See the examples at the Bayes Theorem Wikipedia page . Scroll down to the Interpretation section and you'll notice that there is a Bayesian Interpretation and a Frequentist Interpretation section. Contrast this with Bayesian Inference . So yes, a frequentist can use Bayes Theorem. Bayesian inference views probabilities and uncertainty differently than frequentist inference, and Bayes Theorem is sort of the universal engine used in that inference.
