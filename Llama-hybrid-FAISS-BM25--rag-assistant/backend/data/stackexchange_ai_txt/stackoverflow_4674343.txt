ASP.NET MVC Routing Via Method Attributes GET vs. POST

In my ASP.NET MVC application, I want to use this ASP.NET MVC Attribute Based Route Mapper, first announced here . I am trying to do a RESTful API using this, and I don't understand how to differentiate from Get vs. post. The GET is found, but when I try to POST, the route doesn't map, and I get a 404. Please advise. See Code: [HttpGet] [Url("organizations/{organizationId?}/alerts/", Order = 1)] public JsonResult List(Guid? organizationId) { ... return Json(data, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet); } [HttpPost] [Url("organizations/{organizationId?}/alerts/", Order = 2)] public JsonResult Send(Guid? organizationId, string message) { ... return Json(data, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet); }
