There is no reliable way to do mass email broadcasting from .net without some intermediary. What I mean by this is that the emails must be queued in your database or other persisted storage. Then, you need another app (console, service, whatever) that is responsible for monitoring the queue and acting on the broadcast requests. Second, do not send them straight from your code. Instead, send the emails to a local mail server under your control for rebroadcasting to the actual recipient. The shear number of spam detection mechanisms (like grey-listing) means that you will spend an inordinate amount of time doing things sending the message, getting a grey-list denial, waiting 15 minutes (or however long), then sending again to see it go through. The reason for queueing even if you are going through a real mail server is to keep from overloading your local mail server. Sending mail from .net is generally fine for those one offs, especially when all of the recipients are within your company. However, anytime you have to send them to the general public with any reliability then you need to "grow up" so to speak.
