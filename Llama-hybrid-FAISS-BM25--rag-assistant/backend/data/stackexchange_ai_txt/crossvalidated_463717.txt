What is the "standardized residuals" in GARCH(1,1) model with Student-$t$ innovations?

I'm using the dataset daxreturns , with the description of the data like: "This data set contains transformed standardized residuals of daily log returns of 15 major German stocks represented in the index DAX observed from January 2005 to August 2009. Each time series is filtered using a GARCH(1,1) model with Student $t$ innovations.". So I take a look at the data and it seems like the minimum value is positive. It seems to me that, the standardized residuals obtained from a GARCH(1,1) model with Student- $t$ innovations are always positive? Can someone help me to explain this idea?
