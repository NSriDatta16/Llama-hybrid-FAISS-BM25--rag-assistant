SMTPClient Half Working \ Half Not

I am using Microsoft's membership framework on a website. I am able to send password retrieval e-mails, but am unable to send e-mails myself using SMTPClient. When you configure the SMTP settings in the Web Site Administration Tool, what are the settings that this application give it's SMTPclient? If I know this, I can duplicate it and hopefully send e-mails. A few items I've ruled out. - I'm using port 25, (which is the only one allowed under medium trust). - This code works on my local system.
