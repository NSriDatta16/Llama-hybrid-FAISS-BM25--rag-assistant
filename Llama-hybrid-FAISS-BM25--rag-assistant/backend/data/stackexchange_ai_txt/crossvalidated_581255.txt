I was really intrigued by this, so I searched around a bit. There is a technical explanation related to estimation of small variances in mixed models. To answer your first and second questions, the model is reporting near-zero random intercept variance due to a very small, calculated between-ID variance. As explained here nlme will report near-zero values and lme4 will report precisely zero values when the model finds very small proportions of variance in the random intercept. You demonstrate that you do have non-zero variance among ID-clusters; however, recall that ICC can be defined as variance between clusters AND/OR average correlation within clusters. You only have three observations per ID and there does not seem to be clear differences in overall "levels" between clusters in this data. The deviations among clusters is likely being interpreted as less meaningful/systematic due to the small within-cluster sample as explained here . I would answer affirmatively to your third question. If I run the following (or without random slopes for wave), the model gives interpretable estimates. empty_means On a side note, I would suggest including a meaningful 0 value for your wave variable. If you use wave = rep(0:2, 89) , you can interpret the fixed-model intercept as estimated value at the first wave.
