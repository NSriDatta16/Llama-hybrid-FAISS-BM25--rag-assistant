What you want is a 3d-Space-Filling-Curve for example a hilbert-curve. That is a spatial index over 3 ccordinate. It is comparable to a octree. You want to store the object in that octree and do a depth-firat search on the coordinate you have recorded with your iphone as fixed coordinate probably the center of the screen. A octree subdivde the space continously in eigth directions and a 3d-Space-Filling-Curve is an hamiltonian path through the space which is like a fracta but it is clearly distinctable from the region of the octree. I use 2d-hilbert-curve to speed search in geospatial databases. Maybe you want to start with this first?
