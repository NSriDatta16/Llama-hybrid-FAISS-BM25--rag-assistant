Sounds like you're a candidate for Support Vector Machines . Go get libsvm . Read "A practical guide to SVM classification", which they distribute, and is short. Basically, you're going to take your events, and format them like: dv1 1:iv1_1 2:iv1_2 3:iv1_3 4:iv1_4 ... dv2 1:iv2_1 2:iv2_2 3:iv2_3 4:iv2_4 ... run it through their svm-scale utility, and then use their grid.py script to search for appropriate kernel parameters. The learning algorithm should be able to figure out differing importance of variables, though you might be able to weight things as well. If you think time will be useful, just add time as another independent variable (feature) for the training algorithm to use. If libsvm can't quite get the accuracy you'd like, consider stepping up to SVMlight . Only ever so slightly harder to deal with, and a lot more options. Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning is probably the first textbook to look to for details on what libsvm and SVMlight are actually doing with your data.
