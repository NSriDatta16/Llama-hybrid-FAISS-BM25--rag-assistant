Thanks to @Xi'an for the confirmation. The authors are saying that when $$ P(T(y^{\text{rep}}) > T(y) \mid y) = P(T(y^{\text{rep}}) > T(y) \mid \theta, y) $$ then the reasoning of the CDF transformation mentioned above implies that these are uniformly distributed on the unit interval. I was planning on asking about the next paragraph as well, but I think I understand it now. More generally, when posterior uncertainty in $\theta$ propagates to the distribution of $T(y \mid \theta)$ , the distribution of the p-value is more likely to be near $.5$ than near $0$ or $1$ . (To be more precise, the sampling distribution of the p-value has been shown to be 'stochastically less variable' than uniform.) Perhaps by "stochastically less variable" they mean convex-ordered. If this is the case, it's straightforward to show, using Jensen's inequality, that conditional probabilities are convex-ordered when one conditions on less than the other.
