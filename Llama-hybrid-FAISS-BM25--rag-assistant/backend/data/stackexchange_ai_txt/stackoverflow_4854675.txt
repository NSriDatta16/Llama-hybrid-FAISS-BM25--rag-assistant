An elegant solution would be to define a View Model common to all pages. You should always bind to properties of the view model and should avoid binding to UI Elements. Using a view model you can always access all neccessary values and define several presentations in different pages. I've read something about pages having their own object space, so that UI elements can have the same name in different pages. Also it can happen that the first page isn't available after loading the second one. The binding target would then be unavailable.
