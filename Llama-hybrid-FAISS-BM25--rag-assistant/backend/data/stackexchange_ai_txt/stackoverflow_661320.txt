How to add native library to "java.library.path" with Eclipse launch (instead of overriding it)

I got a native library that needs to be added to java.library.path . With JVM argument -Djava.library.path=path... I can set the path as I want. My problem is that my other library (pentaho reporting) searches fonts based on the default java.library.path (including system directories etc) and the manual setting overrides the default path.. So : how can I add a path entry to the default java.library.path instead of overriding it (which seems to be done with -Djava.library.path)? (I wouldn't want to add the default path by hand, which wouldn't be nice for the sake of deployment) EDIT: Sorry for missing details; I'm working with Eclipse. (The deployment is done with JNLP and there I can use nativelib under resources )
