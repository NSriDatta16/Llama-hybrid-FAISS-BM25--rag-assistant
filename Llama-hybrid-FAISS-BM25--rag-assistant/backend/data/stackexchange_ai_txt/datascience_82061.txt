Text classification using deep learning with removing name, place address etc

I want to prepare a deep learning model for text classification(Document classification), But in my training content many place have name, address, brand name, etc.. which will do confuse to model as deep learning is work with sequence of words, I was thinking if we will train model by removing these details, but in predict content when we get name, address, brand name then it also confuse... Can someone give the idea how i handle this situation in deep learning? And which deep learning algorithm and library should use for best accuracy and speed for text classification.
