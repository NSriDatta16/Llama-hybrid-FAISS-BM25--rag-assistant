Visual Studio: How to reference assemblies in Visual Studio?

i have a debug and a release version of an assembly dll. They are sitting is directories on my computer. For other developers they are sitting in directories on their computer. For the debug version of the application i want to use the debug assembly. For the release version of the application i want to use the release assembly. That's the question. For those not paying attention, there are quite a few issues here. How to reference an assembly on my computer, which after the project is checked into source control becomes a valid path on someone elses computer. How to have the "References" node be per solution type (Debug, Release). i tried copying the debug assembly to \bin\Debug and the release assembly to \bin\Release and added the assembly dll's to source control in the \bin\Debug \bin\Release folders. Then i hope that the assembly would be found in the executable's folder. Problem with that is that other developer's machines get an error that the assembly dlls could not be overwritten - when CopyLocal is false.
