Learning iPhone programming and Objective-C programming at the same time will be daunting. If you're serious about getting into this, I recommend you start by learning C on the command-line, then advance to Objective-C GUI apps on the desktop, then eventually move to the iPhone. If you want to short-cut the process, there are plenty of join-the-dots tutorials online and a whole bunch of iPhone programming books targeted at different levels of experience, but you'll need to be pretty tenacious; the online stuff is of extremely variable quality and there will be a lot of cursing and hair-pulling. I have almost 20 years of C and C++ under my belt, but I still lost a lot of sleep getting up to speed. Don't be discouraged, though; it is extremely gratifying to finally get something up on the app store and see people enjoying it.
