In C# , off of the top of my head: public bool lol(int minTrue, params bool[] bools) { return bools.Count( ( b ) => b ) >= minTrue; } should be pretty quick. A call would look like this: lol( 2, true, true, false ); This way, you are leaving the rules (two must be true) up to the caller, instead of embedding them in the method.
