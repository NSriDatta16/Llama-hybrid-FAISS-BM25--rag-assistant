How to correct underdispersion in logistic regression

I created a logistic regression model with four continuous variables and a binary outcome. I divided the residual deviance by the residual degrees of freedom, which equaled 0.63. From my understanding, underdispersion is supposed to be rare, and it essentially results in coefficients that are too conservative. This seems like less of a problem than overdispersion, which results in overconfidence. Does underdispersion need to be corrected?
