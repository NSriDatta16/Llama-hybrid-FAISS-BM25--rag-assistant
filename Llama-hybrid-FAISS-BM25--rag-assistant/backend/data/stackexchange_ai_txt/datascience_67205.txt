Which metric to use for classify a binary logistic regression

I still novice in machine learning. My problem is as follow : I use two binary logistic regression models for making comparaison. Additionally to LogLoss and accuracy, I would like to use for metric : precision / recall/ F1-mesure. I have used the formulat : print (classification_report(y_test, y_pred.round())) My question is: which one, for the tree metric value, should I used. is it the weighted average ore the parametres of the true values (number 1 in picture)
