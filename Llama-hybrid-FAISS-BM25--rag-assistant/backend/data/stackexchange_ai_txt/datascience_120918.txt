When we train a machine learning model, we give it a lot of data to learn from. If we give the data to the model in the same order every time, the model may end up memorizing that order instead of learning the general patterns in the data. This means that the model may be good at predicting things in that specific order, but not so good at predicting things in other orders or on new data. Shuffling the data means that we randomize the order in which the data is presented to the model during training. This helps the model to learn the general patterns in the data, rather than memorizing the specific order. This can improve the model's accuracy and ability to predict things on new data. So shuffling data is just a way to make sure that the model learns the general patterns in the data, and not just the order in which it was presented.
