Integrating a javascript object with jquery

I have this js object which I got from php through jason_encode(). This object has 2 objects, Name and Video. Then through a for loop I distribute the names into divs. My problem is I need to create a link in each div that would create a dialog that displays the video. I'm basing this idea from the jquery UI example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#photo-manager Specifically the view larger icon which I intend to have the same dialog except embedding a youtube video. Here is the code that gets the values from the jscript object and puts them in divs. for ( var i in BodyWeight ) { if(BodyWeight[i]['Color'] == 'Red') { $('#redboxes').append(' ' + BodyWeight[i]["ExerciseTitle"] + ' '); } else if(BodyWeight[i]['Color'] == 'Blue') { $('#blueboxes').append(' ' + BodyWeight[i]["ExerciseTitle"] + ' '); } } Then basically I would have a icons in each that should just have in it the data from ExerciseVideo. I just can't figure out how to connect both objects together. In the jquery example they image url is embedded in a href unfortunately I can't do the same for a video.
