How CNN reduces number of feature maps/ number of classes?

How does the CNN reduce numbers of feature maps or shall we say classes? I have looked into some literature where they have this in their methodology: Encoding part: Convolve using ReLU x 2feature Convolve using ReLU Max pooling. Reduce image size by a factor of two. Repeated for about 5 times Decoding part: Upscaling. Increase image size by two Convolve using ReLU. Reduce number of feature maps by four. Convolve using ReLU. Reduce the number of feature map or number of classes. From a certain amount down to three. My question is about number 6.
