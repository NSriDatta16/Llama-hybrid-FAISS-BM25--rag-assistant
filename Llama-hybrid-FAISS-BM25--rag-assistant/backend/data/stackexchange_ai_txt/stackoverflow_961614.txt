How to use escape character in replace function when replacing semi-colon in VB

Okay so I was helped earlier with my program question and found out that """" is how you make " become another variable in the function: Robert = Replace(Robert.ToLower, """", "A") So now I am also trying to work with other keys like the semi-colon. I put it in the function like this: Robert = Replace(Robert.ToLower, "char(59)", "B") I also tried to insert ; in place of char(59) with \ in front of it as an escape key, none of this worked. It still just gives me a ; when I type a ;. Can someone please help me with this? Thanks!
