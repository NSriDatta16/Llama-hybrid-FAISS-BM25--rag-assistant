We use different ant targets for different environments. The way we do it may be a bit inelegant but it works. We will just tell certain ant targets to filter out different resource files (which is how you could exclude certain beans from being loaded), load different database properties, and load different seed data into the database. We don't really have an ant 'expert' running around but we're able to run our builds with different configurations from a single command.
