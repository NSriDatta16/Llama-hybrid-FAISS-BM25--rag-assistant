Ideally, the covariates used for matching should be measured contemporaneously for both treatment and control groups, before the treatment has started, but as close to the start as possible. If the covariates used for matching make the treatment assignment ignorable (loosely speaking, the treatment group and control groups are similar to each other on average EXCEPT for the treatment), making sure you match just before the treatment administration would ensure nothing else changed in the interim and the two groups were comparable, on average, at the time of treatment administration.
