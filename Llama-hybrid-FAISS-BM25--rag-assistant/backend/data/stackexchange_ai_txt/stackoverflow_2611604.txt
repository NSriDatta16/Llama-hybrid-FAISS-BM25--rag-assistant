Why is an inverse loop faster than a normal loop (test included)

I have been running some small tests in PHP on loops. I do not know if my method is good. I have found that a inverse loop is faster than a normal loop. I have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop. Setup "; $xstart = microtime(true); for($x=$counter; $x>0; $x--){ echo ''; } $xend = microtime(true); echo "inverse for: " . ($xend - $xstart) . " "; echo " normal - inverse: " . (($wend - $wstart) - ($xend - $xstart)) . " "; $ystart = microtime(true); $y=0; while($y "; $zstart = microtime(true); $z=$counter; while($z>0){ echo ''; $z--; } $zend = microtime(true); echo "inverse while: " . ($zend - $zstart) . " "; echo " normal - inverse: " . (($yend - $ystart) - ($zend - $zstart)) . " "; echo " inverse for - inverse while: " . (($xend - $xstart) - ($zend - $zstart)) . " "; ?> Average Results The difference in for-loop normal for: 1.0908501148224 inverse for: 1.0212800502777 normal - inverse: 0.069570064544678 The difference in while-loop normal while: 1.0395669937134 inverse while: 0.99321985244751 normal - inverse: 0.046347141265869 The difference in for-loop and while-loop inverse for - inverse while: 0.0280601978302 Questions My question is can someone explain these differences in results? And is my method of benchmarking been correct?
