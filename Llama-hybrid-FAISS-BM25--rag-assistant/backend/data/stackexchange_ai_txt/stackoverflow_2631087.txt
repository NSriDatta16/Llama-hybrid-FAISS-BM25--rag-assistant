How to synchronize HTML5 local/webStorage and server-side storage?

Possible Duplicate: Best way to synchronize local HTML5 DB (WebSQL Storage, SQLite) with a server (2 way sync) I'm currently seeking solutions for transparently and automatically synchronizing and replicating across the client-side HTML5 localStorage or web storage and (maybe multiple) server-side storage(s) (the only requirement here that it should be simple and affordable to install on a regular hosting service). So do you have any experience with such libraries/technologies that offer data storage which automate the client-server storage synchronization and allow data to be available either offline or online or both? I think this is a fairly common scenario of web applications supporting offline mode...
