I would not say that there are computer languages "more powerful", just languages more suited for your specific problem domain. That said, PHP is a language that evolved from a hack and tailored for a very specific problem domain; this shows up in several places, like for example inconsistent parameter order across database interfaces. IMHO PHP community has made some very sad decisions for new syntax enhancements over the time. IMHO Python is much more general, well designed and elegant, but your question is one that usually starts flamewars.
