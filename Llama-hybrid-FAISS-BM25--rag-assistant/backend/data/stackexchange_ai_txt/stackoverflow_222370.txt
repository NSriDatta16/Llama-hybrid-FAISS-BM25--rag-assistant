Option Strict On and .NET for VB6 programmers

I'm preparing a class on Visual Basic 2005 targeting Visual Basic 6 programmers migrating to the .NET platform. I would like a word of advice about whether to recommend them to always enable Option Strict or not. I've worked exclusively with C-style programming languages, mostly Java and C#, so for me explicit casting is something I always expect I have to do, since it's never been an option. However I recognize the value of working with a language that has built-in support for late-binding , because not having to be excessively explicit about types in the code indeed saves time. This is further proved by the popular diffusion of dynamic typed languages , even on the .NET platform with the Dynamic Language Runtime. With this in mind, should someone who is approaching .NET for the first time using VB.NET and with a VB6 background be encouraged to get into the mindset of having to work with compile-time type checking because that's the "best practice" in the CLR? Or is it "OK" to continue enjoying the benefits of late-binding?
