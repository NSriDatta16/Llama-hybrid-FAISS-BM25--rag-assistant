Marginal means confidence interval

Let's say that I have 4 groups and I want to report whether there are significant differences between them in terms of a measured variable. Each group has different numbers of male/female and different numbers of subjects with age 67 G1 .... G4 Sex Age Variable measured Sex Age Variable measured M 67 3 F >67 1 ... ... F >67 3 M To compute the adjusted means I compute for each group the means of the subgroups Male >67 years Male 67 years Female and then I average these means. How do I compute the 95% confidence intervals? How do I see whether the means computed in such a way are significantly different? I cannot use ANOVA because the data do not respect the assumptions.
