In my opinion its depend of the settted attribure and tyle of collection, if the collection is a Set and the attribute have infulance on the method equal or hascode then definitely i will set this property before this refer also to sorterd list etc. in other cases this is irrelevant. But for this exapmle where object is created i will first set the atributes than add to collection because the code is better organized.
