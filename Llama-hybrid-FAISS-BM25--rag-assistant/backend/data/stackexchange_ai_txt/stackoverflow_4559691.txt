In pretty much any scripting language, a variable will always take up more memory than its actual contents would suggest. An INT might be 32 or 64bits, suggesting it would require 4 or 8 bytes of memory, but it will take up 16 or 32bytes (pulling numbers out of my hat), because the language interpreter has to attach various metadata to that value along the way. The database might only require 200megabytes of raw storage space, but once you factor in the metadata, it will definitely occupy much much more.
