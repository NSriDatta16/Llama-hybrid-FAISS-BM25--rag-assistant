Indexes are useless when You perform full scans without ORDER BY . Oracle index organized table,Postgresl cluster table, MySQL (InnoDB) PRIMARY KEY clustered index: give big performance for ORDER BY. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-index-types.html "Are Indexed a big overhead while inserting if the Database is most likely to be used as above ?" If index fit into RAM everything is ok.
