Some comments: Say in December, 200 of those 1000 students tell us they are definitely not coming. That leaves 800 students remaining who still may come. Surely that 800 remaining pool now has a different probability of coming from the 20% rate that applied to the entire 1000 pool. How do I incorporate the information that 200 of 1000 students have definitely told us they are not coming into the probabilities of the remaining 800 students? No modification should be necessary. The logistic regression model gives individual attendance probabilities for each of those 1000 students. That some of them (unknown probably to the others) say they will definitely not come should not influence probabilities for others. Imagine that in January 100 of the remaining 800 students call us and say, "We are almost definitely coming." How do I reflect that positive attendance signal for those 100 students? Use historical data about students calling in January saying they will definitely come. How many of then did appear? Imagine that in February 200 other of the remaining 800 students don't bother even checking their admission status online, which is a signal that they are very unlikely to come. How do I incorporate that negative signal into my model? Same as former point, use historical data. And, if you don't have them, plan to record them for the future!
