This does seem to be a problem peculiar to the Windows Script Host's DropHandler shell extension . Whereas: test.vbs "C:\포미닛.txt" C:\WINDOWS\System32\WScript.exe "test.vbs" "C:\포미닛.txt" both work when typed from the console (even if the console can't render the Hangul so it looks like ? ), a drag and drop operation that should result in the same command goes through a Unicode->ANSI->Unicode translation that loses all characters that aren't in the current ANSI code page. (So 포미닛 will work on a default Korean Windows install but not Western.) I'm not aware of a proper way to fix the problem. You could perhaps work around it by changing the DropHandler for .vbs files in the registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VBSFile\ShellEx\DropHandler\(Default) from the WSH DropHandler ( {60254CA5-953B-11CF-8C96-00AA00B8708C} ) to {86C86720-42A0-1069-A2E8-08002B30309D} , the one used for .exe, .bat and similar, which doesn't suffer from this issue. You would also probably have to change the file association for .vbs to put quotes around the filename argument too, since the EXE DropHandler doesn't, to avoid problems with spaces in filenames. Since this affects argument-passing for all VBS files it would be a perilous fix to deploy on any machine but your own. If you needed to do that, maybe you could try creating a new file extension with the appropriate DropTarget rather than changing VBSFile itself? Or maybe forgo drop-onto-script behaviour and provide a file Open dialog or manual drop field instead.
