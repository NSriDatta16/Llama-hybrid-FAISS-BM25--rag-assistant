Files contain whatever the application that created them chose to place in them. Files are essentially a sequence of bytes. Any further organisation is a semantic distinction made by the program that created them. It is untrue to think of all files containing the same structure. That said, certain data storage problems are similar enough to be solved in similar ways, and patterns start to emerge. Splitting data into records or packets is an example of that.
