I prefer using Magento objects, as I can reuse that script later when the database layout changes. Also, it's much easier not having to deal with looking up column IDs beforehand. Data Flow will not accomplish what you are looking for AFAIK, as it doesn't support linking the simple products to the configurable ones.
