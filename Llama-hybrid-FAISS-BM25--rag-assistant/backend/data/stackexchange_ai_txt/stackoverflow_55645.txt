The Chromium.org team listed several options for accelerating the build (at this point about half-way down the page): In decreasing order of speedup: Install Microsoft hotfix 935225 . Install Microsoft hotfix 947315 . Use a true multicore processor (ie. an Intel Core Duo 2; not a Pentium 4 HT). Use 3 parallel builds. In Visual Studio 2005, you will find the option in Tools > Options... > Projects and Solutions > Build and Run > maximum number of parallel project builds . Disable your anti-virus software for .ilk, .pdb, .cc, .h files and only check for viruses on modify . Disable scanning the directory where your sources reside. Don't do anything stupid. Store and build the Chromium code on a second hard drive. It won't really speed up the build but at least your computer will stay responsive when you do gclient sync or a build. Defragment your hard drive regularly. Disable virtual memory.
