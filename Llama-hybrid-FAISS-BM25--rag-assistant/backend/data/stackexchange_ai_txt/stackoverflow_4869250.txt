mootools Resizable from left, not right

The mootools function makeResizable allows you to specify a handle, which means I can set a handle to the left of the element I want to resize. But the drag operation only allows to pull from the right to the left, not left to right. Is there a way I can modify the function to let me do so? I'd like to be able to use a handle on the left and right of my element. Edit: Also, I have set a resizable for another element for vertical resizing. And the logic seems to be inversed. I have to scroll up to max the element smaller. Why would this be? Absolute position on the element is set to bottom:0; left:0; (inside a relative container)
