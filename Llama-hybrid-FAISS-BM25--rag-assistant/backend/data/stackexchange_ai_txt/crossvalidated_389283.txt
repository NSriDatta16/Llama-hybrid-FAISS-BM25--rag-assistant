Each value of your $N$ variables defines a point in an $N$ dimensional space. This cloud of points is often ellipsoid-like (if it is not, then you should not consider the variables as linearly related and the correlation does not mean much). The axis of the ellipsoid correspond to the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix, and their "strength" to their eigenvalues. The proof can be found in any time series analysis textbook that covers Principal Component Analysis. The loose intuition of why PCA or other eigenvalue-based methods matter is that you have some process that has some "main" causes, and the rest is "noise". If we make the ansatz that the noise is loosely equal in every dimension (because we might not know anything about it we assume it is not particularly directed).
