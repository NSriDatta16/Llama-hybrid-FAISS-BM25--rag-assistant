Neither test is going to be very reliable no matter how you choose the lag length. Both tests combine time series unit root test statistics, whose null distributions are derived under the assumption that $T\to\infty$. While that assumption is, of course, never literally satisfied, $T=6$ is going to give you time series test statstics, and hence panel statistics, whose properties are anybody's guess. For example, Maddala and Wu's test sums up $-\ln(p_i)$ over $i$, where $p_i$ are the $p$-values of time series unit root test statistics like that of Dickey-Fuller's, and where the $p$-values are typically computed from asymptotic null distributions. (There are so-called response surface regressions that try to come up with better approximations to finite-sample distributions, but whether these are implemented in Stata, and if so, if these are reliable for $T$ so small is something I would not dare to say.)
