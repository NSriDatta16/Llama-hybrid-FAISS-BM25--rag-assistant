Use a proper class for your objects; base R has ts which has a lag() function to operate on. Note that these ts objects came from a time when 'delta' or 'frequency' where constant: monthly or quarterly data as in macroeconomic series. For irregular data such as (business-)daily, use the zoo or xts packages which can also deal (very well!) with lags. To go further from there, you can use packages like dynlm or dlm allow for dynamic regression models with lags. The Task Views on Time Series, Econometrics, Finance all have further pointers.
