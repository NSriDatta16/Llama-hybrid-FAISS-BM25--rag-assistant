Running maven goal in multiple lifecycles

I have a case where I want to run the cobertura plugin in both the verify phase and the reporting phase. I have two profiles and they should both be running the cobertura plugin, but in profile A, I only want to create the xml/html output, but in profile B, I will be generating full site documentation that includes these results. I have cobertura configured as a plugin that runs as part of the verify phase, but if I do that, even if I run mvn verify site, the cobertura report does not appear in the site documentation. It seems as though I need to have it listed in both the plugins and the reporting section (since I won't be running site in profile A, it won't get called in that profile if I only have it in the plugins). So far the plugins section of my POM includes: org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 2.2 com/somepkg/** xml html verify cobertura I don't want to copy this into the reporting section too since this is a lot to duplicate. Is there a good way to accomplish this otherwise? Thanks, Jeff
