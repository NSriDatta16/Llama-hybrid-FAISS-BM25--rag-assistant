The equation $$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i $$ is what is termed as the true model. This equation says that the relation between the variable $x$ and the variable $y$ can be explained by a line $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$. However, since observed values are never going to follow that exact equation (due to errors), an additional $\epsilon_i$ error term is added to indicate errors. The errors can be interpreted as natural deviations away from the relationship of $x$ and $y$. Below I show two pairs of $x$ and $y$ (the black dots are data). In general one can see that as $x$ increases $y$ increases. For both of the pairs, the true equation is $$y_i = 4 + 3x_i + \epsilon_i $$ but the two plots have different errors. The plot on the left has large errors and the plot on the right small errors(because the points are tighter). (I know the true equation because I generated the data on my own. In general, you never know the true equation) Lets look at the plot on the left. The true $\beta_0 = 4$ and the true $\beta_1$ = 3. But in practice when given data, we don't know the truth. So we estimate the truth. We estimate $\beta_0$ with $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\beta_1$ with $\hat{\beta}_1$. Depending on which statistical methods are used, the estimates can be very different. In the regression setting, the estimates are obtained via a method called Ordinary Least Squares. This is also know as the method of line of best fit. Basically, you need to draw the line that best fits the data. I am not discussing formulas here, but using the formula for OLS, you get $$\hat{\beta}_0 = 4.809 \quad \text{ and } \quad \hat{\beta}_1 = 2.889 $$ and the resulting line of best fit is, A simple example would be the relationship between heights of mothers and daughters. Let $x = $ height of mothers and $y$ = heights of daughters. Naturally, one would expect taller mothers to have taller daughters (due to genetic similarity). However, do you think one equation can summarize exactly the height of a mother and a daughter, so that if I know the height of the mother I will be able to predict the exact height of the daughter? No. On the other hand, one might be able to summarize the relationship with the help of an on an average statement. TL DR: $\beta$ is the population truth. It represents the unknown relationship between $y$ and $x$. Since we cannot always get all possible values of $y$ and $x$, we collect a sample from the population, and try and estimate $\beta$ using the data. $\hat{\beta}$ is our estimate. It is a function of the data. $\beta$ is not a function of the data, but the truth.
