Unions are useful when dealing with byte-level (low level) data. One of my recent usage was on IP address modeling which looks like below : // Composite structure for IP address storage union { // IPv4 @ 32-bit identifier // Padded 12-bytes for IPv6 compatibility union { struct { unsigned char _reserved[12]; unsigned char _IpBytes[4]; } _Raw; struct { unsigned char _reserved[12]; unsigned char _o1; unsigned char _o2; unsigned char _o3; unsigned char _o4; } _Octet; } _IPv4; // IPv6 @ 128-bit identifier // Next generation internet addressing union { struct { unsigned char _IpBytes[16]; } _Raw; struct { unsigned short _w1; unsigned short _w2; unsigned short _w3; unsigned short _w4; unsigned short _w5; unsigned short _w6; unsigned short _w7; unsigned short _w8; } _Word; } _IPv6; } _IP;
