Why would you not use Simultaneous Confidence Intervals

I have been reading Brad Efron's book Computer Age Statistical Inference . Section 20.1 talks about simultaneous confidence intervals. If I understand the idea, it basically means that if variable A has 95% coverage and variable B has 95% coverage then the probability $P(A \cap B) = .95^2 = .81$ . Methods like Scheffe's adjustment extend the intervals so that all variables together have 95% coverage. In other words, using the above example, $P(A \cap B) = .95$ . Now that I am aware of this idea I have the following questions: Why is it not standard practice in all modern regression problems? Are "regular confidence intervals", those which are not stretched out until they are simultaneous, mostly invalid? If A and B are colinear variables does that mean that you don't have to stretch their regular intervals out as much as you might if they were completely independent?
