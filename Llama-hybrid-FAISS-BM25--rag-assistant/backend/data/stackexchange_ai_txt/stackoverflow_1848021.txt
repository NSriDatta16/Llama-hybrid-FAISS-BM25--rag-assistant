Maybe look into using Sender Policy Framework . It might not be exactly what you are looking for but it might help. Briefly, the design intent of the SPF record is to allow a receiving MTA (Message Transfer Agent) to interrogate the Name Server of the domain which appears in the email (the sender) and determine if the originating IP of the mail (the source) is authorized to send mail for the sender's domain. Ripped from wikipedia: Sender Policy Framework (SPF), as defined in RFC 4408, is an e-mail validation system designed to prevent e-mail spam by addressing a common vulnerability, source address spoofing. SPF allows e-mail administrators the ability to specify which Internet hosts are allowed to send e-mail claiming to originate from that domain by creating a specific DNS SPF record in the public DNS record. Mail exchangers then use the DNS record to verify the sender's identity against the list published by the e-mail administrator.
