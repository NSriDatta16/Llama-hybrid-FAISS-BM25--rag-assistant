Keep track of trainings, datasets eetc

After searching quite some time for it on Google I could not find a sufficient software/toolbox that can manage trainings of neural networks. I thought of a program that combines visualization techniques without the need to write code as well as having the possibility to compare several trainings of neural networks and be able to store them easily. Does a program like this exist? Regards Lukas
