US numbers which are local start with an area code and some have special significance like 555 or 800 and are always the same number of digits in total. Some may be input as alpha text by the phone user similar to 800CALLNOW and you would not get an international call in that format. Regarding your project you would need to be an authorised and registered mobile network operating software engineer and using standard modules of code for a device or gathering statistics about calls and you would not generally need to have knowledge of the specifics you ask about as the filtering would be done in that module and all you need is the output to a variable as a parameter. The organization in the US requesting the work would need to supply you with a specification of any specific number formats that may be encountered and maybe a document from the national telecomms regulator assuming the work can be done outside the US at all. If they have not supplied the details or can not do that if asked then that part of the project can not be completed satisfactorily.
