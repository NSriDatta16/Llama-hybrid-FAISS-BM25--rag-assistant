Averaging errors over different forecast horizons makes no sense in my opinion. Suppose, you produced a set of dynamic forecasts $\hat y(t+h|I_t)$ where $t$ is the last actual observation used for a forecast, $I_t$ - information set and $h$ is the forecast horizon. In this case, especially for ARIMA type of the model, the error variance depends on the time horizon $$Var[\hat y(t+h_1|I_t)-y(t+h_1)]\ne Var[\hat y(t+h_2|I_t)-y(t+h_2)]$$ Thus, I think you need to study and present MSE as a curve over the forecast horizons $h$ : $$MSE(h)=1/T\sum_t[\hat y(t+h|I_t)-y(t+h)]^2$$ You may be better at forecasting long horizons rather than short ones, for instance. The procedure can be visualized as a table with rows representing $t$ - the last actual used for a forecast, and columns representing $t+h$ - the time period for which forecast is produced. In this case the forecast horizons $h$ are diagonals of the upper triagonal matrix. You average along these diagonals. You'll have as many MSE(h) as you have diagonals.
