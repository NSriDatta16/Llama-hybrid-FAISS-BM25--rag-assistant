What is momentum-like training aid technique for reinforcement learning (Q learning)?

Is there any method that could help a reinforcement learning (specifically Q learning) model converge? Can optimization strategy like momentum/Adam/RMSProp applied to Q learning to update Q-table value? $Q(S, A) ← (1-α)*Q(S,A) + α * [reward + γ * maxQ(S',a)]$
