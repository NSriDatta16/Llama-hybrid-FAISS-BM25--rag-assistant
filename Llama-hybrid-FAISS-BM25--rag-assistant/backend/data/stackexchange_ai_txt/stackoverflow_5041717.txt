Dirk With respect to the master / worker logic and the Java option. Nimble (see http://www.paremus.com/products/products_nimble.html ) with its OSGi Remote Services stack might provide an interesting / agile pure OSGi approach. You still have to decided on a specific distribution mechanism. But given that the USe Case is computationally heavy & data-lite, using the Essence RMI transport that ships with Nimble RSA with a simple front end load balancer function might work really well. An good approach to 'direct communication channel' - would be to leverage DDS - this a low latency Publication / Subscription peer to peer messaging standard - used in distributed command/control type environments. I think there is a bare-bones OSS project somewhere but we (Paremus) work with RTI in this area. Hope the above is of background interest.
