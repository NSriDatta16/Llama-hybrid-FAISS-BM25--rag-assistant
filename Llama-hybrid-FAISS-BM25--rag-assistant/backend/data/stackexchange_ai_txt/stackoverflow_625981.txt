Not sure if I understand your question correctly, but to drag a wpf window, all you need to type in the click event handler of a component on the form (or the form itsself) is: this.DragMove(); There is no need to implement the dragging functionality yourself. Update: small example: Create a window, place a button in it. Wire the MouseDown of the window and the Click of the button as: private void Window_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { this.DragMove(); } private void button1_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show("hey"); } Works perfectly, you can drag the window, and the button continues to work...
