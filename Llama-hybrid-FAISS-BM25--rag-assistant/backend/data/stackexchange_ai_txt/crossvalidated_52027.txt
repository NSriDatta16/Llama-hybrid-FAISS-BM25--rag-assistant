Skew in both directions and dealing with outliers

I have a lot of wonderfully messy data (got to love the social sciences), and realized that I was not fully prepared to bear its wrath. For the record, after reading some articles regarding ANOVA, I am extremely paranoid about violating its assumptions. So I am trying to do my best in cleaning the data. I have also, in instances where assumptions have been violated, also run a nonparametric counterpart to assess whether the results are similar. I'm not entirely sure whether this is an acceptable practice? Or, if so, how this can be reported in my results. A bit of background: my design is set up for a 2 x 5 mixed factorial (the between group is age - young/old - and the within groups factor is different forms of input methods). Questions: In looking at my data (especially preference data) for the conditions, most of the data is skewed. The problem is that most of the distributions are positively skewed, while one or two are negatively skewed. Not quite sure what to do with this? Everything I have read has suggested that ANOVA is not a viable option under this circumstance. And some have also suggested that nonparametric tests are also not very powerful in this case. What to do? I have had to transform my data to help with normality and variance issues, but still have outliers in some cases. (I have looked at the outliers and reasoned through their existence. Some people just performed very well/poorly or possibly were harsher raters than the average joe). I was just taking the extreme scores that fell above/below my threshold (defined below) and recoded them as one more (or less) the next most extreme score. My questions are: is it OK to recode outliers after the transformation? If so, what's the best way to do that, say, after a square root transformation (obviously making it one more or one less than the next most extreme score is not the way to go as with untransformed data)? Originally, I started identifying outliers (in addition to normality plots and boxplots) as +/- 2.24 SD from the mean. After doing some reading, I thing that discovering outliers using the median absolute deviation might be best for my distributions. Just to be clear, though, after finding the median of the deviations of the historical scores from the median for that condition, do you just multiply that by 3 and consider all scores greater than/less than that value an outlier? Sorry, these are probably basic questions. I appreciate any feedback/advice! Thank you! EDIT: My dependent variables are different. Most of them are continuous (performance in WPM, and also likert-type response scales). Another type of variable is error rates (percentages). EDIT #2: My design is 2 (between groups - age) x 5 (within groups - input method type). There are 25 people in each group (young/old) so there are 25 people in each cell in my design. It was counterbalanced for order effects. To be more specific, my dependent variables are: 1. Adjusted Words per Minute (this is an average for each person over 15 trials) for each of 5 input methods. Along these lines, I also captured 3 different error rates (also averaged over 15 trials for each person). 2. Subjective ratings for each of the input methods: satisfaction (using the System Usability Scale, typical in our field, which is continuous, a composite score derived from 10 questions), workload (using the NASA-Task Load Index, again, continuous), pre- and post-test preference (0-50 point scale), post-test perceptions of accuracy (same 0 - 50 point scale). Also the Attitudes Toward Computers Questionnaire to assess attitudes toward technology (composites). 3. Individual measures (which I plan to correlate to some of the preference/performance measures). Individual baseline measures are all continuous, either motor speed (finger tapping test), speech rate, cognitive tests (Digit Symbol Substitution, etc.). Also some anthropometric measurements (finger circumference, hand breadth, etc.). Many of those are just going to be descriptives about my sample.
