Hypothesis testing on cointegration vector

I am studying cointegration theory in time series using online resources. As per https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/16-2-ooiatdfglsurt.html DF-GLS test is implemented in the package urca can be used to test for cointegration, but the null hypothesis of this test is to check for unit root in zt=xt- \theta*yt. There are other R functions that provide the cointegrating vector (e.g., VECM function in tsDyn package, ca.jo function in urca package), but I could not find a way to do any hypothesis testing on the estimated cointegrating vector. To be specific, how do I test if this cointegrating vector (1, \theta) is equivalent to (1, -1) ? I found a related question here, but not specifically on hypothesis testing. Test for cointegration between two time series using Engleâ€“Granger two-step method Please advise.
