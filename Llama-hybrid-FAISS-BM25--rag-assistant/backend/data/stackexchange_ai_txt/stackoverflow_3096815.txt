http://katacasts.com/ has many good examples (in many different languages) of doing Code Katas which include heavy TDD. Just recently Kent Beck has put video's up at http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development (pay to watch) and I have yet to hear anything bad about them. Another one to note is James Shore has also put up many TDD videos for his "Let's Play TDD" series at http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/
