No. MAC addresses are not useful beyond the local network, so they're not available in the upper layers (eg. Application layer). Using Javascript to get the the address isn't exactly foolproof either, since it's incredibly easy for someone to manipulate. If you want to restrict the hosts that a user can access your site on, you'll need to use a method of storage persistence within the browser to store a key - something that uniquely identifies them. Some forums use this method to catch people attempting to bypass their bans. You should generate some kind of random key (or encrypt a string), store it on the server-side along with the user you want to identify, then give the user the key to be stored in a cookie/localStorage. Though, there is the obvious problem of a user clearing their cookies... Hopefully that gives you a bit of head-start.
