After doing some research (a lot of sites, and a book named "Cross-functional teams" By Glenn M. Parker), I came to the following conclusions: A team should be comprised of people who are collectively qualified to get the team's features "Done". This means, that each member is not expected to be able to perform every task required , but that every task required can be performed, in sufficient quality, by at least one member of the team. While the team(s) should be cross-functional , when there is more than one team, there should be also some form of functional department , whether official or otherwise, led by an expert in the field. The expert may be a member of one team, or not, but in any case all members who perform tasks of a certain function, should communicate and collaborate frequently enough with the expert, as a professional authority on how to do their job. In my example, this would mean that the DBA and Technical-Writer would both lead their respective professional forum or department (depending on the level of formality), they may each be a member of one team. Database and documentation work would be done by team members capable of doing the work, and doing so under the experts' supervision (professional authority). In this way specialists may exist in the organization, alongside with generalists, and what people who ride the middle between the two. And of course, in this method, the team is capable of completing all of the business-level tasks (features, user-stories) assigned to it, in a self-sufficient manner, which is what we wanted.
