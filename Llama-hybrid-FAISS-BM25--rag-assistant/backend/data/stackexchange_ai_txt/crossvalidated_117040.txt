Probabilistic interpretation from sigmoid functions

Why do we interpret the results of logistic regression as probabilities? Passing the output of any regression procedure through a sigmoid function results in a probabilistic interpretation with respect to classification. Why is that so? Given that the output is between 0 and 1, is it enough to interpret the results as probabilities?
