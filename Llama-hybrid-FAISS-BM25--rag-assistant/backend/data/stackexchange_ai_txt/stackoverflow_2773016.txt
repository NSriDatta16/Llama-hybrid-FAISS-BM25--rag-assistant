Ant and Maven are to two alternatives that are usually used. What is considered best will differ from project to project and also often developer to developer also. You several have other option like Gant and Gradle. My personl favorite is Gradle, since it uses Groovy syntax and offers the benefits of Maven without forcing you to do anything.
