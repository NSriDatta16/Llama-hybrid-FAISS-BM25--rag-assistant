The best I can think of for this situation is an associate array, stored as JSON. As I don't know where your data is coming from, I'm just going to pretend. $item['price'] = 123; $item['otherinfo'] = 'stuff'; $data[] = $item; // repeat for all data. foreach loop over it if you can Then, depending how you want to store the data (rewrite every time, append to the file, etc.. Info at w3schools.com for different ways to open a file): $json = json_encode( $data ); $file = fopen( 'storage.txt', 'w+' ); // opens and clears the file. probably not the best, see link above fwrite( $file, $json ); fclose( $file ); Then, when you want to load the data: $string = file_get_contents( 'storage.txt' ); $data = json_decode( $string ); Hope that gets you off to a good start.
