Since i didn't get any answer, I thought i would answer the question myself. I may be biased (this is the answer to my own question) but I think yes this is a good approach. The distance from 0 could be quantified e.g. with the mean absolute error to avoid giving too much weight to outliers with metrics such as the mean squared error. A non-parametric significant test to test if the distribution is significantly different from 0 can be implemented in R e.g. with the sr.loc.test function of the SpatialNP package. The variance of each sample can be quantified by looking at the radial distance from their centroids. To look if they are significantly different, one can do a non-parametric test of homogeneity of multivariate dispersion as implemented in the vegan package. First a distance matrix, also called a dissimilarity matrix, can be calculated with the Euclidian distance as metric with the function vegdist Second the multivariate dispersions can be computed with betadisper Third a pairwise permutation test can be carried out with the function permutest , which outcome indicates if the test is significant or not
