You cannot create a marker interface that will have meaning to the JVM, like the java.io.Serializable interface does. However you could create a marker interface that you check for in your own code using instanceof . However using marker interfaces in this manner is generally discourage now that we have annotations . Marking class methods and fields in various ways for later processing at compile time using the Annotation Processing Tool (apt) or at runtime using reflection is what annotations were created for. So rather than creating a marker interface and using it like so: class MyClass implements MyMarkerInterface { } You should probably create an annotation and use it like so: @MyAnnotation class MyClass { }
