You will probably like Learning With Kernels by Schölkopf and Smola. Most of Schölkopf's work is mathematically rigorous. That said, you are probably better off reading research papers instead of textbooks. Research papers contain full derivations and proofs of convergence, bounds on performance, etc. which are very often not included in textbooks. A good place to start is the Journal of Machine Learning , which is highly regarded and fully open access. I also recommend the proceedings of conferences like ICML , NIPS , COLT and IJCNN .
