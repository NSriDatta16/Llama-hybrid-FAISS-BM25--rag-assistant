How do I combine these examples?

First of all, I would like to apologize for posting this again. I am new to this forum. Also, I cannot ad comments on my first post of this question, or send private messages to users who commented, therefore I can't properly communicate with anybody who tries to help. What is the proper way for me to communicate with people who may comment on or answer this post? Again, I'm sorry to be repeating this question. With that out of the way, I move on. I am just now experimenting with Javascript, so my knowledge of it is small. I found a website that offers a guestbook tool ( http://www.bfnsoftware.com/index.php?eid=2013 ), and another that offers a star rating tool( addratings.com/ ). I would like to know what parts of the scripts to change and what to change them to in order for the result to be a star rating tool under each new guestbook post. By the way, I had to resort to scripts not hosted at my site because of file type restrictions at my web host. The guestbook code is in two parts. The first is the input form. This is it in it's basic form: :: Guestbook :: Name: Email Address: Website: Vote: 0 - Worst 1 2 3 4 5 - Average 6 7 8 9 10 - Best :: Message :: I am not using the "guestWebsite", "guestEmail" or "guestVote" fields of the form on my site. I was able to choose to let users enter html in the "guestMessage" textarea. This is part two of the guestbook code. I put it on the page that I would like the posts to parse on. document.write(" " + Title + " "); document.write(" "); for (nextE = 0; nextE '); document.write(' '); document.write(' Name: ' + GuestName[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' E-mail: ' + GuestEmail[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' Website: ' + GuestWebsite[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' Vote: ' + GuestVote[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' Date: ' + GuestDate[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' '); document.write(' '); document.write(' Message: ' + GuestMessage[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' '); } View Guestbook I have modified it like this: document.write(" " + Title + " "); for (nextE = 0; nextE Username: ' + GuestName[nextE] + ' '); document.write('Submission Date: ' + GuestDate[nextE] + ' '); document.write('Line Submission: ' + GuestMessage[nextE] + ' '); document.write(' '); } Next is the star rating script. Here is what I'm using: aR_BgColor=""; aR_FgColor=""; aR_url=location.href + ""; aR_title=document.title + ""; aR_StarType ='1'; document.write(' '); document.write(' '); The site explaned that if I wanted to use the code more than once on the same page, I could, but I would have to define a unique value to + "" part of aR_url=location.href + ""; like this: + "1" for each instance of the code, or all the results would be the same for each instance. So my question again is "What parts of the scripts do I need to change and what to change them to in order for the result to be a star rating tool under each new guestbook post?", Thanks in advance for any help I may get.
