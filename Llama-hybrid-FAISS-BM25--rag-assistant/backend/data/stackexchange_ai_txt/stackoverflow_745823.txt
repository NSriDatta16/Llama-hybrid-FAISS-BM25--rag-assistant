Are there success stories of OpenSource projects using Agile/Scrum methodologies?

Most succesful , and large open source projects seem to follow the Benevolent Dictator style organization. But I was wondering if there are any success stories with agile development in Open source. When refering to Open source I mean large net-community driven development, not established teams doing Open source under the same roof.
