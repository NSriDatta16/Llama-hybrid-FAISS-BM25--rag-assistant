XML is the closest thing you are going to get. Since each CMS has their own proprietary way of storing/presenting/managing data, coming up with a common solution for all of them would be a pretty big task. However, I believe most CMS have a basic XML format that can be leveraged, but you'll need to do some custom work if you want to port from one CMS to another.
