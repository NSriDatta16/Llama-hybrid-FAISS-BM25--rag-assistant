You would probably use a confidence interval, since it is narrower and more conservative. Inverting null hypothesis significance testing to "confirm a null hypothesis" has innumerable practical and theoretical problems. Case in point, it's hard (impossible?) to state the actual "level" or "power" of the test, whatever you are actually testing, and one can easily liken a prediction interval to an "extra wide" confidence interval. Add to that: those points are not predictions, you have observed them, and you're interested in whether the mean response would be within a consistent range as that describes the data generating mechanism. But as pragmatic tool, I see it better to verge on the side of more false positives rather than more false negatives.
