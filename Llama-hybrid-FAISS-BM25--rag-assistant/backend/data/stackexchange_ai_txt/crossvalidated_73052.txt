Single sample versus multiple sample

I have a jar with white and black balls. Total number of balls in the jar is 100000. I want to estimate the proportion of white balls. My constraint is that the sample size for estimation should be low, lets assume 500 balls. I am debating between two approaches. Draw a single sample of 500 balls, $\hat{p}$ = number of white balls divided by 500 Draw 10 samples of 50 balls each. Calculate the proportion of white balls in each sample, i. e., $[r_1, r_2, ..., r_{10}]$. Estimated $\hat{p}$ = average of $[r_1, r_2, ..., r_{10}]$. Which method should I use so that I am less susceptible to sampling error?
