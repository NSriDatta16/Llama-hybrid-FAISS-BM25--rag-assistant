Exceptions vs return codes : do we lose something (while gaining something else)?

My question is pretty vague :o) - But here is an example : When I was writing C code, I was able to log counter's value when something failed : for ( int i = 0 ; i Now, using exceptions, I get this : try { for ( int i = 0 ; i } catch ( Exception exception ) { Log( "Failure ! Maybe in myCall() ? Don't know. i's value ? No clue." ); } Of course, one may declare "i" outside of the try/catch statement (and this is what I'm doing). But I don't like it - I like declare variable where they are used, not before. But maybe am I missing something here. Do you have any elegant solution ? Thank in advance ! Sylvain. ADDED : myCall() is an obscure API call - I have no clue what it can throw. Also, I can of course add a Try/Catch block around each call, but I would then be better to use return codes ? Would I then add a lot of noise around important lines of code ?.
