New-style classes have been recommended practice in Python since they were introduced in Python 2.2. In Python 3.x, only new-style classes are available. Therefore, I recommend you switch your classes to new-style. I am not aware of any real problems you might have from this. For the most part, new-style classes simply bring new features, such as super() actually working. If you have code that relies on the semantics of old-style classes in tricky ways, that code would of course break. (The only example that comes to mind is the famous Borg pattern by the famous Alex Martelli.) Here is a link to the Python reference manual for a discussion of new style classes vs. old-style ("classic") classes. And here is a link to the classic essay where Guido van Rossum explains why new-style classes were introduced. I use only new-style classes in my code and I encourage you to do the same.
