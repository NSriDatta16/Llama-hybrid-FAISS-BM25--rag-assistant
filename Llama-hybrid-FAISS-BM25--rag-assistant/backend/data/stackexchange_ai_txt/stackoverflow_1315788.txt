I think there are two issues that need attention: How are the passwords transmitted securely? How should the passwords be stored securely? Existing password based key agreements such as SRP address both problems. Your solution to encrypt passwords with RSA is not bad idea but is a partial solution only: Since RSA randomizes the encryption, it prevents offline dictionary attacks. From your description it is unclear if your proposal prevents replay attacks. Can an attacker login by sending a previously intercepted encrypted password or do you have a countermeasure such as time-stamps?
