Scala Actor in script mode

I'm trying go through Chapter 9 of Programming in Scala, but I found the Actor sample code could not run in script mode. The code is simple: // TestActor.scala import scala.actors.Actor class Redford extends Actor { def act() { println("A lot of what acting is, is paying attention.") } } val robert = new Redford robert.start But when I run scala TestActor.scala , nothing happens, the program exit before the Redford class print anything. But if I use the following code to compile and run, everything works fine, it prints the message as expected. // TestActorCompiled.scala import scala.actors.Actor class Redford extends Actor { def act() { println("A lot of what acting is, is paying attention.") } } object Main { def main (args: Array[String]) { val robert = new Redford robert.start } } It seems when the program run in the script mode, it exit before the actor doing anything. Why this happens? And how could I make this program do no exit before Actor.act() is done when the program is running in script mode? Update: I'm using Scala 2.8.1.final
