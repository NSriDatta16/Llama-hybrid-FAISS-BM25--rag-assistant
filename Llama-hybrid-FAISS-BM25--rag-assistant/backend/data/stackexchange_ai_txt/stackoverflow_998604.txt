Check if your iPhone properly provisioned . You may connect iPhone and launch Organizer from XCode (Main Menu -> Window -> Organizer) and then check PROVISIONING PROFILES information. After that you need to match Bundle Identifier (Project -> Info.plist) and your App ID. You may read this Apple Note Mismatch between App ID and Bundle Identifier I had similar message boxes (two in a row) when my Bundle Identifier was incorrect.
