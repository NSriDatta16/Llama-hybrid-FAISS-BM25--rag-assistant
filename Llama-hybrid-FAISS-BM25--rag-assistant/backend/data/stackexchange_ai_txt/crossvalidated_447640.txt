Help in simple Bayesian inference problem using Bernoulli

I have recently started to get into Bayesian statistics and, in order to try and grasp it better I decided to work out a small example, but I am having a hard time going through it. Let's say I am trying to figure out the probability of myself waking up on time. Essentially, I am trying to model this as a Bernoulli Distribution, where p is the probability of myself waking up on time, and I a trying to figure out the value of p. Now, if I assume ignorance and state that my prior probability of myself waking up on time is 0.5, and also that I have woken up on time today, how do I use this to figure out my current estimate of p?
