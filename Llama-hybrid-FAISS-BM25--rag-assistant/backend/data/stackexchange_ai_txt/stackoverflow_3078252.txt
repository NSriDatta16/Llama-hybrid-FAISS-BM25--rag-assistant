I would not suggest using a hidden div that way. It is a lot of extra markup for an id , and you are not currently using the id or rel attribute (Both potential candidates for holding this information): Since there is already the concept of an ID in HTML, I think it makes the most sense to leverage that: "> This would output: Title Here Title Here Title Here Then in your jQuery part (Assumes id will not contain a - ): $('#reports').delegate('li', 'click', function() { var idOfTheClickedReport = this.id.split('-').pop(); fetchReportById(idOfTheClickedReport); ... });
