Linear Regression model visualization

I am trying to visualize, how does the linear regression model draw a straight line when we have multiple features and one label to predict. Like when we have 1 feature and 1 label, we can easily plot them on a 2-D graph and draw a straight line. Even if we have two features and one label, we can still plot them on a 3-D graph but I couldn't able to visualize, what will happen when we have 20 features. Will algorithm use 20-D graph or am I missing something. I am new to machine learning. So this question can come as naive.
