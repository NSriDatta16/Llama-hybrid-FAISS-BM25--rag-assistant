Reporting tool for C++ that shows number of times executed given a line

I would to know if there is a tool in C++ that gives you a report where it displays the following: The source code of the whole project. Usually one HTML page per source file. Beside the source code, there are line numbers, for readability purposes of course. And for each line, at the left of the line number, there is a value displayed for how many times that line is executed. Of course, you need to execute a script that runs say unit tests and from there generate a report. If you are familiar with code coverage tool Cobertura for Java and NCover for C# that's one of its important features.
