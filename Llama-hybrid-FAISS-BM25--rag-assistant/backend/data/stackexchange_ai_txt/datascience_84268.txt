If i understand you right what you trying to achieved is Text Classification using Context Information.Also i assume that you have target column ,so you need to used supervised learning(please correct me if my assumptions are wrong :) ) For such cases the best is to use recurrent neural networks like LSTM for example.Please check this https://www.kaggle.com/kredy10/simple-lstm-for-text-classification ,because i think it is very similar to your case.
