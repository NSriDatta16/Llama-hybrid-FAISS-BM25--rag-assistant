It is casting the data pointer as a pointer to a long. The line: char data[128]; will allocate 128 bytes of memory and treat that data as characters. The code: long * ptr; ptr = (long *) data; allocates a pointer to a long, and sets that pointer to point at the memory allocated by char data[128]; . You can reference this memory by data[x] to get the xth character starting at the beginning of this memory block. Or you can reference this memory by ptr[x] to get the xth long starting at the beginning of this memory block. Just note that each long takes up more storage than each character. It is probably 8 bytes - so you can go up to data[127] or ptr[15] .
