SQLite is not good choice if you need such concurrent access to database. I suggest switching to some other rdbms, like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and also take into account get_or_create fragility: How do I deal with this race condition in django? Regarding the above link, there is also second solution to that problem - using READ COMMITED isolation level, instead of REPEATABLE READ. But it's less tested (At least in MySQL), so there might be more bugs/problems with it.
