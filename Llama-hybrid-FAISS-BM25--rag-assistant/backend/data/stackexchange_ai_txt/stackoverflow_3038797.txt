Regarding spam, most organisations are very secretive about how they prevent spam (not wanting to publish information which helps the spammers) and in some cases they don't actually know - an obvious examlpe of this is bayesian filtering - but, for example, hotmail use a completely unaccountable army of volunteers to manually classify emails. Do and get a copy of spamassassin and try to reverse engineer how the standard rules work. Obvious things to check are: 1) AVOIDING LOTS OF CAPITALS 2) don't mention the 'V' word 3) make sure you've got a current and restrictive SPF 1.0 policy published 4) make sure your sending from an address which has A and PTR DNS records 5) Do provide a reply-to and from email address which use your domain in the address the mailer is working locally but once we deploy it it no longer runs doesn't send emails Which? These are 2 totally seperate things. If the code is falling over (if so why have you not provided the error details) then its likely a PHP version issue or a problem with the connection to the MTA (or the PHP mail config). The latter is a problem with the MTA itself. 99.9% of problems reported as PHP mail failures have nothing to do with PHP and are problems with the MTA. Enabled detailled error reporting for your MTA and see where it is failing. C.
