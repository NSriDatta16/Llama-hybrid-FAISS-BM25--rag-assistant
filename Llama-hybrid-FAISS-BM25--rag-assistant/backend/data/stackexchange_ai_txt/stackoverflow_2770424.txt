Does .Net use Device Dependent or Device Independent Bitmaps?

When loading an image into memory, does .Net use DDB, DIB, or something else entirely? If possible, please cite your sources. I'm wondering because we currently have a classic ASP application that is using a 3rd party component to load images that is occasionally creating a “Not enough storage is available to process this command.” error. The error is very inconsistent but tends to happen on larger images (not always, but often). After resetting IIS, processing the same file again typically works just fine. After much research I have found that DDBs tend to have this problem when processing large images because they work out of video memory. Considering that we are running on a web server with an integrated video card and limited shared memory, this could certainly be our problem. We are in the early stages of converting our app to .Net and am wondering if using .Net for this might be a viable alternative to our current method which is why I am asking the question. Any advice is welcome :) but out of curiosity if nothing else, I am really hoping for an answer to the question; does .Net use DDB or DIB?
