Well all that doesn't really matter in a man-in-the-middle attack. a Secure Socket Layer is very recommended if your dealing with sensitive information. Use the LDAPv3 Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension for a secure connection. Also, log the http-user-agent to differ between computers on the same network. Locking the user accounts to prevent bruteforcing is always a good idea. Make sure to deny the IP address/user agent combination and not only the ip address. Now they can't capture the info when your sending it, and they can't fake the cookie information. For that part, it's pretty secure. There could be other factors though, but as i don't know them, it isn't relevant.
