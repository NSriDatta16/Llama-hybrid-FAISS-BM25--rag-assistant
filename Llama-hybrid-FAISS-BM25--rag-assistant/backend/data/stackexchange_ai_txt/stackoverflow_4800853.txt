Should Interfaces Live In The Same Namespace As The Concrete Classes That Implement Them?

Is there a standard for how solutions/projects are organized in regards to interfaces and the classes that implement them? I'm working on a an MVP, DDD application and would love to hear feedback as to how others layout their projects and why they do it that way. Thanks!!
