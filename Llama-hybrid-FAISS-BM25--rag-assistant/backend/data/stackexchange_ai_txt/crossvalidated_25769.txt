You may want to use some feature extraction technique to derive descriptors for a k-means or other type of clustering. A basic approach would be to fit a certain distribution to your histograms and use its parameters as descriptors. For instance, you seem to have bimodal distributions, that you can describe with 2 means and 2 standard deviations. Another possibility is to cluster over the first two or three principal component of the counts of the histograms. Alternatively wavelets approaches can be used. This page explains how to do that when dealing with extracellular spikes. The data is different, but the idea should be applicable to your case. You will also find many references at the bottom. http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Spike_sorting In R you can calculate the principal components of your peaks using either the princomp or prcomp function. Here you'll find a tutorial on PCA in R. For wavelets you may look at the wavelets package. k-means clustering can be achieved using the kmeans function.
