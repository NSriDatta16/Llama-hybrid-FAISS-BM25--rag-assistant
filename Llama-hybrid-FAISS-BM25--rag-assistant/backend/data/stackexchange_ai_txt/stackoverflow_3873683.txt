Best way to report thread progress

I have a program that uses threads to perform time-consuming processes sequentially. I want to be able to monitor the progress of each thread similar to the way that the BackgroundWorker.ReportProgress / ProgressChanged model does. I can't use ThreadPool or BackgroundWorker due to other constraints I'm under. What is the best way to allow/expose this functionality. Overload the Thread class and add a property/event? Another more-elegant solution?
