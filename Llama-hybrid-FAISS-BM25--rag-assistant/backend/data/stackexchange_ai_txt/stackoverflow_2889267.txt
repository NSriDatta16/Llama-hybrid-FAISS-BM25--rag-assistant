jQuery find first visible element after horizontal scroll

I’m new (only two weeks old) to jQuery, so please bear with me. I know that a very similar question was asked some time ago, but I do not know how to adapt the answer to my problem. I have a very wide multicolumn layout that is something like this: | aaaa | bbbb | cccc | … | | aaaa | b | cc | … | | aaa | cccc | ddd | … | The code looks like: aaaaaaaaaaa bbbbb ccccccccccc dddddddddd ... xxxxxx There is no vertical scrolling and the container width is set in such a way that only two columns are shown. The user scrolls left or right to see the relevant text. What I want is to get the position currently on display, store it (maybe in a cookie) and retrieve it the next time the user opens the page. I think that I need a way of finding out what paragraph is currently the left-top most, but other suggestions are very welcome. Any ideas? BTW: this is an internal project, so Mozilla only :-)
