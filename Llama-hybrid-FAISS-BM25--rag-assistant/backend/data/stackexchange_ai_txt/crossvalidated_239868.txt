Detecting trend reversal in a time series

I'm a novice in time series analysis and I'm trying to detect trend reversals automatically. In the example below, a heuristic rule would say that a trend reversal has occurred if the value has been trending in a direction for t1 seconds, then in the other direction for t2 = t1/k seconds. I've tried to parse the answer on detecting trends but it went beyond my head. While I know I need to read up way more on time series analysis, I wonder if there are simpler (and more coarse) methods for detecting trends and trend reversals. Something like detecting slopes and calculating the angle between them?
