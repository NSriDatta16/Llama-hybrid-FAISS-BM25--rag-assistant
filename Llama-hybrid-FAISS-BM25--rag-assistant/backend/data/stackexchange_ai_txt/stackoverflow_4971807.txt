Storing referenced Dlls in visual studio solution folder

I want to have a library folder that stores all my dlls. What I'm currently doing is as suggested here . Have physical folder, create solution folder, copy the files. If I'm using SVN, I'll have to use tortoise on the file explorer to add the library. Not sure if I'm going to have to do the same thing in TFS. In vs 2010, is there any easier way to do this? I want to be able to just drag a dll into the library folder inside visual studio and have it physically put the dll in the folder.
