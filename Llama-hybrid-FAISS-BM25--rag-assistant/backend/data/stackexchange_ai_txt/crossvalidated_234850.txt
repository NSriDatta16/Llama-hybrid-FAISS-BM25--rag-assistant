Intuition behind regression sum of squares

$SSR = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2$ is the sum of squares of the difference between the fitted value and the average response variable. In other words, it measures how far the regression line is from $\bar{Y}$. Higher $SSR$ leads to higher $R^2$, the coefficient of determination, which corresponds to how well the model fits our data. I'm having trouble wrapping my mind around why the farther away the regression line is from the average $Y$ means that the model is a better fit.
