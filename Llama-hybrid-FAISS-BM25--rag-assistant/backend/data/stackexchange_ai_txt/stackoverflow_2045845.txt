Really smooth animate effects with jQuery

I have some jQuery set up on my page to swap out some DIVs when a user clicks a link. The DIVs have flash objects, paragraphs and images inside them and when I click the link to swap it out the effects aren't exactly... smooth. This is my code: $('#div').toggle('fast'); $('#anotherdiv').toggle('fast'); It kinda gets stuck on the flash object for a short while and then disappears completely. Does anyone know a plugin to make really smooth animated effects in jQuery? I took a look at jQuery UI but it seems a little overkill for what I want it for. Cheers. :)
