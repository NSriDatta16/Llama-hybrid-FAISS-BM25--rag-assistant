Autocovariance of White Noise

I'm studying time series, I don't understand the description below. The white noise series $w_t$ has $E(w_t) = 0$ and $$\gamma_w(s, t) = \operatorname{cov}(w_s, w_t)= \begin{cases} \sigma_w^2 & s = t \\ 0 & s\ne t\end{cases} $$ But I don't understand how to get the result. If $s = t,$ then $\gamma_w(s, t) = \gamma_w(t, t) = E[(w_t- \mu_t)^2] = \operatorname{var}(w_t)$ How does $\operatorname{var}(w_t)$ become $\sigma_w^2$ ? And why if s and t are not equal, the covariance of two sequence will become 0?
