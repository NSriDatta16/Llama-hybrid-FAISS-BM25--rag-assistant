Autoencoders can't learn meaningful features

I have 50,000 images such as these two: They depict graphs of data. I wanted to extract features from these images so I used autoencoder code provided by Theano (deeplearning.net). The problem is, these autoencoders don't seem to learn any features. I've tried RBM and it's the same. MNIST dataset provides nice features but my data doesn't seem to yield any. I enclose examples below: Filters created on MNIST: Filters created by training on my data: I've used many different permutations of hidden layer sizes and training epochs but the results are always the same. Why doesn't it work? Why can't autoencoders extract features from these images? EDIT: For anyone that has a similar problem. The solution was really simple and the cause really dumb. I just forgot to rescale the pixel values from RGB encoding to float in range 0 - 1. Rescaling values solved the problem.
