If you are concerned about security, state server is a no-no. State server performs absolutely no access checks, anybody who is granted access to the tcp port state server uses can access or modify any session state. In proc is unreliable (and you mentioned that) so that's not to consider. Cookies isn't really a session state replacement since you can't store much data there I vote for a database based storage (if needed at all) of some kind, it has the best possibility to scale.
