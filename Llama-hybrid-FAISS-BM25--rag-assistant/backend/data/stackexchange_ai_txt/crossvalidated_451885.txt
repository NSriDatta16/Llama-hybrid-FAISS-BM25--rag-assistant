Gaussian Process - The variance term in Kernel matrix is not reducing to 0 at the Location of the Data Point

I am running a variance reduction experiment using GPy library and sampling using Bayesian optimization suggested location. I noticed that once the data at certain location is added to GP's data set, the variance of that data is still largely positive (minute decrease from its original variance!) when the objective function is 2d function. This makes Bayesian optimization getting stuck at some local optima! The variance goes to 0 in GPy library for 1D function but using 2D function such as Branin Hoo, the variance does not go to 0 at the data point location. I am using Matern25 kernel. I also tried with Gaussian kernel i.e. RBF. Could this be a bug in the library or it is to be expected?
