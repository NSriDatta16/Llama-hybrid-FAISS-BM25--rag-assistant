This really depends on what you plan to do with the xml. In access 2003, and 2007 we can import xml. So, if you have a xml string that is a table of data, then you could receive the data, write out to disk, and then execute a Application.ImportXML. This approach is FAR less code then other answers given here. Here is a code snip this concept: Dim intF As Integer Dim strF As String Dim objXML As Object Set objXML = CreateObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP") objXML.Open "GET", "URL string here", False objXML.Send strF = "c:\t.xml" intF = FreeFile Open strF For Output As intF Write #intF, objXML.responsetext Close Application.ImportXML "c:\t.xml", acAppendData The above would assume that the XML has a catalog, or table def in the text eg: 1 Kallal Albert 2 Smo Joe
