Do variable selection methods change based on the type of response variable?

The diagnostic tests for different models would be different, but how would the variable selection change? For instance, how much different is it to fit a Poisson regression model versus a logistic regression? It seems like forward, backward, and stepwise processes would be about the same for both (though it seems the validity of these methods is contested).
