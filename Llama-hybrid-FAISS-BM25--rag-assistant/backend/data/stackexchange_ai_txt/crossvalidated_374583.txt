Transforming the data (e.g. scaling or taking the log) to be more normal is perfectly acceptable, you just need to keep in mind that it will affect the interpretation of your model. You would also need to back-transform predicted values to get back to the original scale. You could also consider modeling the data with some other non-normal distribution, say with a generalized linear model or taking a Bayesian approach.
