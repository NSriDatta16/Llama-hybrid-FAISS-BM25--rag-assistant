Python - SkLearn Logistic Regression: One-by-one train instance

Here is my question, I have a huge train set so I can't load it in memory and apply this code. model = LogisticRegression() model = model.fit(train_set_df, y_label_df) So, I am looking for a way to train my Sklearn.LogisticRegression model by passing instances one-by-one in order to avoid loading all the train data in memory. Thanks
