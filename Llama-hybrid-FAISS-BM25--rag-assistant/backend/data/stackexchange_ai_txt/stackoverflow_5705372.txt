What it comes down to is mutating state using LINQ should be avoided and not encouraged, LINQ's focus is on querying and transforming data, but not in place mutation - you lose many of the benefits of LINQs functional approach (i.e. no side effects, same input produces same output) if you do mutate state. There is no benefit of Linq offering a ForEach() extension method over a normal foreach loop other than that it would aid you in mutating state - hence its not implemented (that's at least my take on it, take it with a grain of salt).
