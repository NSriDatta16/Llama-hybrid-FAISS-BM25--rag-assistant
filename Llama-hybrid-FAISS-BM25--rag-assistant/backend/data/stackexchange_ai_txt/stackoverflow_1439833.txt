I suppose you could imagine an environment where a programmer wants to obliterate commits to cover up his responsibility for a mistake. Or perhaps a more commmon problem would be, a novice programmer obliterates something he shouldn't have through ignorance and now all history is lost, or even a competent experienced programmer makes a mistake. Those scenarios are good reasons to make obliteration hard or require special privileges. But I've had a number of times when we've decided to restructure our repositories for one reason or another. If, say, we have one repository on server A and another on server B, and we decide to move a project from A to B, I would really like to obliterate it from A. Otherwise, six months from now someone might find the copy on A and not realize it is no longer current. Especially when I was first learning SVN, I made a lot of bad decisions about how to organize branches and tags that I later wanted to rework. I really wanted to just obliterate the old structure and put it all back right. Again, to avoid confusing anyone who looks at the history.
