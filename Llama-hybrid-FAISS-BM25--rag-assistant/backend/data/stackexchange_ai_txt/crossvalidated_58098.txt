I upvoted simply because the downvote was uncalled-for. To answer the question: Nobody can tell you how to analyze anything unless they have some idea of why you want to analyze it. That said: If you just want to display the data, make a bunch of bar charts. People can see who put what, and how frequently. Done. Do you want to say how two variables are related? Maybe that agreeing with one question predicts disagreeing with another? That is regression or one of its flavors. Do some basic reading. The simple stuff isn't really that hard, and excel can do a lot of really basic stuff. Do you want to group people into clusters? People who think alike? That is a lot harder. PCA, kmeans, etc. Let us know what your goals are and we'll try to point you in the right direction.
