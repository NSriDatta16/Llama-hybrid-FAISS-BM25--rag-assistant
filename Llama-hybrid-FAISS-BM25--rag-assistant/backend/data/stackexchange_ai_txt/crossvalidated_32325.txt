Good summaries (reviews, books) on various applications of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)?

Are there any good summaries (reviews, books) on various applications of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)? I've seen Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice , but this books seems a bit old. Are there more update books on various applications of MCMC in areas such as machine leearning, computer vision, and computational biology?
