C# basics - Memory Management

I am new to the programming in C#. Can anyone please tell me memory management about C#? Class Student { int Id; String Name; Double Marks; public string getStudentName() { return this.Name; } public double getPersantage() { return this.Marks * 100 / 500; } } I want to know how much memory is allocated for instance of this class? What about methods? Where they are allocated? And if there are static methods, what about their storage? Can anyone please briefly explain this to me?
