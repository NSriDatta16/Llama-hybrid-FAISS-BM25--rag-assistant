what are the suggested approaches for this scenario with you? experience in this field? Another very popular approach (apart from @user112358 suggestion) is to use neural networks, particularly LSTM - RNN because of their inherent "memory" capabilities. Recurrent Neural Networks are a very good candidate when dealing with time series, such as forecasting product sales, because they are the only variant of neural networks that can model the dynamics of a system . A very informative tutorial on how to rapidly prototype such an algorithm can be found here , targeting the Keras API using Python. I highly recommend that you check it because it personally helped me a lot. It is also applied to a shampoo sales dataset, which is exactly what you are looking for as a case study.
