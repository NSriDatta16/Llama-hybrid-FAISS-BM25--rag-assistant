Auto-suggest of airfields - how to order "best match first" across several columns?

Given the following table structure: id iata icao name 1 ANC PANC Anchorage - Ted Stevens International 2 LHR EGLL London - Heathrow 3 LGW EGKK London - Gatwick 4 MDZ SAME Mendoza - Governor Francisco Gabrielli International what's the best way to extract the records in "best match first" order, as you would expect in an auto-suggest field at a travel agent site? A match on ="string" in any one column should take precedence over a match on LIKE "%string%" in any other. After that, alphabetical order on "name" is probably what I want. For example, searching "anc" would return row 1 then row 4. "lon" would get 3 then 2. IATA codes are always 3 characters, ICAO always 4. However, either or both may be NULL. While I would expect my AJAX to submit three characters and filter in Javascript from there, I can't assume that the input will be three characters - non-Javascript users will be submitting a string of arbitrary length. I'm doing this in PHP with MySQL.
