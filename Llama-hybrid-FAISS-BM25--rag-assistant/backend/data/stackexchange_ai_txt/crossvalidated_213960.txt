How to make this data in the following figure separable for the classification into three classes?

The figure below shows the PCA projections of inputs which are 14 meteorological features, (i.e. wind, temperature, humidity, pressure, and so on.) I would like to use any technique to make it more separable than this, The ISOMAP method is also used instead of PCA, but gave a non-separable distribution as well! Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
