jQuery collapsing list?

Check out http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ At the bottom there's a tabbed section. The seconds tabs "Details" gives the example of exactly what I want to accomplish. You can show/hide each row, and you can show/hide the details within that list row. Is this part of the jQuery UI? If so, does anyone happen to know what it's called?
