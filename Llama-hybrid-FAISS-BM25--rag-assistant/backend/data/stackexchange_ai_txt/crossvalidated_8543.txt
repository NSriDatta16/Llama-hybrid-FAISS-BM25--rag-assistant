I don't know why I took the time to answer this. Is it because I can or maybe it's because DrWho seems to think it is very important. In either case .... Though well intentioned “Time series expert modeler of IBM SPSS Forecast v19 was used. Both exponential smoothening models and ARIMA models were examined.Outliers were detected and prevented from influencing parameter estimates” may have suffered from an inability to detect level shifts i.e. “Intercept Changes” which are a sequence of pulses with the same value and sign. Note below a reasonable model for STATE1 using all 17 values suggests a Level Shift at 2004 ( period 11). This model [AR(1)] was used to cleanse STATE1 of unspecified background factors that may have been present to cause significant changes in Y given X. Y(T) = -87.899 +[X1(T)][(+ .158)] M_CASES +[X2(T)][(- 77.4369)] :PULSE 7 I~P00007STATE1 +[X3(T)][(- 65.2775)] :PULSE 15 I~P00015STATE1 +[X4(T)][(- 112.77 )] :LEVEL SHIFT 11 I~L00011STATE1 +[X5(T)][(+ 43.0999)] :PULSE 9 I~P00009STATE1 +[X6(T)][(- 58.4117)] :PULSE 4 I~P00004STATE1 + [(1- .840B** 1)]**-1 [A(T)] Leading to a cleansed set of values FOR STATE1 1994 383.0000000000 1995 257.0000000000 1996 263.0000000000 1997 465.4116693551 1998 149.0000000000 1999 434.0000000000 2000 246.4369202361 2001 275.0000000000 2002 134.9000542626 2003 142.0000000000 2004 131.0000000000 2005 336.0000000000 2006 108.0000000000 2007 75.0000000000 2008 118.2775018144 2009 40.0000000000 2010 26.0000000000 Notice that a simple line graph between Y and X visually support the change in the relationship between Y and on or about period 11 (2004) such that the Y values are clearly lower than expected for the period 2004-2010 ( 11-20) as compared to period 1994-2003 (1-10). This is a classic case of an outside factor impacting either Y or X ( but not both !) starting at time period 11. Normal statistical commentary would refer to this level shift as a “lurking variable” confounding simple analysis if untreated. For STATE2 Y(T) = -6.4072 +[X1(T)][(+ .213)] M_CASES +[X2(T)][(- 254.25 )] :PULSE 17 I~P00017STATE2 +[X3(T)][(+ 214.32 )] :PULSE 12 I~P00012STATE2 +[X4(T)][(- 92.6947)] :PULSE 16 I~P00016STATE2 +[X5(T)][(- 98.6907)] :PULSE 15 I~P00015STATE2 +[X6(T)][(+ 39.8298)] :PULSE 13 I~P00013STATE2 + [A(T)] 1994 121.0000000000 1995 227.0000000000 1996 179.0000000000 1997 76.0000000000 1998 195.0000000000 1999 275.0000000000 2000 253.0000000000 2001 199.0000000000 2002 133.0000000000 2003 237.0000000000 2004 228.0000000000 2005 1285.6763010529 2006 488.1702389682 2007 645.0000000000 2008 635.6907401611 2009 648.6947149772 2010 748.2497352909 Note that the Pulses were identified GIVEN the number of cases. Now proceeding with the CHOW TEST to test the significant difference between the two sets of regression coefficients: We get the following OLS Model for the combined 34 (cleansed values used ) With Error Sum of Squares = 363716. For STATE1 we get Y(T) = -49.293 +[X1(T)][(+ .150)] M_CASES + [A(T)] Sum of Squares 142759. And for STATE2 Y(T) = -6.4072 +[X1(T)][(+ .213)] M_CASES + [A(T)] Sum of Squares 1445.64 As before we have the following F test Numerator = [363716 – (142759+1445)] /2 = 109,776 Denominator = 363716/30 = 12,123 Computed F value of 9.0 with 2 and 30 degrees of freedom is significant at alpha less than .001 . Thus one could conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the two states at about a 99.9% Level of Confidence given that there was a significant effect in STATE1 at or about 2004.
