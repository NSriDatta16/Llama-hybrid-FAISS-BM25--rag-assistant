You should override getMe method with return type Child at Child class. This feauture is called as covariant return, it comes with jdk1.5 .. class Child extends Father{ public Child getMe() { return this; } } What about this solution?. It did not look elegant, you should cast to T at getThis method.. But there is no need to override getThis method at subclasses.. But unfortunately type safety is not enforced, one can define such a base object , Base baseChild = new Base (); Therefore I do not recommend this method.. class Base > { public T getThis() { return (T) this; } } class Child extends Base { } Child child = new Child(); child.getThis(); // return type is Child Base base = new Base(); base.getThis(); // return type is base
