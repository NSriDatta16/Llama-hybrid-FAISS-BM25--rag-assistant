How can I use a Cox proportional hazards model to obtain probabilities?

I am using a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the probability of an event (failure of a mechanical device, say) occurring at discrete, finite times: $t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. In Cox's original paper, Regression Models and Life Tables , he says that, if you let $T$ be the random variable representing the time to failure of a given member of your population, and $T$ is discrete, then $$ \lambda(t) = Pr(T = t|T \geq t). $$ So it seems to me that, if I estimate $\lambda_0(t)$ in the canonical Cox model formula $$ \lambda(t) = \lambda_0(t) \exp \left( \sum \beta_i X_i \right) $$ as a "baseline" probability that failure occurs (that is, a sort of average of the probability of the event occurring at time $t$ when the $X_i$ are all zero), I can obtain an estimate of the probability of the event occurring at a time $t$ in the future for a device with risk characteristics $X_i$ by just plugging in the values of $X_i$ and the value of $t$ into the formula. Is this the correct way to use a Cox model, or am I not thinking hard enough?
