The answers I see here aren't wrong, but I don't think they've really addressed your question. I think you're asking, " Should I track the total hours actually spent on a certain task?" The answer is, "You can if you need to, but it isn't part of Scrum." Scrum is a very lightweight process. It defines/requires only what is needed to make Scrum work. You can (and, in many cases, probably should) overlay other processes on top of Scrum in order to suit your organizational needs. For example, if tracking the total hours actually spent on a task enables you to better estimate similar tasks in the future (as it seems your VP wants), then that might be a good reason to track total hours, provided that it doesn't interfere with productive work too much. Or, perhaps you need to know the total hours for billing purposes. So just because Scrum doesn't require something doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. However, for the purposes of Scrum itself, there is no need to track the total hours actually spent on a task. It is not needed for any of the Scrum artifacts, which only track the estimated amount of time remaining.
