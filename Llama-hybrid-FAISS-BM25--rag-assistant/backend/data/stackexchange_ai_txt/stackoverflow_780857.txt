PRAGMA journal_mode = OFF is not working why?

I am running SQLite3 version sqlite-3.6.12 and I have successfully ported it to my OS. The problem I am seeing is that when I execute the command "PRAGMA journal_mode = OFF" it returns "OFF" but I am still seeing *.db-journal files being created. It is critical that these files are not created for the purpose of my project. When I step through the code sqlite3PagerJournalMode is returning PAGER_JOURNALMODE_OFF so I am wondering if setting journal_mode=OFF should still produce these files or if there is something else that I am missing.Please help I also tried PRAGMA main.journal_mode = OFF and PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY.But the journel file is creating as such !!!!
