How can I detect spurious regressions results?

I run bivariate Granger-causality regressions. Let $y_{t}$ and $x_{t}$ be stationary time series. I test if $x_{t}$ can forecast $y_{t}$ with the following regression: $$y_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta_{1}y_{t} + \beta_{2}x_{t} + \varepsilon_{t+1}$$ I find that $\beta_{2}$ is significantly larger than zero, so $x_{t}$ appears to forecast $y_{t}$ . However, I do not find any plausible explanation for this effect. So I am thinking that the result might be spurious. Is there any way to test if my result is spurious? How would one go about to argue that the result might be spurious?
