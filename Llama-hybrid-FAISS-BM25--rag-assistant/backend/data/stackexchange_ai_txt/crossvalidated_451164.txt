Handling cumulative exposure variables in mixed-effects logistic regression (MELR) models

I am working on analyzing the results of an observational study, a brief description of which is as follows: X number of diabetic subjects have been recruited to collect naturalistic driving data, and subsequently model their driving behavior as a function of a bunch of predictors such as blood-glucose level, roadway and environmental characteristics, etc. One aspect of this study that I am currently dealing with involves modeling the driver behavior at stop-controlled intersections using the following response and predictor variables: Response variable : unsafe behavior (rolling stop or no stop) & safe behavior (full stop; reference level) Predictor variable : Cumulative exposure to glucose episodes prior to the trip start. An episode is simply an event where the blood-glucose level stays below or above a certain threshold for a certain period of time. A trip is the movement of a car between two points from engine start to stop. So, each row in my analysis data has a value of the response (unsafe or safe), and cumulative total duration of exposure to glucose episode at the trip start. During a trip a subject can come across multiple stop intersections, so there will be multiple rows for the response but the cumulative exposure information for those responses will be the same. I am using the lme4 R package and setting up the model formula as follows: lme4::glmer( stop_beh ~ cumexp_episode_totalmins + (1|subj), # by-subj random effects data = my_data, family = "binomial" ) I am wondering if this is the correct way to handle cumulative exposure variables in MELR models? Update Based on Erik's response, I thought adding how my data is organized will add clarity to my question. "subj", "trip_id", "stop_encounter_id", "cumexp_episode_toatlmins", # start of the study period; # multiple stop sign encounters within a trip "A", 1, 1, 0, "A", 1, 2, 0, "A", 1, 3, 0, # driver had 15 minutes of episode before the start of trip 2; # notice the episode info is repeated for the trip "A", 2, 1, 15, "A", 2, 2, 15, "A", 2, 3, 15, # no additional episode b/w trips 2 & 3 "A", 3, 1, 15, "A", 3, 2, 15, # 15 more minutes of episode between trip 3 & 4 "A", 4, 1, 30, "A", 4, 2, 30
