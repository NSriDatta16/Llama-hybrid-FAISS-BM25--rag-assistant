Regression discontinuity is useful when there is some exogenous event or attribute that can be used to identify an effect. Knowing whether RD is appropriate here is determined by whether D is an exogenous attribute. It makes sense that D is time-invariant for an RD design, but that's not the important feature for determining whether RD is appropriate. You'll want to look at D and be able to say that the only difference between your two groups (D==0 and D==1) with relevance to y is the status of D. If there is any other variable (z) that can effect both D and y, RD would not be appropriate. It is quite difficult to identify a "quasi-experimental" treatment that satisfies the requirements for an RD design, so you'll want to think carefully about whether D is truly exogenously assigned. You'll also want to think more about how y varies. Do you expect y to increase or decrease at a different rate over the panel between your D groups? Or do you expect there to simply be a different average value between D groups? If y has different expected growth trajectories for D groups, you could look into running a growth model, which would use an interaction between t and D. If D were time-variant, it would be unlikely to be appropriate for RD, as D's status would need to be exogenous over the repeated measures. I can't think of a situation like that (but I could be wrong). You could consider a fixed-effects model with year dummies, though.
