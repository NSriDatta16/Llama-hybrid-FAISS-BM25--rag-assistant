How to standardize text data for training Neural Networks?

I want to train neural network with text data(natural language) as input for classification purpose. One way for standardizing text data for neural network is to use N-GRAM/SKIP-GRAM representation which will be in vector form. Is there any other way apart from n-gram/skip-gram to represent data that can be used as input for neural networks?
