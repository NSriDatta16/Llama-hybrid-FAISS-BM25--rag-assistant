Measuring weather impact on sales as a crossed random effect

I'm trying to model sales of a clothing brand having longitudinal data (unbalanced panel: 20 stores with 50 - 157 weeks of datapoints). There are many regressors in my analysis, but I believe that weather is one of the most important ones as the brand offers typical winter clothes between December and February, beach/summer ones between June and August and all-season clothes during the whole year. The correlation between total sales and temperature is high (~0,64), but I have a problem with the "reciprocal seasonality": it is obvious that sales decrease during the cold Summer, but so they should in case of warm Winter (the correlation between sales and weather in Winter is negative). I have decided to go for a mixed model as I'm using many variables and believe that some of them are important on the store level. However, I have a problem with implementing the weather effect that depends on a season. My current solution is to add a temperature | season crossed effect so the model looks like this: lmer After doing some research I've decided to use crossed effects, as I don't think that seasons are nested within stores (please correct me if I'm wrong). EDIT: Season may be a month or even ISO week (number of week within a year, usually 1 - 52). However, I believe that using ISO weeks may lead to overfitting, so the seasons should be somehow predefined - for example first two weeks of each year will be labeled as "Early Winter", next three ones as "Winter Peak" , "Early Spring" and so on. sales are measured on the weekly level per store. We believe that sales depend on price, distribution and temperature. store week sales price distributiom season temperature 1 A 2017-01-02 10 1.1 0.7 Early Winter -10 2 A 2017-01-09 7 1.1 0.7 Early Winter -11 3 A 2017-01-16 8 1.2 0.8 Winter Peak -2 4 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 5 A 2018-01-01 12 0.9 0.25 Early Winter -4 6 A 2018-01-08 10 1.2 0.5 Early Winter -3 7 A 2018-01-15 8 1.1 0.8 Winter Peak -7 8 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 9 B 2017-01-02 11 1.1 0.9 Early Winter -7 10 B 2017-01-09 12 1.2 0.8 Early Winter -8 11 B 2017-01-16 7 0.7 0.7 Winter Peak -9 12 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 13 B 2018-01-01 10 0.9 0.9 Early Winter -10 14 B 2018-01-08 12 1.2 0.7 Early Winter -7 15 B 2018-01-15 11 1.1 0.8 Winter Peak -5 Of course, there are more stores, more weeks and more seasons. So, to keeps things simple, let's assume that price and distribution do not vary across stores. However, I am interested in the temperature effect on sales that should be dependant on the season. After some more reading here I'm even more confused and consider treating the season as a fixed effect, so I'm considering three models: lmer1 lmer2 lmer3 Which of them is the best pick for the described problem? Is it correct if I interpret the results of these models like below: lmer1: the average effect of temperature on sales is B * temperature, but if it is Early Winter, the additional effect is (B_early_winter) * temperature. Each season will also get its own effect on the global Intercept. lmer2: the average effect of temperature on sales is B * temperature, but if it is Early Winter, the additional effect is (B_early_winter) * temperature. lmer3: each season and season:temperature effect will be a separate parameter.
