The Receive and SendReply are just classes you can new. Take a look at this blog post where I create WF4 service using just code. BTW the ReceiveAndSendReplyis not an activity but a template that preconfigures a Receive and SendReply inside of a Sequence for you when you drag it onto the design surface.
