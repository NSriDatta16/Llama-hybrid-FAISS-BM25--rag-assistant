It is not converted as having the query part of the URL after the fragment is not valid. RFC 3986 defines a URI as composed of the following parts: foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose \_/ \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/ | | | | | scheme authority path query fragment The order cannot be changed. Therefore, URL1: http://www.example.com/?query=Траливали#ajax_call will be handled properly while URL2: http://www.example.com/#ajax_call?query=Траливали will not. If we look at URL2 , IE actually handles the URL properly by detecting the fragment as #ajax_call?query=Траливали without a query. Fragment is always last and are never sent to the server . IE will properly encode the query component of URL1 as it will detect it as a query. As for decoding in PHP, %D2 and similar is automatically decoded in the $_GET['query'] variable. The reason why the $_GET variable was not properly populated was because in URL2 , there is no query according to the standard. Also, one last thing... when doing 'Траливали' == $_GET['query'] , this will only be true if your PHP script itself is encoded in UTF-8. Your text editor should be able to tell you the encoding of your file.
