I can't comment because of low reputation and so I am writing this in response to Felipe Almeida's question. After Indie AI's perfect answer, there is nothing much to add. If you want to detect specific shapes (like an X), you can pre define a specific filter, as is the case with edge detection. But this is the beauty of deep learning, there are so many layers, so many filters and so many iterations that the filters learn almost every object shape necessary on it's own. So theoretically, if there is an X to be detected, one of the filters will learn to detect an X (as the yellow filter)
