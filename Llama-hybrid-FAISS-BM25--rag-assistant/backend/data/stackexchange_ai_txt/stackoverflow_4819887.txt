This is a very hard question to answer, but I am going to suggest that you have a marshalling/conversion layer that converts from managed collections to unmanaged ones. Keep your library exactly as it is, and just convert the parameters and returns. This is what I would do if The collections aren't giant They aren't constantly passed back and forth all of the time. You often get the collection in the client code and then do a bunch of calls on it completely in managed land. For these reasons It layers the API keeping it simpler crossing the unmanaged/managed boundary can be a bottleneck and should be minimized This would be my default approach unless I really needed access to the functionality of the lib in the datastructure (it wasn't just organized data -- but data and behavior)
