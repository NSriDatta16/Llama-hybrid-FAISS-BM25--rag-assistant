Very little of what is in that video is actual "screencast" The effects and animations are almost certainly done in a professional compositing application -- my guess is Adobe After Effects. The "clicking" is all contrived -- they use a big arrow to make it clearer and easier to follow, and even add the little blue circles to show when something is actually getting clicked. This may not be what you want to hear, because After Effects is expensive , and the hardware required to run it well is really expensive. After Effects is hard to learn. Doing truly stunning compositing work takes a lot of time, patience and experience. Those discouragements aside, it is doable. In addition to being a developer, I am an amateur video producer and have worked with After Effects. It is extremely powerful, and has some programming aspect to it when you get into using expressions to control the behaviour of elements. Here is a Vimeo channel that showcases some great After Effects work: http://vimeo.com/channels/aework If you are serious about getting into compositing to create videos like the one to which you linked, and want to learn After Effects, I recommend the training from http://www.lynda.com . They have a great series by Chad Perkins and I learned a ton from them. If you have a fair amount of time to devote, you can definitely get through them all in one month, which costs $25.
