The queues are either defined in Active Directory or as text files (in the system32\msmq\storage\LQS folder), for public and private respectively. In theory you may be able to add custom properties to the public queue object in AD. Similarly, you may be able to add text to the private queue text file (although it may get stripped out should the queue properties be changed).
