Another option is to fit quasiPoisson models with log link & dispersion parameter $\phi$. As for the Poisson GLM with log link, the expectation of the response is $\operatorname{E}(Y) =\mu$, where $\mu=\exp(\beta^\mathrm{T} x_)$, but its variance is $\operatorname{Var}(Y)=\phi\mu$. This doesn't affect the point estimates of the coefficients, but does their standard errors, & hence confidence intervals. Another is to fit a Poisson GLM but use a robust estimate of the coefficients' variance–covariance matrix to calculate their standard errors, as @Nick suggests. Again, this doesn't affect the point estimates of the coefficients. Note that the assumption $\operatorname{Var}(Y)\propto\mu$ is still made during Fisher scoring: though estimates are consistent even if that's not true, they'll be closer on average for a given sample size if it is (this point was skated over rather in the otherwise very good article on the Stata blog ). If the variance–mean relationship is clearly different you could use other GLMs with this estimating-equation approach; in practice, with count data, it tends to be hard to be sure of much more than that it's increasing.
