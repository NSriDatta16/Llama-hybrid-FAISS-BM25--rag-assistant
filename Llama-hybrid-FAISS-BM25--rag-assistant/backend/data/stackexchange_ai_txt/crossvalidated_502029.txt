I think there are possible two questions here: Should you differential weight observations in your regression set up If you do weight observations, is AIC still a valid test criteria? First, yes, you should differentially weight observations when each observation has contains a quantifiably different amount of experience or knowledge. In your example, yes, it makes sense to weight by Number of People . Then, once you have decided to weight, all statistical model assessment should be on this weighted data, including AIC. You AIC results tell you that if you care about predicting observations, or rows in your dataframe correctly, then Normal is better, but if you care about predicting correctly weighted by Number of People , then Gamma is better. Your example here is hopefully contrived because you wouldn't use either a Normal or Gamma distribution, which take continuous variables along all real numbers (Normal) or all positive numbers (Gamma) to model a fraction Average Sales = Sales / Reps . A better modeling setup would be Total Sales = N Reps * GLM(x1, x2) where the GLM can be interpreted as a productivity rate.
