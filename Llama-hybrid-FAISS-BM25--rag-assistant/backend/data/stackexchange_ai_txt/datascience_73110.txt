Measuring the success of text summarization

I am trying to make a text summarization program that will take a text article and reduce it to a para or 2. Since I am a newbie with no idea of NLP, it is hard to approach and break down the problem. So I was wondering if there was a measure that is used to check for effectiveness and correctness of text summarization. I tried googling this, but nothing that suits my purpose. Does something like this even exist? or am I going in the wrong direction?
