If by chance you're working as an Organization Github's teams are designed for this. Create an owner team with just yourself (should be default). Create a developer team, but with read only access to your main repo. The developers can fork your private repo (forks will also be private), and can push to their forks. They cannot push to yours. So, to contribute, they push to their forks send you pull requests.
