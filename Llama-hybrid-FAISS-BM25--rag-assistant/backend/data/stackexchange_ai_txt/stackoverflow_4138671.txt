Combining StateT and State monads

Lets say I have a function f :: State [Int] Int and a function: g :: StateT [Int] IO Int I want to use f in g and pass the state between them. Is there a library function for StateT (return . runState f) ? Or in general, given a monad transformer with a corresponding monad, is there a library function for it?
