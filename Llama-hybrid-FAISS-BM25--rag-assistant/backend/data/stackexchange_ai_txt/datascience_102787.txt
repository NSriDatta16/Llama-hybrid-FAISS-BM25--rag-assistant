Please find the steps below. Encode classes of body types into variables (0, 1, 2, 3). Remove the rows or fill the cells contains Nan values. Remove/Update cells have unrelated data like 10 doors etc. Remove outliers if present in column like speed. Make the data balanced if required. Apply right encoding techniques for every non numeric columns. Perform Standardization and Normalization. If you feel that you really have more columns then apply PCA with 95% variance to reduce the columns count. Apply Random Forest classifier with K-Fold cross validation in whole dataset(before apply PCA) which gives you good accuracy and the importance features. Please feel free to run different algorithms along with hyper-parameters tuning using GridSearchCV.
