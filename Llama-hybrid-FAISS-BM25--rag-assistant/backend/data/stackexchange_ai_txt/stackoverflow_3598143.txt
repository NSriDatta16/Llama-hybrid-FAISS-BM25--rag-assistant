WebKit's Web Inspector , used by Safari and Chrome. Opera's Dragonfly Both do pretty much the same things Firebug does. I'm usually using both Firebug and Web Inspector. Though I like Firebug more, I had a few errors that I wasn't able to trace using it (they were just listed as errors), but they showed up in Web Inspector.
