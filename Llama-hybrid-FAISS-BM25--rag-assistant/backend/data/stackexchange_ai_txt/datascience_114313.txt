How to check the impact of predictive Model

Suppose that I build an email marketing campaign where the goal is to predict which members will make purchases or not and based on that change the marketing email campaigns. After we build the model, let's say we make recommendations to change the body of the marketing emails in a certain way. After one quarter, and having applied these changes, we observe that there is 10% increase in purchases with respect to last quarter or the same quarter last year. How do we know this 10% increase is the result of the model predictive power and the subsequent changes and not any other reason, such as external factors? Should we run A/B testing, if yes, exactly how? How about Hypothesis testing? How should we calculate the sample sizes for a machine learning model?
