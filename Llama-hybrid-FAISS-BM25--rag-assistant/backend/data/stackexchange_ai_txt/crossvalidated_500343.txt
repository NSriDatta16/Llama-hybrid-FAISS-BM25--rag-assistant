Halving time for a population of dice

The following question arose today on a Norwegian facebook forum for math teachers, with some unclear definitions and a lot of simulation. We have a population of $K$ (regular, 6-sided, equal-probability) dice, which are thrown repeatedly (all at once, independently). Each time a dice shows a 6 it is removed from the population before the process continues. What is the distribution of the waiting time before the population size is reduced to $K/2$ (the halving time)? (Or its expectation, median, the question as asked there was unclear about this) ... feel free to assume $K$ is even, or to generalize to the waiting time until population is reduced to some level $m . I can see many ways to attack this (aside from simulation), but I am especially interested in simple, intuitive ways that could be understood without advanced probability. Markov chains seems a way to go, but the simpler the better. (A bonus question: Is there some meaningful limit of this problem when $K \to\infty$ ?) (I am attempting an answer but will first wait to see ...)
