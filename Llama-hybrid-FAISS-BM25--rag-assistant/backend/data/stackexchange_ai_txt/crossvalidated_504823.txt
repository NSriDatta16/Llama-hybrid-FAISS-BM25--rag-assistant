"Weighted average" for medians

I have data that includes ~20 groups with descriptive stats of median, count, and mean for each of the groups. I know that the means are heavily skewed, and I don't have access to the underlying data to remove outliers. What I want to do essentially is find a weighted average of the medians, so I can visualize the relative importance of each of the categories, while using only median and count. What I had done is just take the median * count for each category, then divide by the sum product of median * count for all categories to get a percentage weighting. Is this a "legit" statistical approach? Is there a more direct, or at least easier to explain approach to this. The second step would be to try to apply the weights to the median of all the data points. So if the median is lets say 8, could I apply the weighting from the above approach to this figure of 8. e.g. group 1 has a 20% weight. I can somewhat say then that group 1's "share" of the grand total median is 1.6. Is this feasible? I understand I am really just trying to find a weighted average, but I can't use means and I only have the summary data points, not raw data.
