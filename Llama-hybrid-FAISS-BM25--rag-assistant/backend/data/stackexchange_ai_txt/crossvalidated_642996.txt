I notice 3 things and can't pinpoint the specific reason you got it wrong: I can't help but notice "planned replacement" at $T=12$ is not an inequality. If $T$ is continuously distributed, this probability is exactly 0. Do you actually mean $T \ge 12$ ? Additionally, you ask for the long run average cost per unit time . Supposing 340 was the correct expected cost over the 15 year period, would you not therefore have to divide this quantity by 15 to get the amount? Following up to point 2, your approach assumes that for a 15 year period you would only need 1 replacement. There is of course a non-zero probability you could need 2, 3, 4, or... replacements. You could for instance replace your unit at year 5, and then replace it again at year 10, etc. The text "Probability Models" by Sheldon Ross provides some clever expressions for solving recursive expectations such as this.
