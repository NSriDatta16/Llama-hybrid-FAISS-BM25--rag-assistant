Does Random Forest Regression or Lasso Regression benefit (in terms of accuracy) from predicting multiple outputs at once?

I'm using Random Forest regression and Lasso regression for the task of predicting multiple outputs. I'm using sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor and sklearn.linear_model.Lasso in Python and they support predicting multiple outputs at once instead of creating an estimator for each output (same features for each one). The question is whether I benefit in terms of accuracy? I see for the Random Forest there is a section called multi-output problems ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree-multioutput ) that explain that there can be an improvement in terms of accuracy when the outputs are correlated. what about the case I don't know if they are correlated? Anyway, I will glad to hear more of your knowledge about the way Random Forest solve the "multi-output problems" For the Lasso regression, I didn't find any information about this.
