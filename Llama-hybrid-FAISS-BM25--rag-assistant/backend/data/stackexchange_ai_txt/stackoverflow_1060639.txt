You may also wish to consider the VARRAY type. You do have to work with the entire array (no retreival of subsets, partial updates, etc.) but you can define a max length and Oracle will store only what you use. You can declare VARRAYs of most any datatype, including BINARY_FLOAT or NUMBER. BINARY_FLOAT will minimize your storage, but suffers from some minor precision issues (although important in financial applications). It is in IEEE 754 format. Since you're planning to manipulate the data with PL/SQL I might back off from the BLOB design. VARRAYs will be more convenient to use. BLOBs would be very convenient to store an array of raw C floats for later use in another C program. See PL/SQL Users Guide and Reference for how to use them.
