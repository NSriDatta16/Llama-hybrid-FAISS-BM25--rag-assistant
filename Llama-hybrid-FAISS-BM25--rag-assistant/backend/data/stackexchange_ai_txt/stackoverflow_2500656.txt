Considering that your server side validation method topic_ServerValidate is tied specificly to the checkboxlistCategories field, you do not need to set the ControlToValidate property. The reason that it "blows up" when you add the ControlToValidate property, is the type of the control you are referencing - a CheckBoxList . When assigning a ControlToValidate to any kind of validator, that validator will automatically do a "non empty" check on the referenced control before performing the actual validation logic. If the field is empty, no validation will be done (i.e. validation success). That is, of course, unless you set ValidateWhenEmpty = true . Apparently, the validators do not know how to check if a CheckBoxList is empty, and instead they throw an exception. In your specific case, where the CustomValidator really just serves as non-empty check, you definatly want validator to occur even when the referenced control is left "empty". As stated in the first paragraph of my answer, the simplest way to achieve this is to remove the offending - and unnecessary - property.
