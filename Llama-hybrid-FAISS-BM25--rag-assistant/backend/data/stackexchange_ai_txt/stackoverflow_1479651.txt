Javascript not working in Safari in Mac OSX

I have a payment page where a customer is entering their credit card details. I have removed all of the non-relevant sections. What's weird is that my front-end validation works fine on FF, IE, and Safari for windows. It only is failing on Safari in Mac OSX. Specific user agent strings that have had issues: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/530.19.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.2 Safari/530.19 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Safari/525.22 For some reason, it is not forcing both month and year to be selected before submitting and back end validation is erroring out. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have not been able to reproduce. Here is the code: Month 01 - Jan. 02 - Feb. ....... Year 2009 2010 2011 ......... $(document).ready(function(){ $("#schedule_payment").validate({ submitHandler:function(form) { if ($("#new_card").attr("checked")) { if ($("#expiration_year").val() == "" || $("#expiration_month").val() == "") { alert("Please check the expiration date."); return; } var isExpired = false; if (parseInt("20" + $("#expiration_year").val())
