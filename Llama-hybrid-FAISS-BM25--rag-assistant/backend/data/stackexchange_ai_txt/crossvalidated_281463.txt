Is bias a frequentist concept or a Bayesian concept?

I know that bias is the difference between this estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated. In classical approach the parameter has one particular true value, meanwhile in Bayesian approach the parameter value (is fixed but) is chosen from a probability distribution. But is it Bayesian or frequentist concept?
