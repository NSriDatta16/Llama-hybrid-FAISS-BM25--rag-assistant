I think your model is not complex enough to learn from the CIFAR-10 datasets. You can find CIFAR-10 classification datasets results using different models and activation functions here . Looking from the results, I can see that you will need to use a dense CNN model with Exponential Linear units (ELU) to get better accuracy.
