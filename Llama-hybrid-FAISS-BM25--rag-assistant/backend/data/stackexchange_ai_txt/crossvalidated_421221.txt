Bayesian Inference: Feeding Posterior back in as Prior

I've just started reading about Bayesian Inference, and one thing I've wondered about is if it's possible to feed the posterior in as a new prior for a new model, using the same data. Or would that somehow be redundant, as in it would just accept with itself? I.e - First model: posterior $\propto$ likelihood x prior Second model: newposterior $\propto$ likelihood x posterior EDIT: Maybe it would be helpful if we assume that the prior and likelihood are conjugate priors, which would yield the same distribution family for the posterior and prior.
