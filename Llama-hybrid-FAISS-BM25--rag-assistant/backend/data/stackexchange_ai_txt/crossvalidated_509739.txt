If you are going to calculate the AVERAGE only, you don't need to deal with your unbalanced dataset. Just take the average for Males and Females, separately. If there are some outliers that change the average value significantly, Median may be a better choice. BUT if you want to develop a prediction model, you must perform over/under-sampling on your training dataset, and then develop your model.
