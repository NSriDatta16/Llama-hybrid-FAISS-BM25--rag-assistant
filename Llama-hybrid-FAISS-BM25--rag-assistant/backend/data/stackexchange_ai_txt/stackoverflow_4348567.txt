I'm not exactly sure what you are trying to do, but I'm assuming you want to use hash tags to control page loads like Twitter and Facebook. If that's the case check out this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/116446/what-is-the-best-back-button-jquery-plugin Edit: Here's what was suggested on that post: Asual: http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/ jQuery BBQ: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ History: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/history jQuery hashchange: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/ ReallySimpleHistory: http://code.google.com/p/reallysimplehistory/ Personally, I'd suggest going with Ben Alman's jQuery BBQ as it is cross-browser and very easy to use. Basically: $(window).bind('hashchange', function(e) { // Get the hash (fragment) as a string, with any leading # removed. Note that // in jQuery 1.4, you should use e.fragment instead of $.param.fragment(). var url = $.param.fragment(); }); Source: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/ Another popular one is Sammy.js ( http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/ ) this is actually what Twitter uses.
