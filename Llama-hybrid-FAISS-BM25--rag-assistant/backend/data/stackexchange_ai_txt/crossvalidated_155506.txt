Propensity Score Matching and significance of estimators in logit regression

If I run a logistic regression to calculate a propensity score (i.e. the dependent variable is 0= do not participate in the treatment; 1= do participate) and therefore I want to see the probability a variable affects participation, shouldn't I get non significant effect of my independent variables? If my independent variables prove to be significant, doesn't that mean that there is a bias between my treated group and control group? Thank you !
