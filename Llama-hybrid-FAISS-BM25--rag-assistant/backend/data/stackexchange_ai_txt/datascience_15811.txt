This is just the comment from Emre expanded, but yes you should look into recurrent neural networks for generating text in the style of a given corpus. RNNs and LSTM work really quite well for this. This writeup is widely cited, and to your question, shows how it's pretty easy to generate something like this, given the text of Shakespeare's plays: PANDARUS: Alas, I think he shall be come approached and the day When little srain would be attain'd into being never fed, And who is but a chain and subjects of his death, I should not sleep. Second Senator: They are away this miseries, produced upon my soul, Breaking and strongly should be buried, when I perish The earth and thoughts of many states. If you follow this you can easily run this on your local GPU too to generate text from whatever input poetry you like. I have had pretty good results with 0.1-0.5 dropout, 2 layers, layers of size 512-1024.
