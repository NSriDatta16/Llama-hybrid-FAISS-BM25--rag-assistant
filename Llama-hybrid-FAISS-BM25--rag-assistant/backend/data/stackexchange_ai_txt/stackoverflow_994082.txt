How do you implement the "one step build" for a LAMP project?

Having the "one push build" to take your changes from development environment to live server is one thing that is very nice to have and often advocated. I came on board with a small team running in a LAMP stack and use SVN for version control, currently deployed on a single production server (another server for development and soon to be a separate mysql server). I'm just now putting in place a lot of the organizational things that have been missing prior to me coming on board. I am curious to see how people are doing this (one step build) currently see how i can implement it best for my situation (small team, LAMP environment with SVN) Some particular challenges I'm interested in would be handling database changes (schema) and also if and what kind of "packages" are people using to keep things organized (e.g. RPMs, PEAR, etc.).
