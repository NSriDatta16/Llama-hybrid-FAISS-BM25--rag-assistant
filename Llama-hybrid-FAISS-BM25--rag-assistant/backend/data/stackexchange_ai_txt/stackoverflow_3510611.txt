I'd like to add that for large columns stores, postgresql also takes advantage of compressing them using a "fairly simple and very fast member of the LZ family of compression techniques" To read more about this, check out http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/storage-toast.html It's rather low-level and probably not necessary to know, but since you're using a blog, you may benefit from it.
