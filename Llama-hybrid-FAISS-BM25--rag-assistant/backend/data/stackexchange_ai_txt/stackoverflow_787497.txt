SNMP is certainly an acceptable way to monitor your network, devices and servers. Because it uses UDP it won't unduly stress the network via TCP retries and the like (SNMP clients are, or should be, architected to handle dropped packets etc.). Plus you'll have a huge array of client solutions to monitor your system and integrate against. If you envisage a final solution in Java, see the Java/SNMP documentation and SNMP4J SNMP.com (founded by Jeffrey Case, one of the SNMP architects) sells extensible SNMP agents . One of these may save you a world of grief.
