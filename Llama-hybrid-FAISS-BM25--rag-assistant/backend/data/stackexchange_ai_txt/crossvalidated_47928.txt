I think you are doing 3 mistakes: 1) in the frequentist example, you treat the data as if they were on the "normal" (logarithm) scale, while in the bayesian example, you treat them as on the "lognormal" scale. Supposing the data are on the lognormal scale, you should probably modify your frequentist example to something like: > data1 = c(0.32618457, 0.29166954, 0.27427996, 0.23844847, 0.25148180) > require(MASS) > fitdistr(log(data1), "normal") mean sd -1.29200367 0.11039312 ( 0.04936930) ( 0.03490937) You can run fitdistr(data1, "lognormal") just to see I am not kidding - you will get exactly the same result. IMPORTANT: remember that the mu and tau in bugs and mean and sd in R are parameters of the original normal distribution, and don't confuse them with mean and sd of the lognormal distribution. See here for more info. 2) recommended uninformative prior for tau is dgamma(0.01, 0.01) , for mu is flat normal like dnorm(0, 1.0E-10) 3) sigma is not 1/tau , but sqrt(1/tau) , so you should modify your code ( and your priors ), like this: x[i] ~ dlnorm(mu, tau) ... dnorm(0, 1.0E-10) tau ~ dgamma(0.01, 0.01) sigma
