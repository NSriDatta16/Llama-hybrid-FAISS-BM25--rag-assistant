Time Series - Using log or not?

I am testing some time series on Eviews, which are 10-year treasury constant maturity rate and 3-month treasury bill. I need to test for the order of integration of the former, and the cointegration between them. But I'm not sure whether to transform them into logarithm form or not. I read somewhere that if it's interest rate then we should leave it as it is. Is this correct?
