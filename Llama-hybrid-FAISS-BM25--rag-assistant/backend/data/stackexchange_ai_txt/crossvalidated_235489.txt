XGBoost can handle missing data in the forecasting phase

Recently I have reviewed XGBoost algorithm and I have noticed that this algorithm can handle missing data (without requiring imputation) in the training phase. I was wondering if XGboost can handle missing data (without requiring imputation) when it is used for forecasting new observations or it is necessary to impute the missing data. Thanks in advance.
