The height of the dark element is dynamically calculated based on the contents and size of the pane. Within the jScrollPane js you'd need to adjust the calculation of verticalDragHeight Search for... verticalDragHeight = 1 / percentInViewV * verticalTrackHeight; The trouble is, if you do alter this it could (and probably would) affect the display of the scroll bar under certain circumstances. For example, you wouldn't need a scroll bar if the contents of the pane is smaller than the size of the pane right? Adjusting the verticalDragHeight could effect that determination. Just in case I misunderstood the question, you are defining the height of your pane right? I.e... .scroll-pane { height: 200px; }
