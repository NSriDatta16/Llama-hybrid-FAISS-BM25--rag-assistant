Why my training and testing set are about 99% but my single prediction does wrong prediction?

I have performed fruits classification using CNN but i am paused at a point where all things are going right confusion matrix accuracy score all are correct it seems there is no overfitting but it always classifies wrong fruit. Why would this happen. Link to source code is provided below. Thank You! Github source code link
