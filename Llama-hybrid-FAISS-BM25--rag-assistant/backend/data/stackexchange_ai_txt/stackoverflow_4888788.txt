Are you able to use jQuery? If so, I would look into jQuery UI to handle both your drag and drop events. Since you can make a ghost copy of what you are dragging without disrupting where you drop it. Visual feedback for drag allowing you to show a fake ghost copy. - http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#visual-feedback Visual feedback for when you hover over the droppable area. - http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#visual-feedback
