How well does GAN (generative adversarial network) perform for small samples?

GAN is an unsupervised learning algorithm that pits a discriminator and generator against one another so that they iteratively compete to enhance the overall model's ability to model/replicate a given dataset. So far I have only seen GAN applied in code to very large datasets that have hundreds of thousands of observations. Not restricted to image construction, have there been any studies on how GAN performs (for a density estimation-sampling task or other) when it is only fed a couple thousand or just hundreds of sample observations? If not, and given what we already know about what it is capable of for large sample sizes, what can we theoretically expect in terms of the training and performance of GAN for small datasets?
