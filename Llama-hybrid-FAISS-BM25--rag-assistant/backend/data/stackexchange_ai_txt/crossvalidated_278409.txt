Consistency of Sample Mean in Time Series Data

I'm looking at page 219 of the book "Time Series: Theory and Methods" by Brockwell and Davis , and I can't seem to get my head around one line. Observe that \begin{align*} n\text{Var}(\bar{X}) &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i,j=1}^n \text{Cov}(X_i,X_j) \\ &\vdots \\ &= \sum_{|h| Using the inequality they say If $\gamma(n) \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$ , then $\lim_{n \to \infty}$ $n^{-1} \sum_{|h| $0$ ... Why are those limits equal? I was told it could be showed with Fejer's theorem because it was a Cesaro sum, but wouldn't the book mention this? I am wondering if it's because of something simpler.
