"The information (which eigenvalue corresponds to which original (input) column) is lost." Since each principal component is a linear function of all input variables, each principal component (eigenvector, eigenvalue), corresponds to all of the original input columns. Ignoring possible changes in sign, which are arbitrary in PCA, re-ordering the input variables about will not change the PCA results. "Is there a way to tell matlab to not to sort the eigenvalues?" I doubt it: PCA (and eigen analysis in general) conventionally sorts the results by variance, though I'd note that princomp() sorts from greatest to least variance, while eig() sorts in the opposite direction. For more explanation of PCA using MATLAB illustrations, with or without princomp(), see: Principal Components Analysis
