Great question. Drag0 explained nicely but I agree, something is amiss. It's like looking at a photograph and having to deal with the border. In real life, you can move your eyes to look further; No real borders exist. So it is a limitation of the medium. Besides preserving size, does it matter? I am not aware of a satisfactory answer but I conjecture (unproven) that with experiments on attention and occlusion (partial objects), we don't need the information lost on the borders. If you were to do something smarter (say copy the pixel next to it), it wouldn't change the answer though I have not experimented myself. Padding with 0s is fast and preserves size, so that's why we do it.
