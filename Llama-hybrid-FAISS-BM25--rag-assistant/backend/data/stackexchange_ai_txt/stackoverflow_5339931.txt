strcpy expects you to provide an allocated storage buffer, not just a char* pointer. If you change char q[]=""; to char q[50]; it will work. Since you're only giving strcpy a pointer to a zero length string it doesn't have enough space to store the copied string and overwrites aka corrupts the memory.
