About training and cross validation on a time series problem

I am new to machine learning. I'm having a task of predicting whether a user will churn in March, given February feature data and the churn result. However, March data is leaked and now I'm assigned to predict for April. My strategy is to train the model with February data and perform cross validation with March data. Then I will try to predict April data using model trained with February data. Here are my questions: Is my strategy good? Or should I append both February data and March data to predict April data?
