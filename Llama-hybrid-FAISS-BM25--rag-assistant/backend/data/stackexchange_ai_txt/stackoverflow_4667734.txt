You add components to your potentially reused cell over and over again. You need to move the creation add adding of labels etc. into the if (!cell) { } block and only configure those components afterwards. One way to find the correct UI elements is to look them up by a tag which you assign in that block, another - more elegant way - is to use a custom UITableViewCell subclass altogether with properties to those elements. Edit: And release those views after adding them - or you will just leak them.
