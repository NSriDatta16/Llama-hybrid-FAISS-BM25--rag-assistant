You say PDFsharp but you actually use MigraDoc. Yes, table rendering with MigraDoc Foundation is still slow with version 1.32. Version 1.50 brought huge speed improvements in general and with 1.50 beta 2 we particular tackled slow table rendering. Test results: PDFsharp + MigraDoc WPF 1.32.2608: Average: 24.443 seconds MigraDoc-1.32-patched-release (WPF) from Pakeha: Average: 9.114 seconds PDFsharp + MigraDoc (WPF) 1.50.3638-beta: Average: 16.114 seconds PDFsharp + MigraDoc (WPF) 1.50.3915-beta2: Average: 1.559 seconds See also: https://forum.pdfsharp.net/viewtopic.php?p=9379#p9379
