Determine the symmetrical bounds to capture a certain area under a bell curve

I'm trying to improve a machine learning model. I've modelled a few continuous variables into discrete bins, but I want to make the bins smaller as they approach the mean as to increase sensitivity. For this purpose, I'm making a general purpose function that takes in a value (example: 10%) and returns the positions on a Bell curve under which 10% of the area under the curve lies. The (poorly drawn) picture is likely much clearer than my words. I'm trying to solve for X given a mean, the value that is 3 Standard Deviations away from that mean, and that I want 10% of the area under the curve. I remember taking this in Stats, but I can't remember how to solve it.
