In addition to the excellent answers provided by others, I would like to comment on how time series analyses are used in electrical engineering. A large part of electrical engineering consists of modulating voltages and currents to transmit information, or using sensors to convert a physical signal (such as a sound wave) into an electrical form, from which a computer is expected to make a decision. An analog to digital (A/D) converter translates these signals into a set of evenly-spaced (in time) discrete samples, or a time series! Time series analysis methods are the basis of almost all modern signal processing algorithms. For example, speech processing consists of using a microphone to convert a sound wave to an electrical voltage, which is sampled by an A/D, after which a time series model of the signal is created. For instance, linear predictive coders (LPC) in cell phones create an ARMA model of the words being spoken and transmit the model coefficients (along with an index representing an excitation signal from a pre-defined dictionary) instead of the data samples themselves to achieve data compression.
