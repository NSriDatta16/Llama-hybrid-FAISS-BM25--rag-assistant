How to Purge an MSMQ Outgoing Queue

Is there any way to purge an outgoing queue. It doesn't appear that I can do it with the MMC snap-in and when i try to purge it in code i get an error Format name is invalid the computer it's sending the messages to does not exist, so they will never be sent, however the queues filled up the max storage space for MSMQ so everytime my application tries to send another message i get the insufficient resources exception. I've tried the following formats and they all fail with the exception format name is invalid DIRECT=OS:COMPUTER\private$\queuename OS:COMPUTER\private$\queuename COMPUTER\private$\queuename
