First step is to narrow down your problem. If you take out the UpdatePanel altogether, does it work OK? Also, right off the bat I see that pnlPhoto1Comments.Visible is set to false... ? This is getting set correctly somewhere I suppose, otherwise you wouldn't even get the ItemCommand event. So probably not a problem.
