Some people will report that your app doesn't work, just because they don't understand something. These particular comments you're referring to seems exactly this case. Furthermore, fighting device compatibility for Android apps isn't worthed anymore - the fragmentation gets worse faster and faster, and you simply can't catch up. In a simple app you can be certain that you don't rely on some hardware-specific stuff and you should never bother figuring out what's happening on somebody's Sony-Ericsson, LG, HTC, whatever. Once you start putting if (Build.MODEL.equals("Nexus")) { //... you've got yourself in the fragmentation hell.
