I also don't know how to link the input from the web cam to the variables in the algorithms I've written. I think the most common way for this is to use the machine learning approach: first calculate features from your video stream (like position of color blobs, optical flow, amount of green in image, whatever you like). Then you use supervised learning on labeled data to train models like HMMs, SVMs, ANNs to recognize the labels from the features. The labels are usually higher level things like faces, a smile or waving hands. Depending on the nature of your "variables", they may already be covered on the feature-level, i.e. they can be computed from the data in a known way. If this is the case you can get away without training/learning.
