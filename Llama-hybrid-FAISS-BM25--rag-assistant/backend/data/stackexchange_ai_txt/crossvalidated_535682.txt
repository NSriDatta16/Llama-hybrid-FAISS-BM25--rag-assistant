Your dataset is far too small for split sample validation to be reliable. Use a resampling method such as the bootstrap or 100 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation. You are using logistic regression, which is a probability model, but then you are discarding the probabilities and reverting to a classification system, and using discontinuous accuracy scores that will be fooled by a bogus model. For more see this . For better modeling and validation strategies related to probability models see RMS .
