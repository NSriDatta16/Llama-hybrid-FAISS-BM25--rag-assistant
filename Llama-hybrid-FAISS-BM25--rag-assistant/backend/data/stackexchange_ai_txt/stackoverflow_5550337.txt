Grouping messages to show latest in overview

I'm trying to show messages in an organized way in my rails 3 app. I'm trying to group the messages by a listing id and showing the latest message in that conversation belonging to the listing. I'm trying this syntax in my controller: @messages = Message.all(:conditions => { :recipient_id => current_user.id }, :group => :listing_id, :order => "created_at DESC") This successfully groups together my messages by listing, however it doesn't show the last message within that group. It shows the oldest one. Does anyone know how to accomplish this? I've tried using the :having clause, but to no avail so far.
