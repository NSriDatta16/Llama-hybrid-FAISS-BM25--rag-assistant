You're conflating two usages of bias. In the neural networks literature, "bias" is sometimes used to refer to adding a constant to a neuron. In the broader statistical literature, "bias" (of an estimator) is used to describe the difference between an estimator's expected value and its true value. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator
