A linear transformation on the inputs does not affect the predictive power of a multilinear model, think of it as converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Your model stays the same, although the coefficient attributed to the variable will naturally reflect the normalization. If you are using the norm of the model coefficient to estimate feature importance, you should pay attention to properly normalize your variables and watch for correlations in order to effectively use weight norms as proxy for feature importance.
