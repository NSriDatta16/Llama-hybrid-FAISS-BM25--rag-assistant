Average your three points to get the center of the triangle: center = (a + b + c) / 3 Calculate the normal vector by taking the cross product of two of the sides: normal = (c - a) x (b - a) Normalize the normal vector (make it of unit length): unit_normal = normal / |normal| Scale the normal by the height of regular tetrahedron: scaled_normal = unit_normal * sqrt(2/3) Now, your two points are: top = center + scaled_normal bottom = center - scaled_normal
