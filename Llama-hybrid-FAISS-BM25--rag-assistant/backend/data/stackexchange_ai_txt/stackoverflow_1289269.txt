Okay, figured this out after finding a random bit of information in one of Yahoo's samples. Apparently, if you don't explicitly set the sortedBy field to null after you've made an update, and you've declared the sortedBy option previously, it will keep the previously found sorting order. My guess is some kind of caching so its not performing the same costly client side sorts over and over. So the code that fixed this was the following: var allData = { row: count, appname: String(appName), membercount: Number(memberCount), loggedin: Number(zoneOccupance), peakoccupance: Number(peakOccupance), averageoccupance: Number(averageOccupance) }; sococo.myDataTable.addRow( allData, count ); sococo.myDataTable.set( "sortedBy", null );
