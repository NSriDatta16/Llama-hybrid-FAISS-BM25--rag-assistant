What is the waiting time in a coupon collector problem with coupons in packs?

I am looking for an equation that will let me calculate the waiting time expectation and variance for a coupon collector problem (equal probabilities of coupons) in which coupons come in packs, with no duplicates within a pack. I found a paper by Stadje (1990, The collector's problem with group drawings) but couldn't get through the math. I want this for a biology problem in which, say I have $20$ ($s$) insects moving randomly in groups of $4$ ($m$) and they can form all possible groups, how many encounters will it take on average for one insect to meet 18 ($n=l$) of the other 19. I would like to calculate the expected time and $95\%$ CI for varying $s$ and $n$. I saw a similar question at How many stickers do I need to complete my FIFA Panini album? but that does not have the waiting time equation. Thanks very much. V
