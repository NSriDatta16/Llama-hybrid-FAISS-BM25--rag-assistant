Mac Create Alias for DMG File without fixed user in it

I want to put an alias to a fixed folder, namely the iWorks template folder into a DMG. The directory is /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My Templates My Problem is, that I want to put it into a DMG so people can easily install the template. But while it works fine with the Application folder, the template folder always has my username in it. So if someone else opens it, the alias points to the dir with my username, which of course does not exist on a different mac. Does anyone have any idea how to fix it? Thanks. Combining all of your comments to the following I get a droplet working the way I want. on open thefiles set outputFolder to (path to application support folder from user domain as text) & "iWork:Pages:Templates:My Templates:" do shell script "/bin/mkdir -p " & quoted form of POSIX path of outputFolder tell application "Finder" duplicate thefiles to outputFolder end tell end open The Problem is, while it works on my mac, I can not use it being inside the DMG file. I can not Drag anything on it. Any ideas? Thanks so far.
