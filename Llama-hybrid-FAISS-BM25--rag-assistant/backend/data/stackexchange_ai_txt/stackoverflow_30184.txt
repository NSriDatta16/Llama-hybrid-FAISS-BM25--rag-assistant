Winforms - Click/drag anywhere in the form to move it as if clicked in the form caption

I am creating a small modal form that is used in Winforms application. It is basically a progress bar of sorts. But I would like the user to be able to click anywhere in the form and drag it to move it around on the desktop while it is still being displayed. How can I implement this behavior?
