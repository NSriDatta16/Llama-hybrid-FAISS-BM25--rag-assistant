I assume you are talking about other private/public functions of the class which is being initialized. Like anywhere else, I would say decomposing large complicated behavior into sub functions is good practice. The obvious complication would be calling functions which rely on as-yet un-initialized content of the object. Since the constructor and the other functions are in the class have the same visibility (from a code maintainability point of view) I don't think it is unreasonable to say that it is ok to leverage other functions but necessary for the programmer to ensure that such circular dependencies are avoided (like virtual functions).
