I think that what you're stuck on is this: When does the reverse happen? What gets assigned to the variable idea ? The key thing is that everything on the right happens before the assignment. So if you chain a bunch of methods on the right, then what gets assigned is the final result of the chain. Play with it a little in irb and see: >> input = gets.chomp.reverse fooboo => "ooboof" >> input = gets.chomp.reverse.upcase fooboo => "OOBOOF" What might also be tripping you up is that Ruby's string method reverse returns a reversed string, but it doesn't actually change the string it's called on. To change the string itself, as others have said, you need the reverse! method. This is a pattern in the language. (This can be a gotcha, and there are similar gotchas in other languages. For example sort @array in Perl returns a reversed array but doesn't change @array 's order.)
