I would use the unequal variance t-test (default t.test in R) here, and I think the full-credit answer would go through why you elected against z-testing and equal-variance t-testing even though you know the variances and know that they’re equal. The reason why I’d go with t over z is that, yes, you know the population standard deviations, but you also know the population means! If you’re going to take the simulation parameters as known, there’s no hypothesis testing to do. You know, with certainty , that the first asset has lower average returns than the second. If you don’t know that, then you shouldn’t be able to say that you know the standard deviations. Put another way, if your teacher just gave you two data sets that she generated form your code, but you did not know the generation process, you would proceed with an unequal-variance t-test (aka Welch’s t-test).
