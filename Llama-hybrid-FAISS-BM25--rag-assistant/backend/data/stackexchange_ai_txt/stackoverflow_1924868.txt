Yes and no... yes, you can now run asp.net on Linux via Mono. However, I think in practice you will find many more platform specific limitations than you would with similar Java applications. I rarely see major platform specific issues even in average quality software written in Java. With ASP.Net, you'll routinely see apps and third party libraries that barely work on Mono, or just don't work at all. The porting effort may not be high, but its much higher than similar Java applications, in my experience.
