GNU Emacs can do it as well (if you don't mind Emacs Lisp and the uncommon GUI). It still uses the old POSIX Regex syntax, not the new Perl one (which means you have to escape capturing group parentheses). Search ^\(.\) Replace by \,(upcase \1) and you are done. You can of course do it interactively, and you can also call your own Lisp macros from there, of course.
