partial rendering of a large table in jQuery

I have a table with about 5,000 rows which I build dynamically with jQyuery. I was wondering if there is a way to display the rows in chunks as the table is being built, until finally showing all of the rows? I have tried this but with no luck. So far I have tried the following: a) Creating the stubs b) Getting the total rows and dividing them into smaller chunks. c) Injecting the first chunk into the table and embedding a call to a function in the last row to call the next batch of data to load). Unfortunately, even this way it wants to wait until everything renders. Is there a way around this?
