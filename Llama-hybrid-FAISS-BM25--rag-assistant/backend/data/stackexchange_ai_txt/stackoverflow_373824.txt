As long as the function that your application will be serving is general, I'd say it is safe to rely on Javascript. One of the sites that I manage receives ~35,000 UV's on a good day. I think it is fair to say we come in contact with quite a variety of browser and operating system combinations. According to our stats, roughly 97% of our users have Javascript enabled. If it can fail elegantly without Javascript, I'd opt for that solution, but I wouldn't lose sleep over the fact that you might be losing a few people everyday.
