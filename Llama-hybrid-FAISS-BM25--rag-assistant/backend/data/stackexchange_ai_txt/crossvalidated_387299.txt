new data is wrongly labelled same weight on the old and new "concepts" Likely need to detect and adapt to concept drift and/or imbalanced data . "Prequential AUC for Classifier Evaluation and Drift Detection in Evolving Data Streams" http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dbrzezinski/publications/PrequentialAUC_LNCS.pdf "we advocate the use of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in imbalanced data stream settings and propose an efficient incremental algorithm that uses a sorted tree structure with a sliding window to compute AUC using constant time and memory" The Apache MOA framework implements prequential evaluation of machine learning models (as opposed to holdout evaluation in batch/traditional learning).
