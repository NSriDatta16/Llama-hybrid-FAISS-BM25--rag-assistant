In short, ESVM model is an ensemble of SVMs trained to distinguish each single training set element from all the rest, while OSVM is an ensemble of SVMs trained to distinguish each subset of training elements that belong to one class. So, if you have 300 cat and 300 dog examples in the training set, ESVM will make 600 SVMs, each for one pet while OSVM will make two SVMs (first for all cats, second for all dogs). This way, ESVM does not need to find a space in which the whole class clusters but rather a space in which this single element is an outlier, which is likely simpler and leads to a high precision. Recall is said to be provided by the ensemble.
