How do I correctly performance test SELECT queries with Oracle?

I would like to test two queries to find out their performance as apposed to just looking at the execution plan. I have seen Tom Kyte do this all the time on his website as a way to gather evidence on his theories. I believe there are many pitfalls in performance testing, for example, when i run a query in SQL developer for the first time, that query might return some fair number. Running that exact same query again, returns instantaneously. There must be some sort of caching on the server or client going on and I understand this is important - however I am only interested in non cached performance. What are the guidelines to performance test? AND how do I write a performance test which repeats the query? Do i just write an anonymous block & loop? How do i get timing information, averages, medians, std deviations?
