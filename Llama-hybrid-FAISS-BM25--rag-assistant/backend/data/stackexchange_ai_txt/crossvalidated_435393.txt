could someone please give a concrete example to illustrate the Dirichlet distribution prior for bag-of-words?

I am aware of the notion of the Dirichlet distribution , a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution. To get parameters of the Dirichlet distribution prior for bag-of-words, this CMU Machine Learning Course gives an approach by computing word frequencies. that course also gives this example, to give the parameters of the Dirichlet distribution prior for the word "aardvarks", it is reasonable to look at a hundred million webpages, and counts how many times the word "aardvarks" shows up. so far so good to me, and then that course says at 46:09 the number of total hallucinated words will be 50,000. which is NOT convincing, the value of 50,000 is the number of vocabulary of most adults who speak English fluently , rather than the total number of words in those a hundred million webpages. am I missing something? could someone please give a concrete example to illustrate this approach with a particular dataset, such as 20 newsgroups dataset ?
