video storage

I am working on an .net client server application, a new requirement is to allow user upload/copy videos into the system, there will be about 50 videos (500 MB each) per year. The application stores data in SQL 2005, but obviously storing the half GB video in SQL server is not great idea. Any suggestion on how to manage the upload/copy and storage of the videos? Is there any existing commercial package/solution which can be easily integrated in? Thanks in advance.
