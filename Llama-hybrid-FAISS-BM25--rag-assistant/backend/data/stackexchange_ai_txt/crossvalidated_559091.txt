Using hyperopt for finding n_estimators for ensemble model?

I am trying to tune my model (An ensemble model with xgboost, lightbgm and catboost) with hyperopt, but I don't know how to find the optimal n_estimators value. When I use the best_parameters returned by fmin to train the model, apparently I have to find the optimal n_estimator value (through trial and error) that recreates the smallest loss. Is there any way to know at which iteration I get that lowest loss?
