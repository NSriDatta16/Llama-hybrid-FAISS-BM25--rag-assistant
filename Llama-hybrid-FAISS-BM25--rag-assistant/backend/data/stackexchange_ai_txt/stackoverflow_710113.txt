How are you storing information about the controls you need to restore? If you are using ViewState or ControlState, then I don't see how load could affect things. That's how any of the composite controls do things. I will say that I saw your second error while using the Infragistics UltraWebGrid, and never was able to track it down. From the call stack, it appeared that EnsureChildControls was being called during the Load phase (or maybe LoadViewState).
