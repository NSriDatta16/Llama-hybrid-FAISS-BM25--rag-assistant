they are instead being treated as if /user is a real directory and as if /user/username is a valid file and exists (which it does not). What exactly do you mean like this? What does it show? Do you want to rewrite or **redirect? Rewrite = call www.site.com/index.php?Agent=username when the user enters www.site.com/user/username Redirect = redirect the user to the other URL so their address field says www.site.com/index.php?Agent=username Right now, your code should rewrite, not redirect, which is probably what you want. Just checking... Your problem might be that the username you're testing with contains capital letters. Add NC to make the match case insensitive. RewriteRule ^user/([a-z]+)$ index.php?Agent=$1 [QSA,NC] If you want to allow other characters than just the letters a-z, you can either add more characters to character class, or just write (.+) to match any character. Edit As per the question below, I think the infinite redirect happens because the rule is triggered again (and again) because the rewrites matches the new index.php request. Simply checking that the target of the redirect isn't a file should solve that. (-f = "is file". ! = negate condition.) RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
