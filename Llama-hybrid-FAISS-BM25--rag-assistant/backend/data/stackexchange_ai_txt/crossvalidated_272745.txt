How does one evaluate a prediction confidence for an SVM?

For an SVM classifier, how can I get the confidence of each prediction ? I thought of adding a "unknown" class, but I don't quite see how to do it ( what values ?) While theory is highly appreciated, I would be glad if you can give me hint(s) on how to do it in scikit-learn.
