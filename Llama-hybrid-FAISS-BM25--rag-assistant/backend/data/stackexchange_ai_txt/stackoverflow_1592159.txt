Robert Allison has a large and fantastic collection of examples using SAS/Graph that include, among other things, geocoding locations, drill-down, dashboards, etc. SAS code for each example is shown as well so you can find something similar to what you want your output to look like and tweak his examples to fit your needs. If you are not familiar with the SAS macro facility yet, you will definitely want to learn the basics to make your life much easier. CSV files can be read into SAS directly with a data step or with the import procedure. Search through the SAS-L newsgroup as well as it has been around for years and someone has likely already asked whatever issue you might be facing. In general, the more specific you can make your question here, the more helpful we can be.
