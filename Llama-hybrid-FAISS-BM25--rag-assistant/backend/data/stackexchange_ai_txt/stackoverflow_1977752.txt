I suggest Juce . It's elegant, cross-platform, fast, well-written, almost totally bug-free and is identical to the last pixel on every platform it runs on. The number of known bugs is nearly always zero, since when a bug report is filed, the author drops everything and fixes it! The Register wrote an article about it a while ago which gives a rather good overview of the library.
