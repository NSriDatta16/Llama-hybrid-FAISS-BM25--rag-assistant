Here's how I worked around this problem. I embedded a directory list and file list in my form and setup a mouse click listener for the file list. I have it configured to only show image files and as soon as you click an image, it gets set as the picturebox image. It's not drag and drop, but pretty darn close. The most important thing is it works regardless of privilege level of the app.
