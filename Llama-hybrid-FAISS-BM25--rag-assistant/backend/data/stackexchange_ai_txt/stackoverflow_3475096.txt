Works fine for me. Have you checked that the script and esp. the code in question is executed at all? E.g. add some unconditional debug-output to the script. Or install a debugger like XDebug to step through the code and inspect variables. absolute_path; echo "debug: "; var_dump($url); echo $url; } } $page = new PageClass(); $page->absolute_path = "http://localhost:8888/smile2/organic/"; echo "debug: page->get_absolute_path\n"; $page->get_absolute_path();
