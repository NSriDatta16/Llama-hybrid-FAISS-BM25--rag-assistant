The storage services tend to make the most sense when the data is read/served many multiples of times more then it is written/stored. The situation you describes sounds like a good use case for one of the hosted server options (EC2, Rackspace, etc.) but you may also want to look into Google App Engine since it provides you some free service before you incur any cost. That will let you develop an app without requiring any investment, especially since you don't yet know what the future usage rate of your app will be. In any of these environments you could create a web service that allows clients to connect via http / REST to store information.
