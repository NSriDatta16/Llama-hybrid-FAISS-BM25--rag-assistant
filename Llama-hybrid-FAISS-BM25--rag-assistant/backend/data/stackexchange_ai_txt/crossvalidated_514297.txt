First off, here is a recreation of your plot with a black body radiation palette, which makes the temporal dynamics a bit easier to see (all R code at the bottom): This does seem to support your thoughts. Here are time series of the estimated parameters per year: The means seem to have a clear downward trend. The standard deviations and the degrees of freedom do not really show a clear trend. As a final plot, here are your raw data per year, with beanplots superimposed: So, as to your questions: There are different possibilities of varying complexity. The first idea would be to fit distributions to each year's data, as you did, and then use a standard forecasting method (I recommend Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman ) to forecast each parameter separately. In the present case, for instance, ets sees multiplicative errors and no trends in all three parameters, since your time series are quite short. The mean, though, gets a very high estimated smoothing parameter. The second idea would be to forecast each company's loss separately, then fit a distribution to the forecasted losses. In both cases, you could account for the uncertainty in the forecasts by calculating density forecasts for whatever you are forecasting (parameters or company losses, respectively), then sampling from these and fitting a distribution to the sample. Per above, forecasting the parameters seems like a reasonable thing to do. (But see below.) Visual inspection suggests that the distributions do indeed change over time. I could think of many possible tests you could do. For instance, you could test whether there was a downward linear trend in the means, or a general (not necessarily linear) trend, using a correlation test between the mean and time with Kendall's or Spearman's correlation. You could use an ANOVA on company $\times$ year and test for a main effect of year. You could forecast the last year's density in any of the ways discussed above, assess it using proper scoring rules and check whether the scores are significantly better than if you had disregarded the temporal structure in the historical data (e.g., using a permutation test). Again judging from the plots, and noticing that the high losses typically stem from the same companies, I would say that descriptively you are right. I don't see how you could formally test it, though... State space forecasts or panel data methods would be an interesting alternative to the simple methods discussed above. Finally, one thing comes to mind: as you write, you have little data - just 34 companies over 9 years. Also, there are a number of high values that may have a strong influence on your distribution fitting. Fitting a general t distribution for each year requires three parameters for each year (the mean, the standard deviation and the degrees of freedom). That is more than I would be comfortable with. I would recommend you look at more parsimonious distributions, like the gamma with only two parameters, or the exponential as a special case of the gamma with only one parameter.
