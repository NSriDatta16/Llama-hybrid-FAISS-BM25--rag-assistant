Indeed $P_{ij} = \frac{q_{ij}}{q_j}$ for $i\ne j$, so the transition matrix for the embedded Markov chain is $$ P=\pmatrix{ 0&1&0\\ \frac12&0&\frac12\\ \frac12&\frac12&0 }. $$ The holding time for state $0$ has $\mathsf{Exp}(1)$ distribution since $q_{01}=1$ and $q_{02}=2$. The holding time for state $1$ has $\mathsf{Exp}(2)$ since $q_{10}=q_{12}=1$ and the minimum of two independent exponential random variables is again exponential with rate equal to the sum of the two. A similar argument shows that the holding time for state $2$ has $\mathsf{Exp}(4)$ distribution.
