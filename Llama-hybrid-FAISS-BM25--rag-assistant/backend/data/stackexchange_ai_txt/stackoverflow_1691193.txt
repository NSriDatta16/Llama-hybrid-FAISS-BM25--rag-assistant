Another useful introduction in writing and maintaining large unit test suites might be this book (which is partially available online): XUnit Test Patterns , Refactoring Test Code by Gerard Meszaros The book is organized in 3 major parts.

Part II describes a number of "test smells" that are symptoms of problems with how we are automating our tests. Part III contains descriptions of the patterns.
