little help with some tsql

Given following table: rowId AccountId Organization1 Organization2 ----------------------------------------------- 1 1 20 10 2 1 10 20 3 1 40 30 4 2 15 10 5 2 20 15 6 2 10 20 How do I identify the records where Organization2 doesn't exist in Organization1 for a particular account for instance, in the given data above my results will be a single record which will be AccountId 1 because row3 organization2 value 30 doesn't exist in organization1 for that particular account.
