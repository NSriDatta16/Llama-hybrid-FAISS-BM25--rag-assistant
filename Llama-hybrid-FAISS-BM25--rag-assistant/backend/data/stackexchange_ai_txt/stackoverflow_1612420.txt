Drupal MultiSite, Multiple Sites or Organic Groups

I am using Drupal for a project but am not sure on the best way to implement the following. I have one main site with it's own look and feel. I want another site with certain members of the main site in it. It should have it's own look and feel. It should have both public and private conent. What out of the folling would you do. Use MultiSite and share the users table Use Mutliple Sites and find a way of linking the users. Use one site and use Organic groups. Kind Regards Rupert
