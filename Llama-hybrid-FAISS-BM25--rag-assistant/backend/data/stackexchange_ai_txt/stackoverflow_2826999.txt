The fast answer is that there is no complete list of those tags. Magento doesn't use a strict grammar for XML files because they can be extended without any trouble. Looking at the 1.4 codebase, I performed the following command from a terminal: cd /path/to/magento grep -r global/ . 2>/dev/null | grep -v pearlib | grep php | sort And got back about 75 lines where the global config path is invoked specifically. Some of these are simple: global/page/layouts global/pdf/totals global/template/email global/payment/cc/types And others are far more obscure: global/catalog/product/type/configurable/allow_product_types global/helpers/core/encryption_model global/widget/related_cache_types On top of that, there are several which are invoked dynamically, such as your mentioned routers, rewrites, etc: global/models/'.$model.'/resourceMode global/'.$groupType.'s In fact, I even found 4 references in my own extension code that added to the global space. Knowing all that, a complete reference of valid global tags would be a misnomer, and will likely change even during minor updates. To your last point, you cannot go forward with complete assurance that you will be in compliance w/ Magento's configuration model. Do your best to use the objects that are provided with the library, use samples from the rest of the app when possible, and forge ahead bravely when no help is given. :) Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
