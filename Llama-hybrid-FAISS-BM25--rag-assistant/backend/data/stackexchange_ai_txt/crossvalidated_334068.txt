So the expected value for the number of trials seems to be indeed ∑24i=1124⋅i=124⋅24⋅252=12.5 . ... But unlike most situations, where one imagines the average to be also close to the most frequent case, here it seemed that the number of burglars who would get in very quickly would be roughly the same as the number of those who struggle to get in, and as the number of those who try about 12-13 times. Most (or at least many) real-life situations involve a probability that is bell-shaped (e.g., the Normal distribution), where the mode of the distribution is indeed close (or equal) to its mean. However, the uniform distribution is, well, uniform - the expected outcome is just as likely as any other one. How would you use the data from, say, 1000 people who entered the building, to decide if any of them probably actually did not know the code and just tried them out until they found the correct one This is a case which is presumably exactly the opposite - the distribution of attempts on the code (since it involves mostly people who know the code), is concentrated toward the mean. The distribution is probably similar to a geometric distribution with high $p$: : This gives a number of easy ways to detect unauthorized intrusion: flag the top $x$ percentile of attempt tries, flag attempts that are more than $\alpha > 1$ the expected number, or fit the distribution to a known expectation (e.g., the geometric one), and flag low-probability events.
