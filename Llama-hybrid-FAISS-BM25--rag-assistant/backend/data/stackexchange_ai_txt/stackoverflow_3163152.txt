You can either: Use a CDATA block instead (just make sure you're using the correct encoding, i.e., the encoding of the XML file matches the encoding of the data). The only think you have to lookout for is ]]> , which cannot be put literally in a CDATA block. Use mb_encode_numericentity instead of htmlentities (possibly combined with htmlspecialchars and a previous decoding of html entites with mb_convert_encoding ). If the encoding of the XML file is UTF-8, you can just remove the entities. Suppose you have the following HTML fragment: &copy; 2005 John Doe Then, you could just do: $data = "&copy; 2005 John Doe"; $data = mb_convert_encoding($data, "UTF-8", "HTML-ENTITIES"); $data = htmlspecialchars($data, ENT_NOQUOTES, "UTF-8");
