One option would be to store the hash (SHA1, MD5) of the password instead of the clear-text password, and whenever you want to see if the password is good, just compare it to that hash. If you need secure storage (for example for a password that you will use to connect to a service), then the problem is more complicated. If it is just for authentication, then it would be enough to use the hash.
