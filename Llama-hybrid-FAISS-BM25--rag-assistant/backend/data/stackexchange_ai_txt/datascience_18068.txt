Reducing the dimensionality of a dataset with PCA does not only benefits humans trying to look at the data in a graspable number of dimensions. It is also useful for machine learning algorithms to be trained on a subset of dimensions. Both to reduce the complexity of the data and the computational cost of training such machine learning model.
