The definition of a CDF requires that a random variable take values in a totally ordered set. However, the defining property of a categorical random variable is that its values are non-orderable. Therefore, CDF's do not exist for categorical RV's. That said, if your primary interest is to provide a graphical representation of your data, you might want to look to the probability mass function instead. In order to present the PMF, you'll want to organize your data so that the probabilities are arranged in decreasing order. This approach is commonly used in fields like text mining. The R script below illustrates how to do this: K If you really wanted, you could generate something akin to a CDF by taking the cumulative sum of the ordered estimated PMF. However, I would imagine that you'd lose some of the visual appeal by doing that.
