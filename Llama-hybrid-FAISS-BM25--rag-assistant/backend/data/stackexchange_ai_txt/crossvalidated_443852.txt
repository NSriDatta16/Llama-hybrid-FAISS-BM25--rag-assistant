Dynamic Time Warping Univariate Time Series to aid in selecting Forecasting Model

I have approximately 174 univariate time series that I would like to forecast. These are all country observations that have been thoroughly cleaned with no outliers or missing values. I would like to fit each time series to the appropriate forecasting method with "enough care" that I can. This may be a little laborious. Can I speed my forecasting selection/ by checking if similarities exist with different countries? And from that stage choose appropriate forecasting techniques for each clustered group of countries? The end goal is not accurate forecasting but rather trend analysis I have read from here that Dynamic Time Warping may be the optimal time series clustering solution.
