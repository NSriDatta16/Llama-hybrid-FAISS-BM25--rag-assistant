Adding more samples to ordinary regression is equall to ridge regression

I am a beginner in machine learning. I have a question why adding more samples to a data set is equal to adding regularization term to the ordinary least squares loss function? (In other words why can I add more samples to my data set and solve OLS instead of solving ridge regression?)
