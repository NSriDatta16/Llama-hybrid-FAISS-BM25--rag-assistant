Using WF3 you can't really do that. You can create custom composite activities and add new acitivities to them on when using them but they cannot already contain predefined activities and "template holes". The way activities like the IfElseAcitivity appears to do this is by adding the default 2 branches at the time you drag the activity onto the design surface. This is done by adding a custom ActivityToolboxItem to your activity class.
