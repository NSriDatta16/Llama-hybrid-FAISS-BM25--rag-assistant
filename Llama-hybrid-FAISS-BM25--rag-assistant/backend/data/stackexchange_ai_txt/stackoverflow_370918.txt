Organize your source directory so that each functionality has only one place where it should be and it's easy to find something. Make sure to share naming convention to prevent duplication. Design your module so that they do one thing only - and do it well. Review the code to make sure names and locations are correct. Provide a efficient search engine based on a code indexer so that it's easy to look if there is already a function doing a peculiar task. Don't underestimate the time to generalize an existing component so that it can effectively be reused. Document the modules, with API documentation an/or unit-tests. Communicate within the Team so that every one has a good grasp of what has possibly been already written, who has or knows who may have working on/used a module.
