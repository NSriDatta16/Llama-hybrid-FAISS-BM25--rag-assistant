Missing Websphere NodeAgent JMX MBean

I am trying to run the sample code from IBM ( sample code link ) to connect to Websphere Application Server v7.0 through a JMX client. I could successfully connect to the Websphere MBeanServer by jconsole, and could see two domains exist (JMImplementation and WebSphere). However, I found that there is no NodeAgent MBean as specified in the sample code with ObjectName pattern WebSphere:type=NodeAgent,node= ,* . Does anybody know why the NodeAgent MBean is not there?
