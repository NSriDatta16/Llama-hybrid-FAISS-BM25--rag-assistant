Time series and Machine Learning : test/training sets

A common practice in Machine/statistical Learning is to split up the dataset into a test and training set. However, 2 of my textbooks on time series analysis never do this, they apply the TS algorithms on the entire dataset to predict the next datapoint in the series. Does anyone know why this is the case? I.e, the reason for the difference in approaches?
