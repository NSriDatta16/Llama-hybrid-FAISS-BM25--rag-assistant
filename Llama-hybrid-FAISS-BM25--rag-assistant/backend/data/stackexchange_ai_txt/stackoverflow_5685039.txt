Upload a file with web2py on Google App Engine

I have a problem deploying my application written in web2py on Google App Engine. Everything works well on localhost, but on GAE I cannot access the content of an uploaded file. When I check the request.vars.my_upload_field var on localhost, I get: FieldStorage('upload_field', 'my_file.txt', 'File content') But on GAE I only have: FieldStorage('upload_field', 'my_file.txt') No file content... I did not do anything special (I believe...) Why do I have such behaviour and how to fix it? PS: I am using a SQLForm(db.my_table) that has an 'upload' field.
