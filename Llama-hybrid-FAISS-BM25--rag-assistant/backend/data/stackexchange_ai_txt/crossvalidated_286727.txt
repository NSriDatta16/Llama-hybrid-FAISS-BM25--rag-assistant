I believe taking average of your samples or not will not change your results significantly. A usual Mid-IR spectrum contains 2000+ variables (with the resolution of the instruments in my lab, at least) and modelling that much variable with 10 samples (even if the they have 2 spectra for each sample) does not sound good. The best option would be to increase the number of samples. Working with this small amount of samples is very very risky, you may end up with "good looking" model just by chance. Second option is to assigning only few samples to the test set including their replicate measurements. If you put their replicate measurements to your original model you are likely to end up with an overfitted model, as you mentioned. Thus, if I have to, I would assign 3 samples (all 6 spectra, without averaging) of them to the validation set and the remaining 7 samples(their 14 spectra without averaging) to the calibration set and carry out the cross-validation step. After finding optimal number of components, test your model on validation set. Also if you are modelling, say, concentration, then I would make sure that the samples having highest and lowest concentration are included in calibration set. Edit: Also check this question where @cbeleites provides a paper and some intuition about the small sample size problem.
