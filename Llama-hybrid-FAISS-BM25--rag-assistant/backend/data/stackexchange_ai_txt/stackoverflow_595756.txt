UIScrollView touches don't seem to work

I used the "View-based Application" template in Xcode for an iPhone project and went into the view controller's XIB. I changed the view from a basic UIView to a UIScrollView , and now the method (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; never gets called. I have an NSLog statement in there. It gets called just fine when the controller's view is a UIView , so what's different/special about UIScrollView s that you don't receive touch events? How can I respond to a touch event?
