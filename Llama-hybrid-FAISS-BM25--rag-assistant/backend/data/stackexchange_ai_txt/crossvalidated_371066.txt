R - cv.glm$delta vs. semi-manual calculation of mean squared error

I went to https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action?file=LoanStats.csv and downloaded the file LoanStats_2017Q4.csv. I sampled 2% of the data and ran it through some cleaning (177 lines of code that removed qualitative variables, set the string binaries to a numeric 1/0, turned strings into numbers, removed obvious linear combinations, and omitted records with "na"s in them) to go from a 118648x145 data file to 1818x71. I'm attempting to predict "int_rate" based on the other variables. Per request here is the cleaning code I used to generate my 1818x71 dataset from the full size dataset. setwd("[Your_storage_location") project_data I started with a regular linear regression. pd.lm.reg And then did a semi-manual calculation of the MSE. y.lm.reg $int_rate)^2) #13580.01149 mean((y.lm.reg - project_data_reduced$ int_rate)^2) #7.469753293 The calculated mean square error is 7.469753293. Then, I wanted to show the usefulness of cross-validation, so I ran the leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) in R. pd.glm.fit This gives the values #[1] 657,733,987.4 657,372,197.6 If I do a 10-fold validation like this set.seed(42) pd.cv.err.10 Then I get delta values of #[1] 771,478,014.5 694,245,342.8 My understanding of the above code is that without specifying the cost function it is the case that the cv.glm function will automatically use an MSE calculation. In addition the documentation says that the \$delta term is the cross-validation estimate of the error. But the cross-validation estimates are roughly 8 orders of magnitude (10^8) times bigger than the calculated MSE. That doesn't seem right. Even if they were giving the total error rather than the mean then the mean values would be > pd.cv.err.1818 $delta/1818 [1] 361789.8721 361590.8677 > pd.cv.err.10$ delta/10 [1] 77147801.45 69424534.28 Why am I getting so vastly different numbers when doing the calculation manually vs. asking the cross-validation algorithm to look at it? Am I misusing the code? Am I calculating something incorrectly? Does the $delta term actually mean something different than the MSE estimate after cross-validation?
