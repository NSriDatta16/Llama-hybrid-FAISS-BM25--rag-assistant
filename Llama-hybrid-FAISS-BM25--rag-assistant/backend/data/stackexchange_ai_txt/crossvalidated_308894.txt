You will want to build a regression model for this. The proper way is to use a Transfer Function modelling process as described in Chapter 11 of the Box-Jenkins textbook . I can summarize for you..... The procedure for transfer function model identification outlined by Box and Jenkins uses the cross correlations between two prewhitened series to tentatively identify model form. The first step to this process is to develop an ARIMA model for each of the user-specified input time series in the equation. Each series must then be made stationary by applying the appropriate differencing and transformation parameters from its ARIMA model. The stationary time series are, in turn, "prewhitened". Prewhitening refers to the process of applying a given set of autoregressive and moving average factors to a stationary series. The stationary output series is prewhitened by the input series AR and MA factors. If there is more than one input series, then the stationary output series is prewhitened once for each different input. Prewhitening is necessary because it removes the intrarelationship in the individual series. This allows you to more accurately assess the interrelationship between the input and the output series. The cross correlations between the prewhitened input and output reveal the extent of this interrelationship. The cross correlations can be converted to estimates of the impulse response weights or regression weights. The pattern in the impulse response weights indicate can suggest a tentative transfer function model. By applying these impulse response weights to the input series to predict the output series,one can generate a preliminary estimate of the noise series. Following the rules for ARIMA model identification, the patterns in the autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations of the tentative noise process give clues as to the initial form of the noise model. Given the identified transfer function and noise model, one can proceed to the model estimation/diagnostic checking phase.
