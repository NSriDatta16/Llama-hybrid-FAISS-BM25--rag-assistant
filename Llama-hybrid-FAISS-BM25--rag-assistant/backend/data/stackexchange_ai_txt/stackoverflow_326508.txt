It depends on how you want to generate your terrain. For example, you could procedurally generate it all (using interpolation of a low resolution terrain/height map - stored as two "bitmaps" - with random interpolation seeded from the xy coords to ensure that terrain didn't morph), and use minimal storage. If you wanted areas of terrain that were completely defined, you could store these separately and use them where appropriate, randomly generating the rest.) If you want completely defined terrain, then you're going to need to look into some kind of compression/streaming technique to only pull terrain you are currently interested in.
