Machine Learning: Does it improve the loss if you increase your learning rate when your loss is stagnant?

My model loss is quite stagnant, although there is a very mild decrease. Would it help if I increased the learning rate suddenly to get it out of the local optima? is this a valid strategy? Also, if I got into a bad local optima initially due to too low a learning rate after decaying, does it make sense to have a lower decay rate or should I just change the learning rate to a higher one manually?
