If there was a true 1:1 relationship, every record in the first table would have a corresponding record in the second table and vice-versa. In that case, you would probably just want to make one table (unless you needed some strange storage optimization). This is very incorrect. Let me give you an example. You have a table CLIENT that has a 1:1 relationship with table SALES_OFFICE because, for example, the logic of your system says so. Would you really incorporate the data of SALES_OFFICE into CLIENT table? And if another tables need to relate them selfs with SALES_OFFICE? And what about database normalization best practices and patterns? A foreign key column with the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints that references a UNIQUE, NOT NULL column in another table creates a 1:(0|1) relationship, which is probably what you want. The first part of your answer is the right answer, without the second part, unless the data in second table is really a kind of information that belongs to first table and never will be used by other tables.
