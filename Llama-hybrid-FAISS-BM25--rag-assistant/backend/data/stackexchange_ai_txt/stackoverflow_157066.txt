I would use a spreadsheet editor to make a set of SQL statements. Put a new column at the start and add insert into tablename values(' . Add other columns to seperate the data with code like '',' . Finish with ''); . Use the autofill feature to drag these cells down to as many rows as necessary. Copy the entire sheet to a plain text editor and remove the excess tabs, leaving you with a simple set of insert statements. This is a solution that I can use for any database system and any spreadsheet file format. Plus it is easy to populate the spreadsheet from sources such as other databases, or copying and pasting from a webpage. It's also quite fast and available from any desktop machine, using Excel, OpenOffice or Google Docs. See my example spreadsheet in Excel and OpenOffice versions.
