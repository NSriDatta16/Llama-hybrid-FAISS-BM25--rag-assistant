Build And Archive Buttons Don't Do Anything in XCode 3.2.4 for me

After I use Build and Archive to produce an Ad Hoc Distribution build, the Organizer appears. When I select the build, and press Share Application, the dialog pops up, but thereafter none of the buttons work. I can't Distribute For Enterprise, Save To Disk or Email. I press the buttons and they just pop right back up. There are no errors or warnings on the archive build. Anyone else have this happen and have a fix? Much appreciated.
