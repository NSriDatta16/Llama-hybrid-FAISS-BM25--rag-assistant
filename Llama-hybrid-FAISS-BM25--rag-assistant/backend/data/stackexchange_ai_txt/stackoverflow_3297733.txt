How to get UIWebView User-Agent

I've got a problem working with one remote server. My app makes a request to a server using [NSData initWithContentsOfURL:] method and as a response I get website's url which I open in UIWebView . The problem is that those requests have different User-Agent and server can't serve me correct because it expects that I send all requests with the same User-Agent. I know how to change User-Agent (e.g Change User Agent in UIWebView (iPhone SDK) ) but what I really want it is somehow to get UIWebView 's User-Agent and set it to [NSData initWithContentsOfURL:] to avoid problems with server side
