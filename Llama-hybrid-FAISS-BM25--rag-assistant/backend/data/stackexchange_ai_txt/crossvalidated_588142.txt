White test with neural networks in Python

I'm trying to apply the White test for heteroskedasticity to some neural network models in Python ( https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.diagnostic.het_white.html ). The built-in White test of the statsmodels package seems to assume that the (exogeneous) variables also contain the bias term, since for some reason the OLS fitting procedure does not include an intercept term by default. However, for more complex models, such as neural networks, I have no idea what to do here. (Related question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72188315/how-to-perform-het-white-without-constant ) Right now I can circumvent the assertion error checking the number of degrees of freedom by simply adding a column of ones, as with statsmodels' add_constant method. But since this is a more complicated setting, I was wondering if this is correct?
