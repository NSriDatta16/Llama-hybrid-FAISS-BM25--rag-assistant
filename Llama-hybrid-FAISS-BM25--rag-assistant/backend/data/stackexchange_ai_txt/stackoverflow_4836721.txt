Parallel code throws OutOfRangeException

Does anyone know how why this code returns out of range exception? For example if the leastAbstractions List instance has count == 10 , the loop will execute 11 times finishing with i = 10 and returning this exception. for (int i = 0; i { this.Authenticate(new HighFragment(leastAbstractions[i])).Reactivate(); }, TaskCreationOptions.PreferFairness); }
