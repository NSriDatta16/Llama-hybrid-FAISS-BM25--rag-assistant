If the number of samples in the class is just 5, it seems that machine learning is not a good approach to the problem. Even if we ignore the problems in training the classifier (and you'll need on of very low VC dimension), validating it on 5 samples will not give you enough confidence in the results. I think that relaying on domain knowledge to build a (small and simple) classifier while using the dataset for validation will work better in this setting. I didn't understand the relations between this dataset and the other data sets you mentioned. If you have a more reasonable number of samples you can try the method described here: https://www.quora.com/In-classification-how-do-you-handle-an-unbalanced-training-set/answer/Dan-Levin-2
