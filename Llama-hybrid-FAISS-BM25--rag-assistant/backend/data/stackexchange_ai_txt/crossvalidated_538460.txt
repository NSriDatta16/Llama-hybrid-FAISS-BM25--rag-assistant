How to check for correlation between 5 classes (Likert ratings) and continous variable?

Apologies if the question seems basic or technical terms are used incorrectly, but I am not very experienced in statistics. I have collected data concerning different properties of objects, let's say animals, that are classified into 5 classes. The classes are equidistant and ordered Likert ratings 1-5 (for example representing weight, so 1 = low weight, 5 = high weight). Each object (animal) belongs to a class 1-5, and the properties are all numerical and continous. So the data looks something like this: Animal (unique ID) Class Property1 Property2 Property3 ... Fish 1 0.5 2 2.2 ... Cat 3 0.2 1 1.3 ... Horse 4 1.2 4 3 ... Dog 3 0.8 2.5 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... How do I test whether there is a correlation between the classification into the 5 classes and a certain property? For example, if property 1 was volume, then surely low volume would correlate to lower classes/lower weight, and high volume would correlate to higher classes/higher weight. What I'm actually trying to do is to build a program that analyses these objects, and then uses their properties to predict a class. So I need to compare the properties to find out which work best as class predictors. I could obviously just get the averages for each property per class and then compare, to see if there is a trend from 1-5, but that doesn't seem statistically sound. Especially if I need to compare the "degree of correlation" with the classes for different properties.
