It's impossible to know what technology will be around in 10 years, so forget about predicting year 2050. It is natural for software to be upgraded during it's lifetime, to be replaced with better alternatives, and formats for data storage to change. Plain text is the most portable form of data storage in existence, so use it in whatever way you find appropriate. Don't use binary. Use a database for large amounts of data, since this data can be exported into plain text and once again inserted into another database if, let's say, Oracle ceases to exist one day and you choose PostgreSQL which survived.
