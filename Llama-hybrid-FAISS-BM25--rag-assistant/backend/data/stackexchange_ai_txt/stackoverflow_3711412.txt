You can actually simplify it further, like this: if (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) != null) return false; //Usual script here Is it "good practice"...sure, if it works for you and your team. Jumping out of a function as soon as you have nothing more to do there is a very efficient way to do things, as long as it's easy to understand and maintain for whoever is working on it. Whether you want false specifically depends on the situation, for example if you want to return but not prevent other event handlers from running later, you may want return true; instead.
