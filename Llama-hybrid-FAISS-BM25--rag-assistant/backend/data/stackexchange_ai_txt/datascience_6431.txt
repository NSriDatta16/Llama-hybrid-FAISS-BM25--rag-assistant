I have read @MaximHaytovich's answer and it is a good one. I would just like to suggest some further options, which were generalized in that answer as feature engineering. I would suggest trying to do the obvious first and analyze the data before transforming it to become ready for any machine learning algorithm. First look at the data and learn yourself and hypothesize about what patterns could be indicators of fraud. What is the nature of the data that you are 100% sure is reliable (it is mentioned in the question you posted that there is available data that is reliable) and how informative are they for the goal? The more familiar you are with the data, the better interpretation you can provide to any output you get from the methods you use. Try doing some outlier analysis on the incomes or any features that may be fraudulent that may make sense to do outlier detection on. Are there any suspicious missing values? Try doing clustering (one of the unsupervised algorithms you were talking about) to see if there are any in-betweens or irregularities.
