Which way to go with graphic-intense multi-touch app, XNA or WPF?

I am about to start development of a multi-touch application. I need to decide between WPF and XNA. Which would run faster ? WPF already has libraries to support multi-touch via TUIO input. Does anyone know a similar library or even just sample code to drag/rotate/move objects in XNA ? Thanks! SW.
