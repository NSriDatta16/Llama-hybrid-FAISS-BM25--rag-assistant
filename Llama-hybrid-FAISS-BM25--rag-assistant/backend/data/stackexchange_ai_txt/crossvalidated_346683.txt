Is risk modeling a hypothesis-driven, scientific endeavor?

One could hypothesize that factors x1 , x2 , x3 predict y . Then, test that hypothesis using a statistical model or machine learning method restricted to those predictors while establishing criteria defining success. Yet there is still no cause/effect demonstrated per se nor an if/then relationship ventured. Given the ability of methods to "predict" given enough data and even modest manipulation, the ability to predict y will always be true given enough sample size. Risk prediction seems more analogous to having hammer, nails and wood in hand and asking "can I build a desk." Is risk-modeling a hypothesis-driven, scientific endeavor or some other entity altogether?
