Add something like to the implementation file: - (IBAction)loadPage:(id)sender; { NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.stackoverflow.com/"]; NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]; [webView loadRequest:request]; } And add this to the header file (each line at the appropriate position): - (IBAction)loadPage:(id)sender; IBOutlet UIWebView *webView; Then bind the button to loadPage within interface builder, and bind webView to the UIWebView. Response to comment: I created this sample project, hopefully it helps: - http://dd5.org/static/iPhone_Browser_Sample.zip Binding the button: Right-click and drag to the class where you added the code above. Release the button. Now a little dark-gray panel should appear. Then click on the loadPage: entry within that panel. If the code was added correctly, the entry should show up there.
