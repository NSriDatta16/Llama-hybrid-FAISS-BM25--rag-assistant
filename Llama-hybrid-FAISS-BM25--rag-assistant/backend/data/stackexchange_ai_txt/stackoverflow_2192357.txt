Using CoreData with an object?

this is a beginner's question: Every tutorial I've seen on CoreData focusses on database-backed storage. They all start out with drawing an object model with relationships and whatnot. But my app will be like a simple drawing app, think Illustrator light or OmniGraffle. I have an object in memory for the page and then several child object for the drawn elements. How would you use CoreData for this? I don't need finished code just pointers or ideas. Thank you!
