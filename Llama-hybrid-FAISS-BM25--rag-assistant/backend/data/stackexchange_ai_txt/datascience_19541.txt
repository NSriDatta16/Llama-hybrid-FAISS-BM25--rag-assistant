Machine-learning algorithm / library for outcome prediction

I am extremely new to this data science world so bear with me if my question is not very clear, I'd be glad to clarify. What I am looking for is simple: train a program with a set of values (5 ordered integer inputs, 1 boolean output). Then I would give it 5 inputs where the outcome is not known, and it has to tell me the outcome.
