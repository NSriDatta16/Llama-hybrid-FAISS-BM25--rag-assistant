How to interpret logistic regression with days of the week and months of the year as predictors together with continuous and binary predictors?

I am using logistic regression to predict electricity spike prices (price that exceeds a certain threshold). I directly use the following variables as my independent variables together: (a) demand/load - a continuous IV (b) is a binary IV (c) days of the week (d) months of the year. I used the reference category for (c) and (d) and end up sept and tue for the reference. How do I interpret the results using marginal effects for all my predictors? I am using Stata 9.
