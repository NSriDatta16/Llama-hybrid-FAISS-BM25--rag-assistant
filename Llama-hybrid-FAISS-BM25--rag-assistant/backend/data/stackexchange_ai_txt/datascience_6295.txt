Finding both count and average of a column in R data.table, after group by

I have a data table of 5 columns. I want to do a group by on one column and want to get the count of another column, id . I do this in this way: dt[,length(id),by=dt$cid] . If I also want to get sum of id , how do I proceed? I tried this: dt[,(sum(id) length(id)),by=dt$cid] but it did not work. Could you please help out. Thanks
