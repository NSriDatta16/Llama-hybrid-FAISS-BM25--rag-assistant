touchesMoved QuartzDemo application

I am modifying the QuartzDemo application to include swipe detection while UIView is active (a PDF page being displayed in it via Quartz). This will not work, the event never gets to the QuartzView.m because it sits under scrollview? touchesBegan: works fine and I can use single tap. How can I go about with catching touchesMoved while PDF page is being displayed? I need a simple example with code that does nothing on touchesMoved: , I'll build up on that later. Please keep in mind that I still want to use the UIScrollview as it is and show PDF content based on selection in that scrollview.
