Not entirely following your question, but I think this is what you want: df There are numerous ways to do this kind of thing, so you will need to provide more detail about what you're trying to do if you want a better answer. Edit In general, if you have a set of unique values and you want to apply a function to them based on that set, then you can do this with some version of an apply function. For example, in the example above, here are a few different ways to get the average value based on the first column: ddply(df, .(V1), function(x) data.frame(mean=mean(x[,2]))) do.call("rbind", by(df, df[,1], function(x) data.frame(mean=mean(x[,2])))) do.call("rbind", lapply(unique(df[,1]), function(a) data.frame(V1=a, mean=mean(df[df[,1]==a,2]))))
