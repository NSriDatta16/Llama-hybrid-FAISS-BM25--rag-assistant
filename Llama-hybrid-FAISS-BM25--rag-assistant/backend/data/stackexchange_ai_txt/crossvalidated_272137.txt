What is an appropriate amount of data to take in a moving average?

For instance, lets say I have 10,000 data points to work with for a single plot of data. I want to smooth this data using a moving average and I want this to be automated (I have already written the code). What is an appropriate amount of data points to use in calculating an average for an interval of points? Is it a percentage? A number? And if you can, I would love to hear an explanation or be pointed toward a source that I could read myself. I have it currently set at intervals of 1%, or about 100 data points per average. My error is not too large, but I also want to keep in mind calculation time if I need to run 1000's of datasets (which would mean tens of millions of data points).
