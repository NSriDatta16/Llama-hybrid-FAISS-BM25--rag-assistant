Software: R is certainly a good choice. I use python for this sort of thing; I write my own objective/gradient function(s) and use one of the scipy optimizers, like L-BFGS. But, R is better if you aren't a strong programmer. Caveat: I'm a machine learning guy, not a statistician, so please consider my answer to be one opinion, not the "right answer". It sounds like your model should have at least coefficients for (1) is treatment?, (2) is control?, (3) each plot, (4) each region, (5) week-of-year, (6) week-of-year-and-region, (7) water depth, (8) bird species, (9) water-depth-and-bird-species. After including all of these, I'd look at residuals to try to determine any obvious ones I missed. Though, it sounds like you have a pretty good idea of all of the major covariates. I would try different models (Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson) and use a hold-out set to determine which is more appropriate. I would use L2 regularization and seriously consider L2 normalizing the covariates (at least approximately). If there is a strong covariate like depth, I'd definitely want to include it in my model, else other covariates may appear stronger than they really are.
