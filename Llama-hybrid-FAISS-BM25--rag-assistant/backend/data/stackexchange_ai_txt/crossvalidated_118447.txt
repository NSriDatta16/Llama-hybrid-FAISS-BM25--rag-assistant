Just for the sake of resolving the question, I'm going to state that this is probably due to a confusion over the modeling framework. It would rarely (if ever) be sensible to model an average egg mass with a Poisson distribution (which only applies to a unitless count variable). If you have average counts , and have a measurement of the total exposure (i.e. you have total counts and the area or time over which they were collected), you can do a Poisson model with an offset. In this case it would make more sense to use a log-Normal (i.e., by transforming the response and then fitting a linear mixed model, lmer(log(Avg_egg_mass) ~ ... ) or a Gamma model (the former, log-Normal approach is easier; I would generally only recommend a Gamma model in cases where there is a strong mechanistic or cultural reason to use one).
