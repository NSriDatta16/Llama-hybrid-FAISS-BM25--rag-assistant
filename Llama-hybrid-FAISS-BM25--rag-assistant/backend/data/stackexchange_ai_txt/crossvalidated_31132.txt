The likelihood function is a function that involves the data and the unknown parameter(s). It can be viewed as the probability density for the observed data given the value(s) of the parameter(s). The parameters are fixed. So by itself the likelihood is a frequentist notion. Maximizing the likelihood is just to find the specific value(s) of the parameter(s) that makes the likelihood take on its maximum value. So maximum likelihood estimation is a frequentist method based solely on the data and the form of the model that is assumed to generate it. Bayesian estimation only enters in when a prior distribution is placed on the parameter(s) and Bayes' formula is used to obtain an aposteriori distribution for the parameter(s) by combining the prior with the likelihood.
