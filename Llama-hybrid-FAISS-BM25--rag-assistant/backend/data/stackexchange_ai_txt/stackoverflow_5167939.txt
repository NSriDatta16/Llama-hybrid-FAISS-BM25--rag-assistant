Jquery/Draggable/Background window to the foreground with a mouse click /How?

I use the stack option to get the background windows to the the foreground by dragging. But I am stacked when I want to get a window in the foreground by clicking. I couldn't figure out how to get the largest z-index. EDIT: $('.drag').draggable({stack: '.drag'} This code brings the background div.drag in the foreground, but just if you drag it. I want the background div.drag to get into the foreground also when you click it. If you just click it it stays int the background. EDIT 2: Meanwhile I used: var zIndex = $('.drag').length; $('.drag').draggable({stack: '.drag'}, stop: function() { zIndex = $(this).css('z-index'); } }).click(function(event){ $(this).css('z-index', ++zIndex); });
