I don't know any Django module which would offer what you want (at least wiki i.e. editable text with some lightweight markip language, coupled with version control system), but you can take a look at InterfacesFrontendsAndTools page at Git Wiki, section "Wikis, blogs, etc.". Among others you can find there: wikiri : simple, single-file wiki written in Python, with optional git support for history tracking Chuyen : a weblog software written in Python, using the Django web framework and Git as its data storage backend through PyGit Pystl : very simple, small blog engine in Python, using Git for version control.
