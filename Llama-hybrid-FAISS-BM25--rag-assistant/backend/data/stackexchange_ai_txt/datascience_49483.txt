How to detect outliers documents using python Machine Learning

I'm currently working on a Machine Learning project. The point of this project is to train a model with a pandas.Dataframe composed with 3 columns: "Libellé pays" --> that won't be used for now. "Marchandise" --> current strings that I want to use. "label" --> corresponding labels The thing is, I have only one "class" of document (labelled 1). I would like to have at the end a model that will be able to determine if a document could be identified as similar to the trained datasets. After some research, I was able to tell that outliers detection could be useful, but I can't find documentation that matches my current problem. Could you help me with that? Edit : adding code and data. def class MLModel: def __init__(self, logger): """MLModel constructor.""" self.logger = logger self.xml_dir = "./DASCP-DASCV_2018_MRS-FOS.xls" self.dataframe = None self.classifier = None def get_traindata_from_xls(self): """fetch training data from excell file. filepath is in init""" xl = pd.ExcelFile(self.xml_dir) self.dataframe = xl.parse('Manifest') and this is what self.dataframe looks like: https://pastebin.com/faduQ6gU Libellé Pays object Marchandise object label int64 dtype: object
