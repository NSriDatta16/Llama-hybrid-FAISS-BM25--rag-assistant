How to simulate a binary response variable based on two non-interacting continuous variables

I want to simulate a binary response variable which depends on two normally distributed continuous variables, and I want to have more 1s than 0s in the response variable. I wonder how this can be done such that a logistic regression will not identify a significant interaction term. My current approach in R looks like this: n = 1e5 x1 = rnorm(n) x2 = rnorm(n) y = x1+x2+rnorm(n) y = ifelse(y > 2, 1, 0) df=data.frame(x1=x1, x2=x2, y=y) summary(glm(y ~ x1*x2, df, family=binomial(logit)))$coefficients This usually results in a highly significant interaction term, even though the y is just the sum of x1 and x2. So how can I simulate a y which depends on both x1 and x2, but not on their interaction?
