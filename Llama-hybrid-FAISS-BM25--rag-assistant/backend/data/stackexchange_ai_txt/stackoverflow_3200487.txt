POST indicates a generic action other than GET , PUT , and DELETE (the generic hashtable actions). Because the generic hashtable actions are inappropriate, use POST . The semantics of POST are determined by the resource to which an entity is POST ed. This is unlike the semantics of the generic hashtable methods, which are well-known. POST /people/add-many HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-Type: application/json [ { "name": "Bob" }, { "name": "Robert" } ]
