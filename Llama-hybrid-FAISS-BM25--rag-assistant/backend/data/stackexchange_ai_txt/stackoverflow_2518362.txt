sorting nested list, allow only li to be sorted witin the same ul

$(document).ready(function() { $("#test-list").sortable({ items: "> li", handle : '.handle', axis: 'y', opacity: 0.6, update : function () { var order = $('#test-list').sortable('serialize'); $("#info").load("process-sortable.asp?"+order+"&id=catid&order=orderid&table=tblCats"); } }); $("#test-sub").sortable({ containment: "ul", items: "li", handle : '.handle2', axis: 'y', opacity: 0.6, update : function () { var order = $('ul').sortable('serialize'); $("#info").load("process-sortable.asp?"+order+"&id=catid&order=orderid&table=tblCats"); } }); }); first second the problems i have: sorting the main ul is working but not all the time - i will try to fix that my own but if there is a problem with the code here and not the one in proccess-sortable - tell me. moving li in the main ul is ok but the sub or the sub of the sub is having problem - i can drag something from one sub to it's sub or the other way too - i don't want that to happend. i want to be able to drag li and by selecting that one that only this ul group will send to proccess-sortable to be updated - how can i catch the specific ul of li i am draging?
