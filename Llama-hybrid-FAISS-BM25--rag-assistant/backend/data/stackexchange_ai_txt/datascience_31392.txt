Memory problems with smaller CNN

Hello everyone I'm having a weird problem. I having problem with one of two models I've been using. Models take an image data as input and outputs joystick and keyboard information. A simple CNN , implemented using Keras to use with MNIST data, in which I changed the input size; The inception_v3 (which is way more complex than the first one). While training the first model, it throws the following error: > 2018-05-07 23:03:22.080446: W T:\src\github\tensorflow\tensorflow\core\framework\allocator.cc:101] Allocation of 1037238272 exceeds 10% of system memory. I have tried changing the batch_size parameter to a smaller batch size without any results.
