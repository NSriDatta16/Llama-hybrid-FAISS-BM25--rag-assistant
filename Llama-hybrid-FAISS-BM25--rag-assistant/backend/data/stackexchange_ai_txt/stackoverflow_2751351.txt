Is it a good approach? The pros of this approach outweigh the cons. The cons to de-normalization (that's what you are proposing) include: You need to maintain correct genre, printing and price data for every single magazine in authors table anytime they change for a magazine_id. That's expensive. You obviously waste a LOT more storage space, repeating each magazine data on average 18 times (is that the right guesstimate?). Any other selects/maintenance of authors table becomes slower/more expensive. Your query seems broken. It should instead be SELECT * FROM Author, Magazine WHERE Author.magazine_id = Magazine.id AND genres = 'Motors' To solve your problem, make sure you have an index on magazine table on genres and an index on magazine_id on authors table
