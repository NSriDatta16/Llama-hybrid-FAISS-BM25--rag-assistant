I think you want to work backwards - first pick a point on a plane (X,Y,Z) (by averaging?) that you want to look at. Then pick a distance D away from that point that you wish to be. Next take the equation of a plane http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane.html ax+by+cz=d (different d) and from there deduce a normal vector n = (a,b,c). Normalize it and multiply by D to obtain N = (A,B,C). Now there are only two points from which you could be looking from: (X,Y,Z) +/- (A,B,C). So, now pick whether you want to look from behind or from the front - that will affect the choice of + vs -, I just do not know which is which.
