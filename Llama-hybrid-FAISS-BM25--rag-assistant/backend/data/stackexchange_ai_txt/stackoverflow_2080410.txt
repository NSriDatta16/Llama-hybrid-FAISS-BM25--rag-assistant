How expensive are function calls in JavaScript?

I've been looking at other people's JavaScript code, and I've noticed that many programmers tend to create functions that could be combined with the functions that are calling them. One example is this ; the 'initWebGL' function could be combined with the 'start' function and it'd function the same. Another example is in the source of this , where function 'tick', which is called every 15 milliseconds, makes calls to two other functions that may just as well be combined with 'tick'. I understand the organizational qualities of this, but I am curious about the effect on performance. Is doing this good practice, especially considering that JavaScript is an interpreted language?
