No: Java programs created in Clojure will tend to be a bit larger (in terms of final bytecode size) making it impossible to create bytecode-identical files- Not that this really matters. In terms of functionality, the Clojure java interop is very good and therefore you can create functionally-equivalent code compared to any Java code, with asymptotically-equivalent performance characteristics. (There may be some extremely, extremely obscure Java features that are not available in Clojure, but I believe java interop in clojure has almost 100% coverage at this point.)
