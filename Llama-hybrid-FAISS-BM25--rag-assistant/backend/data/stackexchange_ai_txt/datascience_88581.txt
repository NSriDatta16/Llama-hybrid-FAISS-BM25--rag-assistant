To add a few points to the good answers already proposed: In general this kind of site can only propose standard methods applied to standard data. This can be pretty useful, but it covers only a small proportion of the vast diversity of problems addressed by data science. In a broad sense, data science has applications in virtually every imaginable domain (e.g. medicine, astronomy, self-driving cars, machine translation...) and with every possible kind of digital data (e.g. text, speech, images, video...). The scope of this kind of website is limited to one domain, typically solving standard business problems using standard business data. It's easy to see that the world is full of non-standard problems just by browsing a few questions here on DataScienceSE.
