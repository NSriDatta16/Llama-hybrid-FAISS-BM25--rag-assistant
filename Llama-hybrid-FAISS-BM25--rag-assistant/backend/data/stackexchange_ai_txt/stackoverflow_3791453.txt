The programming language Ada was quite possibly the first compiler to use pragma to specify preprocessor directives. The word was used as a shortened form of "pragmatic information" When the C programming language was designed it didn't initially have pragma directives, but was quickly added to the specification to support custom compiler features. (ie. #pragma optimization_level for the intel C++ compiler) Since then many languages have implemented pragma in some form or another, including C#, but they are often limited to build time warnings and optimization hints. One of the most common and useful pragmas, in non-standard C and C++, is #pragma once used to specify that a file should only be included once.
