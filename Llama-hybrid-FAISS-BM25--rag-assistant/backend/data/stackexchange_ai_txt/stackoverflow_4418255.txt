I want to drag n drop the text view on image in android 2.X please , look at this image below. Here, "Blue" color represents the ViewGrop , "White" is ImageView and the image is set on the ImageView. the text written "Fashion" is a TextView.This is how i have implement the structure. Now i want to allow the user to select the TextView and drag it to any part of the image and then drop it over the image at desired position. As of now for a reference i tried to refer the following url but whenever i use TextView instead of Button things are getting abnormal. link text Can anyone give me the road map or example to get it done ?
