SAS ( prox mixed ), HLM, and R ( lme ) handle missing data in exactly the same way -- namely by deletion of each row of the dataset where either the outcome or any of the predictor variables are missing. Therefore, this is not the reason why results from R were slightly different. If you don't want to handle missing data that way, you will have to look into things like multiple imputation to first generate a complete dataset based on some sensible imputation model and then averaging parameter estimates as described by Rubin (1987).
