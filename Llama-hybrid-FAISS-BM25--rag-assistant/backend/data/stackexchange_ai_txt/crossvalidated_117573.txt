You can use any binary classifier e.g. Logistic Regression. The problem is more tricky at model selection stage, more precisely - how are you going to select the model. Here you will need to estimate the performance (on some held-out set). Your case is typical for real-world data since you have big class imbalance. Computing performance indicator as accuracy will be very biased. I propose you to use a balanced measure of accuracy (see Talk Slides ).
