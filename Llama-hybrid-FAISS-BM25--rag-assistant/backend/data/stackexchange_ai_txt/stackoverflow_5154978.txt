Proper way of saving and loading pictures

I am making a small app where the user can create a game profile, input some data and a picture that can be taken with the camera. I save most of that profile data with the help of NSUserDefaults , but a friend discouraged me from saving the profile image in NSUserDefault . What's the proper way to save and retrieve images locally in my app?
