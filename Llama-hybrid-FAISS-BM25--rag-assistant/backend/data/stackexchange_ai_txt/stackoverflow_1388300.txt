Is there anything called GUI standards?

GUIs are one of the important areas in most of the software products. I would like to know whether there is something called GUI Standards that defines the best practices in GUI design, but in depth. As an example are there any definitions that contain the best size for a text box or the ratio between the width and hight of a Windows form. (Just to provide maximum ease to the user + best appearance) While searching I found several articles: GUI Standards But they seem to be some "Local" standards defined by some organization only for themselves. Do we have something more common/published than this? I know there is a standard from Microsoft as well.. But it is just what they do. Not a practices list for best appearance\usability\user experience.
