How to reduce Image color-depth/ Compress Image size in Java ME?

I need to transmit the image from the mobile phone to the server. I am able to reduce the image screen size but not the memory size. I understand i have to deal with the color depth. J2ME does not seem to offer any scaling method which is available in J2SE: image rescaled = image.getScaledInstance(thumbWidth, thumbHeight, Image.SCALE_AREA_AVERAGING); BufferedImage biRescaled = toBufferedImage(rescaled, thumbWidth, thumbHeight, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB); How I would I tackle this ? I would like to reduce the image memory size before i transmit to the server.
