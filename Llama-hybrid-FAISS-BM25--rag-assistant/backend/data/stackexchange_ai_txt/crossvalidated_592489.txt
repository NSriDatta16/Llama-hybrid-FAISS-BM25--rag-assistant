Creating a forest plot separated by outcome from a multivariate meta-analysis using metafor

I'm struggling to create a forest plot that separates the average effects by outcome. I ran a multivariate mixed effects meta-analysis with 6 outcomes, with 49 studies (some studies have effect sizes for all six outcomes; others have less). Here is the model and output: main_model Using the metafor package, I created a forest plot that has all of the outcomes combined, but how would I separate the outcomes either by different columns in one plot, or using separate plots by outcome? Below is my plot code and the top half of the forest plot output: pdf("ForestPlot.pdf", family = "Helvetica", width = 12, height = 20) par(mar=c(2.5,4,1,2.5), cex = .9, font = 1) forest(main_model, xlim = c(-2.5, 1.8), # adjust horizontal plot region limits addfit = F, # add standard summary polygon annotate = T, # remove annotations width = 0, # width of annotations efac = .55, # height of CI bars pch = 19, # changing point symbol to filled circle col = "gray40", # change color of points/CIs clim = c(-1 ,1), # set absolute limits for CIs cex.lab = 1, # increase size of x-axis title cex.axis = 1, # increase size of x-axis labels cex = .85, # set font expansion factor lty = c("solid", # CI line type "solid", # credibility interval line type "solid"), # horizontal line type xlab = "", # label X axis mlab = "RE Model: p = .04, I2 = 93.9", # label summary estimate showweights=F, ilab=df$RELATION, ilab.xpos=-1.1, steps = 5) # number of tick marks for the x-axis par(cex = .9, font = 2) text(-2.5, 120, "Study name", pos = 4, cex = .9) text(1.8, 120, "Correlation and 95% CI", pos = 2, cex = .9) text(-1.1, 120, "Outcome", font=2) dev.off() op Thank you in advance for any guidance!
