Creating a model for "classifying" behavior

I am working on creating a model for "classifying" behavior on a scale from "good" to "bad". I have a largish dataset where each row represent an individual and each column an aspect of the behavior it can be amount of time spent, changes in time spent compared to a previous time period, number of distinct sessions, how much of some actions that an individual has performed etc. All in all there is currently 24 variables (a number which may change in the future). Now I want to classify the individuals on a scale from "good"/"normal" to "bad"/"abnormal" behavior (this scale must be continous and not descrete). My initial approach has been to do a principle component analysis (PCA) on the 24 variables and found that the first 3 PC's account for 70% of the variance in the data (adding two more I have about 90%). This seems promising to me since those individuals with "abnormal" behavior have larger values for at least some combination of the variables, e.g. more time spent, higher frequency of certain actions. My problem is how I should go about reducing the dimensions further. I want to have all the individuals mapped on a single dimension from good to bad. Since I am quite new to this type of modeling I would appreciate any hints/suggestions. Would it be a good idea to do a simple linear regression of the three princple components? Should I use more of the PC's to account for more of the variance in the data? Is there another method I should try to model this? I am using R if that is relevant.
