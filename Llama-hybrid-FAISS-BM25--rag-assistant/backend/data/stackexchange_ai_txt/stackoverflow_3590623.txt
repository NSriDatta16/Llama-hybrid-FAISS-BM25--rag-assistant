How to develop Eclipse GUI plugins

I want to develop a GUI plugin inside Eclipse such that I can expose a set of tasks and the user can drag-drop the tasks in the editor canvas and create connections between them like a workflow. A -> B -> C. In the background this would generate a set of Java classes with custom code. Any pointers to what resources do I have for such a plugin ?
