Nested outcome categories in a multinomial logistic

I’m modeling a target-shooting video game. A player can shoot and hit the target, shoot and miss, or switch weapons. For simplicity, the outcomes are HIT , MISS , NEW_WEAPON . I have covariates on player and weapon properties. The data are unbalanced: some players play a lot, some a little, some on one visit, some on multiple, and the targets are randomly generated with varying difficulty. Some weapons are better for some targets, but switching has a penalty in the game, so players don’t like to switch. What I want to ask is whether switching is a good strategy on average, and whether it’s more effective for some players than others. I’m thinking I’ll use a two-level logistic regression, but not a baseline-categories multinomial model. A logistic regression of the outcomes HIT + MISS as 0 vs. NEW_WEAPON as 1. Including an intercept for each player will tell me a player’s tendency to fire weapons vs. switch weapons. Then I can include this intercept as a covariate in a second logistic regression, this time of the outcomes MISS as 0 vs. HIT as 1. This covariate would have slope $\beta$, which tells me the effect of the tendency to fire a weapon vs. switch weapons on average. As an extension to (2), I can build a logistic regression of MISS as 0 vs. HIT as 1 with slopes $\beta_p$ per player, which tells me whether switching is more effective for some players than others. Does this sound reasonable? Any suggestions? I'm concerned that reusing the observations of HIT and MISS in (1) and in (2) is somehow not right.
