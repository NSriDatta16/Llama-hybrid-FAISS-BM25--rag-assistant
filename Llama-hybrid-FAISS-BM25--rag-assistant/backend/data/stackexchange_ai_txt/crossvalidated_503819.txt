Confidence intervals for derivatives from GAM predictions

I have built the following GAM model in mgcv wt9 I then made population averaged predictions from this model. # Create new data frame to predict from pred.dat $tagged tagged) pred.dat $sex_t0 sex_t0) pred.dat $scale_id scale_id) # Population averaged predictions from fitted gam wt9 preds $fit) pred.dat se.fit) # Calculate 95% CI for predictions from predicted standard errors pred.dat $lci fit - (1.96*pred.dat $se.fit) pred.dat$ uci $fit + (1.96*pred.dat$ se.fit) # Plot predicted weight for tagged and untagged, and male and female, animals through time (+/- 95% CI) mycolours1 I would now like to create an equivalent figure for the first derivatives of these curves. I can create and plot the derivatives manually but am struggling to get confidence intervals. I have followed this post to obtain the first derivatives manually. I understand that there is no function to automatically calculate first derivatives and confidence intervals from model predictions. The derivatives() function from the gratia package will calculate first derivatives and confidence intervals from a fitted GAM but not from model predictions, see answer here . eps $age.x age.x + eps X1 Q: How can I obtain confidence intervals for these first derivative curves? Noting that these are model predictions and not plotted directly from the fitted GAM.
