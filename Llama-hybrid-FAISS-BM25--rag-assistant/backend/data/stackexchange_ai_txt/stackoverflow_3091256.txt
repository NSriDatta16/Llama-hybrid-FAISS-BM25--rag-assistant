I hate to use the word impossible but I think in this case it might apply. At the very least it sounds like the end result would be too horrible to imagine ever being practical. The only method around it I can think of is creating a video with every single angle in, and using the mouse's drag to skip to certain frames. That would work but you'd need a hell of a lot of frames to make it a smooth transition. If you go this way, I suggest you limit the scope of movement to just left and right. At least to begin with.
