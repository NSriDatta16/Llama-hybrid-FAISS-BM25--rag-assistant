Averaging binomial confidence intervals

I have a general statistical question. Three schools A, B, and C have 0.23, 0.56, and 0.8 fraction of female teachers. The upper and lower confidence intervals (CI) for the three schools can be tabulated as shown below: school female_instructors upper_CI lower_CI A 0.33 0.53 0.13 B 0.55 0.65 0.45 C 0.80 0.90 0.70 If I were asked to report the average fraction of female instructors in the three schools combined I would have informed: (0.33+0.55+0.8)/3 or 0.56. How would I define the CI for the average fraction?? Average given CIs as well i.e. upper: 0.69 and lower:0.43?? Is this is the best way to do such calculations?
