It is more elegant if your design confines all the knowledge about what makes a ConcreteClass1 special inside ConcreteClass1 . Could you have a Process() function in the base class that they each inherit from the base, and have it just do whatever your if bodies would do, including calling DoOtherStuff(this) ? That would have better encapsulation, and when you added more classes you wouldn't change your calling code, because it would just be calling base->Process() and relying on polymorphism.
