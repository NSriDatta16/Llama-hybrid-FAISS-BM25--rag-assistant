My 50 cents: Zoredache solution is definitely good, but I discourage usage of enums; they are not very smart in mysql: if you specify an unknown value, the error is represented with an empty string - even if some default is specified. Also, it's crazily long to ALTER if you want to modify or add a new type. unsigned tinyint should be enough for most of your needs ...
