Migrating from Javadoc to Python Documentation

So I've gotten somewhat used to Javadoc style documentation. Looking through various examples of Python code, I'm finding that, at first blush, the documentation seems to be missing a lot of information. The good: vary rarely do you see self-evident bits of documentation. Docstrings are usually a paragraph or less of English markup that integrates instead of standing out on separate lines. The bad: in conjunction with Python's duck-typing, I find that many functions are unclear about the parameters they expect. There's no type hinting (duck-hinting?) and often times it would be nice to have some idea that the parameter should be list-like, string-like, stream-like. Of course, Javadoc was designed for a lower-level language, without great introspection abilities of Python, which might account for the less verbose documentation philosophy. Any advice on Python documentation standards and best-practices?
