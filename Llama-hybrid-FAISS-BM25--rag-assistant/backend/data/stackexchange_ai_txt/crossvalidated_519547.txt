Average model from different runs

I am using gradient boosting classifier to classify data into two class. Let's say spam/non spam. At different thresholds, I am getting different confusion matrixes. I am interested in the TN vs FN curve. I ran the classifier 10 times with different seeds as I wanted to report a robust number. But I am confused about how to take average and measure standard deviation of these 10 runs. I have taken 10k threshold values. Should I take mean and std on grouping threshold? Edit: what I mean is, should I take 5 threshold value and check the deviation among all 10 results. And then pick man to report if standard deviation is low there.
