Execute dynamic algorithms in AS3

I have a Flash in AS3. I want to dynamically load code that performs some kind of calculations. Is it doable with AS3 (I've read that there is no eval)? Should I use an interpreter in AS3 that gets the data and does the calculations? My first thought was to load an external swf that does all the calculations but I think having an engine that gets input from a socket is more elegant as a solution. So, how is it possible to execute algorithms that come from a server in a swf file?
