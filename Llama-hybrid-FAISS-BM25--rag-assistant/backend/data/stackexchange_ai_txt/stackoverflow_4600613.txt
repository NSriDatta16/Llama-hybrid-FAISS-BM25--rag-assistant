jScrollPane sticking scrollbar problem with Drupal

I have a Drupal site using jScrollPane that has a problem with the scrollbar dragger. When you single click on the scrollbar dragger it will not release the cursor's hold on the dragger until you double-click elsewhere on the page. An example can be seen here: http://webdev2.msi.ucsb.edu/lunch . Thanks in advance!
