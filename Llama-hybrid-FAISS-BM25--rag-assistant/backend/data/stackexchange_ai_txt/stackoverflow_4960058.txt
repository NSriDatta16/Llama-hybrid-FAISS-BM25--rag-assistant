I think you don't want to consider "how full" the table is (how many "buckets" out of total buckets have values) but rather the number of collisions it might take to find a spot for a new item. I read some compiler book years ago (can't remember title or authors) that suggested just using linked lists until you have more than 10 to 12 items. That would seem to support more than 10 collisions means time to re-size. The Design and Implementation of Dynamic. Hashing for Sets and Tables in Icon suggests that an average hash chain length of 5 (in that algorithm, the average number of collisions) is enough to trigger a rehash. Seems supported by testing, but I'm not sure I'm reading the paper correctly. It looks like the resize condition is mainly the result of testing.
