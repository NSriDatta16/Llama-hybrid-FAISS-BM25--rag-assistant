When you are looking at Program Files in a Windows Explorer, look for a button along with Organize, Open, Print, Burn etc that says Compatibility Files . That in general will take you to the virtualization location for a folder. Also, if you are willing to put up with the UAC prompt, if you run the application as an administrator it will write to the location under program files. Or if you move your installation to somewhere other than program files, though this would cause you to lose protection against someone changing the exe, it will write to the application directory also.
