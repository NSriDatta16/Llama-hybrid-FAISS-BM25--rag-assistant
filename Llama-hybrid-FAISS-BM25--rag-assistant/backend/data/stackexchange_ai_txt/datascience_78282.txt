Is always converting a input vector into matrix and apply cnn's good idea?

I know the benefits of using cnns(reduced size weight matrices). Is it a good idea to convert a input vector(which is not a image) into a matrix and apply cnn's. What I understand is that it should not be done because this would enforce some relationship between input vector value which actually doesn't exist. Am I correct or there is some way we can apply cnn's to reduce computation? If cnn's can't be applied what could be the method for reducing computation for very high dimensional input
