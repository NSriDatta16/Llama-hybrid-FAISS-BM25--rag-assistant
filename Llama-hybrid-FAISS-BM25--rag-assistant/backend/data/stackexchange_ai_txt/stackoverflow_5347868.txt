I am not sure x:Static is supposed to work in d:DataContext , I think only d:DesignInstance or d:DesignData could. Did you test the design time data and sure that indeed filled with data? Try specifying the d:IsDesignTimeCreatable=True property in the d:DesignInstance . Although this is Silverlight specific I am sure it might give you some hint. It should generally look like this: d:DataContext="{d:DesignInstance Type=vm:EquipmentViewModel, IsDesignTimeCreatable=True}" You could use the same ViewModel for both runtime and designtime, make a IsInDesignTime property in you ViewModelBase and return data appropriately. Example: private static bool? _isInDesignMode; public static bool IsInDesignModeStatic { get { if (!_isInDesignMode.HasValue) { var prop = DesignerProperties.IsInDesignModeProperty; _isInDesignMode = (bool)DependencyPropertyDescriptor .FromProperty(prop, typeof(FrameworkElement)) .Metadata.DefaultValue; } return _isInDesignMode.Value; } } Note: I would encourage you to use StaticResources (rather than DynamicResources ) for templates or styles that are not meant to change at runtime. Read this for more info.
