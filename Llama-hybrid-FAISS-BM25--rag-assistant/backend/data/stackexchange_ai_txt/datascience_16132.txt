Do you mean a class label that the algorithm has never seen before? Then no, it is not possible. If you dont have labelled data for all your samples you can run a LDA, to get some topics and then assign labels based on the topics obtained. Even this approach wouldnt be really great. Since your problem is classification, I would recommend restricting your domain and using only samples for which the label is known. For better classification accuracy you can look into CNN .
