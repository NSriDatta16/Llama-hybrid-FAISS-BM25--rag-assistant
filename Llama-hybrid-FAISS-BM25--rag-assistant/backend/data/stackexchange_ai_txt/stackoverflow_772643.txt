You have to understand the methods the 'bad guys' use, so some understanding is mandatory. For the average developer I think it is enough to grok the basic priciple of what they are doing in order to avoid creating vulnerabilities in their projects. For somebody who works in a security relevant area (banking comes to mind, or credit card data from an online shop), a deeper understanding is required. Those developers need to go 'under the hood' of how a 'bad guy' operates and which techniques he uses.
