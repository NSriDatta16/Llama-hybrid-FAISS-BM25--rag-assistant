Is it possible to automatically create inverse relationships in a core data model?

The core data model of my app features about 50 entities with a lot of relationships between them. All of the relationships are uni-directional only (and are only required in one direction). However Apple discourages you from leaving relationships without inverse (for model consistency reasons) and I believe that the missing inverses are responsible for a number of errors I am currently facing. Since I don't really need the inverse relationships functionality-wise, I wonder if it would be possible to have them created automatically by XCode. Going through 50 entities with about 3 relationships each and creating inverses manually seems like a tedious task... Any help much appreciated!
