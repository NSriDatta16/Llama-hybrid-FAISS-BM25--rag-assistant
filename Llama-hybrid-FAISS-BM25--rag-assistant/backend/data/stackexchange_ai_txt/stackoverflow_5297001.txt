webcontainer in Websphere vs tomcat server

In a conversation, somebody asked me "let us say our web application only needs JSP/Servlets (no EJB), then in which case would you prefer websphere over tomcat server". Here was my response that if our application need following features of websphere :- i)if app requires Websphere provides clustering and fail-over mechanism. ii) if app requires Websphere services like caching, JMS and Security services. iii) if app need to interact with third party system/resource using JCA protocol iv) if organisation is not cormfortable on putting their app on open-source based server I want to validate my understanding above..and does any body have any extra points?
