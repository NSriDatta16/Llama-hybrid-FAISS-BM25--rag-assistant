Does every view that has an 'Edit' or 'Done' button needs to be inside an UINavigationController?

just wondering here if that makes sense. I've read somewhere that Apple classifies the good use for a navigationBar and navigation controllers for views that really needs it as going to another pages from that current one, etc. But in some cases, (most part of it, at least for me) is that I won't be using all the complex structure of a UINavigationController on my views, sometimes they don't have any navigation at all, just and 'Edit' button at the top or a 'Done' Button... So my question would be? Is it really necessary to create a navigation controller just for these buttons? Or I simply could 'simulate' the look and feel of the bar on a plain UIView and drag some buttons over there? Thanks
