What I did was to determine how many points I had going in the x and y directions, and then divide that by the x and y dimensions, then divide that by 3, as I wanted each minimum point to be three pixels, so it could be seen. The trick then is that you have to aggregate the data so that you are showing several points with one point, so it may be the average of them, but that depends on what you are displaying. Without knowing more about what you are doing it is hard to make a suggestion. For this part, subtract, don't add: best_max_y+best_min_y as you want the difference. The only other thing would be to divide y_magnitude and x_magnitude by 3. That was an arbitrary number I came up with, just so the users could see the points, you may find some other number to work better.
