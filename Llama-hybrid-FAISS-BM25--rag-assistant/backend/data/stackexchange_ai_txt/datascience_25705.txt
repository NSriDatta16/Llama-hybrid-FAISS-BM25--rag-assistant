Deconvolution vs Sub-pixel Convolution

I recently read Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network by Wenzhe Shi et al. I cannot understand the difference between deconvolution (mentioned in Section 2.1) and the Efficient sub-pixel convolution layer (ESCL for short) (Section 2.2) Section 2.2 defines the ESCL as performing convolution with a fractional stride. Isn't this what deconvolution is? Why is a distinction being made? Thanks
