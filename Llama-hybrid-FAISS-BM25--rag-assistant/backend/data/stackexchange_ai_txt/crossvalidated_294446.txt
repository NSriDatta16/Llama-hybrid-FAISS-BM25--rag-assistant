Normality distribution and logistic regression

My research includes a binomial variable as DV and numerous continuous variables as IV. From descriptive analysis I can tell that distribution for most IVs is not normal and couldn't find any transformation that can solve the problem. I applied log, 1/x, sqr, sqrt, ... . Here is the histogram of one of the main variables. What type of analysis suits these data (my choice was logistic regression) and how can I solve the normality issue? Thanks
