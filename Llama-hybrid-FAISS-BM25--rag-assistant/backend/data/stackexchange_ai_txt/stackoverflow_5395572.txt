I assume that you are talking about an ASP.NET web application here. Most dictionaries define the term upload as something like "copy or transfer (data or a program) from one's own computer into the memory or storage of another computer". If you are uploading, you are in other words moving it to the server. I am therefore also assuming that what you are really asking for is how to upload without storing the file on the server's file system . Files can be uploaded to a server using the FileUpload Web Server Control The uploaded file becomes a file of type HttpPostedFile on the server. You can read the HttpPostedFile.InputStream property [ MyFileUpload.PostedFile.InputStream ](e.g. with some sort of XmlReader ) without involving intermediary storage of the file on the server's file system.
