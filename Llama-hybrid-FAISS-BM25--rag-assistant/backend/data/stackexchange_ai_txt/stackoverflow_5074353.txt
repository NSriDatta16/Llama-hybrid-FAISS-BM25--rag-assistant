I've done this before. Start by organising your form into logical sections. Don't leave all your controls on the form, place them inside panels. At Design-time you'll need to have the panels "fully expanded", but then at runtime you manipulate the panels' left, top, width, height, and maybe even the alignment and anchors properties, through code. You could use a timer as suggested by @Adam Rackis.. or you could change the increment value to alter the speed of the animation. The animation itself is just a loop that starts with x = x1 and ends with x = x2, where x = x + increment_value inside the loop. As the value of "x" changes, the component will be automatically redrawn. To get a smoother effect you might need to repaint the control (or the entire panel) on each iteration. If it runs too fast, you can either insert a delay or try to make the loop rely on a timer. I've had problems with timers for this kind of stuff, but admittedly I wasn't using C#.NET at the time (I did it in Delphi). It takes a lot of fiddling with the fine details to get this working nicely, so be patient, it's not Flash! Good luck.
