Is there a way to add external regressors for exponential smoothing based models?

I'm trying to forecast a daily time series while taking into consideration the effect of weekends and holidays using different methods in R. For arima() it was simply done by adding a dummy variable in the xreg argument. But for other methods such as : ets() tbats() stlm() theta() etc... I couldn't find how to accomplish the same thing. Any through, guidance or advice will be greatly appreciated.
