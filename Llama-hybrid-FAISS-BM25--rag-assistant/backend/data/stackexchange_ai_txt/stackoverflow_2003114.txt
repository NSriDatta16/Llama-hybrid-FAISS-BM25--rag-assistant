autosizing sql server database diagram view

i see there is "arrange tables" that organizes your table relationships to be clear. is there anyway to autosize the tables so it shows: the full name of the table the full height to show all fields. i find myself tweaking tables over and over manually and its a pain. I would hope there would be some way to auto correct the sizing of all tables in the diagram with one click. maybe i am too hopeful.
