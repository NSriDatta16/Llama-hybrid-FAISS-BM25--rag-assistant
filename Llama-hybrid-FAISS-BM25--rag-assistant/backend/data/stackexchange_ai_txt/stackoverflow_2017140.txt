I think the problem here is that you are asking the wrong kind of HTML skills. You think you're making it easier by letting them do HTML 1998-style. But in reality, you are making it a lot harder. I myself would have to spend a lot of time remembering how to do layouts in tables, or how to set font colors, background colers, borders etc. etc. without the use of CSS. However if I was told to create this page in HTML now-style, using divs, spans, CSS etc. I would defenitly be able to pass the tests. I think the same is true for a lot of the grad students that make this test. EDIT We have global CSS styles but the job only entails the very simplest HTML imaginable - adding paragraph breaks between text, an image here or there, and tables to render data that we we keep locally in spreadsheets. I read in some of your comments that they are not supposed to do CSS because that overrides your default stylesheet and that they do not have to layout, but just do a table here and an image there in the page body in the CMS. If this is the case, then you are testing the wrong thing, since what you are testing is clearly creating a layout.
