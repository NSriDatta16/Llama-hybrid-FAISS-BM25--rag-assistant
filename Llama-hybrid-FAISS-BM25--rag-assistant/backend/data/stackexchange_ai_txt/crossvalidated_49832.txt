In a multi-level model, what are the practical implications of estimating versus not-estimating random effect correlation parameters?

In a multi-level model, what are the practical and interpretation-related implications of estimating versus not-estimating random effect correlation parameters? The practical reason for asking this is that in the lmer framework in R, there is no implemented method for estimating p-values via MCMC techniques when estimates are made in the model of the correlations between parameters. For example, looking at this example (portions quoted below), what are the practical implications of M2 versus M3. Obviously, in one case P5 will not be estimated and in the other it will. Questions For practical reasons (the desire to get a p-value through MCMC techniques) one might want to fit a model without correlations between random effects even if P5 is substantially non-zero. If one does this, and then estimates p-values via the MCMC technique, are the results interpretable? (I know @Ben Bolker has previously mentioned that "combining significance testing with MCMC is a little bit incoherent, statistically, although I understand the urge to do so (getting confidence intervals is more supportable)" , so if it will make you sleep better at night pretend I said confidence intervals.) If one fails to estimate P5, is that the same as asserting that it is 0? If P5 really is non-zero, then in what way are the estimated values of P1-P4 affected? If P5 really is non-zero, then in what way are the estimates of error for P1-P4 affected? If P5 really is non-zero, then in what ways are interpretations of a model failing to include P5 flawed? Borrowing from @Mike Lawrence's answer (those more knowledgeable than I are free to replace this with full model notation, I'm not entirely confident I can do so with reasonable fidelity): M2: V1 ~ (1|V2) + V3 + (0+V3|V2) (Estimates P1 - P4) M3: V1 ~ (1+V3|V2) + V3 (Estimates P1-P5) Parameters that might be estimated: P1 : A global intercept P2 : Random effect intercepts for V2 (i.e. for each level of V2, that level's intercept's deviation from the global intercept) P3 : A single global estimate for the effect (slope) of V3 P4 : The effect of V3 within each level of V2 (more specifically, the degree to which the V3 effect within a given level deviates from the global effect of V3), while enforcing a zero correlation between the intercept deviations and V3 effect deviations across levels of V2. P5 : The correlation between intercept deviations and V3 deviations across levels of V2 Answers derived from a sufficiently large and broad simulation along with accompanying code in R using lmer would be acceptable.
