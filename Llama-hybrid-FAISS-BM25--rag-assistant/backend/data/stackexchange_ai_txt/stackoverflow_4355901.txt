First of all please use code tag to wrap your code. do something like: model.username = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"ysnky"]; is very discouraged you can use isntead: model.username = @"ysnky" in this case you don't have to worry about the object release. But if you want to use model.username = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"ysnky"]; the response to your question is NO. You don't need to call [model.username release] or to be more precisous your code is wrong, you have to do something like: Model1* model = [[Model1 alloc] init]; NSString *tmpString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"ysnky"] model.username = tmpString; [tmpString release]; finally I suggest to you to best design your class, you can make better by doing a initializer like: Model1* model = [[Model1 alloc] initWithUsername:@"skdnaodnsa"];
