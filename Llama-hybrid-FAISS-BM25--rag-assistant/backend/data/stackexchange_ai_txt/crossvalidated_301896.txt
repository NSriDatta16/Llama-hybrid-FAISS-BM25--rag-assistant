You didn't show us how did you calculate those "probabilities". You said that you used the formula $$ p = \exp(B_o+B_1X_1+\dotso+B_nX_n)/(1+\exp(B_o+B_1X_1+\dotso+B_nX_n)) $$ However, if you used it, then you would get correct results, for example, for the fifth line of your table we have $$ \begin{align} \eta &= -1.7 + 0.216 + 0.471 + 0.638 + 0.187 + 0.347 \\ p &= e^\eta / (1 + e^\eta) = 0.54 \ne 1 \end{align} $$ Knowing that all the values you got are obvious overestimates, I guess that the only error that you could have made is that you incorrectly used the formula. As we can see from the first table you provided, you are conducting your logistic regression using dummy variables for levels of your variables. This means that your $X_i$'s are not the actual values of the variables, but rather indicator functions of those variables. For example, parameter for "Age 40-49" is a parameter for $I(X_\text{age} \in (40, 49])$, where indicator function returns $1$ if the condition is met and $0$ otherwise, so for a person in that age we have $\beta_{\text{Age 40-49}} I(X_\text{age} \in (40, 49]) = 0.471 \times 1 = 0.471$, and for a person from other age group it is equal to $\beta_{\text{Age 40-49}} \times 0 = 0$. If you multiplied the parameters by the actual values of your variables, that are in each case greater than $1$, then you obviously got incorrect results. If this is not the case, then you must have made other kind of error in your computation since if you used the formula correctly, then you wouldn't see all-ones in your results.
