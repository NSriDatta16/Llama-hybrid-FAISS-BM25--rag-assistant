This may be a daft question, but did you actually send the email to other Lotus Notes users via your Notes infrastructure? If not, the mail routers will have stripped the mail of any proprietary Notes stuff as it wings out to the internet. You mention an error message, what was it exactly? AndrewB mentions that your organisation's ECL may be kicking in; alternatively, if you use 3rd party spam / trojan protection, that might have had something to do with it, I don't know.
