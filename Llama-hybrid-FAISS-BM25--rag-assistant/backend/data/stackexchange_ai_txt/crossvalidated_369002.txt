Difficulty understanding contingency table and logistic regression coefficient

I have the following contingency table D not-D E 980 122 not-E 2420 6439 where D may stand for disease, and E for exposure. This leads to the odds ratio (OR) $$ \frac{odds(D|E)}{odds(D|\bar{E})} = 21.4 $$ [1] I hope that is correct? [2] This ratio says the odds of having D given E is about 21 times the odds of having D given you do not have E i.e. having E greatly increases the chance of D? [3] Therefore, in a logistic regression where D is the response and where E is included (amongst several other predictors) as a binary predictor variable, with $\bar{E}$ as the reference level, I would expect its model coefficient to be positive, so that if E is present the odds of D is greater than if E is not present? [4] The problem I have is that the model coefficient for E is negative which I interpret to mean having E reduces the odds of having D, which contradicts what I understand the OR is telling me? EDIT: Using R, with some variable name changes, fit
