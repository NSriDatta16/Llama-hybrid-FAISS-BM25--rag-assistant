I agree to opinions said before. Just as alternative, if you see that customer behavior is too different if it is a guest or not, depending also on model you use, probably it would make sense to use two different models. For example, if you know will use LogisticRegression and not regular customers behavior is distributed in bigger range, then probably you achieve better scores by using two Logistic Regressions (one for regular customers, another for guest customers).
