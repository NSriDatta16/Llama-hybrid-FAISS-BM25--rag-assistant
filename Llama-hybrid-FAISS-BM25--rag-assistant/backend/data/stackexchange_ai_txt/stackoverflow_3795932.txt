How to integrate Disqus plugin for WordPress with JQuery Ajaxed content?

I have implemented JQuery Ajax for dynamic content retrieval for my WordPress blog. But now I have a problem with DISQUS plugin, it just do not load anymore, because page is not reloading. For other small scripts I have used LiveQuery plugin for JQuery and it worked out well, but DISQUS is too complicated for me. Maybe someone could give me some directions where should I change DISQUS plugin files in order to make this work on dynamically generated page?
