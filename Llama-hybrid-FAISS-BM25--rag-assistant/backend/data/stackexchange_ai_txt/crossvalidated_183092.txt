A fairly standard assumption of a time series model is that residuals are $i.i.d.$, which excludes autocorrelation for both levels and squares. Hence, in a "good" time series model residuals will not be autocorrelated, whether in levels or in squares. A GARCH model assumes that standardized residuals are $i.i.d.$, where standardized residuals are residuals from the conditional mean model divided by fitted conditional standard deviations from the GARCH model. Thus the standardized residuals should be autocorrelation-free in both levels and squares.
