Resume Parsing - extracting skills from resume using Machine Learning

I am trying to extract a skill set of an employee from his/her resume. I have resumes stored as plain text in Database. I do not have predefined skills in this case. How should I approach this problem? I can think of two ways: Using unsupervised approach as I do not have predefined skillset with me. I will extract the skills from the resume using topic modelling but if I'm not wrong Topic Modelling uses BOW approach which may not be useful in this case as those skills will appear hardly one or two times. (I would appreciate if you enlighten me more about topic modelling). Another approach is manually labeling the skills for resume and making it supervised learning problem. But I have around 500 resumes, manual labeling will be very tedious and very time consuming. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks.
