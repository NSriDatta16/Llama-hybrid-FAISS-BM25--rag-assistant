Search for lines with a small range of angles in OpenCV

I'm using the Hough transform in OpenCV to detect lines. However, I know in advance that I only need lines within a very limited range of angles (about 10 degrees or so). I'm doing this in a very performance sensitive setting, so I'd like to avoid the extra work spent detecting lines at other angles, lines I know in advance I don't care about. I could extract the Hough source from OpenCV and just hack it to take min_rho and max_rho parameters, but I'd like a less fragile approach (have to manually update my code w/ each OpenCV update, etc.). What's the best approach here?
