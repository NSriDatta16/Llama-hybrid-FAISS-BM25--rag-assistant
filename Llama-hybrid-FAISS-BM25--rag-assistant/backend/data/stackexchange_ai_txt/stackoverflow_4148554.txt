Play! is designed to be comfortable for developers coming from scripting languages like Python and PHP. It provides its own build system and management scripts, somewhat like Rails or Django would. Existing build tools and infrastructure (like the Maven repositories commonly used for dependency management in Java-land) will not integrate well with Play. Wicket will be more comfortable for developers coming from desktop development in Java. It doesn't provide special tooling, so it will be easier to integrate into a specific build tool if you have a preference (and there are many build tools providing things like automated dependency retrieval available in the Java ecosystem.) So there's quite some difference between the two options :) If you can figure out which experience would benefit you most, the decision should be pretty clear from there.
