I think what you're looking for is a UserControl . You can inherit directly from that, and you should be able to use the designer to drag and drop stuff on it. To make it even easier, you can just right click on your project and click Add -> User Control. That will create the .cs file for you as well as a partial .cs file for the designer generated code.
