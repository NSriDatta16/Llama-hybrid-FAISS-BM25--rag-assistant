I am not sure if there is a pithy title for this entire topic but it is certainly an important issue. Maybe " robust statistics " would be a good place to start? The aptly-named empirical influence function describes how an estimator (e.g., the mean or median) depends on the value of one of the points in its sample. It can also be generalized into the "influence" or sensitivity function , which asks how the estimator's value changes as the distribution of the data shifts. You could also consider an estimator's breakdown point , which is essentially the proportion of "bogus" values (e.g., arbitrarily large) that an estimator can tolerate. The mean, for example, has a breakdown point of zero because you can completely change its value by subsituting an arbitrarily large positive or negative value for a single point in the data set. On the other hand, the median is very resistent to this sort of 'attack;. In regression contexts, DDFITS is a diagnostic which asks "how does the prediction for this point change if that is included/excluded in the analysis?" Cook's Distance (or Cook's D) is a similar quantity (they're calculated differently, but are inter-convertible). Leverage is a related quantity but is only affected by the independent variables' values, rather than both the independent and dependent ones.
