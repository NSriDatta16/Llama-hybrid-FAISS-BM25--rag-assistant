Customize the look of the Silverlight Control Toolkit drag / drop

Is there a way to override the template of or restyle the carrot (and even completely remove as I need in one case)? The carrot being the position marker where the drop will occur. I'd also like the ability to change the icons used during dragging - I've seen an infinity symbol, an arrow, and a strike-through circle, for which all I'd like to use custom icons. Unfortunately, I'm also confused as to when a given icon displays itself.
