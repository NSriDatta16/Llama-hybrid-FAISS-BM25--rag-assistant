Deep classification, how to represent category as TF-IDF vector?

I am trying to implement so called deep classification method described here . I am trying to replicate chapter 4.2, with category-based search. Unfortunately, I am not sure how should I represent the category by one single tf-idf vector. (It is not clear for me from the paper). What kind of representation would you suggest? One big concatenated document (for whole category) and computation of the tf-idf for this document. Computation of the tf-idf for each document separately separately and then computing average tf-idf vector. Some other method?
