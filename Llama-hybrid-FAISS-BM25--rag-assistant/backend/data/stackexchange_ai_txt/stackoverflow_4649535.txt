how to program the STM32 flash using openOCD and gdb

I'm using an Olimex ARM-USB-OCD dongle with openOCD and GDB to program and debug an stm32f103 micro. The IDE I'm using came from the Olimex dev-kit CD and makes use of eclipse ganymede. I can load a small program into the RAM and step through the code without any problems. I now have a much larger program which doesn't fit into RAM (which is only 20K) and so I'd like to run it from flash (which is 128K). I've modified the linker script indicating the program code should go in the flash section (address 0x8000000), but gdb fails to load the program. (gdb) 20 load main.out &"load main.out\n" load main.out ~"Loading section .text, size 0xb0e6 lma 0x8000000\n" Loading section .text, size 0xb0e6 lma 0x8000000 &"Load failed\n" Load failed What should I do to get gdb to load the program into flash?
