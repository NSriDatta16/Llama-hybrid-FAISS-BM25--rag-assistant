How find the "closest" (in a sense of data generating process) time series?

Suppose we have overall $m$ time series, each with $n$ observations. We also have another time series with $n-k$ observations ( $k>0$ ). Given the shortest series, I want to find from $m$ series those which have the closest data generating process (DGP). Motivation for this is to "recover" history for the shortest series from available series with longer history. Off the top of my head, I think of looking at correlation coefficients between series, or estimate some model (could be AR/ARMA) and look at coefficients. Is there any documented approach for this kind of exercise?
