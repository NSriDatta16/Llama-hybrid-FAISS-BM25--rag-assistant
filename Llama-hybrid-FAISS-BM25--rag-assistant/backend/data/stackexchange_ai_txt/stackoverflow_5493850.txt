For your task at hand (Payroll) and of these two choices i would recommend you to go with Neo4j. HBase is for truly big datasets (hundreds of gigabytes / terabytes). Payroll dataset is tiny. Hbase is not an actual database. It's a data storage. You will have to manually code and navigate links between entities, enforce foreign keys, transactions etc. Hbase is geared more towards batch processing of large volumes of not structured data rather than OLTP (what you need for Payroll).
