http://autobox.com/dave/regvsbox.pdf (which I authored) discusses issues/differences/opportunities/pitfalls when dealing with time series that your possible regression solutions may be ignoring. Time series data can suggest lag structures for input series AND lag structure for the series that is being predicted while identifying the presence/form of external deterministic effects (level shifts,local time trends,seasonal pulses,pulses) while addressing the effect of non-constant model error variance and non-constant model parameters over time. Whether or not you are predicting 1 series at a time using multivariate inputs or predicting multiple series at a time using multivariate inputs one needs to be aware of the assumptions under which estimation proceeds and how these assumptions are tested via model diagnostics,
