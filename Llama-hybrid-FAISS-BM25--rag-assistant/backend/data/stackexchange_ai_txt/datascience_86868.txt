Does Gradient Boosting perform n-ary splits where n > 2?

I wonder whether algorithms such as GBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM perform more than two splits at a node in the decision trees? Can a node be split into 3 or more branches instead of merely binary splits? Can more than one feature be used in deciding how to split a node? Can a feature be re-used in splitting a descendant node?
