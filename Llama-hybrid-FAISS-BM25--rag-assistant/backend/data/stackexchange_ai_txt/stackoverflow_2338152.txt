Using sim() with lmer()

I have run two multilevel logistic regressions using the same predictors, but on two different responses: fruitMLM Income is discrete with values c(-2,-1,0,1,2) , HDI is continuous between 0 and 1, Country is categorical, and the responses are both 1/0. To plot confidence bands I run a simulation using the sim() function from the arm package: sim(fruitMLM,100) sim(fuelMLM,100) The first one computes fine. The second one returns the following error: Error in mvnorm(n.sims, bhat[j,], V.beta) : 'Sigma' is not positive definite I actually am doing this with 8 different responses. Six of them worked fine and two of them returned this error. Does anyone know how to rectify this?
