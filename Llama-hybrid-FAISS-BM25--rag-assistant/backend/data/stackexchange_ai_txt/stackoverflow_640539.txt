I'd suggest creating some sort of ViewModel on the server to tailor the data for the client. This is similar to your second option; however, it's not done on row by row. It's a batch operation on the server side which preps the columns so the view doesn't need any special logic. I feel manipulating data on the client side can be tricky because there's so many variables- browser, os, computing power. You control the server, so leverage what you control as much as possible. Good luck.
