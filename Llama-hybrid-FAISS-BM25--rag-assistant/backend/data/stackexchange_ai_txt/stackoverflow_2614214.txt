UIButton looks good in InterfaceBuilder, but not on iPad sim or device

In InterfaceBuilder, I'm creating the simplest possible UIButton, by simply dragging from the Library panel into my view. After doing that, I get a nice UIButton that looks like this: Pretty image http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/760/screenshot20100410at111g.png When I preview in the simulator, or view on my iPad device, my UIButton has a line underneath it, like this: Ugly image http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/8863/screenshot20100410at111.png Anyone else have this problem? Anyone have a fix?
