I believe Require-Bundle is an Eclipse thing (that has now made it in the OSGi spec to accommodate Eclipse). The "pure" OSGi way is to use Import-Package , as it specifically decouples the package from the bundle that provides it. You should be declaring dependencies on functionality that you need (the Java API provided by a certain version of a certain package) instead of where that functionality is coming from (which should not matter to you). This keeps the composition of bundles more flexible. JavaScript analogy: This is like detecting whether a web browser supports a certain API versus inferring from what the user-agent string says what kind of browser it is. Peter Kriens of the OSGi Alliance has more to say about this on the OSGi blog . Probably the only case where you need to use Require-Bundle is if you have split packages, that is a package that is spread across multiple bundles. Split packages are of course highly discouraged.
