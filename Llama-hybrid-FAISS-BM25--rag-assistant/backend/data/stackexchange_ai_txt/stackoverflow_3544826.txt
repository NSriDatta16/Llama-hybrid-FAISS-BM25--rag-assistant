Android Home Screen like effect flickering problem when set child.setvisibility(View.Visible)

I have made a sample application to flip through different layouts in a viewflipper. XML is basically (pseudo-code) And in Java code, public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN { oldTouchValue = event.getX() } case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP { //depending on Direction, do viewFlipper.showPrevious or viewFlipper.showNext //after setting appropriate animations with appropriate start/end locations } case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE { //Depending on the direction nextScreen.setVisibility(View.Visible) nextScreen.layout(l, t, r, b) // l computed appropriately CurrentScreen.layout(l2, t2, r2, b2) // l2 computed appropriately } Above pseudo code works well moving linearlayouts inside viewflipper when dragging on the screen (just like the home screen). The problem is when I do nextScreen.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE). When the next screen is set visible, it flickers on the screen before moving to its appropriate position. (I guess it is made visible at 0 location.) Is there a way to load the next screen without making it flicker on the screen? I want it to be loaded (made visible) out of screen so it doesn't flicker. Thank you very much for your time and help!
