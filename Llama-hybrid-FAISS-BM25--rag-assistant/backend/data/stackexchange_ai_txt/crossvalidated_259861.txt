I'm not totally sure what you try to achieve here. I also don't understand your notion of 'non-random' there. But I assume that you're trying to simulate a data of three variable that has the same joint distribution as some real data set, and you specifically want the correlation structure to be the same. There are many ways to achieve this. If you have plenty of data (~100^3), you can do non-parametric density estimation to recover the joint density and do Monte-Carlo with the estimated density. Another way is to restrict our attention to marginals and correlation, which would presumably work well with much less data. It would work as follows. First estimate the marginal distribution of each variable. Apply the corresponding quantile functions(the inverse of the distribution functions) to each variable. Denote them by $Q_x,Q_y,Q_z$. Estimate the correlation matrix $\Sigma$ of $\Phi^{-1}(Q_x),\Phi^{-1}(Q_y),\Phi^{-1}(Q_z)$, where $\Phi$ is the distribution function of standard normal. Now, we're ready to simulate data using Gaussian copula. Generate a normal vector that follows $N(0,\Sigma)$. You can do it by multiplying Cholesky decomposition of $\Sigma$ to the independent normal vector. Denote them by $x_{sim},y_{sim},z_{sim}$. Let $X_{sim}=Q_x^{-1}(\Phi(x_{sim}))$, and define $Y_{sim},Z_{sim}$ similarly. Then these are desired random variables that have the marginal distributions estimated in 1, and similar correlation structure as the original data.
