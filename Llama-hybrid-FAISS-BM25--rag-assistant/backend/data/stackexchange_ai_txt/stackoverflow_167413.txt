Subversion and revision engineering - what are the best web resources to read about?

We are migrationg from CVS to SVN and embracing some kind of revision management in order to enforce order to development/testing/release cycle. We are currently testing, developing and releasing on the same code line, we know its a bad practice and we want to make end to it. What are your experience, know how, suggestions working with source code tree. We are building small/average (2-5 months) custom projects and we have to give early access to customer for review. Requirement creep is common. EDIT: please note, i need not only advice on subversion, but more on how whole devel/test/deploy cycle is reflected in trunk/branches/tags/versions etc
