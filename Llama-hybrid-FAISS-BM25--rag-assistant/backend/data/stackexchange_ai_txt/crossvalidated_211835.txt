How to draw a Shepard diagram from PCA scores?

In Legendre & Legendre 2012 , they are saying that it is possible to diagnostic a PCA with the Shepard diagram. What would be the procedure to draw the diagram? I don't know what to put in relation now: library(vegan) x = rnorm(10,24,1) # fake data y = rnorm(10,12,1) z = rnorm(10,4,1) df=data.frame(x,y,z) pca = rda(df,scale = FALSE) biplot(pca, type = c("t","p")) dist(df,method = "euc") plot(scores(pca)$sites, asp = 1) plot(dist(df,method = "euc"), dist(scores(pca)$sites,method = "euc"), xlab = "Distance in multidimensional space",ylab = "Distance in reduced space", main = "Shepard?") abline(a=0,b=1) The scatter diagram of Fig. 9.1, which is often referred to as a Shepard diagram (Shepard, 1962; diagrams in Shepardâ€™s paper had their axes transposed relative to Fig. 9.1), may be used to estimate the representativeness of ordinations obtained using any reduced-space ordination method. In principal component analysis (Section 9.1), the distances among objects, in both the multidimensional space of original descriptors and the reduced space, are calculated using Euclidean distances (D1, eq. 7.32). The F matrix of principal components (eq. 9.4 below) gives the coordinates of the objects in the reduced space.
