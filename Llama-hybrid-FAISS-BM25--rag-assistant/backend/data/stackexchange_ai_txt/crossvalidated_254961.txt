What is the best way to combine n correlation factors to predict an outcome?

Let's say that I have n+1 time series of two outcomes : either + or - . Time series A1 to An correlate, ie. have the same sign, with the time serie O with a probability p1 to pn . Let's says that we know the last realisation of A1 to An what would be the best way to predict O ? I'm thinking of selecting the time series that have a correlation factor p>0.55 and do some kind of linear combination. Maybe you could point in some direction to get the optimal predictor.
