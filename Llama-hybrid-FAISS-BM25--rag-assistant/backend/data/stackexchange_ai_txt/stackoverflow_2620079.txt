idlj Ignoring "#pragma prefix"

I have an IDL file that has a "#pragma prefix" directive, but whenever I use idlj to build the Java code, it ignores this and generates an _id without the prefix specified. This is a big problem because when _is_a is used, it always returns false, since my generated code does not contain the expected prefix. Please help! Thanks in advance!
