innerHTML to view XML content in a div

I have a form that I am using innerHTML to view the contents of one div in another div. When the user clicks the button, they should be able to view their template. However I am dragging a tree from an XML file and even though the code runs, I get undefined as an output. Am a newbie at this, so any help would be much appreciated! Any thoughts? Thanks!
