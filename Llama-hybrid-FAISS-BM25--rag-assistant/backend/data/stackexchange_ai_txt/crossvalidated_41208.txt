The Sleeping Beauty Paradox

The situation Some researchers would like to put you to sleep. Depending on the secret toss of a fair coin, they will briefly awaken you either once (Heads) or twice (Tails). After each waking, they will put you back to sleep with a drug that makes you forget that awakening. When you are awakened, to what degree should you believe that the outcome of the coin toss was Heads? (OK, maybe you don’t want to be the subject of this experiment! Suppose instead that Sleeping Beauty (SB) agrees to it (with the full approval of the Magic Kingdom’s Institutional Review Board, of course). She’s about to go to sleep for one hundred years, so what are one or two more days, anyway?) [Detail of a Maxfield Parrish illustration.] Are you a Halfer or a Thirder? The Halfer position. Simple! The coin is fair--and SB knows it--so she should believe there's a one-half chance of heads. The Thirder position. Were this experiment to be repeated many times, then the coin will be heads only one third of the time SB is awakened. Her probability for heads will be one third. Thirders have a problem Most, but not all, people who have written about this are thirders. But: On Sunday evening, just before SB falls asleep, she must believe the chance of heads is one-half: that’s what it means to be a fair coin. Whenever SB awakens, she has learned absolutely nothing she did not know Sunday night. What rational argument can she give, then, for stating that her belief in heads is now one-third and not one-half? Some attempted explanations SB would necessarily lose money if she were to bet on heads with any odds other than 1/3. (Vineberg, inter alios ) One-half really is correct: just use the Everettian “many-worlds” interpretation of Quantum Mechanics! (Lewis). SB updates her belief based on self-perception of her “temporal location” in the world. (Elga, i.a. ) SB is confused: “[It] seems more plausible to say that her epistemic state upon waking up should not include a definite degree of belief in heads. … The real issue is how one deals with known, unavoidable, cognitive malfunction.” [Arntzenius] The question Accounting for what has already been written on this subject (see the references as well as a previous post ), how can this paradox be resolved in a statistically rigorous way?
