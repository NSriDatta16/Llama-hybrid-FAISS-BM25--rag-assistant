Only when the fields in the UserProfile table are not required for all the number of records in the user table. For example if you had 3,000,000 users but only 3,000 of those have UserProfiles, it may make sense to split them (to avoid a whole bunch of null columns.) Although now a days with the increased databases speed and cheap costs of storage, it really doesn't make much of a difference to split them for this reason...
