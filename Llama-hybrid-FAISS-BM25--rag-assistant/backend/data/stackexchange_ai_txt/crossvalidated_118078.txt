Probabilistic importance value for Caret linear SVM classifier

In a linear SVM model, inside caret I would like to get the variable importance after recursive feature elimination, so according to the documentation: library(caret) library(mlbench) library(Hmisc) library(randomForest) n The output of lmProfile shows the most 5 important variables, and predictors(lmProfile) will show me all the important (retained) predictors after recursive feature elimination. In the documentation I can read this sentence: ... At first this may seem like a disadvantage, but it does provide a more probabilistic assessment of predictor importance than a ranking based on a single fixed data set. At the end of the algorithm, a consensus ranking can be used to determine the best predictors to retain. Could anyone please let me know how I can get these probabilistic numbers for each retained variable? In other words I would like to report my important variables not only by showing their ranks, but in a more quantitative way.
