Let me give you a very very intuitional insight. Suppose you are tossing a coin 10 times and you get 8 heads and 2 tails. The question that would come to your mind is whether this coin is biased towards heads or not. Now if you go by conventional definitions or the frequentist approach of probability you might say that the coin is unbiased and this is an exceptional occurrence. Hence you would conclude that the possibility of getting a head next toss is also 50%. But suppose you are a Bayesian. You would actually think that since you have got exceptionally high number of heads, the coin has a bias towards the head side. There are methods to calculate this possible bias. You would calculate them and then when you toss the coin next time, you would definitely call a heads. So, Bayesian probability is about the belief that you develop based on the data you observe. I hope that was simple enough.
