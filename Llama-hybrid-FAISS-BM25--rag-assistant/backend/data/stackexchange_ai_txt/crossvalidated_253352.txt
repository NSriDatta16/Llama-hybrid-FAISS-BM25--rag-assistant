To Question 1: Yes, there is! It is called cross-validation (leave-one-out should work for you). The main problem with your current approach is that you select your predictors solely based on how well they predict the outcome within your current sample. This will likely lead to over-fitting and therefore bad performance in new samples. In cross-validation you split your sample into a "training" sample (where you select your predictors) and a "cross-validation" samples (where you test performance) multiple times to circumventing the problem. To Question 2: Again, yes, there is! Cross-validation is often used in combination with regularised regression, which help you with selecting/weighing the predictors. The functions you are looking for are: Ridge regression, LASSO, or Elastic net As far as I can see you are currently trying to solve a prediction problem with inferential methods. The methods and workflow in predictive modelling (aka machine learning) are somewhat different from classic inferential statistics. You may have to do some reading/coursework before proceeding efficiently. Here is a very good online-course that covers predictive machine-learning procedures (including the ones listed above) in detail.
