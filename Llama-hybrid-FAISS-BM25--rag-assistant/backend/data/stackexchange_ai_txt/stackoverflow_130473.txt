the Starteam object model is heirachical, projects contain views, views contain folders, folders contain items (child folders, files, cr's etc) So once you have your view list you can get the folders that belong to the view, then you have a few properties that determine how they map to the local file system, both the view object and the folder objects have a readonly path property. There are 4 other properties of interest though, on the view object read up on the DefaultPath and AlternatePath properties and on the folder object the DefaultPathFragment and AlternatePathFragment.
