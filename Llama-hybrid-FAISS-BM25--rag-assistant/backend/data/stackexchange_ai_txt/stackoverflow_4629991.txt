The Office 2010 suite splash screen is approximately 500 x 335 for its splash screen. I'm not sure if there are any "standard" sizes for splash screens, but you could try looking at the Patterns & Practices documents or UX Guidelines documents that Microsoft publishes and see if they are mentioned there. Interestingly enough, the Windows 7/Vista UX Interaction Guidelines contains the following section: Reconsider animated splash screens (as well as static splash screens). Often splash screens just draw attention to how long a program takes to load, and they wear out their welcome quickly. While splash screens are acceptable if they are displayed only when user interaction isn't possible, whenever practical a better alternative is to design your program so that users can interact with it immediately, even while it is still loading.
