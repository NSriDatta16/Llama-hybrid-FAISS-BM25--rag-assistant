Average time for a random walk on the edges of a cube

In a interview i had something similar to this question Random walk on the edges of a cube . But this time there is only a ant, it takes one minute to go through a single edge. The ant can use the same edge several times in a row. The question was : on average, how long it would take for the ant to come back to the initial corner ?
