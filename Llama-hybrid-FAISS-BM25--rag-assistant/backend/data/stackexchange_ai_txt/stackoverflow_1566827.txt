I would recommend you PersistJS , it's a really small library (3K gzipped) for client-side storage, it uses four persistent data solutions depending on the browser capabilities: globalStorage: Firefox 2.0+, Internet Explorer 8 localStorage: development WebKit openDatabase: Safari 3.1+ userdata behavior: Internet Explorer 5.5+ The problem with cookies is that they are limited to about 4 kilobytes in size, and they are sent along with every HTTP request.
