Passing touches through a UIView to a UIScrollView not working

I have a view derived from a UIScrollView controller that I use to page through images in a library. That works fine. I overlayed a UIView on the right side to handle touches for scrolling quickly through the list of images. My problem is that if I pass the touches through to either 'super' or 'nextResponder' they never make it to the UIScrollView object below. My question is how can I force the UIScrollView below to handle the touches that I don't need to handle? I'm setting a timer for 0.3 seconds that during that time all touches are passed to the UIScrollView to handle. So if the user started a swipe gesture to turn the page, it will happen. Here's the code for the touchesBegan method: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; // Start a timer to trigger the display of the slider and the processing of events. touchesTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.3 target:self selector:@selector(showSlider:) userInfo:nil repeats:NO]; // Where are we at right now? UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint currentPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; lastPage = [self page:currentPoint.y]; // Pass the event though until we need it. // [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; if ([touch.view isKindOfClass:[UIScrollView class]]) { if (self.nextResponder != nil && [self.nextResponder respondsToSelector:@selector(touchesEnded:withEvent:)]) { [self.nextResponder touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; } } }
