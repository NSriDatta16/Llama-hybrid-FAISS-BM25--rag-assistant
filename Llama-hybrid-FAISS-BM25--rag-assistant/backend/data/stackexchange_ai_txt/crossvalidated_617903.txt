Requested from comments: Making the naive assumption that (given the overall proportion of time you are in "yes") what you are doing at any question-time is independent of what you are doing at other question-times, this is essentially estimating a binomial proportion. If you want a distribution, you may want to use Bayesian methods starting with a Beta conjugate prior for the proportion of time and then rescale to total time. There are many frequentist methods of producing confidence intervals .
