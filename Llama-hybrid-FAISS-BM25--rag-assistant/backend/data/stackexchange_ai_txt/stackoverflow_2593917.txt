I'll bet someone has done this more elegantly, but... In this case, no, it's not possible to determine P(Z|Y,X). In general I think it's possible to start with a set of independent "atomic" probabilities and eliminate them as we add constraints. For example, looking at X and Y, we start with four probabilities: P( X, Y) = a P( X, ~Y) = b P(~X, Y) = c P(~X, ~Y) = d Now we add the constraint that the probs must add up to 1. We can eliminate one variable, any variable, say d: P( X, Y) = a P( X, ~Y) = b P(~X, Y) = c P(~X, ~Y) = 1-a-b-c Now suppose we also know P(X)=K: P( X, Y) = a P( X, ~Y) = K-a P(~X, Y) = c P(~X, ~Y) = 1-K-c And so on. In the stated problem we can eliminate five of the original eight probabilities, but then we're asked for the ratio of two that are still independent.
