I'll expand on my comment asking why Qt Creator isn't on your list. I'm experienced with MSVC, and I've used Eclipse for some C++ development on Linux and been impressed with it. Despite my familiarity with these tools, I've pretty much settled on using Qt Creator for Qt based work. Qt's signals and slots paradigm is effectively a language extension, and one that Qt Creator makes very easy to use: there's great code-completion features while writing connect() statements that intelligently display the available signals and slots on the classes you are connecting. The help system is well integrated, the integration with the resource editor and the form designer makes it feel a little like Visual Studio too. The debugger is adequate for most purposes, but lacks the finesse of debugging with MSVC - for some bugs I've had to drop back to using gdb manually. The other thing I'm missing is the ability to impose some virtual organization of my code files. I can't group related classes together in the project view. But despite those flaws, I'm loving it. Check it out! Edit : improvements to both Eclipse and MSVC support are on the Qt Roadmap . If Qt Creator really isn't for you, I think MSVC wins, particularly if you are already familiar with it.
