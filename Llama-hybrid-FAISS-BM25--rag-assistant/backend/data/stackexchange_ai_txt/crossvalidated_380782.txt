Which kernel is this

If $x \sim N(0,\sigma^{2})$ and $\pi(\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma}exp(\frac{-a}{\sigma^{2}})$ then the posterior would be proportional to As, $f(x|\sigma)$ proportional to $\frac{1}{\sigma}exp(\frac{-x^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}})$ $$\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}exp[\frac{-(x^2+2a)}{2\sigma^{2}}]$$ what kernel is this? I know that the posterior exists because it integrates numerically. From The Bayesian Choice The author notes posterior exists for all x. Which as I stated is true form numerically checking the integral. But I want to know how I could see this if I could not have checked numerically, ie from a known kernel or such.
