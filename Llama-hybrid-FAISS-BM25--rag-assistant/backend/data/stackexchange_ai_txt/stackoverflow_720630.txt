Yes, but it isn't pretty. Look at the sys.sysprocesses (or dbo.sysprocesses in SQL 2000 and below). The program name will be SQL Agent something with a binary value at the end. That binary value is the binary vale of the guid of the job. So, substring out that value and do a lookup against the msdb.dbo.sysjobs table to find out what job it is (you'll need to cast the sysjobs.job_id to varbinary(100) to get the values to match). I told you it wasn't pretty, but it will work.
