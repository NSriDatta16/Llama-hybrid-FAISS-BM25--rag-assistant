iPhone app compile error with static libraries on distribution build

I am currently trying to build the distribution product of my (first) iphone app so that it can be uploaded to the App Store. I have gone through all of the App ID and Distribution Provisioning profile process and finally got the Organizer and target's build configuration to recognize it. The problem is that when setting the "Active Configuration" on "Distribution" (duplicate of the "Release" config. per iPhone Dev Center directions) I cannot get the code to compile. The project contains a reference to a static library which contains several classes that are used as base classes in many of the project's classes. So when building on Distribution configuration, the compiler throws errors saying that it cannot find the base classes from the static library, and the build fails. If I switch the Active Config. to "Debug" (as used on development) there is no problem at all, and the app compiles correctly as expected. I cannot get to find what the problem might be. I found this another similar question here but it seems to be a different case: iPhone static library distribution and release build errors (but not for debug) Google also seems not to have many useful results. I have also checked the target's info in the Build section, and switched back and forth between "Debug" and "Distribution" configurations to check for any relevant difference, but no one is found so far. Actually I didn't find any relevant info on the static lib. Only on the General Tab of the info window, but the static lib is displayed correctly in the Direct Dependencies. So, at this point I am clueless. I have tried to follow the instructions as exactly as possible, but I guess that was not enough and I am having problems now. I suppose the fix should be somewhat simple (maybe just set some parameter, somewhere) however I have not been able to find that out. Could you please (PLEASE :) ) provide some help on this. Any help or hint, is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!
