Visual Studio Link problem

I am working on a asp.net mvc c# jquery application. For some reason when I drag a file from the solution explorer on to my code page I no longer get the path to the file. All I get is ../../ If I start with a new MVC project and drag a file say the jquery file Visual Studio gives me this, but in my existing project when I drag the same file I get this, ../../ Any idea why?
