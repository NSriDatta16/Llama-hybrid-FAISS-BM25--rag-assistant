Consider that you have three groups (0,1,2), and with both a quadratic model and a "categorical" model, you have 3 d.f. -- either way fitting the average outcome in each group exactly. They're different parameterizations of the same fit. For ordered models there can sometimes be advantages in parameterizing it using orthogonal polynomials (in particular, if the levels progress smoothly you might find that a lower order fit is a good description).
