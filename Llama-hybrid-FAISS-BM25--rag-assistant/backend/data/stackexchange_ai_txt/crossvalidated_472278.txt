Ordering list of items by two criteria

I have a list of items with two scores: scoreA and scoreB. To be more specific they represent the average of a list of accuracy scores and their maximum. Both of the scores range from 0 to 100%. I'm searching for methods to order the list of items by a balance of the two scores. The idea is to weight them differently but for simplicity let's consider equal weights. In that case, the top items of the list will have high scores for both but we do not want to rank very unbalanced items higher than more balanced ones. Example: ScoreA ScoreB Item1: 95% 70% Item2: 60% 90% Item3 50% 60% Item4: 75% 10% I guess that the key here is using some kind of distance measure. Since both of the scores are going to be from 0 to 100% or 0 to 1, then we can just translated both scoreA and scoreB to x and y coordinates and calculate the distance to the (1,1) coordinate which will be the maximum. After that, we just have to order by the least distance. I want to know if this is correct or there are some other methods I can use.
