Any UIView that needs to report that it was touched can detect the touch using the UIResponder inherited methods – touchesBegan:withEvent: – touchesMoved:withEvent: – touchesEnded:withEvent: – touchesCancelled:withEvent: UIViews that you want to be able to report touches can be inherited from, and in your subclass you can define a delegate method to be called from within the methods above. By setting the delegate to some central reporting class you can have all the touches and the views that received them identified. Don't forget to pass on the touch event, i.e.: [[self superview] touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; if you want touch events to work normally.
