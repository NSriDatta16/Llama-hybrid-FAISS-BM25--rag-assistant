Problem with "log(0)" error while using brms in R to do Bayesian analysis

I'm using brms to conduct a multilevel regression in R. I've been getting warnings and errors of the following type: Rejecting initial value: Log probability evaluates to log(0), i.e. negative infinity. Stan can't start sampling from this initial value. (many repetitions of the above) Initialization between (-2, 2) failed after 100 attempts. I've gradually stripped out as much as I could out of the call to the simplest form that still produces the error. I used to include a Gamma family with a log link function, fixed and random effects, narrower priors, more iterations, and more chains. I've scaled back so that I can identify if the error remains as I remove elements that could conceivably have caused it. (Note that there are very few iterations in this snippet only because I got tired of running the entire thing just to produce the error). This is what remains: fit1 I've verified that there are no zero values of newLatency , and that all participants have data with a mixture of degrees of censoring (between 11% censored and 59% censored). The only thing that will make the error go away is if I drop the " | cens(mycens) " part. I should note that with the full model (with, of course, many more iterations, fixed effects, etc.), it starts with a ton of the "log(0)" statements and then proceeds to run the model anyway, and it gives me reasonable results. Given that I'm not doing any log transforms, the error must be embedded in the model in the computation of log likelihoods? If so, how can I track that down? I'm just nervous about reporting a result of an analysis that started with a bunch of warnings.
