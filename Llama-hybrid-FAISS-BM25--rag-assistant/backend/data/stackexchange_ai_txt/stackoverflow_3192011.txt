Any easy performance data exploration programs?

I'm trying to optimize some software, so I generated a large volume of real world performance measurements - nothing fancy, just a few numbers describing the case plus time in milliseconds. I did some basic analysis on it - mostly dividing data into buckets in various ways and calculating bucket averages - and it was quite helpful in giving me a general idea, but it seems these relationships are more complex than I expected. In the mean time I'll keep throwing various formulas at the data, but perhaps by some chance there exists a tool I could use to explore such data visually, and look for patterns this way? Any recommendations?
