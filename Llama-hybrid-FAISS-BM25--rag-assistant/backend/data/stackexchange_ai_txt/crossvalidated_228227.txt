But in common sense, KPCA should be better than PCA. It is very hard to state anything related to the performance of dimension reduction techniques. The main concern is that it is hard to define a metric to compare different dimension reduction techniques. Usually, a visual examination is the best thing to do when comparing projections in low dimensional spaces (see per example What's wrong with t-SNE vs PCA for dimensional reduction using R? )
