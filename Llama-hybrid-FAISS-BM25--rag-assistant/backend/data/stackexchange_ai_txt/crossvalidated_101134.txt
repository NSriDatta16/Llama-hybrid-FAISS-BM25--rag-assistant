Variable creation in time series regression

I have a coworker who wants to create his own independent variable to add to a time series regression model because he believes that his variable will encapsulate more information. Is this advisable? His variable is essentially a weighted average, but I have concerns about the variable's interpretation (it is kind of odd), its behavior, its distribution etc. Any thoughts on this? The math major part of me felt slightly uncomfortable with this idea!
