I find camelCase a little more pleasant to type, because I find the underscore a bit awkward to type. Don't use global variables. I avoid procedural coding in PHP, I find OOP is easier to keep things organized. Besides, doesn't PHP have enough stuff in it's global namespace already? Generally I try to stick to: Classes are StudlyCaps singular or plural nouns, as appropriate: Item , Row , DB , Items . Variables are lowercase nouns, singular or plural depending on what they hold: $column , $name Constants are singular upper-case nouns: DEBUG , TYPE_FOO . Methods are camelCase, and begin with singular verbs ( get , perform , do ), followed by a noun (singular or plural) describing what it operates on or returns ( getThing() , getThings() ) It definitely depends on what you're coding for. If I'm coding PHP or PEAR, I use camelCase. If I'm doing Python/Django, I use under_scores. If I'm writing ELisp, I use dashed-separators.
