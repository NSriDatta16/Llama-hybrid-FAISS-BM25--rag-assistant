Geometric vs. arithmetic mean

I'm not sure if this is the best place for this question, but when averaging data, how do you know if the geometric or arithmetic mean is more appropriate for taking the average? Do you need to know something a priori about the data set to decide? For my particular problem, I am sampling the data in a log space and wish to average several data sets that should follow the same trends.
