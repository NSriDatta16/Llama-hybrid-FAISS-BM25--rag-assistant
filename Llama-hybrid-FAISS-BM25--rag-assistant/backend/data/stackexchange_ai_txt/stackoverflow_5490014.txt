In Magento 1.5 is it possible to import products using CSV with custom options?

Magento allows you to set custom options for products -- for example, Deluxe version of a product that is $15 more expensive. Previous versions of Magento prior to 1.5 required a hack to import custom options. I understand that 1.5 allows importing of custom options. However the Magento website has zero documentation. Can anyone explain how to import a CSV file with products using custom options?
