Validation in deep learning networks

https://es.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/trainnetwork.html?s_tid=doc_ta#bu6sn4c-traininfo In the above link, there is an example for train network with augmented images. The number of iterations per epoch is 31 and the validation frequency is 50. Why the validation frequency is higher than the number of iterations per epoch? I think the network should be validated at least once per epoch?
