I'm also beginning to get my feet wet with android development. Honestly, I think some of the books out there do a pretty good job of explaining the development framework and getting you started with using the tools quickly. Some of the books I'm reading include "Teach Yourself Android Application Development in 24 Hours" (obviously the title is an exaggeration; the book is just organized into hours. Each hour will take some time for a beginner), "Hello, Android: Introducing Google's Mobile Development Platform (3rd edition)", and "Beginning Android 2." From my, so far, limited experience, developing using the SDK is accessible and enjoyable. That being said, you really need to commit the time/energy to get up to speed.
