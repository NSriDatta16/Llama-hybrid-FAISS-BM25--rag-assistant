What threshold for percentage change is significant?

Here is a scenario: The average score on an exam in Yamaha Elementry in year 1 is 75.1%. 200 students took that test in year 1. In year 2, the average score was 76.5%, which comprised of 230 students. Based on this information, how significant was the performance from year 1 to year 2. Thank you.
