K-fold cross validation dealing with an interaction term

I'm working on a logistic regression analysis and have a data set that contains ~12,000 data values (~6,000 values = 1; ~6,000 values = 0). I would like to use a k-fold cross validation process to validate my model. However, I have an interaction term in my model: results I found the following R code to conduct a k-fold cross-validation procedure: library(boot) turkey 0.5) output My resulting delta estimate was 0.42. This seems like a very poor model validation value (less than a flip of a coin). What suggestions could I use to improve model performance? Thanks!
