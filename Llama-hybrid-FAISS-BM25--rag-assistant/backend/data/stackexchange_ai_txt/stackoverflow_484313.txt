I have used LLBLGens Auditing classes. Determining the user is really something that you will have to handle. There are too many variables for LLBLGen to actually do this for you. How are your users handled? Is this a winforms or asp.net application? The best solution would be to store the UserId in a session variable or static variable depending on which is more appropriate for your application. In your implementation of the Auditing class you can just pull the UserId from its storage place. Another potential solution would be to override the Entity Class or the Data Adapter classes and pass the UserId in to your save methods. However, this would be a lot more work.
