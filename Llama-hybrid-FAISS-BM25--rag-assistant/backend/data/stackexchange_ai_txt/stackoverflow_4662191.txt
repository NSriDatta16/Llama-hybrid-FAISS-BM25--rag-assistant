I'm pretty sure that browsers on a MacBook Air don't send a different user agent, so it's not possible to redirect its users to a mobile version. That said, the MacBook Air functions more like a regular laptop (with keyboard and largish screen, not like the iPad), so most users would probably prefer the regular version anyway.
