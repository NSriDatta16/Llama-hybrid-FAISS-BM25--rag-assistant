Maximum likelihood estimation is often used in machine learning to train: neural networks, e.g. Can we use MLE to estimate Neural Network weights? linear, logistic regression and multiclass logistic regression, e.g. Why linear and logistic regression coefficients cannot be estimated using same method? conditional random field (CRF), e.g. https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-graphical-models-3-learning/lecture/oKJ1x/maximum-likelihood-for-conditional-random-fields hidden Markov model (HMM), e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hidden_Markov_model&oldid=768811108#Learning Note that in some cases one prefers to add some regularization, which is sometimes equivalent to Maximum a posteriori estimation , e.g. Why is Lasso penalty equivalent to the double exponential (Laplace) prior? .
