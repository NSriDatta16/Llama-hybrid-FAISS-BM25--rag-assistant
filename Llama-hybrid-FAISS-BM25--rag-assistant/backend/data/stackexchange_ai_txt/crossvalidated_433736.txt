When would it be computationally inefficient to sample from a distribution?

I am reading some stuff about MCMC simulation and using that as a method to sample from a distribution. I understand that MCMC algos can be used to approximate a distribution when we are unable to obtain a closed form solution for the PDF. However, the book also mentions that we can use MCMC simulation when it is not "computationally efficient" to directly sample from the distribution. What would cause it to be computationally inefficient to sample directly from a distribution? What would be a good example?
