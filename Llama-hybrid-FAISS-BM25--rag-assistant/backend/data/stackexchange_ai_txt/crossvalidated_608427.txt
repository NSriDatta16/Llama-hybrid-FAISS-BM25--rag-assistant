Question on Equation 5.2 of Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto

I'm currently studying the textbook Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto. I can't seem to understand the derivation in Equation 5.2: How did (a) become (b)? In particular, why is the probability component in (b) computed as $\frac{\pi(a|s) - \frac{\epsilon}{|A(s)|}}{1-\epsilon}?$ Thanks in advance. :)
