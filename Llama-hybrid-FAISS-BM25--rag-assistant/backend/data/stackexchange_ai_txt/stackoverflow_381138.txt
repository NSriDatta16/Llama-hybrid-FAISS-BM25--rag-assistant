Algorithm to determine thread "hotness"

I'm trying to come up with a way to determine how "hot" certain threads are in a forum. What criteria would you use and why? How would these come together to give a hotness score? The criteria I'm thinking of include: how many replies how long since the last reply average time between replies The problems this algorithm must solve: A thread which has 500 replies is clearly hot, unless the last reply was over a year ago. A thread with 500 replies that was replied to a second ago is clearly hot, unless it's taken 4 years to reach 500 replies. A thread with 15 replies in the last 4 minutes is really hot! Any ideas, thoughts or complete solutions out there?
