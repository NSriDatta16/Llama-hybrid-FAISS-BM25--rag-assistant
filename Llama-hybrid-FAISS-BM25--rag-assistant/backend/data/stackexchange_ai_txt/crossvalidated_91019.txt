Hierarchical classification

I'm currently working on the classification with massive amount of data. Similar to the kaggle one. Data input consist of features and multiple labels that can be hierarchically aligned. At first I flattened the data and tried to learn multi-label classifier. That involved both, methods that are specially designed for it (like multi-label kNN) and One-vs-All methods. However these approaches didn't yield much result and were really complex. Afterwards I found structured SVM library. Description says, that this library actually minds the structure in the data. However due to its complexity and lack of examples, I didn't have enough time to try it myself. I was thinking maybe someone could shed some light to other hierarchical classification methods out there (in R, Python, C or Java), especially the guys that were tackling that problem on kaggle. What's your approach to this?
