Using GIT with Joomla

We are a web design company, going down the road of setting up a revision management system, and all the processes around how we are going to use it, etc. We are considering using the git revision management system. We mainly develop our websites on the Joomla! Content Management System (CMS). I would like to know how other companies manage their repositories when dealing with a CMS. We mainly deal with template building, and we occasionally customise components or plugins we have installed. My main questions are: Is the best way to store all files (including the Joomla files) in the repository, or just files that you make or change yourself? Do you keep a copy of the database (which Joomla uses for its operation and content storage) somewhere, to account for database changes?
