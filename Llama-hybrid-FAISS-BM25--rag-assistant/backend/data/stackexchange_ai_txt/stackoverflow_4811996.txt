I wouldn't normally use OpenRead() , try DownloadData() or DownloadString() instead. Also it might be that wikipedia is deliberately blocking your request because you have not provided a user agent string: WebClient client = new WebClient(); client.Headers.Add("user-agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100611 Firefox/3.6.4"); I use WebClient quite often, and learned quite quickly that websites can and will block your request if you don't provide a user agent string that matches a known web browser. Also, if you make up your own user agent string (eg "my super cool web scraper") you will also be blocked. [Edit] I changed my example user agent string to that of a modern version of Firefox. The original example I gave was the user agent string for IE6 which is not a good idea. Why? Some websites may perform filtering based on IE6 and send anyone with that browser a message or to a different page that says "Please update your browser" - this means you will not get the content you wanted to get.
