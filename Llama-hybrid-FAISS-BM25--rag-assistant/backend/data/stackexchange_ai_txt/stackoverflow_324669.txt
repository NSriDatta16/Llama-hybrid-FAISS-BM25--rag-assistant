i'd strongly suggest just using in_array() , any speed difference would be negligible, but the readability of testing each variable separately is horrible. just for fun here's a test i ran: $array = array('test1', 'test2', 'test3', 'test4'); $var = 'test'; $iterations = 1000000; $start = microtime(true); for($i = 0; $i "; $start2 = microtime(true); for($i = 0; $i "; // Time1: 1.12536692619 // Time2: 1.57462596893 slightly trivial note to watch for, if $var is not set, method 1 takes much longer (depending on how many conditions you test) Update for newer PHP versions: Martijn: I'ved extended the array to five elements, and look for test3 , as sort of an average case. PHP5.6 Time1: 0.20484399795532 Time2: 0.29854393005371 PHP7.1 Time1: 0.064045906066895 Time2: 0.056781053543091 PHP7.4 Time1: 0.048759937286377 Time2: 0.049691915512085 PHP8.0 Time1: 0.045055150985718 Time2: 0.049431085586548 Conclusion: The original test wasnt the best test, and also: In php7+ is has become a matter of preference.
