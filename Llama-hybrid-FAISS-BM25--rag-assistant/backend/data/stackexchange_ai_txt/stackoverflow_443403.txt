Extract a specific XML message from a log file

i have a log file which contains hundreds/thousands of seperate XML messages and need to find a way to extract a complete xml message depending on the parameters given (values of nodes). My biggest problem is that even though i program a fair amount i have had very little contact with XML or the XML libraries of the languages i use and didnt think that a simple text parsing would be an elegant solution! I am going to attempt this in C# or VB.net any help would be much appreciated and any attempt at a solution even better! thanks in advance!
