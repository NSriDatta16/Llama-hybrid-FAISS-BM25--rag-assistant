Qt - controlling drag behaviour

Suppose I want my draggable widget to move differently than just staying under my cursor while being dragged. For instance, having the widget move only in one axis, or have the widget move double the distance between the cursor and the drag starting point. Which method should I override to define this kind of behaviour?
