What is the proper way to rank machine learning models with multiple eval metrics?

What I'm doing now is ranking each model within each metric and summing the ranks. Whichever model has the lowest sum I am considering the best. Perhaps it would be clearer if I used an example There are 5 models. Model A, Model B, and Model C, Model D, and Model E. There are 3 evaluation metrics. A rank of 1 is the best. I rank the models by each eval metric model eval metric #1 rank eval metric #2 rank eval metric #3 rank Model A 4 3 4 Model B 5 2 2 Model C 1 1 5 Model D 3 4 1 Model E 2 5 3 The sum of each evaluation metrics rank is model sum of rank Model A 11 Model B 9 Model C 7 Model D 8 Model E 10 In this example Model C has the lowest sum and would be considered the best model. Does this process have a name? I'm having trouble searching google for a better solution.
