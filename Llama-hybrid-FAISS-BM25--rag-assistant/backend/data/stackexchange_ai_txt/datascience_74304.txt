You might be underfitting and so have to (at least) train for a longer time (more epochs). Are you calculating your accuracy in the training set before calculating the for the testing set (as the case in many neural network implementation)? Is each training accuracy a mean from many training steps? If this is the case and you are not overfitting (too much), it is expected that you will have slightly better accuracy in the test set as the model has been improved through training. However, more information on how you implement the model would be great.
