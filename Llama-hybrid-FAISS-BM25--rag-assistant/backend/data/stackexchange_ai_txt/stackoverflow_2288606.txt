Joomla: What's the Object to get value from current content, if Registered only?

I need to know if the content being displayed to the user, is for registered only, not public. I think I can't do this trough JDocument or Mainframe, etc. I'm trying to figure this out. Any help on this subject? Thanks for your attention, Have a nice day!
