How to compare 2 non-stationary time series to determine a correlation?

I have two data series that plot median age at death over time. Both series demonstrate an increased age at death over time, but one much lower than another. I want to determine if the increase in the age at death of the lower sample is significantly different than that of the upper sample. Here are the data , ordered by year (from 1972 through 2009 inclusive) as rounded to three decimal places: Cohort A 70.257 70.424 70.650 70.938 71.207 71.263 71.467 71.763 71.982 72.270 72.617 72.798 72.964 73.397 73.518 73.606 73.905 74.343 74.330 74.565 74.558 74.813 74.773 75.178 75.406 75.708 75.900 76.152 76.312 76.558 76.796 77.057 77.125 77.328 77.431 77.656 77.884 77.983 Cohort B 5.139 8.261 6.094 12.353 11.974 11.364 12.639 11.667 14.286 12.794 12.250 14.079 17.917 16.250 17.321 18.182 17.500 20.000 18.824 21.522 21.500 21.167 21.818 22.895 23.214 24.167 26.250 24.375 27.143 24.500 23.676 25.179 24.861 26.875 27.143 27.045 28.500 29.318 Both series are non-stationary - how can I compare the two please? I'm using STATA. Any advice would be gratefully received.
