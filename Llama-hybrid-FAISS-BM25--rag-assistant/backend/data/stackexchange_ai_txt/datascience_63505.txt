That doesn't look at all like a simple dataset for a beginner's project: First if you want to predict future trends you need to look at time series, which is not the easiest type of method. Additionally our data covers only 2 years, it might be too short for good time predictions. Your dataset is made of various types of attributes so it will probably require some serious preprocessing work (e.g. description string) in order to make the data usable for a particular task. Start with plotting your data: volume of sales by country, number of customer by country, most common products, this kind of thing.
