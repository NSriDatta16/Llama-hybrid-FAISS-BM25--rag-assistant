After generating a predictive model by fitting the data with model.fit(X,y) , "the learnings" are simply coefficients (weights ) that are multiplied by the features ( X ) to give you a certain y . In other words, in the end, what you get is a function that for an input X returns a y , you can store the model on the disk using a joblib or pickle and load it in another environment. machine learning? more like coefficients learning. Note : This could be edited in case my answer is lacking more details
