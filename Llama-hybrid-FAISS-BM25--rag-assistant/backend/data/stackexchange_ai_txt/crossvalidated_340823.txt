The HW model is purely deterministic ... the ARIMA model is purely stochastic(adaptive) ... your data (as does most data ) requires a combination of both deterministic and adaptive structure. Here is a plot of your data showing actual/fit and forecast based upon a useful equation which includes arima structure (2,0,0) and 2 pulses and 1 level shift (intercept shift) . I used AUTOBOX, an automatic piece of time series software that I have helped to develop. There is an R version available. The forecasts for the next 8 periods are here ... Identifying the anomalies can often be a precursor to identifying/suggesting the omitted series/effects leading to a potentially useful model that includes causal series EDIT to show OP what the augmented data matrix looks like with the 3 newly discovered/unearthed variables.
