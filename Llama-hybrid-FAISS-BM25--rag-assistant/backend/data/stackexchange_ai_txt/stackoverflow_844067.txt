Conditions that suggest XML isn't a crazy idea If your data looks like a collection of documents. For example, novels have structure, e.g. chapters, paragraphs, sentences, words. You might want to access the structure programatically, but it would be hard to make a relational schema that would support that. A mind boggling number of fields and tables required, almost all are optional. For example, not all novels have a villain, but a villain attribute or tag would be easy enough to add to an xml document. If you have a fairly small amount of data. Data is strongly hierarchical. It is easier to query an XML document of a organizational chart than to do the similar query on an employee table with a manager column that links to itself. Example- DasBlog which uses plain ole xml as the datastore. Conditions that suggest a relational model is better Most of your data fits nicely into tables and columns, fairly small numbers of fields, most fields are required. There is a lot of data. The Relational world has been optimizing for performance much longer than the XML database world. You can have it both ways Most modern relational databases support xml as a first class data type.
