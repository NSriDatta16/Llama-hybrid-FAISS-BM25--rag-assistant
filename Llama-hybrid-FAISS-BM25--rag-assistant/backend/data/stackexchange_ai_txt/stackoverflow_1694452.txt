How to determine if scrolling a UITableView was done by tapping the index?

I want to determine when the index (transparent alphabet) along the side of a UITableView is tapped. To be more specific, I have a sectioned UITableView that has an index, and said index does the right thing, but when the UITableView's -scrollViewDidScroll method is called, I want to be able to determine if said scrolling was the result of the user tapping the index, vs. dragging or swiping the table view itself. If anyone has ideas on how to do this, i'd love to hear about them :-) Regards, John
