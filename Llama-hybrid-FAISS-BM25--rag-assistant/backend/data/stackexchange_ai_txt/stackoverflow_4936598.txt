How to use AJAX Control Toolkit client-side functionality without IIS

I ran an ASP.NET page that i have under development on my local IIS. It uses some dragPanelExtenders as well as some other AJAX Control Toolkit AJAX client side stuff, and in order to show the page to somebody, I wanted to put it up as a plain HTML file, hosted on a live web server (running APACHE). (This is the only public web server I have access to, and I want them to be able to drag some panels and experience the page as it would be when "live") So, I viewed the page running on my local IIS, then saved the source as a HTML file. Then copied this HTML file to the web server ( as well as necessary CSS, JS and image files). When I view this HTML file through the web server, I get this error : ASP.NET Ajax client-side framework failed to load. By debugging, I see that the following lines were in my saved HTML : ?d=VAXZudqFsChpNfB" type="text/javascript"> ?d=Dwbyv-OIp-kJQdqf_UMh7wUzi2" type="text/javascript"> if (typeof(Sys) === 'undefined') throw new Error('ASP.NET Ajax client-side framework failed to load.'); So, at runtime, the referenced resources "ScriptResource.axd" and "WebResource.axd" were not found. Is there any way to get whatever is needed from those AXD's to my HTML file, without actually executing anything on IIS?
