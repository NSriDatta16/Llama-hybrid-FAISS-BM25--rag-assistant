Performant way to store interim PDF documents in document aggregation?

I have to load a few hundred documents of various sorts from disk and produce one giant aggregated PDF. My approach is to convert each document to PDF individually, then aggregate them. I have been writing each PDF document to isolated storage as part of this process. Is there are better way to do this? Performance is a priority - this is client side.
