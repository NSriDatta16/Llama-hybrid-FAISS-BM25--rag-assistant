Two simple thoughts: it's not enough for local extrema to be rare as a proportion of stationary points; they need to be rare in absolute terms (10 local maxima out of a million stationary points is worse than 5 local maxima out of 10 stationary points) MCMC sometimes needs to worry about about multimodality from relabelling in a way that optimisation doesn't. Many models (eg mixture models) are identified only up to labelling of latent variables, which doesn't matter if you just want one of the maxima but can matter if if you want a Markov chain to mix over the entire parameter space -- if it's stuck in one set of labels it is ipso facto not seeing the entire space. You can often fix this by forcing some unique labelling, but I'm not sure that's a general solution. One data point: I have a problem based on a real scientific question that has lots of local maxima. It's a source apportionment problem based on particulate air pollution composition. Given a $T\times S$ data matrix $X$ and known error variances $\Omega$ , we want to find a $T\times K$ matrix $G$ and a $K\times S$ matrix $F$ such that $X=GF+E$ , with all the entries of $F$ and $G$ non-negative, minimising $\sum_{t,s} e^2_{ts}/\omega_{ts}$ . This has lots of local maxima because of the non-negativity constraints -- there tend to be maxima at edges and corners. One other note: The form I've seen the landscape conjecture argued, it's based on the idea that a high-dimensional stationary point is unlikely to be a maximum because that would require all the second partial derivatives to be negative. The problem with this argument is that maxima exist for non-local reasons. For example, there is a global maximum in a lot of problems not because random patterns of second derivatives line up to give a maximum but because the likelihood for that problem is necessarily bounded above. I agree that I'd expect large numbers of stationary points that aren't maxima, but I'm not convinced the number of maxima should be very small.
