Android dev time vs iPhone dev time

IF someone has to develop the same application for Android and iPhone, is it more difficult to develop in one platform than on the other? Does it take more time? Lets think about the average app. Lists, text , buttons, fetch information from the internet. Person has same experience on both platforms. Thanks
