I would thank my lucky stars that SQL Server doesn't have packages. Oracle packages suck. Hmm, we need a way to take all these procedures and put them in one place. I know! Let's make developers create and maintain two files for each package. They will love us forever! As long as MS never implements packages like Oracle did, it'll be a win in my book. EDIT for commenters: Oracle Packages are simply a way to organize your stored procedures into, well, packages so that you don't have 100 stored procedures sitting around, but maybe 5 packages. They're not stackable like packages in Java or C# code. All packages are at the same level. A package requires two files: the headers file and the body file. This creates frustration when adding new procedures to an existing package, because you cannot add the body without adding the header, even though it contains the exact same information as is in the body. For example, here is a snippet from the header file of one of my packages: PROCEDURE bulk_approve_events ( i_last_updated_by IN VARCHAR2, o_event OUT NUMBER ); And here's the corresponding procedure in the body: PROCEDURE bulk_approve_events ( i_last_updated_by IN VARCHAR2, o_event OUT NUMBER ) IS ... BEGIN ... END; No difference. The header file is useless and is simply another hurdle for the developer to step over when developing with packages. On my project, we have a convention that all the commented documentation for each procedure goes in the header, along with the details of when it was added and by whom, but that could just as easily be included in the body.
