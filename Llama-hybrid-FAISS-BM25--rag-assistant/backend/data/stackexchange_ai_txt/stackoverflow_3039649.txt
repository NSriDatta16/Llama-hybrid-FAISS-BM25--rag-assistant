I'm just answering the question without any comment on whether it's a good idea or the right solution for your problem. Enumerate the fonts. For each font, instantiate it, select it into the DC, and use call GetTextMetrics . Check the tmAveCharWidth field of the metrics structure. If it's smaller than the smallest found so far, remember it and the font. Select the font out of the DC and destroy it. Recreate the font with the smallest average character width and use it.
