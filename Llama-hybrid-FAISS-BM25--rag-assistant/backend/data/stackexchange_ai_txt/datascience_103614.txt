How to detect anomalies in each feature - time series

I have a dataset with 5 features corresponding to 5 sensors that measure each three seconds the state of an accelerator. It is structured as well: Sensor 1 | Sensor 2 | Sensor 3 | Sensor 4 | Sensor 5 | Label 1.5 1.1 0.8 1.2 1.2 0 1.2 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.1 0 1.2 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.5 0 The label indicates if the time series is anomaly(=1) or not(=0). I have an anomaly detection task, and the frameworks I've chosen ( 1 , 2 ) give me as output an array with length 3 where I have the labels predicted: (0, 1, 0). I usually worked with anomaly detection frameworks which gave me a threshold and I could have easily marked the values above it as anomalies. In this specific case, with this array of length 3, is it right to assume that I could rewrite the following dataset as this? (True = Anomaly, False = normal) Sensor 1 | Sensor 2 | Sensor 3 | Sensor 4 | Sensor 5 | False False False False False True True True True True False False False False False So, instead mark one value at time, it directly mark all the time series as anomaly?
