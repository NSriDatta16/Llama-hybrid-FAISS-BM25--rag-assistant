How the Correlation Matrix is built for PCA in Weka?

Just to give a context, I want to use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to identify which attributes are similar to others, so I can use just one (or a subset) of them. The correlation matrix of n variables X1, ..., Xn is the n√ón matrix whose i,j entry is corr(Xi, Xj). So if I have 8 attributes, I would have a correlation matrix of size of 8x8. After running PCA in Weka for 8 attributes, the output shows me a Correlation matrix of size of 44x44. And printed 26 Selected attributes. My question: Shouldn't my correlation matrix have the size of 8x8? How does weka build such matrix? Thanks!! MC
