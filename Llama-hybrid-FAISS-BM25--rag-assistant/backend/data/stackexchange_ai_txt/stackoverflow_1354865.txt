This is a hack for IE7 and lower. IE7 and lower will skip the asterisk and continue to parse the CSS as normal. Other browsers will just ignore the entire rule. As an example, since CSS will use the last declared version of a rule, doing the following will cause IE7 and below to use a font-size of 113%, while other browsers use a font-size of 100% for paragraphs. p { font-size: 100%; *font-size: 113%; } There is a little more information at webdevout.net . Personally, I think that it is acceptable to use such hacks for the purposes of working around the brokenness of IE. Apparently, Yahoo! feels the same way.
