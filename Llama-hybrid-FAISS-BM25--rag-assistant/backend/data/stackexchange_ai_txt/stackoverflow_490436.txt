Just figured it out, turns out it was a copy&paste bug. Heh, PEBKAC. I added 4 assertions that verify that the objects are not in the session: Assert.That(Session.Contains(_beveragesCategory), Is.False); Assert.That(Session.Contains(_beerCategory), Is.False); Assert.That(Session.Contains(_darkBeerCategory), Is.False); Assert.That(Session.Contains(_lightBeerCategory), Is.False); When all of those passed (the first time I ran them) I took a closer look at the code that was asserting that the objects were differenta nd found that the assertions were wrong. Was: Assert.That(_beverageCategory.ChildCategories[0], Is.Not.SameAs(_beerCategory)); Should have been: Assert.That(fromDB.ChildCategories[0], Is.Not.SameAs(_beerCategory));
