No, this is not true. In order to consider a cointegrating relationship your variables need to be at least integrated of order one, $I\left(1\right) $ . In order to carry out a cointegration analysis you would first have to conduct a unit root test to see if your time series are in fact $I\left(1\right) $ . Then you could conduct a cointegration test on the relevant series, some of the more popular being the Johansen trace test/maximum eigenvalue test (estimated using maximum likelihood) or the more robust Engle-Granger method (estimated using OLS). If you only have two variables or only suspect one cointegrating relationship you could use the Engle-Granger while the Johansen test can accommodate several cointegrating relationship. Consider an economic example: You are interested in testing whether or not the money and output cointegrate. You would first run a/several unit root test/s on the series in order to see whether or not they were in fact $I(1) $ . If they were in fact $I\left(1\right) $ you could test for a cointegrating relationship using the Engle-Granger method since you only have two variables, hence you can at most have one cointegrating vector. First you would run the regression: $y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}m_{t}+u_{t} $ , where $\beta_{0} $ is a constant, $m_{t} $ is money, $y_{t} $ is output and $u_{t} $ is the error term. After running this regression you would run a unit root test on the residuals to see if they were stationary or $I\left(1\right) $ . If they are stationary the series cointegrate! What is crucial for cointegration is that the series share a common stochastic trend and that they are at least integrated of order 1. By just regressing one $I\left(1\right) $ series on another $I\left(1\right) $ series you could end up with a spurious regression if they do not share a common stochastic trend, i.e. cointegrate. You could also deal with the spurious regression problem by including enough lags for each variable of interest when using a dynamic model! Note that you can have different kinds of non-stationarity. A trend-stationary series which has an upwards trend is non-stationary. By detrending the series or including a time trend you can make these residuals stationary (see the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem) although there is no cointegration present at all. Further, you can have non-stationary series due to level shifts (structural breaks) or sub-samples with differing degree of volatility. You can have an $I\left(1\right) $ series which can be made stationary by differencing it once. Hopefully this answered your question. I would recommend you to read up on stationarity, integration and cointegration.
