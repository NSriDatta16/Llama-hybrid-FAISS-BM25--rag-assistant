ASP.NET User Control Inheriting from User Control Generates Null Reference

This must be a common problem. User control A has a TextBox T. User control B inherits from user control A. User control B is placed onto page P. During the Page_Load event of page P, if you attempt to access TextBox T, you'll find it's null. Is there an elegant solution for this?
