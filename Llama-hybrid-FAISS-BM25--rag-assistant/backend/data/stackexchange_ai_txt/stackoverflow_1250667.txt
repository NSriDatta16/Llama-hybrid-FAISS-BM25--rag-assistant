The simplest way? http://twitter.com/#search?q=whatever - then substitute "whatever". You can use HttpClient's HttpGet for that in Java You can add variations like "search API for user CNN" which would be http://twitter.com/#search?q=source%3AAPI%20@cnn If want RSS instead of HTML use (for above query) http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=source%3AAPI%20@cnn And there's the whole Spritzer API .
