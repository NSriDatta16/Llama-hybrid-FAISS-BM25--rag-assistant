Documentation for troyworks flash framework

I want to design a Flash CS4(AS3) based kiosk application where the screen changes according to the multi-user events. Due to the fact that Troywork's supports HFSM, it might be useful to my needs, but its hardly documented. I checked the dir structure, but cannot understand the usage. Is there any documentation to get started using the framework? Can someone suggest some examples? reference : http://code.google.com/p/troyworks Directory file structure: +---apps | +---.settings | +---build | +---docs | \---src | \---com | \---troyworks | \---apps | +---mnemosyne | +---semantica | | \---moby | +---templateengine | +---tester | \---tgesture +---controls | +---.settings | \---src | \---com | \---troyworks | \---controls | +---cogsDebugger | +---menu | +---tarrow | +---tautocomplete | | \---ui | +---tbutton | +---tcalc | +---tcalendar | +---tcarouselmenus | +---tcookie | +---tcursor | +---tdatefield | +---tdraggable | +---tflow | +---tform | +---tkoosh | +---tline | +---tloadingIndicator | +---tmediaplayer | | +---controller | | +---model | | \---ui | +---tmodal | +---tparticleengine | | \---forces | +---tqa | +---tscrollbar | +---tshapes | +---tsliderbar | +---tslidermenu | +---ttextfield | +---ttooltip | +---ttree | | +---dataproviders | | +---managers | | +---tree | | \---treeclasses | +---tuitools | \---tuseridle +---dev | +---build | +---docs | \---src | +---com | | +---adobe | | | +---crypto | | | +---errors | | | +---images | | | +---net | | | | \---proxies | | | +---serialization | | | | \---json | | | +---utils | | | \---webapis | | | \---events | | \---troyworks | | +---core | | | +---chain | | | +---cogs | | | | \---proxies | | | +---commands | | | +---events | | | +---patterns | | | +---persistance | | | | +---foundation | | | | +---implementation | | | | +---syncher | | | | \---wrapper | | | +---score | | | +---time | | | \---tweeny | | | \---fx | | +---data | | | +---bit | | | +---btree | | | +---constraints | | | +---enums | | | +---filters | | | +---graph | | | +---id | | | +---iterators | | | +---query | | | +---skiplist | | | | +---simple | | | | \---visitable | | | +---tags | | | +---validators | | | \---valueobjects | | +---events | | +---framework | | | +---assets | | | +---controller | | | +---framework | | | +---internationalization | | | +---loader | | | +---model | | | +---security | | | +---tiers | | | +---ui | | | | \---layout | | | \---user | | +---geom | | | +---d1 | | | +---d2 | | | \---d3 | | +---io | | | +---airlib | | | \---fplib | | +---logging | | +---reflection | | +---snippets | | | +---patterns | | | \---reflection | | +---text | | +---ui | | | \---sketch | | \---util | | +---codeGen | | | \---model | | +---datetime | | \---swfconnect | \---util +---docs | \---checkingout +---examples | +---bin | +---doc | +---SaveImage | | \---PostReceiver | | \---data | +---src | | +---Calc | | | +---dev | | | | +---build | | | | | \---lib | | | | \---src | | | \---spec | | +---classes | | | \---com | | | \---troyworks | | | +---commandexample | | | | +---commandcontainers | | | | +---commands | | | | +---controls | | | | \---shapes | | | +---dayinlife | | | +---prevayler | | | | \---demo1 | | | \---Tdining_philosophers | | +---Cogs | | | +---dev | | | +---docs | | | \---src | | +---CommandExample | | | \---obj | | +---Controls | | | \---MixinPlayer | | +---DiningPhilosophers | | +---LayoutUtil | | | +---build | | | | \---slugs | | | \---src | | +---Prevayler | | | \---obj | | +---QA | | +---Sketch | | | +---addFrameScript | | | +---Clickthrough | | | +---ColorUtil | | | +---doc | | | | \---src | | | +---EngineLoader | | | +---FlowControl | | | | +---embedded | | | | \---external | | | +---FrameEvents | | | +---LateBindingView | | | | \---bin | | | +---SymbolClass | | | \---Tweens and saving state | | +---StopWatch | | \---Validation | +---StMPE | | \---dev | | +---build | | \---src | | +---mdl | | \---ui | \---tgesture \---tests +---bin +---obj | \---basic \---src \---com \---troyworks +---apps | \---tester +---core | +---chain | +---cogs | \---patterns +---data +---framework | \---loader +---geom | \---d1 +---logging +---prevayler +---tester +---text \---util \---datetime
