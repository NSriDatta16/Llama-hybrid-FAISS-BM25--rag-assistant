No, you would not average the numbers. Assuming they are stored in this form: RRGGBB then averaging would make weird things happen because of the spillover between color components. What you want to do is average each individual component (i.e. red, green, and blue) and then combine them together. In pseudocode (sorry i don't actually know modula-2): for each pixel: color1 := color2 := resultred := (color1.redpart + color2.redpart) / 2 resultgreen := (color1.greenpart + color2.greenpart) / 2 resultblue := (color1.bluepart + color2.bluepart) / 2 result := combineRGB(resultred,resultgreen,resultblue) draw result onto pixel
