I too find the accepted answer likely wrong. I could not find any reference to such an encoding anywhere. In Tensorflow and in Francois Chollet's (the creator of Keras) book: "Deep learning with python", multi-hot is a binary encoding of multiple tokens in a single vector. Meaning, you can encode a text in a single vector, where all the entries are zero, except the entries corresponding to a word present in the text is one. Please see the Tensorflow category_encoding output_mode parameter's description at https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/CategoryEncoding#args
