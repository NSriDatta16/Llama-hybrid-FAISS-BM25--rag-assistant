If you don't care about the distribution aside from min, max, and mean, then there is a simple answer. Take 96.476510067114100 percent of draws as 80 and 3.523489932885910 percent of draws as 12000. On average, you get 500, and you have your min and max. I calculated the percentages by solving a system of equations $$a + b =1$$ $$80a + 12000b = 500$$ The first equation establishes the the values must sum to one, making sure that we are dealing with probabilities. The second equation get us our average of 500. D
