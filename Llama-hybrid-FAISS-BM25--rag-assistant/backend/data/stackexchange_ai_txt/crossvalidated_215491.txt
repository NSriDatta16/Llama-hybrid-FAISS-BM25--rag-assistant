In this case, you are relating binary properties of a person (answers to questions) to binary outcome (stroke/no stroke). A good place to start is to formulate this as a logistic regression problem, since it will constrain your dependent variable to be between 0 and 1. The result can be interpreted as the probability that the person will have a stroke given their answers to the survey. (Assumes we code "Yes=1, No=0"). Of course, you will need to (a) ensure your sample was representative of the group you intend to use it on (or of the general population being studied) and (b) cross-validate your data to see how robust your findings are.
