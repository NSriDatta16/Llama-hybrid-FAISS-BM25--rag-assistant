How to compare 4 independent means when there is no dependent variable?

There is one other question similar to mine ( Compare independent numeric vectors (means) in R ), but has not been answered (1 year has passed), so I'm repeating the question here. I have obtained exam scores (0-100) of 200 students in 4 subjects. Two of the subjects are taught using one teaching method, while the other two are taught using another method. The subjects are unrelated to each other (a good score on one does not facilitate a good score in another). Scores in one of the subjects are almost exclusively in the 50s. The other three subjects have consistently higher scores on average (mid to high 60s). I wish to see if there is a difference in scores between the two teaching methods. Initially I thought I could use ANOVA, but then realized that there is no dependent variable here. What are my options? What is the best way to approach this problem? Thanks in advance.
