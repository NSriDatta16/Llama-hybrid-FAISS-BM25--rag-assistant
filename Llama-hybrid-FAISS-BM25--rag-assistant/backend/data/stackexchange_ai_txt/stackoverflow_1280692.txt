I figured out the solution just a few minutes after asking the question. In this situation, I have one source grid and one destination grid, so it's easy. In the dragDrop function, I used event.preventDefault(); I can then look at the selected row of the source grid, check the necessary conditions and drop the element in the target only if those conditions are met.
