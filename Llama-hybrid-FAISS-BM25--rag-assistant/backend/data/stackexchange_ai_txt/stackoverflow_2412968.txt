Reading the pst-gantt README it looks like this depends on the pstricks package . I believe that the "ps" is for postscript and the functionality is implemented by generating DVI "special" commands; which means that you can't produce output pdf directly using pdflatex . You can get to PDF output, but you must go by way of DVI . Either source->DVI->PDF or even source->DVI->PS->PDF .
