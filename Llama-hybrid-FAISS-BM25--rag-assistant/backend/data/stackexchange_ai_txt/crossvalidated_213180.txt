These methods are fully described in the following article: Matthias Studer, Gilbert Ritschard, Alexis Gabadinho, and Nicolas S. MÃ¼ller (2011), Discrepancy Analysis of State Sequences, Sociological Methods & Research 40: 471-510, doi: http://doi.org/10.1177/0049124111415372 The behavior of these functions may depend on whether the distance matrix is squared or not. In the above reference you can find an in-depth discussion on whether you should square it or not. By default dissmfac square the distance matrix before computing the Pseudo-R2, whereas it is not the case for dissassoc. This is to be consistent with previous literature on the methodology behind dissmfac . The dissmfacw function does not square the distance matrix by default. In any case, you can change this behavior by using the argument squared=FALSE in all the above-mentioned functions.
