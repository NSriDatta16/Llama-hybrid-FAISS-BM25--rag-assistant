I don't think this is an issue. The volume of data written is less than 1MB/s (average compression ratio during encoding). I found the reason - when I build the graph without audio input (WM ASF writer has only video input pint) and my video capture pin is connected through Smart Tree to preview pin and to WM ASF writer input video pin then there is no glitch in the output movie. I reckon this is the problem with audio to video synchronization in my graph. The same happens when I build the graph in GraphEdit. Without audio, no glitch. With audio, there is a constant glitch every 1s. I wonder whether I time stamp my frames wrongly bu I think I'm doing it correctly. How is the general solution for audio to video synchronization in DirectShow graphs?
