To answer your first question and to quote from [1], Mathematics tell us that linear predictor can be optimal only when the process is Gaussian. When the process is non-Gaussian, a better predictor may be given by a non-linear dynamic model (Masani and Wiener, 1959). Why statisticians, both young and old, keep themselves silent about it I do not know. References: [1] Ozaki, T. & Iino, M.
