Surface Plot for Logistic Regression Interactions

I'm trying to visualize some different interactions from a logistic regression in R. I'd like create a surface plot of the predictive model with two predictor variables along the x and y, then the binary prediction on the z. I've tried using plotly, geoR, persp, bplot, and a few other methods without much success. Almost had success with lattice, but I'm not sure how to plot the predictive model instead of the raw data. Some background: below are simulated data modeled after an experiment where an observer makes a yes/no decision about a stimulus presented at 9 different settings ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 in steps of 0.1. The setting (ordinal) and an additional parameter ranging from 0.02626 to 0.14749 (continuous) were used to predict the yes/no using glmer a la: outcome ~ (random effect) + setting * parameter The results showed a significant negative interaction between the setting and the parameter; this is what I'm trying to visualize. outcome The closest I've come is in using this code: library(lattice) library(gridExtra) trellis.par.set("axis.line", list(col=NA,lty=1,lwd=1)) jobsat_plot Which produces something like this (with the real data; can't seem to get it to work with the simulated data): I think this gets the point across, but I'd like the smooth predictive model to show the general trends. Any help, or pointing in the right direction is appreciated!
