Bayesian change detection (sampling the posterior of a Poisson distribution)

I'm trying to work out how the posterior of a Poisson distribution is derived to enable me to detect changepoints. I'm trying to follow the example here . $Y_i$ (events per year) is modelled using two Poisson distributions (one before, one after the changepoint), with lambda given for these distributions by gamma distributions. For one changepoint the posterior of $T$ (year of changepoint) is given as: $$ \propto{((T\ -\ 1)\ +\ 1)}^{-2-\sum_{i\ =\ 1}^{T\ -\ 1}y_i}\ \Gamma(2\ +\ \sum_{i\ =\ 1}^{T\ -\ 1}y_i)\ \\ +\ {((112\ -\ (T\ -\ 1))\ +\ 1)}^{-2-\sum_{i\ =\ T}^{112}y_i}\ \Gamma(2\ +\ \sum_{i\ =\ T}^{112}y_i) $$ How is this formula derived?
