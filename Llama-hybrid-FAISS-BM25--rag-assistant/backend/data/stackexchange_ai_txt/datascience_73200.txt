One of my favorite tools for feature selection is the Random Forest. Consider giving it a try: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html Random Forests are generally classifiers but they have the added advantage of being able to find and measure the variable's importance. It can be a long process but helpful. By using 'Gini importance' as a measure, RF can provide a bar chart that gives a relative comparison of the features with respect to which feature is best at separating signal from the noise.
