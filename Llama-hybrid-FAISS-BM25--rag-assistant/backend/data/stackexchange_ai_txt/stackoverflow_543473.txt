Is there a good Google Sites competitor?

A client of ours is a membership organization and they are looking for functionality that seems closely aligned with Google Sites capabilities. They want a system where their members can have a content managed site of their own that one or more admins can create by submitting a simple form. The member organization could then add/remove pages, add/edit/remove content, add their own users, modify their color scheme and layout. They would like the ability to have a url structure like, "member_org_url_to_be_named/member_name" - but it could also be subdomains (i.e. "member_name.member_org_url_to_be_named"). So they need a security hierarchy to be able to have different levels of users: Admin - can add/edit/remove sites, users, etc. Member Admin - can add/edit content within their site, add users that are also able to add/edit content within their site. Member user - can add/edit content within their site. From what I've seen and read, Google Sites seems to be able to handle this functionality. It's a little difficult to get in touch with someone there who would be able to tell me this definitively, however. So I'm wondering if there are any other platforms that might be able to handle this workflow. Obviously, I'd love to hear from anyone who has implemented a system like this before. I'd also love to hear from anyone who has actually used Google Sites.
