Confidence interval in logistic regression when probability of success is 1

I have a dataset in which I measure some probability of success using a logistic regression approach. In one of the levels of the predictor variable, all observations were a success (or 1). When I look at the estimates and confidence intervals via the emmeans() function, I get a probability of 1 for this level as well as confidence intervals covering the entire range. My guess is that a more precise calculation of the confidence interval is somehow not possible when all observation for a given group are either zero or one since there is zero variation available and hence the confidence has to cover the entire range... As soon as I swap a 1 for a 0 in the aforementioned level of the predictor, I get a more precise confidence interval. My questions are: What would be the proper statistical approach to analyze such a dataset, or more more importantly how would one interpret such a confidence interval? Below is an example dataset to illustrate my question: d
