I'm not sure if you mean to do it on the web or on the desktop. In fact, I didn't even know you could do it on the web until I saw James' reply up above. I had done a TTS desktop application in Flash embedding the Flash ActiveX inside a C# application. The Flash movie sent a message to the shell using the ExternalInterface API, which in turn passed it on to a TTS ActiveX. I can't recall the name of the ActiveX we used, but there are several decent options to choose from. Turned out quite sweet.
