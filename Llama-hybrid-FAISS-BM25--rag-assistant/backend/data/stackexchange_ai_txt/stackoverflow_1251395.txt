You could set a secret value into the php session with the 'view' script and check for it with the ajax scripts. Request 'index.php' with the browser. PHP builds the page, saves a key into the session, sends the content back to the browser. The browser gets the page content and makes some ajax request to your site. Those ajax scripts also have access to the same session your main page did, which allows you to check for a key. This insures only authenticated browsers are allow to make the ajax requests. Don't count on the ajax request being able to write to the session though. With many requests being satisfied at the same time, the last one in will be the last one written back to your session storage. http://us.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php
