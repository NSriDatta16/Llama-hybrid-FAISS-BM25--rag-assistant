You problem is very common and many data scientists are struggling with there kind of issues. In this blog post , the author explain very nicely what to do. Those are the main notes: 1. Can You Collect More Data? 2. Try Changing Your Performance Metric: Accuracy is not the metric to use when working with an imbalanced dataset. We have seen that it is misleading. There are metrics that have been designed to tell you a more truthful story when working with imbalanced classes. Precision: A measure of a classifiers exactness. Recall: A measure of a classifiers completeness F1 Score (or F-score): A weighted average of precision and recall. 3. Resampling Your Dataset You can change the dataset that you use to build your predictive model to have more balanced data. This change is called sampling your dataset and there are two main methods that you can use to even-up the classes: You can add copies of instances from the under-represented class called over-sampling (or more formally sampling with replacement), or You can delete instances from the over-represented class, called under-sampling. 4. Generate Synthetic Samples simple way to generate synthetic samples is to randomly sample the attributes from instances in the minority class. 5. Try Different Algorithms As always, I strongly advice you to not use your favorite algorithm on every problem. You should at least be spot-checking a variety of different types of algorithms on a given problem.
