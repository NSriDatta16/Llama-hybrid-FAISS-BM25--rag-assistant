This is definitely a classification problem. You could use something like a support vector machine or logistic regression to classify the next element based on you feature vector, but your application sounds like it may be better suited to a Hidden Markov Model, which models states and transition likelihoods between them. The exact classification technique you use is heavily dependent on what you would like as a result of the classification process.
