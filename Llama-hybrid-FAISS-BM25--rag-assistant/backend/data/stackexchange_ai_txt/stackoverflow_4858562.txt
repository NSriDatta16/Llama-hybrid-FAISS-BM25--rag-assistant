Can anyone help with this Magento error?

Fatal error: Call to a member function getArea() on a non-object in {directory}/includes/src/Mage_Core_Model_App_Area.php on line 155 Cropped up when I installed an extension that I wrote on a clean install of Magento. When ported to the dev server it took it down and I cant seem to find where it has originated. Disabling the extension changes nothing. Along with clearing the cache and all the regular Magento hiccups. I've ensured that file permissions are correct to the best of my knowledge.
