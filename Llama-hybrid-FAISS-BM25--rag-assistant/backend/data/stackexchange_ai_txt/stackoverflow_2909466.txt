Does anyone have a suggestion on how to get those Contacts or is this just another example of the Android fragmentation issue? ACTION_PICK works just fine on all Android devices. However, bear in mind that the contacts API changed with Android 2.x, and the StackOverflow entry you linked to was from 13 months ago, back before Android 1.5 even existed (if I remember the timeline properly). Your best approach will be to create a common Java interface that handles your contact-related logic, with two implementations (one for the old API, one for the new). You can load up a static instance of the proper implementation for any given device and use it. You can see an example of that technique here .
