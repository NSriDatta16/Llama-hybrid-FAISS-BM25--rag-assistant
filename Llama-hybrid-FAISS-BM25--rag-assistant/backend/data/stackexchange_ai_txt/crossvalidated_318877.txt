It sounds like you expected city to have little-to-no effect. In this case, you might want to use the Bayesian approach with a prior distribution on city effect size, where the prior is based on previous studies in the literature on similar environmental variables and how they effect performance on similar tasks. It would also make sense to compare your effect size with similar environmental effect sizes in the literature. On the other hand, I am wondering if all the subjects performed the tasks in City A before City B, or vice-versa? Or was the order switched up? This would imply a difference in time and experience, rather than just location. Are these tasks on which performance can be improved with one experience, and could there be a differential in performance on the different tasks? In this case, the main effect may be experience rather than location.
