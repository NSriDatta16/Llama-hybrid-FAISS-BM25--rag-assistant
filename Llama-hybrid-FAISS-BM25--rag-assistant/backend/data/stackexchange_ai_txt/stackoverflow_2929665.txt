Related to the answer by F3, but rather than attempting to encode the entire result (see the following link for differences: http://xkr.us/articles/javascript/encode-compare/ ) can you not just encode (or remove) the single quotes? result[i].replace(/'/g,"%27") Alternately, this regex pattern should match all instances of the ' character "/'[^']*+'/" Like Robert, if you could provide an example of what is returned it would help a bunch.
