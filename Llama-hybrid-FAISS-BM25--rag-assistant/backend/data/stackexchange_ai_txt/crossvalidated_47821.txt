Training an SVM classifier with non-negative weight constraint

I have a problem, where I need to learn a classifier (such as SVM) such that all the learned weights to be non-negative due a constraint on the classifier function. I found out that "SVM Struct" is able to do as mentioned in the comments inside some of their source codes. But, I'm still unable to find any reference (paper, or lecture notes) describing the theoretical aspects of how to solve this problem. Is there any standard method for integrating such constraints in the classification weight learning process? Note that a similar question has been asked in the following question , but I believe no clear and complete answer is given to it.
