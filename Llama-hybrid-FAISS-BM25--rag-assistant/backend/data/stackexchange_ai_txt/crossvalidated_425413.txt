You can do statistics without a computer. You cannot do statistical computing without understanding what you're doing, i.e. statistics. Having this said, probably every statistics course curriculum includes some degree of software and, if covering more advanced material, elements of programming. To do statistics (aka data science) you need to know it. So you need to learn both. As a side-note, it doesn't have to be R. R is great for doing statistics, but for solving simple, day-to-day problems python is equally good, while much easier to learn.
