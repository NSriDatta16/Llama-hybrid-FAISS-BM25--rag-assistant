The question is do you really need to know when to the UserControl is destroyed or disposed? If you build up and tear down your control (event handlers, children, etc.) in the Loaded and Unloaded events, then you should be able to correctly handle when controls become invisible (disconnected from visual tree), as well as when the control is being removed for good. We used this approach in our last Silverlight 4 application that allows you to design organizations; everything from organizational capabilities down to the equipment needed. The application has a lot of views coming and going, so we needed to make sure that everything was unhooked properly.
