In the long run the first differences are taken as zero and the long-run equation reduces to $\gamma_1y+\gamma_2x$=0 which is the long run relationship between the variables. The $\gamma$'s define this long run relationship. The $\beta$'determine the short run adjustment to this equilibrium. 2.See 1. The $\beta$'s are a measure of the persistence of the variable. I don't think that you need to pay particular attention to individual values. In the context of the model the long run relationship can be interpreted as your panel equation. There is no set rule determining the short and long run. One can estimate the half life of a disturbance to equilibrium from the estimated coefficients. This will be different for every model 3 I am not sure that I understand this question. Are you differentiating between a model where the constant is constrained to the ecm or where the constant is unrestricted?
