Implement Live Update into Views

Does anyone know how to implement the Live Update Module into Views? The module is found here: drupal.org/project/live_update (still too green to post more than one link) And a short example is provided here: Question and Answers: Using Drupal and the Live Update module . The module, and thereby live update, works out of the box on both comments and on example.com/node I'm using the modules Organic Groups and Views to sort data for every user and I would like to get those views live updated, without a new pageload, when someone posts something (createing a new node). So what I actual want's is to implement Live Update in my views, correct me if I'm wrong. Is that possible using Live Update by implementing it into the views template? Any help is appreciated! /Martin
