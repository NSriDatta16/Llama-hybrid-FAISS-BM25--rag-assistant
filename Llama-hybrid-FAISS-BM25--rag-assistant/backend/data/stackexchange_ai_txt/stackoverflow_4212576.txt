How to get an id of element to which I drag a "draggable" element

So I have divs like this on my page: And this jquery code: // The draggable effect works well. But I would like to find out an id of a HTML tag where the draggable div gets dropped. If it has any. So if I drag the div to a table with id="my-table", I want to get that value inside js and do something with it.
