This question is about how to interpret the t test as a linear model. I've recreated your data below and will use it in my explanation: library(tidyverse) runsample = tribble(~type, ~y, ~n, '_flagprox', 1, 11, '_flagprox', 0, 267-11, 'a', 1, 81, 'a', 0, 942-81) %>% uncount(n) The data you've used to fit it consist of two types: $x$ is a binary indicator variable (where $x=1$ when type == _flagprox else 0). $y$ is also a binary variable (i.e. 1 or 0). As you've mentioned, you can do a test of proportions with this data. When you do this, the estimated difference comes out to be 0.0448 runsample %>% group_by(type) %>% summarise(meany = mean(y)) %>% arrange(meany) %>% pull(meany) %>% diff %>% round(., 4) [1] 0.0448 The associated p values and confidence intervals are shown in the output of prop.test. Now, let's turn our attention to the linear model. The model you've fit is $$ y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x $$ When $x=0$ , then $y_0$ is the mean of the reference group (whatever it is). When $x=1$ then $y_1$ is the mean of the _flagprox group. So the difference $\Delta$ in those is... $$ \begin{align} \Delta &= y_1 - y_0\\ &= (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1) - \hat{\beta}_0\\ &= \hat{\beta}_1 \end{align}$$ So the coefficient of type_flagprox , or the slope, is the estimated difference, and that is exactly what we see in the output lm(y~type, data=runsample) %>% summary Call: lm(formula = y ~ type, data = runsample) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.08599 -0.08599 -0.08599 -0.04120 0.95880 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Clearly you can't have a two unit increase in type since it is only a variable with 2 categories. A better interpretation for the data you've used is... $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the estimated difference between the group represented by $x=1$ and the group estimated by $x=0$ . The associated confidence intervals can be obtained by using the confint function, but be aware that they may differ slightly between the confidence intervals shown in prop.test in general due to the use of a z statistic in the latter and t statistic in the former.
