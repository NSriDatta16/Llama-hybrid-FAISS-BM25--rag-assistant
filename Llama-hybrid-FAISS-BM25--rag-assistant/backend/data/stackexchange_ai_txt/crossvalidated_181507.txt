Confirming an understanding of SVD

I'm trying to sift through the concepts of low-rank approximations, matrix factorizations and SVD. There's a lot of info out there and the rabbit hole is deep so I just want to make sure my high level understanding is accurate: A common application of SVD is to make low-rank approximations to a matrix, $A$ A low-rank approximation is akin to finding an approximation that retains the minimum number of rows (or columns) that are linearly independent (the rank of $A$). Loosely speaking, we think of these remaining rows as a minimum bound on the useful information contained in $A$. So finding the minimum number is good for making matrices smaller but useful. One way to do this is to find another matrix, $B$, such that we minimize the Frobenius Norm, $\|A - B\|$ Matrix factorization is an application of low-rank approximation, wherein we can find some $RQ^{T} = B$ SVD is a common matrix factorization algorithm of the form $A = U \Sigma V^{T}$ In addition to factorization, SVD is used to solve equations of the form $Ax=b$. In this regard, under certain conditions, SVD is preferred to QR or Cholesky decomposition. SVD is a general case (for $m \times n$ matrices) of an eigen-decomposition The best way (or a very good way??) to find a low-rank approximation to $A$ is by performing SVD SVD is very popular because it exposes eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which have a plethora of useful properties used in Machine Learning/Statistical applications, making it preferential to QR or Cholesky for factorization. Using SVD, we can re-write $A$ as a linear combination of its singular values (from the diagonal of $\Sigma$) and the left and right singular vectors, i.e. the columns of $U$ and $V^{T}$ Calculating the SVD consists of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $AA^{T}$ ($U$) and $A^{T}A$ ($V$). Calculating this product is very expensive, so other algorithms (like truncated SVD, randomized SVD) are being explored Are the above points accurate? I understand there is a lot more to these subjects, but I hope to have captured their relationship at a high level. Please let me know if I'm missing something painfully obvious.
