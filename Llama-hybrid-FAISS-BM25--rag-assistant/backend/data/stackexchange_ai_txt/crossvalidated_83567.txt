You might first want to know exactly what a linear model does. It tries to model a relationship of the form $$Y_i = a + bX_i + \epsilon_i$$ Where the $\epsilon_i$ satisfy certain conditions (heteroskedasticity, uniform variance and independence - wikipedia is a good start if that doesn't ring a bell). But even if these conditions are checked, there is absolutely no guarantee that this will be a "best fit" in the sense you're looking for : OLS is just trying to minimize error in the Y direction, which is what it's doing in your case, but which isn't what seems like the best fit. If a linear model is really what you're looking for, you might try transforming your variables a little so that OLS can indeed be fitted, or just try another model altogether. You might want to look into PCA or CCA, or if you're really bent on using a linear model, try the total least squares solution, that might give a better "fit", as it allow errors in both directions.
