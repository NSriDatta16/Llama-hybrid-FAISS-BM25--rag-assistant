Does HttpWebRequest Obey robots.txt in .Net?

I am creating a tool for Web Developers which will 'scan' the HTML on their site. This requires my Asp.Net application to download a page from their site. To protect from abuse, I want to make sure I obey robots.txt, among other methods. Does HttpWebRequest do this already? Or is there an open source implementation I can use to validate a robots.txt file given a user-agent string?
