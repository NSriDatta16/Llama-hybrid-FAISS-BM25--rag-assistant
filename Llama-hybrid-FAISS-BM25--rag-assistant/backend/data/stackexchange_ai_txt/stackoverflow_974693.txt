Linking CIL with native code

In C++/CLI the following is sample code that links native and managed code within the same file. #include "stdafx.h" #pragma unmanaged __declspec( dllexport ) void func2() { //native code goes here } #pragma managed void func_clr() { func2(); //managed code calls native } #pragma unmanaged __declspec( dllexport ) void func() { func_clr(); //native calls managed } #pragma managed I am trying to experiment in getting other languages to link with managed code. I can compile other languages with the available tools and can compile CIL with ilasm. Ilasm produces the final .dll/.exe directly and I cant figure out a way to link in .obj files from other compilers.
