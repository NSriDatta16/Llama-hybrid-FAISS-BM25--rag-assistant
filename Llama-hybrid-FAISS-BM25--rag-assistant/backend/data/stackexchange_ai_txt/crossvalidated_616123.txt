Determining the sample size of a very unbalanced machine learning problem

I have a machine learning classification problem where 0.05% of the population (N = 100k) is of the positive class. It is important that I don't misclassify these positives (aka I want to minimize the number of false negatives). I want to say with 95% confidence that my machine-learning model does not misclassify any positives. How large should my sample size be?
