Gravity Basically you'd like to find a function that maps an input (an object with a mass and a location) to an output (new location). It's not necessary to have one set of input neurons for each different object. It's sufficient to encode the input variables generically for all objects. Like a function: $$f( x, y, z, mass ) \to ( x_n, y_n, z_n )$$ XOR Training the XOR function is special as the early neural networks, the perceptrons, were unable to learn the XOR function (because it is not linear separable). Multi-Layer Perceptrons however are able to learn the XOR function. This is just to demonstrate that the NN implementation of Synaptic is capable of learning problems that are not linear separable
