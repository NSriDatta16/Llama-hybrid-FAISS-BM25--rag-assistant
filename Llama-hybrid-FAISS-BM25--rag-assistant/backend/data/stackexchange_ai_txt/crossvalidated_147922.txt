Some doubts about survival analysis

I'm struggling to perform a correct and unbiased survival analysis, but I have some doubts. Data I observe a population of posts on a blog within a temporal window $[T_{0}, T_{final}]$. Each post is characterized by: a $start$ date: the date in which it has been published on the blog; a $stop$ date: the date in which the last comment on the post has been left; a $event$ date: the date in which the post has been shared on Twitter for the first time. Basically, the lifetime of each post is defined as the difference between $stop$ and $start$. Analysis and Related Doubts My analysis (at least in this first part) aims at quantifying the effect on the lifetime of the post being shared on Twitter. Suppose I have data organized as follows: id start event stop shared 1 0 105 192 1 2 0 162 245 1 3 0 2 88 1 that is, in the case of $id = 1$, the post is originally published in $t = 0$, it is shared on Twitter after $105$ weeks, and it stopped being commented after $192$ weeks. Note that I brought back all $start$ time to zero. Then, I re-organized data as follows: id start stop shared event 1 0 106 0 1 1 106 194 1 1 2 0 163 0 1 2 163 247 1 1 3 0 3 0 1 3 3 90 1 1 that is, now for each id I have two rows: the first ($shared = 0$) specifies the $start$ and $stop$ times before the post is shared on Twitter; whereas the second ($shared = 1$) specifies the $start$ and $stop$ times after the post is shared on Twitter. At this point, I would like to perform a Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival functions before and after the post is shared on Twitter. s = with(surv.df, Surv(start, stop, event)) KM = survfit(s ~ shared, data = surv.df) and then apply a Cox hazard regression to model to quantify the effect on the lifetime of the post being shared on Twitter sCox = coxph(s ~ as.factor(shared), data=surv.df) summary(sCox) However, I'm not convinced about such a procedure. Questions Do you see any sources of bias in the analysis I have just presented? Is it correct the way I organized data to perform my analysis? Am I actually observing the effect of the post being shared on Twitter?
