I assume you have to return the standard ArrayList, and not your own version of ArrayList, and I assume that 'stuff' is an array, not a list. First off, get bonus points for making the ArrayList have the initial size of the array (toIndex - fromIndex). For more bonus points, make sure that the to and from indecies actually exist in 'stuff' otherwise you get a nice crash. ArrayList uses an internal array for its storage and you can't change that so you have no choice but to create a copy. EDIT You could make things interested and much more complex but it'll impress someone... Do it by creating your own ArrayList class implementing List. Get it to use that original array. Pretty unstable since if that array is modified somewhere else externally, you're in trouble, but it could be fun.
