What should I ask the previous development team during my only (1-3hr) meeting?

There is Ruby on Rails (1.8, 2.3.2) project. First version of project was made by some organisation. I will implement next versions of this project without any help from this organisation. I will be able to talk with developers from previous development team during meeting (1-3 hours). Project statistics: ~10k LOC, 1.0/0.6 code to test ratio, rspec What questions about project can you recommend to ask?
