Order by sorts your results -- one row of results per one matching (where clause) row in the database Group by gives you fewer rows of results than the matching rows (where clause) in your database. Eg you have a table of students's grade point averages (0-4.0) per teacher Order by will give you all the students grades for all teachers Group by teachers will give you one result per teacher. Usually you'd select something like the average of the gpa fields, so you'd get one gpa number per teacher
