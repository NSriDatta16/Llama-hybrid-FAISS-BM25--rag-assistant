When you drag an item into a Visual Studio project (like, in this case, a Content Project), it will copy the file into the project directory . By default it does not reference the file you drag in (although that is available as an option). (If the file you drag in is already in the project directory, it just leaves it there.) The upshot of this is that you need to work on your content files in the content project directory, if you want to see your updates happen immediately. If you don't know where the files are being copied to, select one of them in your content project and press F4 (properties window). Find the "Full Path" entry. That is where your files are stored.
