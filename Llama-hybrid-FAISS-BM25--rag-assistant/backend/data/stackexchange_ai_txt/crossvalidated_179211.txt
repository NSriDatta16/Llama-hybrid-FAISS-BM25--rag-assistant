I think you're asking for a conditional expectation of your label as a function of the features. In any classic regression framework this would be a reasonably straightforward exercise using the model coefficients and whether or not a feature was "on" or "off." In the context of RFs, since the predictions aren't based on a single "model" but represent an aggregated value over many, many "mini-models" -- in other words, the label prediction's relationship with a feature is no longer a simple 0, 1. Your description of a possible solution sounds like it is based on an unconditional arithmetic average and ranking of the "importance" of the features given the prediction, which isn't terribly insightful. You didn't say it, but I think I understand why you're using RFs -- you have too many features to fit into a reductionistic, statistical model. My opinion is that you're going to have to switch out of RFs to a different modeling framework to do what you want to do, but I could be wrong and would be interested in hearing other posters workarounds to an RF-based solution to the OPs question.
