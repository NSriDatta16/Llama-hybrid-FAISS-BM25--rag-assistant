Effective sample size for MCMC with multimodal target

I am trying to evaluate an adaptive MCMC algorithm on a multimodal target density. Among other performance measures, I would like to evaluate the sampler in terms of Effective Sample Size (ESS). The problem is that, for highly multimodal densities, the standard ESS used in MCMC is not useful. For instance: library(coda) set.seed(3213) effectiveSize( c(rnorm(1e3), rnorm(1e3, 10)) ) # var1 # 1.79313 Here the ESS is so low because the autocorrelation decays very slowly with the lag. This is because the first 10^3 samples come from the first mixture component, the next $10^3$ from the second. However, one would like the ESS to be close to 2000 in this example. Hence my question is: are there ESS measures for MCMC that work when the target is multimodal? At the moment my solution is to cluster the output chain, and to sum the ESSs calculated on each clustered subchain.
