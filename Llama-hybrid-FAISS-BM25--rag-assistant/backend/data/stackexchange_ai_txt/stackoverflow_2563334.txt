Documentation of a software project

I am working with a team that works on a very large software project, we have tons of Documentation that is written in MS WORD format with nohyperlinked indexes, no search ability. Everyday we waste our time trying to find the exact document or reference. I was thinking if there was way or even a professional tool that would convert all this into a wiki format and maybe with a little manual (painful) help be organised into something that improves the accessibility. I use Google Desktop Search to make my life a little easier but its not the best solution I just want to know if any of you faced similar problems and possible solutions to this issue.
