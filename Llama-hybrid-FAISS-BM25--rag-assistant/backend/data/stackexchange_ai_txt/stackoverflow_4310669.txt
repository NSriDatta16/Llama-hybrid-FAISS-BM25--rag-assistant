with open(logfile) as f_in: lines = [l for l in f_in if username in l] with open(outfile, 'w') as f_out: f_out.writelines(lines) Or if you don't want to store all the lines in memory with open(logfile) as f_in: lines = (l for l in f_in if username in l) with open(outfile, 'w') as f_out: f_out.writelines(lines) I sort of like the first one better but for a large file, it might drag.
