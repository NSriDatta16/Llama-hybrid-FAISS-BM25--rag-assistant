Oblique random forest with ridge,svm, pls are resulting lesser accuracy than random forests

I am having 20 features with both discrete values and continuous values attributes. I am trying to compare the performance of random forest and oblique random forest. ORF usually performs better than RF but in our case RF is performing better than ORF. Any clarification and suggestion would be greatly appreciated. We used same parameters for all the models. Our class variable is a binary variable.
