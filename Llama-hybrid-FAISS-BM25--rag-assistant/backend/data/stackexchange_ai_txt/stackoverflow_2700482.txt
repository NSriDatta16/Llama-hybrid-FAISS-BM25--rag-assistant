No, there is no way to do this exactly as you describe. But. The very fact that you have this problem means that your initial design is probably not optimal. I don't know your whole problem, so please don't take my advice too seriously, but what immediately comes to mind is get rid of interface implementation in FilterQuery , but rather make it accept (or expose) an instance of Defect , and use that Defect's properties for filtering. Another thing that might work is to have a "storage" structure, which would have all the data fields, and both Defect and FilterQuery would incorporate it.
