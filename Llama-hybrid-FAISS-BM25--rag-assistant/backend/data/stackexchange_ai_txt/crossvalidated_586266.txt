Often more neurons/layers than needed are chosen, and then regularization techniques are used to get a lower effective complexity than the potential complexity. But even then, there is not a canonical answer to how many neurons/layers to choose. Source: Xia Hu et al. " Model Complexity of Deep Learning: A Survey. " (2021).
