How do I create a grid of icons like the iPhone home screen?

How should I go about creating a UI similar to the Springboard (home screen) on the iPhone? I'd like a grid of evenly spaced buttons with images where I can respond to the button tap. Is the UITable a good fit? Should I use a plain UIView and position the icons manually in DrawRect? Is there an alternative that will automatically evenly space the buttons, allow reorganization, and adjust the layout according to the iPhone orientation? I come from a C#/Winforms background and am just now starting iPhone development on the Open Toolchain with 2.2.1 headers.
