JSTL (Jakarta Standard Tag Library) is a XML based standard tag library which offers tags to control the flow in a Facelets or JSP page, tags for date/number formatting and internationalization facilities and several ${fn:xxx()} utility EL functions . Note that JSTL also offers SQL and XML taglibs which enable a declarative manner of executing SQL queries and parsing XML inside a JSP page. This is however discouraged for other purposes than quick prototyping . In the real world both tasks need to be done by real Java classes which are (in)directly controlled/delegated by a Servlet . JSTL is part of the Jakarta EE API and already included in Jakarta EE application servers such as WildFly , TomEE , GlassFish , but not in barebones servletcontainers such as Tomcat and Jetty . JSTL are the taglibs which you import from jakarta.tags.* or http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/* namespaces. JSTL must not be confused with a " custom JSP tag library " (wherein you define a .tld file yourself ). JSTL must also not be confused with taglibs of 3rd party frameworks such as Faces, JSF, Spring MVC, Struts, Displaytag, etcetera. JSTL must also not be confused with Expression Language (EL) (which are those ${} things). Installing JSTL Head to following answer how to install JSTL: How to install JSTL? The absolute uri: http://java.sun.com/jstl/core cannot be resolved JSTL version history and taglib URIs JSTL was available in different versions: 1.0 : Invented by Apache/Jakarta. Composed of two JAR files jstl.jar (the API) and standard.jar (the impl). Taglib URI has no /jsp in path like http://java.sun.com/jstl/core and the prototype version has the library name suffixed with _rt like http://java.sun.com/jstl/core_rt . Came along with and requires at minimum Servlet 2.3 / JSP 1.2. 1.1 : Integrated as part of J2EE 1.4. EL was moved from JSTL to JSP. Taglib URI includes /jsp in the path like http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core . Came along with and requires at minimum Servlet 2.4 / JSP 2.0. 1.2.x : Integrated as part of Java EE 5 and newer. Taglib URI has not changed and is still like http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core . Came along with Servlet 2.5 / JSP 2.1 but works at Servlet 2.4 / JSP 2.0 as well. 2.x : Integrated as part of Jakarta EE 9 and newer. The only change is the rename of javax.* package to jakarta.* package. Taglib URI has not changed and is still like http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core . Came along with Servlet 5.0 / JSP 3.0 and is not backwards compatible in any way due to package name change. 3.x : Integrated as part of Jakarta EE 10. The Taglib URI changes to jakarta.tags.core . Facelets : Facelets, the successor of JSP, has among the provided taglibs a selected subset of JSTL 1.2 core and the full set of JSTL 1.2 functions builtin. This requires a minimum of JSTL 1.2. For Facelets 1.x the XML namespace URI is http://java.sun.com/jstl/core and for JSF/Facelets 2.x the XML namespace URI is http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core with (confusingly!) the /jsp part and from JSF/Facelets 2.2 onwards the namespace URI is http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsp/jstl/core and from Faces/Facelets 4.0 the namespace URI is jakarta.tags.core .
