Rather than embedding credentials it would seem more sensible to use existing NT authentication and run the SQL Server service under an account which has access to the network drive. See question 63749 for some useful hints on service account setup. So, either grant permission for the current SQL Server account to be able to access the network drive, or run the service under a different (possibly new) account which has access.
