The iPhone OS is backward compatible with apps targeted to earlier SDK versions. So, if your app is built with 2.0, it will usually run on 3.0/3.1 without any problems (you should definitely test it though!). Thus, my approach is to always target the earliest possible SDK version, depending on the features needed in that app. If your app doesn't leverage any of the 3.0 stuff (such as push notifications, map view etc.), build with 2.0 or 2.2 - this way you reach much more people.
