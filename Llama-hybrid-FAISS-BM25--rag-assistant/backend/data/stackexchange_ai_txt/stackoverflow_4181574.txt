By "deprecated constructs", you really mean "deprecated member functions". You're asking for a compile-time warning to draw your attention to the call site of any deprecated function. This isn't possible in any reasonable way in standard C++, and I don't see any attributes in G++ that would support this either. Qt can't really add a feature like that if the compiler doesn't have some support for it already. However, Microsoft Visual C++ supports an __declspec(deprecated) extension, and I would imagine it's possible to write a compiler plugin for G++ 4.5 that adds a similar feature.
