Seeming Unrelated Regression (SUR) for logistic regression

I would like to perform linear hypothesis testing on whether $\beta_{11}=\beta_{21}$ in the logistic regressions \begin{align*} \text{logit}[P(Y_1=1|X)]=(\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}X)\\ \text{logit}[P(Y_2=1|X)]=(\beta_{20}+\beta_{21}X)\\ \end{align*} The models are not nested within each other since the outcomes $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are not the same (but the covariate $X$ is the same). I looked into SUR but realized logistic regressions cannot be solved via OLS. Is there a way to obtain variance-covariance matrix for the 4 model parameters above or perform the said hypothesis test? (I understand there are multinomial regression methods but would like to keep the above model structure).
