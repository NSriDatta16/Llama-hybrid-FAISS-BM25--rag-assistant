class weighted classification

I am working on my multi-class classification project and I have a question: I have three classes in proportion: 50%, 47% and 3%. I decided to use class_weight="balanced" parameter in random forest classifier. Now I want to calculate accuracy. Should I use balanced accuracy or can I use common accuracy?
