Javascript Splitting Strings

I came across an block of Javascript code to split a paragraph with the dom structure. The code is as follows: string.split(" "); I am a little confused as to why do they have to use a PLUS SIGN and split the parameter into lookup strings? Why not just use string.split(" "); Is there a technique or browser issue involved here?
