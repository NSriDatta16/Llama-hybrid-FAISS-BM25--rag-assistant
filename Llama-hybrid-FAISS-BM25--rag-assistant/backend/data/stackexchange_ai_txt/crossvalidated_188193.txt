I would not recommend doing this in neither Stata nor other SEM packages. There are a couple of problems in using the so-called meta-analytically derived mean correlation matrix to fit structural equation models. The followings are some of them: 1) It treats the mean correlation matrix as if it was an observed covariance matrix. 2) It does not take the precision of the mean correlation matrix (sampling covariance matrix of the correlation matrix) into account in fitting the structural equation models. 3) If an average, e.g., harmonic mean, of the sample sizes is used as the sample size in fitting structural equation models, the precision of some elements are overestimated whereas others are underestimated. It is hard to tell whether the test statistics and the standard errors are correct. One statistically defensible approach is the two-stage structural equation modeling (TSSEM; Cheung, 2014, 2015a, 2015b; Cheung & Chan, 2005, 2009). It uses SEM to estimate a pooled correlation/covariance matrix based on either a fixed- or a random-effects model. The pooled correlation matrix is then used to fit structural equation models by using the inverse of the sampling covariance matrix of the correlation matrix as the weight matrix. It is implemented in the metaSEM package in the R statistical environment. Here are some examples in MASEM. References Cheung, M. W.-L. (2014).
