Actually, the OP did not relay all the details. First, he is more than likely already running in the same memory space since 99% of all AutoCAD related programming is done in-process. Second, what version of AutoCAD and what verson of .NET? Without knowing these two key pieces of data, any answer may not be correct. Having said that, the DragDrop event on the treeview control is never going to fire if you drop into AutoCAD - the event is for dropping on the treeview! When dealing with AutoCAD, calling the DoDrop from treeview is also not the best option. What you should be doing is calling the AutoCAD Application's DoDragDrop event: AcApp.DoDragDrop(source, data, DragDropEffects.All, New DropTargetNotifier()) The DropTargetNotifier handles the dropped data and would be where you place your messagebox
