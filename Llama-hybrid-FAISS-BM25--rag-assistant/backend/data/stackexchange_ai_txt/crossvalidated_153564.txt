Visualizing PCA in R: data points, eigenvectors, projections, confidence ellipse

I have a dataset of 17 people, ranking 77 statements. I want to extract principal components on a transposed correlation matrix of correlations between people (as variables) across statements (as cases). I know, it's odd, it's called Q Methodology . I want to illustrate how PCA works in this context, by extracting and visualizing eigenvalues/vectors for only a pair of data. (Because few people in my discipline get PCA, let alone it's application to Q, myself included). I want the visualization from this fantastic tutorial , only for my real data . Let this be a subset of my data: Person1 Notice that, by measurement, this data: ... has a mean of zero, ... is perfectly symmetrical, ... and is equally scaled on both variables (should be no difference between correlation and covariance matrix) Now, I want to combine the two above plots . corre gives > $values > [1] 1.6 0.4 > > $vectors > [,1] [,2] > [1,] 0.71 -0.71 > [2,] 0.71 0.71 > > $vectors.scaled > [,1] [,2] > [1,] 0.9 -0.45 > [2,] 0.9 0.45 and, moving on g Does this plot adequately illustrate eigenvector/eigenvalue extraction in PCA? I'm not sure what an adequate ellipses and/or length of the vectors would be (or does it not matter?) I'm guessing, that the vectors have a slope of 1 , -1 is because of my data (ranking? symmetry?), and would differ for other data. Ps.: this is based on the above tutorial and this CrossValidated question . Pps.: the perpendiculars dropped on the vector are curtesy of this StackExchange answer
