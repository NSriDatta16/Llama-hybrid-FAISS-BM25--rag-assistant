It turns out my problem is a little deeper than simply Azure not working on my computer. In order to natively debug IIS apps using windows vista (configured under the project settings) you need to have windows authentication enabled for IIS. This feature cannot be installed let alone enabled under Vista Home Premium under the guise of what home user would want such a feature. For the average VS 2005 user this is okay there is a hotfix but for me and my fancy VS 2008 SP1 there is no solution.
