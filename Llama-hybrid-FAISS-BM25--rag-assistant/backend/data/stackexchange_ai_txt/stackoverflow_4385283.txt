Android Eclipse ADT 8.0.0 (and 8.0.1) problem - can't create views hierarchy with drag and drop in the Outline view

Before the newest version I was able to create hierarchies using drag n' drop, performed on the outline view. Since the upgrade, I can't and the controls ('+', '-' and arrows) are missing. So how am I suppose to build view hierarchies now?
