The examples of members and methods prefixed with an underscore I've seen use the convention to indicate that you shouldn't touch that member or method, when you can't make it private. I read it as 'here be dragons', never had a reason to use it myself. An example is the _jspService() method in servlet development. Check out the linked JavaDocs.
