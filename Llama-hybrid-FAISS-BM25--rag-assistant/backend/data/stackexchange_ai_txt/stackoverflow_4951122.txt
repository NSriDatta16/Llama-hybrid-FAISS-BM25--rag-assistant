I believe that input tags associated with items in a collection (when the model itself is not a collection) need to have an index in the name attribute before you can bind posted data to a view model. Here is the way I usually accomplish this... m.TeamMembers[i].FirstName)%> m.TeamMembers[i].LastName)%> I've also used the template as suggested by Shea, but I have a tad more code trying to force it to render brackets/indexes. member, "TeamMember", "TeamMembers["+(member.Number-1)+"]", new { MemberTypes = Model.GetMemberTypes(member.MemberType.TypeId) })%> Here is an old but still relevant article from Phil Haack on the topic.
