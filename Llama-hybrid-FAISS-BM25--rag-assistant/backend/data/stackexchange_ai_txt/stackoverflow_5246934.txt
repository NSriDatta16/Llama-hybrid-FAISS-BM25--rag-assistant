CWinThread Enquiries (MFC)

I have a very simple question about how CWinThread works and where is the entry point everytime I called ResumeThread(). I'm looking for an entry that looks similar as "main" function where I can perform some operations and branches. I'm also wondering how to end or kill running threads at any point from different thread. Where should I put AfxEndThread()? or simply call pThread->ExitInstance()? My last question is, if i want to make multiple threads, how do I organize them in Standard Template Library (STL) using vector? Thank you.
