secure ODBC connection -- oxymoron?

There are times we need to create an ODBC connection over the "tubes" to one of our customer sites. We would like to provide as much security as possible to our customers, given we are using ODBC and, well... Anyway, there is a checkbox setting in the SQL Server DSN that says "Use strong encryption for data", but absolutely no documentation for it. The only references I can find on the Google nets are unanswered questions -- not very encouraging. Does anybody have a clue what it does or how it works? If that isn't a way to encrypt the data stream, is there another way? BTW, we cannot rely on our customers to force encryption from their end, and dealing with security certificates would be a real nightmare. Thanks in advance, Dave
