Django's template parser doesn't expose blocks by name. Instead, they are organized into a tree structure in the Django Template 's nodelist , with rendering push ing and pop ping on the stack of template nodes. You'll have a nearly impossible time accessing them in the way your example indicates. The SO link that ars references provides suggestions on the best solutions. Of those solutions, defining a variable in the context (ie: {{ title }} in the spirit of your example) that can be reused is probably the most straightforward and maintainable approach. If the piece you want to duplicate goes beyond a simple variable, a custom template tag is probably the most appealing option.
