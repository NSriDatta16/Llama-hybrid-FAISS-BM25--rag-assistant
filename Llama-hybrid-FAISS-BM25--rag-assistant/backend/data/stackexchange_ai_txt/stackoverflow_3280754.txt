The main problem here is understanding the concept of additive/subtractive color : blue + yellow = green only for pigments (paint, ink and so on) because they are subtractive color if you're using lights ( additive colors ) you would get : blue + yellow = white The solution ? If you want to describe subtractive colors (paint-like combination) you have to apply the rule "sum the complementary colors" : blue(#0000FF) +sub yellow(#FFFF00) = black(#000000) because blue_complement(#FFFF00) +add yellow_complement(#0000FF) = #(FFFFFF) --> white which is black complement (in fact we get some dark brown because pigments are never perfect) So why do we get green in actual life ? because we do not use "blue" but cyan(#00FFFF) and : cyan(#00FFFF) +sub yellow(#FFFF00) = green(#00FF00) because cyan_complement(#FF0000) +add yellow_complement(#0000FF) = #(FF00FF) --> magenta I have to add that this is a very simple way of describing the color interaction which is far more complicated...
