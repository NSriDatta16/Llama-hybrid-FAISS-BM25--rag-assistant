You can't pass extra arguments to event handlers. Behind the scenes, the Flex compiler is generating code that looks something like this: private function generatedMouseMoveHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { dragIt(event, 1); } Any event handler created in MXML will be wrapped like that. That's why you can refer to a variable named event .
