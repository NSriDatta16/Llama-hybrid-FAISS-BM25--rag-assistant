This is pretty easy in Haskell: merge as bs = case (as, bs) of ([], _) -> bs (_, []) -> as ((a:as'), (b:bs')) -> if a [] [a] -> [a] (a:bs@(b:_)) -> if a == b then rmDups bs else a:(rmDups bs) take 25 $ rmDups $ merge (map (2^) [1..]) (map (3^) [1..]) yields the following: [2,3,4,8,9,16,27,32,64,81,128,243,256,512,729,1024,2048,2187,4096,6561,8192,16384,19683,32768,59049] though I imagine there's a more elegant way to do it...
