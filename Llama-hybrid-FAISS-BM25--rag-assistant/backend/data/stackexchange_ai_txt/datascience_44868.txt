Machine Learning is enabling the machine to learn by its mistakes. As the machine is not human you need to find a way to tell it what it is doing wrong and a way to reduce its errors. Typically machine learning involves predictions of something (Numbers, Classes or whatever) All the fields you mentioned involve machine learning and of course statistics. Language is transformed into numeric to be processed by learning algorithm which is then able to predict a language from a text or keywords. Hope been clear.
