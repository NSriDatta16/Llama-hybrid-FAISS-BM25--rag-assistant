How to train model when Data is consist of matrices

I am new to ML and python. I am facing an issue related to the training SVM model. I have a training data file size (200,50,120). Where 200 are my examples (or experiments). While Actual data is a matrix X= 50x120. Here 120 are features and 50 is the sample size. On the other side, there is a Y=labels file with size (200,1). I am confused, how to train the model with a matrix? I read some comments about flattering the features into an array. whats is its purpose?
