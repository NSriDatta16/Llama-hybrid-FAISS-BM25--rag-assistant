Simple Transformation with Linq

I'm sure this is a trivial question but I couldn't find a good example. Suppose all you want to do is change one attribute for all objects in a list. I'd like to say something like: List list = ...; list.Select(x => x { x.Name = "Foo" } ); Notice the absence of the "new" keyword. I don't want to recreate objects that already exist, just execute one line of code (in this case a simple assignment) on every element of the list. Is this possible in linq in some elegant way? Thanks in advance!
