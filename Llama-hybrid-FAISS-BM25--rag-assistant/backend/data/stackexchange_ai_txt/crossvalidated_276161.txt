You can construct a confidence interval for the proportion $p$ of not defectives. The interval will be one-sided $[p_c, 1]$ say 95% this gives you an idea based on the width of the interval $([1-p_c,1])$ how confident you are that the proportion is close to 100%. This would be based on the hypergeometric distribution. Based on Bill Huber's comment about the Bayesian approach. This shows that a lot can be said without prior knowledge. This computation is based strictly on frequentist methods.
