RRD4J Sounds like RRD4J (Apache license) is exactly what you're looking for. It is a Java implementation of the well established RRDtool . It is built to collect data over time in a Round Robin Database ( RRD ). Old data is typically archived in RRA archives where the time scale is less fine grained, leading to more space efficient storage. While I have no direct experience with RRD4J, we have successfully been using RRDTool and Cacti for many years, for health monitoring in our data center. Since RRD is the industry standard when it comes to monitoring, I would definitely recommend you take a look at RRD4J.
