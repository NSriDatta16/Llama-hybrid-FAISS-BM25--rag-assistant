This used to be called cellspacing and cellpadding which needed to be set to 0. In CSS, as per this answer : table.main_border { border-collapse: collapse; } table.main_border td { padding: 0;} that should fix it.

Web designers are encouraged to use alternatives (should be very easy in this case).
