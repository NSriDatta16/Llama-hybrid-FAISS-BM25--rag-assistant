Since I didn't design the framework, I can't say for sure, but I believe they probably didn't bother in order to discourage its use for security reasons. I had originally believed that the unmanaged implementation would be faster, but we now know that is not the case, see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14850676/58391 My next best guess aligns with what Pavel says in the comments above. As with most features in .NET and C#, there probably just wasn't enough benefit over cost to implement, test, and ship the feature when the underlying unmanaged one was already good enough. It would be interesting to see a real answer though from someone who designed the language.
