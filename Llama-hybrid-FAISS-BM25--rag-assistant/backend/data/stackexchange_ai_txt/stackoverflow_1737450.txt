I would not consider your solution to be scalable (or advisable). While you might be able to get it work in the short run, trying to process that many rows in Excel is definitely not a best practice -- particularly when you consider maintenance and operational issues. Building a simple cube in Analysis Services is normally pretty straightforward. Once built, your sales team would then be able to connect to a central server using Excel, and issue their queries against it using Pivot Tables or Pivot Charts, with drag-and-drop, etc. If you only have a dozen or so users, you could license SQL Server on a CAL basis, and it should be pretty cheap. In case it helps, I walk through the process of building a simple cube in my book: Ultra-Fast ASP.NET . There are also a number of good examples online.
