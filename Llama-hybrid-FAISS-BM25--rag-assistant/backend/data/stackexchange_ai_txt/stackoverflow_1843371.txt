I recently learned python with a strong C# background. My advise: Just do it. Sorry, couldn't resist but I'm also serious. Install python and read: Python.org documentation (v2.6). A book might help too -- I like the Python PhraseBook . From there, I started using python to implement solutions for various things. Most notably, ProjectEuler.net questions. It forced me to consider the languages and built in data structures. Python is truly easy to use and intuitive. To learn the basics, took me about an hour. To get pretty good with it, took around 5 hours. Of course, there is always more to learn. Also, I want to note that I would discourage using IronPython or Jython because I feel learning core, regular python is the first step.
