iPhone provisioning profile problem

My iPhone application runs fine in the simulator. I'm trying to deploy it onto a physical iPhone. When I install the provisioning profile, my Organizer says "A signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain." I can't resolve this. What do I do?
