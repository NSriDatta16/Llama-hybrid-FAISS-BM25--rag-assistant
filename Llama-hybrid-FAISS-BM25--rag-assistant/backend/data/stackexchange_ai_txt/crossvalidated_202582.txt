This is a perfectly fine definition based on the resources they cite (eg. Jolliffe, 2002); it is at no point wrong. To your particular questions: By score they represent the projections $\Xi$ of the centred data in the linear space defined by the eigenvectors $\Phi$. You can immediately check this in your script with something like: all( abs(score) - abs(X_centered' * U) (I use the abs to ensure we issues with sign). You can produce the $k$-th dimensional approximation of your centred data by using the score of the $K$ first principal components of them. That is: $\hat{X}^K_{c} = \sum_{i=1}^K \xi_i \phi_i$. Assuming $K=5$ in your script this is plainly (coeff * score') which numerically equates the centred sample: all(abs( X_centered - (coeff * score')) . I believe that some of your misconception stems from the fact that you say: " score should be the best linear combination of the principal components $U$" , but unfortunately this is not the case. The score dictate which it the best linear combination of the principal components $U$ to reconstruct the data in terms of fraction-of-variance-explained but they are not the results of that combination. In terms of PCA, SVD contains only the left singular vectors, $U$ (the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of $X$) and the singular values S (the square root of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of $X$, more information here ); nothing about the scores $\Xi$. You will need to project the centred sample $X_c$ using $U$ to get the scores $\Xi$. Inversely, if you know use $\Xi \Phi^T$ you can reconstruct the data back. To recap: score are the projections of the centred data in the linear space defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of $X$. This exactly your final result: $\text{scores} = U^T (X - \bar{X})$. A side-comment: When I started reading on PCA I first try to get the covariance derivation right and then moved to the SVD. I believe that the covariance methodology is a bit easier to follow and somewhat more intuitive in terms of Statistics as well as physical interpretation. Maybe you want to nail that down first and then move to the SVD methodology.
