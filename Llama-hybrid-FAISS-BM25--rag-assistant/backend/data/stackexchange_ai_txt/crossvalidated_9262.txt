I am not sure I understand this bit: "Unfortunately, since the response is the mean value (without looking at the mean, just regular inter-annual variation will swamp the signal)" With careful modelling, it seems to me you could gain a lot by modelling this as panel data. Depending on the spatial scope of your data, there may be large differences in the temperatures that your data points were exposed to within any given year. Averaging all these variations seems costly.
