I suggest using contentLength instead of networkStream.DataAvailable to detect when the data transfer is complete. DataAvailable simply means that there is data received by the OS stack, however depending on the network routing and fragmentation it might not have arrived by the time you're checking the condition, so you stop receiving that data too early. To prove or disprove this, you can do a binary file comparison between what your program has downloaded versus what a normal browser would download. If the former is truncated, then we've found the problem.
