If you want to do this solely using javascript, I would do the following. Give the span an id attribute (so that it can easily be retrieved from the DOM) and place all the content in an attribute named 'content': ${myData} Then, in your javascript, you can do the following after the element has been inserted into the DOM. var elemInnerText, elemContent; elemInnerText = document.getElementById("myDataId").innerText; elemContent = document.getElementById("myDataId").getAttribute('content') if(elemInnerText.length Of course, if you're using javascript to insert the span into the DOM, you could just keep the content in a variable before inserting it. This way you don't need a content attribute on the span. There are more elegant solutions than this if you want to use jQuery.
