SplayTrees and a Dictionary

I'm use a splaytree class as the data storage for the "dictionary". I have the following to deal with Integers, Objects, etc.: public class SplayTree > And I also have the following: public class Entry { public Entry(T word, T def){} ... } Which is what I'm using to add a word entry and its definition But when I try to run some test data, for Ex: SplayTree tree = new SplayTree (); tree.insert(new Entry("test", "test")); I get the following error: Bound mismatch: The type Entry is not a valid substitute for the bounded parameter > of the type SplayTree Any idea to what I should do to fix this?
