Algorithm design: taking words, shifting letters and forming a sentence with them

Within our organization, we were given some sort of assignment / mini competition where we have been given a list of words (brands of water). The goal is to switch the letters of these words around, and end up with a sentence. Because the list is not all too short (about 10 words, most not even very short ones) I figured I wanted to look into programming the solution for this problem. I do have a technical background, but I am not a full blown programmer, let alone have enough insight to create an algorithm of this magnitude. The biggest catch will be the matching of the words, as well as the grammar. I've found one list of words, but I do not believe this one contains different forms of the verbs. I will look into finding more of these, but I hope there is an alternative with some kind of existing grammar engine or API. The catch: this needs to be done in DUTCH, not in English . The actual forming of the sentence (as in the order of the words) is of less importance. If the output is a list of "sentences" that disregard word order, I can filter those out that don't make any sense manually, and then swap words around in order to have it make sense. It would be much appreciated if someone with the right skillset would be able to point me in the right direction, or help me out another way. Get those braincells working :-) Regards
