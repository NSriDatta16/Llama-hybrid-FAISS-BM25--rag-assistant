I reproduced this so we can use my notebook as a reference: https://github.com/csizsek/crossvalidated/blob/03ea088e0805bf550750d27735b38ebe1c9b567a/changing_roc_auc_score.ipynb The data set I used is a simple Ecoli classification data set. You can see that I run the same classificator two times with the label unchanged, then I swap the labels and run it twice again and the ROC AUC score is always slightly different. The reason why this is happening is exactly what @dsaxton said: that most classification algorithms (in this case a Random Forest) use some kind of random bootstrapping or something else that is random and the result model is always slightly different thus it's predictions and the ROC AUC score is different as well.
