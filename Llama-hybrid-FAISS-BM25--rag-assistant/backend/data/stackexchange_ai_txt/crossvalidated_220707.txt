Pattern recognition & classification in time series medical data

I wish to analyze time series data from glaucoma patients to get a better understanding of how that data may fit into patterns and how that may relate to different treatment regimens and preservation of vision. Basically data is comprised of the following: Date: 4 measurements of the intraocular pressure on a given date (these may vary by time they were taken or by methods used to measure the pressure; or both) Cholesterol (or triglycerides) Vision: computerized visual field result (which I hope to dumb down into a "number") The last 3 are nice but it is the first 2 that are key. So, would you be kind enough to suggest a few references I might review to: Get a good overview of data & pattern characterization in time series data? Make any other recommendation you feel might be helpful?
