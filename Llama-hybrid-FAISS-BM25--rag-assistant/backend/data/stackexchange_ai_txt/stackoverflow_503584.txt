Ok so the latest version of StructureMap (2.3.5) has a useful little method called HttpContextBuildPolicy.DisposeAndClearAll(); Cleanup convenience methods on HttpContext and ThreadLocal. HttpContextBuildPolicy.DisposeAndClearAll(), ThreadLocalStoragePolicy.DisposeAndClearAll(). Calling either method will eject all cached instances and call IDispose if the object is IDisposable. Previously the dispose methods weren't being called called, I added that to Application_EndRequest and they are now. I'm hoping that this will solve some of my memory problems. We shall see.
