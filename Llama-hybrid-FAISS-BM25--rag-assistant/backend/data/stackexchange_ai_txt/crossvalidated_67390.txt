I would say that logistic regression can be used. But you could also think other alternatives: -ordinal logistic regression where there are different opportunities which have rank ordering between them (0=not good, 1=might be a good, 2=good with almost certainly, 3=expectionally good opportunity ect) -Just give these opportunities customer specific value metric and use some regression method with non-binary dependent variable
