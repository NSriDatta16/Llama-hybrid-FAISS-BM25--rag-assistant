Unless you want "cat/lizard/snake" as an extra category (probably not attractive because of many possible combinations, but perhaps an option in some cases), the standard category handling does not work for a multi-membership problem. (One-hot- or dummy-)encoding each individual category is the obvious alternative, as you note. Alternatives include forms of embeddings that you average. E.g. one option is multi-membership target encoding. One form of this would be obtained by fitting a suitable random effects regression model with a multi-membership random effect (of course, you'd still want to do things like data splitting to avoid target leakage), but much simpler options like just calculating a target encoding for each category ignoring membership in the others and then averaging is also possible (but may not handle categories that differ substantially in prevalence all that well).
