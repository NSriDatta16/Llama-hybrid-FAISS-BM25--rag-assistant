This is indeed one of the big downsides of MCMC simulations, since there is no general and apriori estimate on the number of samples. I think a good literature here is "Some things we've learned (about MCMC)" by Persi Diaconis which deals with a lot of subtleties of MCMC simulations which might indicates that there is no easy answer to this question. In general, making good estimates on how long to run the chain requires a good understanding of the mixing time of the Markov chain, which heavily depends on properties of the underlying graph. There are many "burn-in-free"-methods out there to bound the mixing time from above, but all of these methods have in common that they need a deeper understanding of the underlying Markov chain and the involved constants are typically hard to compute. See for example "Conductance and Rapidly Mixing Markov Chains" by King, "Path Coupling: a Technique for Proving Rapid Mixing in Markov Chains" by Bubley et al., or "Nash inequalities for finite Markov chains" by Diaconis et al.
