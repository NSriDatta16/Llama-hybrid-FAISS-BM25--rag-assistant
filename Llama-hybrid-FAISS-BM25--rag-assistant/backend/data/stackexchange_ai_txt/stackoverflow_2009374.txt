What I was hoping to do was pick out a random URL from over 2,000,000 records based on the current users interests. This screams for predictive modeling, something you probably wouldn't be able to pull off in the database. Basically, you'd want to precalculate your score for a given interest (or more likely set of interests) / URL combination, and then query based on the precalculated values. You'd most likely be best off doing this in application code somewhere. Since you're trying to guess whether a user will like or dislike a link based on what you know about them, Bayes seems like a good starting point (sorry for the wikipedia link, but without knowing your programming language this is probably the best place to start): Naive Bayes Classifier edit The basic idea here is that you continually run your precalculation process, and once you have enough data you can try to distill it to a simple formula that you can use in your query. As you collect more data, you continue to run the precalculation process and use the expanded results to refine your formula. This gets really interesting if you have the means to suggest a link, then find out whether the user liked it or not, as you can use this feedback loop really improve the prediction algorithm (have a read on machine learning, particularly genetic algorithms, for more on this)
