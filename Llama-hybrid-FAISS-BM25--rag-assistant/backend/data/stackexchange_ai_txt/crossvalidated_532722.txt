Loss values above 1.0

I have a convolutional neural network for tensors classification in Pytorch. I am using Cross-Entropy Loss. My optimizer is Stochastic Gradient Descent and the learning rate is 0.0001. The accuracy of both train and test sets seems to work fine. However, the loss values are above 1. Is there any idea why this is happening and how I can prevent this? Here are the figures of the accuracies and the loss values:
