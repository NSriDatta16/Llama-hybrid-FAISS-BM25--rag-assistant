weighted average in collaborative filtering

I studied on collaborative filtering recently and found that for ratings at last most methods applied were weighted average, no matter what they had proposed, similarity, time, etc. Thus I am wondering whether there is another way to forecast the ratings. Well, I could only come up with weighted average listed above and majority vote since this is kind of an aggregation problem. Are there any other alternative methods? Edit: I was trying to ask for another way to aggregate ratings from others or history or whatever rather than weighted average, which just stroke me from nowhere.
