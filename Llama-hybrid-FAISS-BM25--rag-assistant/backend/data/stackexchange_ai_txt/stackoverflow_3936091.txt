A simple HashMap backed up by Terracotta would do better and will allow to store collection bigger then JVM virtual memory. Embedded databases, especially, the SQL-based ones, will add complexity and overhead to your code, so it doesn't worth it. If you really need a persistent storage with random access, try one of nosql DBs, like CouchDB , Cassandra , neo4j
