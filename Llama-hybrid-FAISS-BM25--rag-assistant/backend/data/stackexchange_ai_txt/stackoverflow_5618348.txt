Nested namespaces in google app engine

Is it possible to create nested namespaces in a google app engine app? Lets say i am modeling a multi-tenant application similar to google docs. So I obviously need one namespace for each organization to avoid data leaks from one org to another. However, i probably want a namespace per user also so that when i am searching for a document, i dont have to search through all the documents of all the users in that organization and again to avoid data leaks. Whats the best way to model this?
