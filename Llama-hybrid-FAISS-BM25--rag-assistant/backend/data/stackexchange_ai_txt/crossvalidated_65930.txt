I agree with @nico's comments. This is in effect an expansion of them. 1) Although ad hoc is academic or researchers' jargon, it should not be understood as a technical term. There is no precise definition (or antonym) to be discovered or found lurking on the internet. 2) Although "to the purpose" fits the Latin as well as any other translation, there is often a negative overtone in the way it is used which is dismissive, disparaging, deflationary, or deprecatory, whether in criticism of other people's work or (perhaps more commonly) of one's own work. However, this is not universal: ad hoc allows a positive translation such as "fit for purpose" (you read it here first?). 3) Commonly, a researcher would describe a test or more generally any procedure as ad hoc as a qualification to defuse possible criticism. The implication would be that although what was done seems appropriate in the circumstances, it should not be taken to follow from general principles or necessarily to have wider applications. There is often an implication that the researcher would willingly use a better-grounded procedure if one could be identified. Examples often serve better than definitions. Faced with distributions that can be negative, zero or positive, and are long-tailed in both directions, I have used cube root transformations. There is no theory worthy of the name behind this; it just works well for those circumstances and can thus be described as ad hoc . The connection with post hoc is a matter of a common Latin word, but there is no statistical link. I know of no reason to hyphenate here: ad hoc and post hoc are the original Latin phrases which remain widely acceptable in academic and research literature.
