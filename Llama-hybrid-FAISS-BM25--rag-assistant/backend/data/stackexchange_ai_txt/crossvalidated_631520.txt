Multicollinearity gets a lot of undue attention. As the Wikipedia entry states: Multicollinearity does not affect the accuracy of the model or its predictions. It is a numerical problem, not a statistical one. There is nevertheless a subsequent inferential problem, seen in your scenario with only two predictor variables. If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are correlated, then you won't be able to distinguish their separate associations with outcome very cleanly. But that will be the same problem whether or not $x_1$ and $x_2$ are mean-centered. See this answer , for example, with respect to regression that is linear in the parameters. From what you describe, mean centering isn't possible in your situation with its nonlinearity in the parameters, anyway. So leave the predictors alone, and recognize the limitations of working with correlated predictors.
