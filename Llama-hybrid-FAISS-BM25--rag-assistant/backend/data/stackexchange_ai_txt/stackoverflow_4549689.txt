A better and easier solution would be to use the same membership provider for both the web application and the forum (which I assume is also using the membership provider). Since you want the same username for both the app and the forum, why not just use the same user database? As for the password, default it is encrypted and not clear text. Check the enablePasswordRetrieval of your provider setting in web.config. In web.config for both apps set the domain attribute to the top level domain: This ensures that if you log in on either the app or the forum, you will automatically be logged in to the other as well.
