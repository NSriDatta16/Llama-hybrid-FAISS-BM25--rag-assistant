Design pattern for web chat client

I am developing a desktop client app for web chat. Something that is similar to icq, pidgin, skype, etc. The client app communicates with the server through POST and GET. Client app has these methods: login logout loadFriendList SearchUser AddFriend SendMessage LoadMessages I would like to use a design pattern for this winforms app. I am a newbie in patterns and I need advice on which design patterns are suitable for this application. Sorry for my English. Any advice on how to organize application code with design pattern? Thank everybody
