Your problems is whilst the first pastie defines utils.httpcache . The variable utils is not defined outside of this function closure (because it is not defined anywhere in global namespace). As below shows. (function() { utils.httpcache = { }; })(); To make it all work in this instance add the following code to the top of your cache.js file. var utils = {}; This declares the utils variable in global namespace. Then when the function closure is executed below it will add utils.httpcache to the utils object. The problem is actually not specific to Appcelerator and is just a simple JavaScript bug. Checkout Douglas Crockfords book, JavaScript the Good Parts . Reading it will literally make you a more awesome JavaScript developer.
