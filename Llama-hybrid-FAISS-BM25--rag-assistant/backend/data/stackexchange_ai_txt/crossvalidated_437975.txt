It is likely that a Breusch-Pagan test shows such a level of statistical significance (i.e. p ) because you have a relatively large sample size (N = 15,000). Visual inspection does indeed show a triangular pattern, indicating potential heteroskedasticity. From my experience, I would be more inclined to use the visual interpretation as it is more telling Edit and further Clarification Given a relatively large sample size (N = 15,000) the Breusch-Pagan test may be sensitive to small deviations from homoscedasticity. This may explain p level of statistical significance The triangular shape of the residuals indeed warrants to consider heteroskedasticity Note: Credit for clarification goes to @SalMangiafico for his input
