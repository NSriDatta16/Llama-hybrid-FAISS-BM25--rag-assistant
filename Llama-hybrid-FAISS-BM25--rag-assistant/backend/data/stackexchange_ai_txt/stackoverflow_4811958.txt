how to BOLD a fragment of the linkText in an Html.ActionLink?

I have this: " + Model.SearchString + " "), "LoginEdit", "Admin", new { area = "Staff", webUserKey = user.WebUserKey }, null)%>, last login: As you can see, I want the portion of the Email string that matches the Model.SearchString to be bolded. I can't figure out the syntax to make this happen, given the context of my code. Any ideas? The goal is something like this (assuming user searched for "john"): john @gmail.com
