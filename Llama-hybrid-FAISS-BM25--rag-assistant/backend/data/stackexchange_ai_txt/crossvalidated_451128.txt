Neural network: finding irrelevant inputs

I am training a neural network and I suspect that some of the inputs might be irrelevant -- they might not have any relationship to the output. How do I identify these inputs so I can get rid of them? (I am assuming that I should get rid of irrelevant inputs, right?) Example: set.seed(123) nr = 1000 nc = 25 xx = as.data.frame(matrix(runif(nr * nc, min=-1, max=1), nrow = nr, ncol = nc)) # y is only a function of V1 - V5 xx = within(xx, y Now what? nn$wts has all the weights, and summary(nn) presents the same weights in a more human-readable format. Can these be used for anything? Ideally, a function / package for doing this has already been written -- I just have not been able to find it.
