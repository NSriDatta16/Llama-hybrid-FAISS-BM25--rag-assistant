iPhone/Android swipe detection for mobile browser

Is it possible to detect that the viewport is being dragged by a touch event? Using the following code I am able to get the position of where the finger touched the screen, what node started the event and where it was dragged to. Which solves one of the problems but I would really like to detect when the user has dragged the page/window/viewport down. To attempt to be more clear as to what I am trying to do: I would like simulate the refresh activity in Tweetie 2/Twitter for iPhone but in HTML5 and JavaScript. window.ontouchmove = function(e){ if(e.touches.length == 1){ // Only deal with one finger var touch = e.touches[0]; // Get the information for finger #1 var node = touch.target; // Find the node the drag started from $("p:last").html( "clienty: " + touch.clientY + " " + "screenY: " + touch.screenY + " " + "pageY: " + touch.pageY ); } }
