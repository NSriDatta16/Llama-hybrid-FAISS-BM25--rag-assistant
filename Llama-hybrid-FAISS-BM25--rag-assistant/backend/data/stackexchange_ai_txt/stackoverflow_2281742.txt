how can you programatically tell if a group header is clicked in a .NET ListView?

What we're looking to do is determine if a group header has been clicked, like the "Hard Disk Drives" or the "Devices with Removable Storage" headers in the My Computer on Vista/7 screen. This has to work in XP. We can detect when a mouse is in the region, and then trap a click, but we'd like to know if there is a specific event.
