If you use Rails, the performance difference between Haml and erubis is negligible: templates get compiled and cached after the first hit, anyway. Combine this with fragment and page caching and you can rest assured that views are not the performance bottleneck of your application. The question you should be asking yourself is: do you like writing Haml? Does it make you more productive? Then you can decide easier.
