In the GAN objective function, why do we first do we first find the D(x) that maximizes the objective function and then maximise wrt the generator?

The GAN objective function is optimised like this: argmin(argmax(L(G,D))) where the argmax finds the D (Discriminator) that maximises L(G,D). Why is it not the other way around, i.e. argmax(argmin(L(G,D))) where argmin minimises L(G,D) with respect to G and argmax does the same but with D? Or would these two approaches yield the same result?
