If your Agent is implementing ITopWorldAgent then you should actually do this: Agent agent = new Agent("John", 9); agent.setTopWorldAgent(agent, "Top_World_Agent", true); If not, then why you are setting something in the manner you are? I presume that something in the setTopWorldAgent method is using a value that hasn't been initialised yet in your constructor.
