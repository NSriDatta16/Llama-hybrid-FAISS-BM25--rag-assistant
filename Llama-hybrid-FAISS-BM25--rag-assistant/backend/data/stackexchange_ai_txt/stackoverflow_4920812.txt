Compilation of postgresql-8.4.7 for Windows

Because of several dependencies in the libraries my company uses internally, I have to compile postgresql-8.4.7 for Windows using Visual Studio 2005. I read the documentation and adapted the paths in the script config.pl according to our internal dependencies. When I try to build postgresql-8.4.7 I can see that the paths are copied correctly (all of the generated *.vcproj files contain the correct paths) but for e.g. OpenSSL a library named ssleay32MD.lib is included, not ssleay32.lib which we use internally. Is this just a question of changing paths and library names and if so which files do I have to edit? I searched the postgresql directory via grep for all possible combinations of the name and fragments of its name, unfortunately to no avail. I would appreciate a good link or a hint for what I should search. Thanks in advance!
