As noticed in the comments, you’ve re-discovered boosting . Nothing wrong with this approach, but usually it’s easier and safer to use a method already implemented and battle-tested by someone else than starting from scratch. If you really want to use your approach, I’d encourage you to first use some out-of-the-box implementation of boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost, etc) to use it as a benchmark.
