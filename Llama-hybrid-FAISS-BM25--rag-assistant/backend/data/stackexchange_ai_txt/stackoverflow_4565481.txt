DataContract/DataMember multiple elements in xml

I have an XML like this: some value ... ... ... ... I would like to deserialize it with DataContract/DataMember.. I know how to handle the array/collection of results elements if they were embedded inside a parent object like: some value ... ... ... ... But I don't know how to do it without the embedding element. Do you?
