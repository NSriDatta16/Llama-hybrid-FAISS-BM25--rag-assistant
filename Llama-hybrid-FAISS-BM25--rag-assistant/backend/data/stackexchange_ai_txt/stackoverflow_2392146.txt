Sorry for replying so late. I somehow solved the problem. I was embedding the plugin using tag then i wrote a small javascript code var MyWorkingPlugin = document.getElementById('MyPlugin'); It seems that after executing the above javascript NPP_GetValue was called. Currently I have no convincing reason why it happened but it worked and I am happy for the moment. If anyone can explain the above behaviour please let us know.
