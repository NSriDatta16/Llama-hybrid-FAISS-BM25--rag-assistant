I try to organize my controllers by concept. Basically I want the action on the controller most related to it. For example, I would consider viewing your own listings to be more related to searching auctions or viewing a single auction than to editing your own profile because the page's model would be emphasizing the auctions, not the user's name, reputation, etc. In your case I'd probably consider something like this: AuctionController - Search - View - PlaceBid - Create - MyListings ShippingController - Payment - Location - Confirm AccountController - Profile - EditProfile - OrderStatus - Inbox FeedbackController - View (for a specific user) - Leave (for giving feedback) AuthenticationController - Login
