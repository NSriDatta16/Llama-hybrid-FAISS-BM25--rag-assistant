Some definitions: Supervised clustering is applied on classified examples with the objective of identifying clusters that have high probability density to a single class. Unsupervised clustering is a learning framework using a specific object functions, for example a function that minimizes the distances inside a cluster to keep the cluster tight. Semi-supervised clustering is to enhance a clustering algorithm by using side information in clustering process. Advances in Neural Networks -- ISNN 2010 Without using too much jargon since I'm a novice in this area, the way I understand the supervised clustering is more the less like this: In supervised clustering you start from the Top-Down with some predefined classes and then using a Bottom-Up approach you find which objects fit better into your classes. For example, you performed an study regarding the favorite type of oranges in a population. From the many types of oranges you found that a particular 'kind' of oranges is the preferred one. However, that type of orange is very delicate and labile to infections, climate change and other environmental agents. So you want to cross it over with other species that is very resistant to those insults. Then you go to the lab and found some genes that are responsible for the juicy and sweet taste of one type, and for the resistant capabilities of the other type. You perform several experiments and you end with let's say hundred different subtypes of oranges. Now you are interested just in those subtypes that fit perfectly the properties described. You don't want to perform the same study in your population again... You know the properties you are looking for in your perfect orange. So you run your cluster analysis and select the ones that fit best your expectations.
