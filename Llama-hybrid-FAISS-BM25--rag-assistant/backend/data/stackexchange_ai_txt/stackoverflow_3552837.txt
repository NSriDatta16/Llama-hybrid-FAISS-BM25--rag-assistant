WPF: Select child control within a Canvas

A quick question regarding WPF: How can I select child elements within a Canvas/Grid? For example, in the following XAML snippet: ...how can I access border1 within parentCanvas_MouseMove and parentCanvas_MouseLeave methods? Also, the way I access the canvas itself within the event handlers looks a bit hacky, I do something along the lines of: private void parentCanvas_MouseLeave(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { Canvas c = (Canvas)sender; c.Background = Brushes.Blue; } Is that the right way of accessing it or is there a more elegant way of doing this? Many thanks, Hamza.
