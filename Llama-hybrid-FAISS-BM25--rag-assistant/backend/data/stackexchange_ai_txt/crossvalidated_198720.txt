I am adding this as an answer because I don't have enough reputation for commenting under the question. I think you are confused between acceptance rate and acceptance ratio . Acceptance ratio is used to decide whether to accept or reject a candidate. The ratio which you are calling as acceptance rate is actually called acceptance ratio and it is different from the acceptance rate. Acceptance rate is the rate of accepting candidates. It is the ratio of number of unique values in the MCMC chain to the total number of values in the MCMC chain. Now your doubt of optimal acceptance rate being 20% is actually about the real acceptance rate, not the acceptance ratio. The answer is given in the other answers. I just wanted to point out the confusion you are having.
