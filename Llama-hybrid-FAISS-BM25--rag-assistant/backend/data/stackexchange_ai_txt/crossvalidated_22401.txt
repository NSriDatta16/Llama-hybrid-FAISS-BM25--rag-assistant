Finding expected minimum absolute difference $E(\min_{1 \leq i \leq m} |x - y_i|)$

I have faced a statistical problem in a computational biology question. I will explain it in statistical language. Let's say we have the results of rolling one red die, $x$, and $m$ black dice $y_1,\ldots,y_m$. These two types of dice are physical identical and both have $N$ faces. The question is finding the average expected minimum absolute differences of values between the red and black ones. $E(\min_{1 \leq i \leq m}|m-y_i|)$ where $x$ and $y$s are discrete and uniformly distributed. My main difficultly is mainly on $E(\min)$ of $M$ random variables. Is there any R function or package regarding such a computation? Update: Here is my simulation in R: nx = 1 # number of red dice , x ny = 4 # number of black dices, y N = 7 # number of faces in dices itr = 14000 # iteration dis.vec = rep(0,itr) for (cnt in 1:itr) { pool = rep(0, N) xz = sample(c(1:N),nx) yz = sample(c(1:N),ny) dis.vec[cnt] = min(abs(yz - xz)) #calculate the minimum } print(mean(dis.vec)) #average!
