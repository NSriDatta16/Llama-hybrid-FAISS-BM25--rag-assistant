Question about heteroscedascity and point estimates

Let's say I am running a regression: $y_{j}=\beta x_{j} + \eta_j$ and $var(y_i|x_i)=var(\eta_i|x_i)=f(x_i)$ , say the variance is increasing in x. assume $\eta$ is fully independent of x, so consistency/unbiasedness hold. So even though ols is unbiased, would this still potentially draw a drastically different point estimate than the case where the variance was homoscedastic? like say for arbitrary obersvation j, $E[\eta_j^2]$ is very very large (e.g., say j is a state, and Y are state averages, and state j has a very very small population, driving the variance up). would then in my sample one large draw from state j significantly alter the regression coefficient? It is just hard for me to reconcile this existing with the estimtor still being unbiased. Is that just the consequence of the hetereoscadascity? if i can keep getting wildly different draws of $\eta_j$ , then the point estimate would also vary widely but on average still be correct?
