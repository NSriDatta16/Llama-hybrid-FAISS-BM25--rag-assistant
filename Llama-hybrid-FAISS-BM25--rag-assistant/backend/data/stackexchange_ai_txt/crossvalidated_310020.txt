Comparing means of samples from different populations

I have two equally long time series samples, drawn from two different populations, I would like to test if the means of the two samples are statistically different given population size differences, one population is much larger than the other. Can you suggest an appropriate test to do this? The data is measuring the adoption of X (defined as : X is chosen / availability for X to be chosen) on a daily basis for a website. The two populations present X to the user in different flows so the samples are generated differently. I was considering Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA but I am still unsure.
