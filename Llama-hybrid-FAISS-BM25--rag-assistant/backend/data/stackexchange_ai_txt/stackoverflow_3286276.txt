You can't actually do this: It is a compile-time error for an expression in an anonymous object initializer to be of the null type. However, you can do this: from a in Activities select new { a.ActivityID, a.ActivityName, a.OrganizationID, OrganizationName = (object)null } This is because in an anonymous object it needs to be able to determine the type of that variable, and it doesn't want to assume it is just object . In fact for your example you may not even want that (you might want a string or a complex type e.g. Organisation ). This is the same problem as going: var a = null; /* What am I oh cruel world */ Having said that I can't see the utility of what you're trying to do here so perhaps if you elaborate on your use-case a more useful answer may be found.
