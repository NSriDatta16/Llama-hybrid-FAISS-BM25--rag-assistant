Welcome to the forum @Tim, and congratulations on your first neural network. If you're already using Keras, you can use the Keras tuner on your network instead of using a separate framework. The Keras tuner documentation is here: https://keras.io/keras_tuner/https://keras.io/keras_tuner/ and there's a tutorial here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/keras_tuner . You are correct that you need some rough idea of valid values for your hyperparameters to start with, but assuming you have a working network already, you can start by incrementing/decrementing your working values for your hyperparameters.
