Web is by nature disconnected model and none of the options mentioned (Session, Application, Cache, ...) are reliable enough. Session will timeout, worker process recycles, etc. If you really need to store the users progress, reliably and through extended periods, the database is your only solution. If you have users profile (if the user must log in), then it's straightforward. If not, generate a unique Id, store it in the cookie (or URL) and track the user based on that identification. Just make sure the Id is encrypted and then base64 encoded string and not just a numeric value. EDIT: After your additional explanation in the original question and comment from Mehrdad Afshari, good solution for you would be to use Session but set the storage to Sql Server instead of InProc. Here's more details and instructions how to set it up: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178586.aspx Have in mind that you will STILL have the session timeouts, but they will survive application pool recycles, even server restarts. If you truly need a permanent storage, custom solution with the database, as I originally outlined is the only solution.
