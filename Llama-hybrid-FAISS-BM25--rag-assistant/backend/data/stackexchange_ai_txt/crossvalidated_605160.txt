How naive forecast is used on validation and test sets?

I need to understand how naive method works when it comes to validation and test sets. I created the following time series and the data partition is as follows: the first 20 days as train, the next 5 days as validation set, and the last 5 days as test. I want to understand the logic behind it, so I do not want to use any library to do it. day
