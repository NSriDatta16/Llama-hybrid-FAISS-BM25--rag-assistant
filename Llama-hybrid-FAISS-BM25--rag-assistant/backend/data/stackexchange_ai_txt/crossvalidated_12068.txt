Classification score: SVM

I am using libsvm (which is meant for solving binary classification problems) for multi-class classification. How can I get classification scores / confidences for each class to effectively compare them given that libsvm can only produces scores for two classes. Desired output: Class 1: score1 Class 2: score2 Class 3: score3 Class 4: score4
