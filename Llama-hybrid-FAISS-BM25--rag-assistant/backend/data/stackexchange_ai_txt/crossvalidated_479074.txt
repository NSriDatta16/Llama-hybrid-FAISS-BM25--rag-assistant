GEE is an asymptotic method and is less robust than it would appear from its derivation. It may not be accurate in small samples, and it doesn't extend to multiple levels of clustering. It assumes that missing data are missing completely at random and is not robust to non-random dropouts in a longitiudinal study. Finally, GEE invites a disjointed way of thinking because not using a full likelihood means that you can't do a Bayesian GEE, you can only do frequentist GEE. There are marginal models (i.e., models that don't condition on subject-specific random effects) that are full likelihood that are not GEE. The oldest example is growth curve analysis, now called generalized least squares. This assumes multivariate normality with a parametric correlation structure, and I have a full case study here . But this approach does not extend easily to ordinal and binary Y.
