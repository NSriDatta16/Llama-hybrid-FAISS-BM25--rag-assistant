This makes me wonder what difflsmeans is doing. By its name, it should be differences of least-squares means, so I don't understand the distinction @Danyou is making (but perhaps overlooked the second part of the lsmeans output for the pairwise differences?). But obviously these are not doing the same thing, the difflsmeans results being very much rounder and with different degrees of freedom. I do know that in this example, lsmeans computes predictions at each combination of ordYear , Fertilizer , and Harvest (assuming all 3 are factors) based on the fixed-effects part of the model. Then it averages together the predictions for each Fertilizer level, giving equal weights to each combination of the other factors. I wonder if the data are unbalanced and if difflsmeans does not give equal weight. You might experiment with the lsmeans call with different weights arguments to see if you can reproduce the difflsmeans results. For example, weights = "prop" or weights = "outer" -- or even weights = "cells" which produces the ordinary marginal means of the data. If you ask me, I'd trust lsmeans . But I'm biased because I'm its author. PS -- Another thing I'll note is that the lsmeans results use a Tukey adjustment (this is the defailt for pairwise comparisons, but you can change to some other adjustment), and the difflsmeans intervals and tests appear to be unadjusted for multiplicity.
