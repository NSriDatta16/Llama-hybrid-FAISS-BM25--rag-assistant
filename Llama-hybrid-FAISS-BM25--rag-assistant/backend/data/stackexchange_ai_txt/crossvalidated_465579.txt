Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the number of dimensions of your data. This is achieved by transforming your data into such form that has smaller dimension (less columns), but preserves some of the main characteristics of the data. This is different from feature selection, i.e. selecting some features (columns), while dropping other columns from your data. In dimensionality reduction we are aiming at loosing as small amount of information as possible, so all the original features take part in creating the new features of reduced dimensionality. You just need to remember that the algorithms extract the "most important" information given some, specific, definition of that they mean as most important. So different algorithms could focus on different things, and some of the solutions may be more useful in some cases, then others. In short, they don't need to "work" in all cases.
