There is no notion of achieving the limiting distribution for a Metropolis-Hastings kernel, unless your proposal is equivalent to your distribution of interest. MCMC as a class of algorithms are asymptotically exact, as, for example $$\Vert P^k(x_{k-1}, x_k) - \pi\Vert_{TV} \rightarrow 0 $$ so the kernel associated with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm converges to the stationary distribution in the limit. To argue that our samples come from the target distribution, we usually run the algorithm for some fixed number of iterations until the algorithm has 'warmed up' or 'burned in'. By this we mean that the algorithm has reached the typical set of the distribution, and is therefore now producing samples from the distribution. These aren't correctly distributed, but (hopefully) very close.
