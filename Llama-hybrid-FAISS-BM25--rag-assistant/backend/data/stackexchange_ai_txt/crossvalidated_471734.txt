Two-way ANOVA or mixed models

I wonder if two-way ANOVA or other mixed-models are to prefer for my analysis. Short background: The effect of three different treatments on parasites on leaves was measured over time (7 sampling dates). Different leaves have been used every sampling so the subject should be independent. I wish to see the effect of treatment (fixed, 3 levels) and date(random, 7 levels) on the amount of parasites. I have 7 samples per date and treatment but use averaged values. I have troubles conducting the two-way ANOVA in R using both random and fixed effects. If anyone have suggestions for this I would love any help! Very thankful for any help!
