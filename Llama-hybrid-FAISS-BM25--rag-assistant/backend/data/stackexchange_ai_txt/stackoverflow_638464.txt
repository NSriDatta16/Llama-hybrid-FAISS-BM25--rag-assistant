In stackless Python, can you send a channel over a channel?

I do not have stackless currently running, so I can not try this myself. import stackless ch1 = stackless.channel() ch2 = stackless.channel() ch1.send(ch2) ch3 = ch1.receive() Are ch2 and ch3 then the same channel? Say: text = "Hallo" ch2.send(text) assert text == ch3.receive() This feature reminded me of a talk about Newsqueak that Robert Pike (of Plan9 fame) gave at Google. In Newsqueak you could send channels over channels.
