First of all, you should use something like this : var_dump($_SERVER); to see what's in the $_SERVER variable : there, you'll find plenty of useful stuff, amongst the HTTP Headers sent by the browser. Like, for instance : HTTP_USER_AGENT : indicates the User-Agent string sent by the browser For example, mine is Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fr; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110323 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.16 and HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE : indicates the languages preferences sent by the browser For example, mine are : fr,fr-fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Note : those are indications -- only ! They can be faked (and even contain malicious data) They can not be there. Then, when it comes to finding the IP address of a user : REMOTE_ADDR is the item that generally contains this information But it can be in another item, generally when the user is behing a proxy -- hence the forwarded headers.
