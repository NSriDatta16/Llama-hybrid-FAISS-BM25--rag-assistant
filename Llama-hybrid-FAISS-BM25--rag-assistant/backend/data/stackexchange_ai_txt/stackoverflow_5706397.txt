Android storage: OnSavedInstanceState not working?

I've read around SO and can't seem to find any answers regarding my problem. I've got an ArrayList of custom objects which implements Parcelable called listOfBuddies . I'm attempting to save it's state using the following code... @Override public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle buddies){ buddies.putParcelable("buddies", listOfBuddies); super.onSaveInstanceState(buddies); } @Override public void onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle buddies) { listOfBuddies = buddies.getParcelable("buddies"); super.onRestoreInstanceState(buddies); } public void onStart(Bundle buddies) { super.onStart(); listOfBuddies = buddies.getParcelable("buddies"); } @Override public void onCreate(Bundle buddies) { super.onCreate(buddies); setContentView(R.layout.buddylist); if(buddies != null){ listOfBuddies = buddies.getParcelable("buddies"); } } However, buddies always returns as null in OnCreate after restarting the Acitivty. Perhaps I'm going about this wrong... but basically I'd like to store the ArrayList of Objects for as long as my application is running.
