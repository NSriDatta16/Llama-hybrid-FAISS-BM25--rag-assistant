Actually, you don't need the "runner" variable as described above, something like: while (!interrupted()) { try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ex) { break; } } But generally, sitting in a Thread.sleep() loop is a really bad idea. Look at the AsyncTask API in the new 1.5 API. It will probably solve your problem more elegantly than using a service. Your phone is getting slow because the service never shuts down - there's nothing that will cause the service to kill itself.
