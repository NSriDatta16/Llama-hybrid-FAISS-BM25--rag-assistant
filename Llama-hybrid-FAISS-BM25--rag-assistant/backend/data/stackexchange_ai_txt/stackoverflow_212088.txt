The AWT EDT is usually the culprit. For some years now it has had some logic to shutdown when there are no undisposed windows. However, there are recurrent problems with leaks, including within the implementation of AWT and Swing. Therefore, I strongly suggest using System.exit in production releases (you might possibly want to leave it out for some testing to detect leaks). The WebStart thread should all be daemon when there are no system windows (console, javax.jnlp services and other dialogs) showing.
