If you are mainly developing these sites for small companies or other reasons where you don't predict or imagine a high traffic (i.e. nothing like Digg/Facebook/etc) then an average of 15ms should be fine. May I ask what the 12 queries are for? I imagine they are for getting menus items, getting page content and the like. There are various methods of combining/optimising queries, so if you perhaps post a few I (and other stackers) may be able to help you optimise your queries.
