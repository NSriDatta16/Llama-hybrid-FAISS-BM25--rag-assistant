Entering values into a linear regression / gradient descent algorithm

The instructor of the machine learning course I've been taking whipped this algorithm at my head without explaining how to apply it to a training set. m = number of training sets (3) j = subscript 0 or 1 x(i) = x from the ith training set y(i) = y from the ith training set alpha = ? h theta = ? If I had a training set of (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), how would I go about entering it into this algorithm?
