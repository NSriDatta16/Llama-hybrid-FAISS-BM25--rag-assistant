How to use DTO in JSF + Spring + Hibernate

Assuming that i'm new about the topic DTO. I can't understand if it is correct to use the DTO in tandem with JSF, Spring and Hibernate. Let me explain, so far I have used the entity bean, created directly from the database, both in business layer and in the presentation layer. Now I decided to try using the DTO approach, but I can not understand how they can help. For example if I have two classes User and Message, and a user has more messages associated; how can I populate the DTO from the database? Or do I manually populate the DTO at the business layer? can someone post an example on how to use DTO? Thank you in advance. Regards, Roberto
