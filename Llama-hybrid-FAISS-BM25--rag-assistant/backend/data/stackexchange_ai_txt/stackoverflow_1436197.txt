It's easy to fragment packet with UDP. If you send a UDP datagram larger than the MTU, it will be fragmented. It's not so easy with TCP, OS will not knowingly fragment packet. Changing host or router MTU doesn't help either because most OSes will do MTU discovery and find the smallest one. You should use some thing like Packet Generator to simulate fragmented TCP packets.
