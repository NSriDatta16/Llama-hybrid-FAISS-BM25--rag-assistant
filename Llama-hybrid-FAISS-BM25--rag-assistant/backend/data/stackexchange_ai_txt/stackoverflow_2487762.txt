This is a simple kinematics problem. At some time t, the velocity (v) of an object under constant acceleration is described by: v = v0 + at Where v0 is the initial velocity and a is the acceleration. In your case, the final velocity is zero (the object is stopped) so we can solve for t: t = -v0/a To find the total difference traveled, we take the integral of the velocity (the first equation) over time. I haven't done an integral in years, but I'm pretty sure this one works out to: d = v0t + 1/2 * at^2 We can substitute in the equation for t we developed ealier: d = v0^2/a + 1/2 * v0^2 / a And the solve for v0: v0 = sqrt(-2ad) Or, in a more programming-language format: initialVelocity = sqrt( -2 * acceleration * distance ); The acceleration in this case is negative (the object is slowing down), and I'm assuming that it's constant, otherwise this gets more complicated. If you want to use this inside a loop with a finite number of steps, you'll need to be a little careful. Each iteration of the loop represents a period of time. The object will move an amount equal to the average velocity times the length of time. A sample loop with the length of time of an iteration equal to 1 would look something like this: position = 0; currentVelocity = initialVelocity; while( currentVelocity > 0 ) { averageVelocity = currentVelocity + (acceleration / 2); position = position + averageVelocity; currentVelocity += acceleration; }
