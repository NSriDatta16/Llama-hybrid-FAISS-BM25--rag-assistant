Java Web Start wont download updated application when run

I've read that JWS checks the jnlp or the jar file on the server for a timestamp change to detect if there are updated files, but my application updates don't download automatically when I run an application a second time. If i javaws -uninstall, then launch the app again, it works fine so I know the files on the server are updated. I also checked the time stamps on the FTP, and they are updated when new files are uploaded, so I don't think thats the issue either. Can anybody help? It'd be very greatly appreciated!
