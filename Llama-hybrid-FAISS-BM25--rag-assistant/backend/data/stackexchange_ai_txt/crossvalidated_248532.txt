How to do Time Series analysis with only 10 data points

I think this is a basic question but really I just need a definite starting point. I am working in R. I have a dataset as follows rowid TimePoint1 TimePoint2 TimePoint3 TimePoint4 TimePoint5 etc. 1 54 34 55 74 474 2 36 63 83 344 636 3 151 61 1643 34 976 etc. (There are actually 10 TimePoints and hundreds of rows) I want to basically create a best fit line (likely non-linear) which I can then compare to another group with the same dataset structure. I think I really need to know what this type of analysis might be called- firstly to create the best fit (is it just regression?) and then to compare with another group.
