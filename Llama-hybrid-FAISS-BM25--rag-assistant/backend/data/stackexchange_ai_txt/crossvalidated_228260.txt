Does it make a difference to run xgboost on hot encoded variables or single factor variable?

I have a dataset, that has a categorical "products" column. It has some 1000 distinct values. Can I directly convert it to integers (say 1-1000) and use this column as a single variable or should I convert it to dummy coding 1/0 for all products as columns? Does it make a difference?
