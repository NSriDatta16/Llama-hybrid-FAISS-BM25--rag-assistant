Keras used to use 2 backends(Theano and Tensorflow), but now only supports Tensorflow because of the discontinuation of Theano. The reason why Keras uses Tensorflow as it's backend is because it is an abstraction layer. It is the easiest way to get started with AI and machine learning because all of the core algorithms are implemented in tensorflow and keras allows you to just call the classes/functions without adding any additional code. Great starter library for beginners and AI enthusiasts who have little coding experience.
