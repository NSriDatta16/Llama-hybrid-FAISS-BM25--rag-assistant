How can I tell if a thread is finished executing without polling ThreadState?

Is there an elegant way to know when a worker thread is done executing so I can access resources it produced? For example if the worker thread queried a list of SQL Servers using ServersSqlDataSourceEnumerator.Instance.GetDataSources(); and saved the result in a DataTable variable, what mechanism can I use to know when this DataTable variable has been populated/is available. I don't want to poll ThreadState; it would be ideal to fire an event when it's done so I can perform actions with the result. Thanks!
