Embedding business logic in the SQL Server might improve the performance but it's going to complicate the design by violating seperation of concerns. In order for me to have portable business logic, it should be in the business layer. I would remove the validation logic from the stored procs and only use them to make CRUD operations easier. You never know when the project stakeholders are going to say "make it run on Database X!". Do your best to keep the validation logic database independent.
