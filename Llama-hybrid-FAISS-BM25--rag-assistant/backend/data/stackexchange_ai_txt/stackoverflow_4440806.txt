get substring from string in C

I am trying to write a program in C, which will allow me to get a string I want between two other strings that will be defined. To be more specific, my example string is "blahblah blahblahblah" and I need to be able to extract the "agent007" substring to a new variable. I have tried the strtok() method, but the thing is I can't extract the tokens to a new variable or an array. I have tokenized the string and the statement that would suite me fine would be something like " if token[i] == "mailto" && token[i+2] == "example" then mailAdd = token[i+1] " (in a pseudo-code way :) ) my program so far #include #include int main () { char str[] ="blahblah blahblahblah"; char * tch; tch = strtok (str," Of course, any other suggestion beyond tokens will be greatly appreciated -
