"Canonically speaking" you can use C or C++. Objective-C is not the only possible language and you can sprinkle Objective-C calls in the middle of C++ code if you like. But really your fear of objective-C is unfounded, it's a great language once you get to know it. And knowing it well really helps leverage the large set of foundation classes. If you're going to move to a platform to develop, do it right or don't bother. That's been my motto on other platforms, with other languages.
