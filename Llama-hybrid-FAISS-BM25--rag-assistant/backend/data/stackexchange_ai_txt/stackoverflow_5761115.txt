See: What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers? You could use VARCHAR(2048) if you want a lower limit. There's nothing wrong with using TEXT in terms of space though. In both cases they only use as much space as the text plus a few bytes to represent the length. See Data Type Storage Requirements for details. As for whether or not you should pick VARCHAR or TEXT see: MySQL: Large VARCHAR vs. TEXT?
