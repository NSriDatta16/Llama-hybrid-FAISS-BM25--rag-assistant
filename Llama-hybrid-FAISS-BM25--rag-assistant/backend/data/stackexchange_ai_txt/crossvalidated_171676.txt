Models for machine learning + constrained optimization

What type of models exist to optimize an output based on certain inputs, if you do not know the mathematical relationship between these, but have access to past input and output data? For example, let's say I am trying to optimize the purity of a chemical compound in an experiment, and I have done hundreds of experiments in the past, for which I have the output (purity) and inputs (concentration of each component, temperature, pressure, etc...).
