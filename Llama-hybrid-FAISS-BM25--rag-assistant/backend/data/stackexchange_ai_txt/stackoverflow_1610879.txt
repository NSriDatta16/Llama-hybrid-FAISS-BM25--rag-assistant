How to simulate a web browser so the website feeds me the correct HTML source?

I'm trying to webscrape a website and it appears to be feeding me bogus HTML with the WebClient.DownloadData() method. Is there a way for me to "fool" the website that I'm a browser of sorts? Edit: Adding this header still doesn't fix the issue: Client.Headers.Add("user-agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)"); Is there something else I can try? :) Edit 2: If it helps at all. I'm trying to download the source of a ThePirateBay Search. This URL: http://thepiratebay.org/search/documentary/0/7/200 As you can see, the source shows what is should, seed information for the movies etc. But when I use the DownloadData() method, I get random torrent results, nothing at all related to what I'm search for.
