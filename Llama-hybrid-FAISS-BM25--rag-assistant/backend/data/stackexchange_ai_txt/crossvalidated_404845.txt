NUM_TRANSACTIONS * AVERAGE is the total time spent loading this page (e.g. page 1: the sum of all 891 343 loading times of this page), since AVERAGE = TOTALTIME/NUM_TRANSACTIONS. This is not a good measure for your problem, since you lose the information which pages are requested frequently. For the start, it might be helpful to plot the NUM_TRANSACTIONS versus the AVERAGE time to load (since we don't know anything else about the pages like number of images/javascript code/whatever) and inspect visually if there are unusually high AVERAGE loading times associated with high NUM_TRANSACTIONS. Alternatively, if you want to identify the Top 10 problematic candidates, you could find the overall average loading time: TOTALAVERAGE = (sum of all (NUM_TRANSACTIONS*AVERAGE))/(sum of all NUM_TRANSACTIONS), then sort your pages by decreasing NUM_TRANSACTIONS and take the 10 topmost pages where AVERAGE is above TOTALAVERAGE. Bulding on this, you could calculate a rough SCORE = NUM_TRANSACTIONS*(AVERAGE-TOTALAVERAGE) for all pages and take the Top 10 with the highest positive SCORE.
