Regression: Explaining increase in revenue from explanatory variables

My boss has an ice cream stand on the sea and has asked me to explain different factors contribute to the revenue of the stand. Each month my boss produces a revenue expectation. We if we miss the target he'd like me to explain how three factors contributed to the difference between the expectation and the realized result. There are three external factors that affects the revenue of the ice cream stand. 1) improvements in the ice cream formula. 2) the total ice cream sales per month for the whole area. 3) how many days with high waves. From historical data I know that the correlation between revenue and "2" is about 50% and the correlation between revenue and "3" is about 27%. Let's say my boss expects ice cream stand to have $100 of revenue for December and when December ends the stand made 110. My boss will then ask me "how much of increase in revenue can be explained by the increase in (for instance) the difference between the projected total ice cream sales and the actual sales? (And similar for the number of high wave days). Initially I thought I could just regress the the revenue and "3" for instance on "2" to answer that question, but I think I am missing an elegant/simple solution. Many thanks,
