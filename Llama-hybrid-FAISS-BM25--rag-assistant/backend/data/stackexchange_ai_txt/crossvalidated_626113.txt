What is the cross product of two probability distributions $P \times Q$?

In many papers on machine learning and statistics, I encounter the following notation Let $P$ be a distribution, and let $Q$ be another distribution. Then the author creates an object $P \times Q$ However, this object is not defined. It is not known if $\times$ means the usual product, cross product, cartesian product, or some other product. Example : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08560.pdf (Equation 1) Can someone please offer an explanation to the precise mathematical operation $\times$ is doing to these distributions and offer at least a simple example when $P, Q$ are simple probability distributions such as the Gaussian probability density function? In other words, can someone please provide simple examples of $F$ where $F = P \times Q$ ?
