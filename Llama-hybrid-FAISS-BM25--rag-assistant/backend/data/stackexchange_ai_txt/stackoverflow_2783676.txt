You probably mean "thread-safe" instead of process-safe. All libc calls are process-safe on Linux as processes (normally) live in separate memory spaces. On the other hand, readdir is not thread-safe, as it keeps an internal static storage for the context. Use readdir_r in that case (the _r means reentrant). The other functions in dirent.h are reentrant by default.
