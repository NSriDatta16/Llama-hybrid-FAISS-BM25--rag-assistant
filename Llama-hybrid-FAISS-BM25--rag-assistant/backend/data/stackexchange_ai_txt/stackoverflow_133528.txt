First impressions of the Fantom programming language?

Has anyone here given the Fantom programming language a whirl? (pun intended). My first impression: I like the ability to have the code run on either the .NET or Java VM. The syntax is nice and clean and does not try anything fancy. I have a belief that "the library is the language" and the developers of Fan believe that their USP is their APIs : But getting a language to run on both Java and .NET is the easy part - in fact there are many solutions to this problem. The hard part is getting portable APIs. Fan provides a set of APIs which abstract away the Java and .NET APIs. We actually consider this one of Fan's primary benefits, because it gives us a chance to develop a suite of system APIs that are elegant and easy to use compared to the Java and .NET counter parts. Any other thoughts, first impressions, pros and cons?
