What is the difference between using a time series model and using i.e the naïve approach for forecasting?

I was reading about forecasting at Wikipedia: Forecasting and I noticed that in the publication they separate the Naïve, Average and Drift approach from the Time series methods (which involve AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, exponential smoothing models...). This is a little confusing for me, because I understood that all of these methods were Time series methods. What is the difference between these forecasting approaches and the "Time series methods"?.
