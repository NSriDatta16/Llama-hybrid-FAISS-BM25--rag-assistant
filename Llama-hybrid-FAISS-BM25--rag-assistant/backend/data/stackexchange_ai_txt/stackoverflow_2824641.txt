#1 and #2 are simple but probably won't scale well to more complicated behaviors. Behavior trees (#3) seem to be the preferred system in many games nowadays. You can find some presentations and notes on AiGameDev.com, e.g. http://aigamedev.com/open/coverage/paris09-report/#session3 and http://aigamedev.com/open/coverage/gdc10-slides-highlights/#session2 (the first one from Crytek is quite good) You probably don't need to worry about "efficiency" here in the sense of CPU usage, since this is very unlikely be a major bottleneck in your game. Reducing the amount of programmer/designer time needed to tweak the behavior is much more important.
