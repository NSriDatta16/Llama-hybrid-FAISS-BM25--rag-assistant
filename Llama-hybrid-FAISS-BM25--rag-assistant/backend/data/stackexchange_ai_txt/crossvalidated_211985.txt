Do you obtain similar training and test error in your evaluation? If yes, you are probably really stuck with a high bias (your data might just not reflecting the relation you want to model sufficiently in its current form, as gung indicated). In this case you could try some more feature engineering/feature derivation. In case you are not utilizing train/test/cross validation you should start by adding those. For feature derivation: you could try to obtain more features for your problem, or derive additional features from the 12 you have so far. This could be done using simple transformations (e.g. Box-Cox), but using domain specific knowledge about the problem and features to transform them into something "more useful" in the respective domain will likely be more helpful. BTW: you could also normalize to SD=1 instead of using a hard range [0,1]. This might help in case of outliers, but you seem to have less of them anyway, hence a resulting similar SD over all features.
