Logistic regression: my main effects lose significance when I add my interaction effects. Why?

I have a dichotomous dependent variable for a 2x3 experiment. There are about 30 observations in each cell, for a total sample size of about 180. Each person was only in one cell. The dependent variable is 0 if they did not display a behavior and 1 if they did display a behavior. The first independent variable has a control group and a treatment group, and the second independent variable has a control group and two treatment groups. So Var1 is 0 for control and 1 for treatment, and Var2 is 0 for control, 1 for the first type of treatment, and 2 for the second type of treatment. I ran a logistic regression in SPSS for just the main effect and got significant results for Var2(2) (which is the second treatment for Var2--the reference group is the control group). I also ran a logistic regression for the main effects AND the interaction of Var1 and Var2, and the main effects go away (the interactions are not significant). Here are my results (I changed actual variable names to this general notation for ease of use). Why would my main effect go away if the interaction is not significant? Does anyone have any idea on what is going on? Do I not have a main effect, or am I interpreting the second logistic regression incorrectly? Any help would be appreciated!
