Covariance example in deep learning book

Someone please help me understand this question. The question is already asked: Help in example for Covariance zero doesn't always imply independence I understand $\mathbb{E}(X)=0$, but I still don't understand why $\mathbb{E}(S)=0$. We have $p(s)=\frac{1}{2}$ when sampling on $[-1, 1]$ and $p(s)=0$ when sampling out of $[-1,1]$. Then $$\mathbb{E}(S)=\int{Sp(S)dS}=p(S)\int{SdS}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1\Big|_{-1}^1\right) = 1$$
