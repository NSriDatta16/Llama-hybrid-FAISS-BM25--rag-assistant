Running Tests From a Module

I am attempting to run some unit tests in python from what I believe is a module. I have a directory structure like TestSuite.py UnitTests |__init__.py |TestConvertStringToNumber.py In testsuite.py I have import unittest import UnitTests class TestSuite: def __init__(self): pass print "Starting testting" suite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromModule(UnitTests) unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=1).run(suite) Which looks to kick off the testing okay but it doesn't pick up any of the test in TestConvertNumberToString.py. In that class I have a set of functions which start with 'test'. What should I be doing such that running python TestSuite.py actually kicks off all of my tests in UnitTests?
