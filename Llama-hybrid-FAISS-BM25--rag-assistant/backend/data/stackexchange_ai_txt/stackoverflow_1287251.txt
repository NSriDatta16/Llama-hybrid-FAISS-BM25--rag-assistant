Use conditional comments targeting IE. This way other browsers/bots (even when masquerading as IE) won't see it. Make sure the message is polite and unobtrusive. Focus on benefits of change ("our website is faster and easier to use in up-to-date browsers") rather than negative aspects of IE (otherwise users could interpret this as ridicule of them or anti-Microsoft fanboyism). Be as non-technical as possible. Average user doesn't know the difference between Internet, browser and search engine (‚Üê this video is painful to watch).
