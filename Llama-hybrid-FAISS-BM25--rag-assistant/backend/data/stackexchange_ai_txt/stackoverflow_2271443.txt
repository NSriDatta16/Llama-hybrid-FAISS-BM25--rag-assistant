Create static library from multiple .h/.cpp files (Visual Studio 2005)?

I'm trying to create a static library using Visual Studio 2005, consisting of multiple header and source files, for example: A->B, A->C, A->D B->E (A->B = B is #include-d in A) I managed to compile a static library by following the MSDN tutorial and put all the files in a project file in Visual Studio, and compiled a .lib. The problem is, I only want others to have access to one header file (A), and not the others, but because A includes the other files, after I have compiled the library and tried to use this in another project, when I only include the static library and header file from A, it says it can't find the header files for B, C, D and E. Is there a way to solve this issue? One method (not the most elegant and simple method) I thought of is to put all the codes into one set of header/source files, but that's a lot of work and can get quite tricky...
