If you've had experience with C++, think of Java arrays as C++ arrays in that once their size is defined, it stays that way. If you wish to increase the capacity, you need to recreate the array and add the contents of the old array inside. Essentially this is what vector did. In Java if you want an expandable array, you essentially want a List object. I would strongly encourage you to use an ArrayList which is essentially the equivalent of vector in Java, allowing you to add as many objects as you want without worrying about its capacity. If you ever need an array, you can convert it using the toArray() method (though in my experience, ArrayList does everything you'd require).
