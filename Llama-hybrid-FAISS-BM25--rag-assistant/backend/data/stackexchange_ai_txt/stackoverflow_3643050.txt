ParallelFor code for finding sum of few elements in an array (Subsetsum problem)

I have the following C# code fragment: using System; class count { public static void Main() { int [] a = {-30, 30, -20, -10, 40, 0, 10, 5}; int i,j,k; int N=8; for (i=0; i What the above program does is, find out the triplets a1, a2, a3 from an Array A, such that the sum of the triplets is 30. I want to know how I can do the sum calculation using the C# Parallel.For extension. I know that this is used as an interview question and there are better alternative algorithms than an i,j,k loop. However, all I want is just to understand how to perform this using Parallel extensions for C# , in an effective way.
