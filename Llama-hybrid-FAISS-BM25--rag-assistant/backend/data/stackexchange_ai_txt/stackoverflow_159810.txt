Update: Aside from all my preachings below, here's the answer you are looking for: There is a Group Policy to turn off the "Save As..." menu item from the File menu in Internet Explorer (IE5+), which can be deployed per-machine or per-user. However, that group policy does not control the "Save Target As..." from the context menu. Unless you are part of the IT department of the company the user is working for, attempting to limit the user actions in the HTTP agent is never a good idea for multiple reasons: You should not mess with the user's computer You might be breaking other applications You don't know what HTTP agent the user is using Relying on limiting the user actions is at best futile, as any sofisticated user will probably find a way to circumvent your limitation It's the quickest way to alienate your users And even if you are part of the IT department, you should try to limit your control over the user's actions as much as possible.
