Updating all rows of a denormalized table in NHibernate

Hey all, quick NHibernate question. In my current project, we have a denormalized table that, for a given unique header record, will have one or more denormalized rows. When the user is accessing a POCO representing the header and performs an update, I need this change to cascade down to all of the denormalized rows. For example, if the user changes field 'A' in the normalized header, I need all denormalized rows to now reflect the new value for field 'A'. My current though is to just do a foreach in the normalized header on the property set, since I already have an IList representing the denormalized rows, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution that does not involve writing a foreach loop for each normalized field that needs to propagate down to the denormalized table. FYI in the pure Sproc world, we'd just issue a second update command in a save sproc with an appropriate where clause - but we're also trying to move away from the sproc dependencies and perform most operations in c# TIA
