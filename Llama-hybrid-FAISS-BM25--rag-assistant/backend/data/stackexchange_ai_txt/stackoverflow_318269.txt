How to shift your paradigm to test-driven development

I've had been hearing about test driven development for a couple years now, and I never really paid too much attention to it from a practical level until recently when I started getting more interested in the .NET MVC. I've been playing around a lot with the MVC Storefront Sample , and I am realizing just how cool and helpful that the test driven approach can be. However, I've been programming using a "test last" approach for a long time now, and when it comes down to business, I can always best estimate my effort with the approach that I am most familiar with. I'm guessing that learning how to use the test driven approach is less like learning another programming language, but more of a change in how you approach laying the framework for, and planning the requirements for building an application. I don't think I could just pick up a book and start a project for one of my clients using TDD, I'm guessing my introduction to it need to be more methodical. What is the best way for me to shift my mind-set of planning to build an application so I can become effective with test-driven development in the shortest amount of time?
