If you're using Java 5+, you can use a custom Annotation, e.g. @MayReturnNull UPDATE All coding philosophy aside (returning null, using exceptions, assertions, yada yada), I hope the above answers your question. Apart from primitives having default values, complex types may or may not be null, and your code needs to deal with it.
