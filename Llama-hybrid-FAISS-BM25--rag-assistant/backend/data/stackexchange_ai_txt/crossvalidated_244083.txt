It depends which field you're in but, one of the big initial pushes for the study of random matrices came out of atomic physics, and was pioneered by Wigner. You can find a brief overview here . Specifically, it was the eigenvalues (which are energy levels in atomic physics) of random matrices that generated tons of interest because the correlations between eigenvalues gave insight into the emission spectrum of nuclear decay processes. More recently, there has been a large resurgence in this field, with the advent of the Tracy-Widom distribution/s for the largest eigenvalues of random matrices, along with stunning connections to seemingly unrelated fields, such as tiling theory , statistical physics, integrable systems , KPZ phenomena , random combinatorics and even the Riemann Hypothesis . You can find some more examples here . For more down-to-earth examples, a natural question to ask about a matrix of row vectors is what its PCA components might look like. You can get heuristic estimates for this by assuming the data comes from some distribution, and then looking at covariance matrix eigenvalues, which will be predicted from random matrix universality : regardless (within reason) of the distribution of your vectors, the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues will always approach a set of known classes. You can think of this as a kind of CLT for random matrices. See this paper for examples.
