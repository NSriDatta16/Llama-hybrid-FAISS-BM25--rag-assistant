If You put in parent.phtml this print $this->getChildHtml('child') Magento should render child.phtml inside parent.phtml As for Your other question... Some block render all blocks that are childs to them, but some renders only those blocks that are echo'ed inside their template. So 'product.info.additional' can use echo $this->getChildHtml() and 'product.info' can use echo $this->getChildHtml('block_name') Please provide me Your module config.xml
