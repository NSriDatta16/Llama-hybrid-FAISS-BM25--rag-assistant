Without an actual error message it's hard to say what particular problem you encounter with. But to solve all possible issues, First of all, you must read an official manual page to make yourself understand PHP strings syntax: http://php.net/types.string Then, you have to understand Mysql proper syntax. I've explained it already here Finally, you have to put everything together like this: $agent = mysql_real_escape_string($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']); $sql = "INSERT INTO `table` set useragent = '$agent'"; $res = mysql_query($sql) or trigger_error(mysql_query.$sql); Running your queries this way you'll never have any problem. Or comprehensive error message at least.
