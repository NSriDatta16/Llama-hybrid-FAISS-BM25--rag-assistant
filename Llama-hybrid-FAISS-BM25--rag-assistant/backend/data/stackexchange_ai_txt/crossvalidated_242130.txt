Logistic Regression Trees in R

Do any of you know if there is an R implementation of logistic regression trees? Specifically, I am looking for a logistic regression tree implementation in R based on a specific algorithm (LOTUS - Logistic regression Tree with Unbiased Splits) developed by Kin-Yee Chan and Wei-Yin Loh. P.S: I am familiar with LMT (Logistic Model Trees) available through the RWeka package and mob (party package).
