IE8 parseFloat problem

in IE8 i get the following error: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; OfficeLiveConnector.1.4; OfficeLivePatch.1.3; Tablet PC 2.0; .NET4.0C) Timestamp: Mon, 11 Apr 2011 12:36:39 UTC Message: Object doesn't support this property or method Line: 102 Char: 4 Code: 0 URI: http://www.geoffmeierhans.com/js/jquery/appone.js The line it is referring to has the following code on it: var distance = parseFloat($('#distance').val()); Anyone know why this might be happening? Thanks
