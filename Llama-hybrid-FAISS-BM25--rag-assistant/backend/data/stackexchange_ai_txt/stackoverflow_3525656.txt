Moving the Wordpress Publish Module

On the Wordpress dashborad page for writing a new/editing an existing post, is it possible to have the 'Publish' module appear at the bottom right (be the last module on the right) as a default, without having to drag and drop it there? I'm okay with changing the code in the core files, I just need to know how to do it ?
