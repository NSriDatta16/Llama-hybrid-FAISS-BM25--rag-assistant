Using both positive and negative values as neural network input?

In neural networks, we sometimes convert the input to z-scores. However, z-scores contain both negative and positive values, if we use such numbers as input, it seems that in some cases the neural network would not be trained well? For example, the loss function w.r.t. a weight variable in the first layer would completely flip if the input (z-score in this case) changes sign. Then the gradient * lr in such two training sessions would be very likely to cancel each other.
