In RDBMS the code smell is rarely in the SQL text, the code smell in in your schema. Case in point: search for some condition in a table without proper index, which will always result in a table scan. To get the last ID_AdvancedRatePlan for a given ID_Hearing, organize the table accordingly: create clustered index cdxARDebitDetail on ARDebitDetail (ID_Hearing, ID_ARDebitDetail DESC); If changing the clustered index is undesirable, for various resons, a covering nonclustered index should be provided. Whatever you do, the gist of it is that you should not scan the table each time, that's the recipe for disaster at deployment. Then you can search as you wish, and Electric's answer is a very good answer.
