Don't really understand your problem. I run multisites from same webapp, packaged as a single war. My WAR is organized as follows, myapp/WEB-INF myapp/common myapp/site1 myapp/site2 All the classes, TLDs are shared but 2 sites have totally different brand, themes etc. The site specific files go to their own directory. They share lots of static files like javascript and images. These files are stored under common and can be referenced using relative URL for each site, for example, ../common/images/cart.jpg The whole thing is delivered as a single WAR and runs as a single app. The site is available at http://example.com/myapp/site1 We also have an Apache front-end with mod_rewrite and the sites are also available as, http://site1.example.com http://site2.example.com
