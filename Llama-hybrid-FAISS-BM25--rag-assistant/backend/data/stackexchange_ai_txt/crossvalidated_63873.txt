Quote from Lütkepohl and Krätzig, Applied Time Series Econometrics, 2004. "Occasionally it is convenient to consider systems with both I(1) and I(0) variables. Thereby the concept of cointegration is extended by calling any linear combination that is I(0) a cointegration relation, although this terminology is not in the spirit of the original definition because it can happen that a linear combination of I(0)variables is called a cointegration relation." So yes, it seems like an acceptable procedure.
