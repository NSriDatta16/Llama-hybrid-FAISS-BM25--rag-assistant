Rebol Parsing Rule: how to correct the rule to separate paragraphs

I want to parse orders-series below: orders-series: {Wordpress Profiles Blogger is a User Admin is a Blogger Author is a Blogger Subscriber is a User Blogger Role Blogger Manage Posts Admin Roles Admin Manage Site Manage Site Include Manage Users Manage Site Include Manage Themes Manage Site Include Manage Plugins } orders-block: copy [] newline2: rejoin [newline newline] rule: [ [some [copy orders to newline2 (append orders-block orders) thru newline2]] | copy orders to end (append orders-block orders) ] parse orders-series rule write clipboard:// mold orders-block I got this in clipboard [{Wordpress Profiles Blogger is a User Admin is a Blogger Author is a Blogger Subscriber is a User} "Blogger Role^/Blogger Manage Posts"] whereas I would like to get this [{ Wordpress Profiles Blogger is a User Admin is a Blogger Author is a Blogger Subscriber is a User } { Blogger Role Blogger Manage Posts } { Admin Roles Admin Manage Site Manage Site Include Manage Users Manage Site Include Manage Themes Manage Site Include Manage Plugins }] How should I modify my parse rule ? Thanks.
