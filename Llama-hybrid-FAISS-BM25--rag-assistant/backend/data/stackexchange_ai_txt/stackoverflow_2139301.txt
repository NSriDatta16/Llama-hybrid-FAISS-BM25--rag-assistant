I mean, if I have an Average of 5seconds, does that mean that the each http requests gets a response 5 seconds on average? ...or does that mean that all 30 http requests (totaling their response times) gets 5 seconds on average? This depend how you created your test plan. But if you have one action (which is the HTTP request) and you specified 30 iterations with 50 users, then it means that 5 sec is the average time for the action performed 50 * 30 times.
