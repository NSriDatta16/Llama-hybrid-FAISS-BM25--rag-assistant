G'day, It sounds like you're persisting some sort of info on the server side on a per-session basis. Are you persisting session id's or user id's on the server? Maybe adding more and more information to some persisted data with each subsequent incoming request? Maybe the incoming User Agent string is also involved which is why changing browser types works, where simply restarting a session in the same type of browser doesn't work? Have you seen if stopping and restarting a session across a time boundary, e.g. the hour, or midnight, when using the same browser also resets the problem? Maybe try spoofing the UA string to see if that also resets the problem. BTW What Apache modules are you running in your server? Also 2.2.3 is quite an old version have you considered upgrading?
