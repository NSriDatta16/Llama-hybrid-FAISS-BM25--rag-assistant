Your question is how to extend inference on the Spearman correlation to a multivariate setting. Actually, Spearman does not test for non-linear trends, it tests for monotonic trends - of which a linear trend is a type of monotonic trend. One aspect of a monotonic trend is that the average trend across the span of the covariate has a net positive or a net negative direction. For instance, a curvilinear, sigmoidal positive trend would still be characterized by an average increase per unit difference in the covariate. Therefore a sound and completely agnostic approach to estimating this effect would be to use multivariate regression with robust standard errors. It's well known that in a variety of settings, robust errors provide asymptotically correct inference for trends. library(sandwich) library(lmtest) set.seed(123) par(mfrow=c(1,3)) curve(plogis(x), from=-3, to=3, xlab='X', ylab='invlogit(x) + N(0,1)') x
