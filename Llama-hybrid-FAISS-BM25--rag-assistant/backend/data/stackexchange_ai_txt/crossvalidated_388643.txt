Not exactly. Assuming a simple linear model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ , the parameter $\beta_1$ (in this case $0.4$ ) represents the effect of a one-unit change in the corresponding $x$ (here jobs) covariate on the mean value of the dependent variable, $y$ (here hours), assuming that any other covariates remain constant at some value. As the $\beta_0$ (the intercept) is $90$ , probably there are some other factors that require on average $90$ hours to be taken into account. It is more relevant to say that each additional job requires an additional $0.4$ hours.
