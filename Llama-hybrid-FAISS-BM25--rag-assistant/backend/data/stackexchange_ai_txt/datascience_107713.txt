Which will be best deep learning model for topic classification using NLP

I have a dataset consisting of two columns [Text, topic_labels]. Topic_labels are of 6 categories for ex: [plants,animals,birds,insects etc] I would like to build deep learning-based models in order to be able to classify topic_labels. so far I have implemented both supervised[SVM, Logistic] & unsupervised [topic-LDA, Guided-LDA] approaches in a traditional way by applying both Word2Vec & TF-IDF but I wanted to implement state-of-the-art deep learning classification techniques for the text data? Suggest me the best deep learning model for text topic classification.
