We tried using PHPUc with CC and we couldn't get the stuff to work right. We experimented with straight CC but found it difficult to get authentication in there (we're distributed, so our reports would be open to the world unless we nailed it down--we couldn't figure it out.) So, we're now actually using Hudson as our CI engine and Phing as our build tool. It works just fine. We have code coverage reports coming straight out of PHPUnit (which Hudson still calls "Clover coverage" from the Java world, but hey it's just a name of a link and we know what it means). Hudson was easy to set up and seems to work with everything you'd need for PHP.
