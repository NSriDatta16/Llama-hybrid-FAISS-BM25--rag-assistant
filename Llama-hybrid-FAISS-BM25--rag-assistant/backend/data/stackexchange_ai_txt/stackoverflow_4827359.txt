Problems organising multiple projects with Git

I have this project structure: root | +-- SHARE +-- Project1 +-- Project2 +-- Project3 All projects reference the project SHARE. So I created 4 repos one in each folder. Then I tried to add SHARE as a submodule to Project1, but I don't get what I want, because Git copied all source files from SHARE to Project1\SHARE. I wan't the submodule SHARE to checkout the files to the folder SHARE, which is parallel to Project1. Is it possible to reference SHARE as a submodule for Project1 without copying the source files from SHARE? Or is there a better way to tell the repo for Project1 that it depends on repo SHARE? I'm using Windows7 with VS2010 and Git Extensions.
