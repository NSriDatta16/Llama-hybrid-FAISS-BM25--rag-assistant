How to select activation functions for neural networks?

What is the process of selecting the best activation function? I already know which functions are better for which kind of problem, but I don't know why a particular function is better for a particular problem. Also, I saw a list of few activation functions. I assumed that those were selected by great minds but I don't know the process which helps me to find if a function can work as activation function. Like there may be some constraints which should be satisfied by a function to be an activation function.
