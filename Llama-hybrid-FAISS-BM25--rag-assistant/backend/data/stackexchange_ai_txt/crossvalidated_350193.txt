Transfer learning scenario

I have an interesting question and I need some help. Consider the following problem. Let's suppose that I am doing regression with neural networks. As input I have a set of measurements, arrays of $N$ values, that are nothing else as $f(x_i)$ with $i=1,...,N$. The network should spit out one parameter that model $f()$. For example if you consider $$ f(x)=\frac{A^2}{x^2+A^2} $$ the network should, given the $f(x_i)$ return an estimate of $A$. Now that is easy. I did it and it worked beatifully. Now to my question. Let's suppose that I want to use the trained network I have for new data, and in particular for data that is generated by the function $$ g(x)=f(x)+C $$ where $C$ is a constant. I don't want to train the network again, since it should have learned already how to extract the parameter. Is there any smart way of, let's say, using the pre-trained network and simply get the same results? I am thinking something on the following lines: I train my network with data generated from $f()$ I would like to give my model let's say just a few observations generated with $g()$ (not thousands, but just The model should be able to adapt and give now the right results for $A$ Any idea? Would really appreciate any hint...
