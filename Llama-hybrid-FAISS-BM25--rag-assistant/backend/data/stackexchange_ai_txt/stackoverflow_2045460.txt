As Gabriel indicates using the SSMA is the best solution for upsizing the tables, indexes and relationships in Access. Then I'd suggest working on the Access front end, containing the queries, forms, reports, macros and VBA code so it works with the SQL Server data storage. This won't take very long by comparision to rewriting the app. Then you may find you don't need to rewrite the application in another environment. This assumes that the tables are properly normalized and clean. Even then it may be simpler to do some cleanup in that respect in Access.
