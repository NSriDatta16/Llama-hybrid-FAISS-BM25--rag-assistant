The easiest way to do this would be to create a new diagram with just the tables you were interested in. Whe you are editing the DSV, in the top left corner is a "Diagram Organizer" right click and choose the option to add a new diagram. This allows you to setup a sort of "view" of a sub-set of the tables in your DSV. Then you can right click on this empty diagram, add one or more of the tables that you are interested in and then you can right click on these tables and choose the "Add related tables" option until you have drilled as deep as you need to into the relationships.
