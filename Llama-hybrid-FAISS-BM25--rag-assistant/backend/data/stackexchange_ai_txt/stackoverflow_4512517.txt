UTF-8 is a variable length encoding. Characters inside the ASCII set will be encoded with one byte as in latin1; characters beyond that will be encoded using up to four bytes. A string consisting of ASCII characters will have the same length in UTF8 and latin1. Is mixing charsets on a column level a good practice? I have never done this, and would tend to say no, as it complicates the database schema unnecessarily. While the database engine should be able to deal with it fine, I would not use mixed charsets out of storage considerations. The savings will be minimal at best. The only valid reason to mix charsets that I can think of is the use of different collations for a specific sort order and/or case/accent sensitive/insensitive searching.
