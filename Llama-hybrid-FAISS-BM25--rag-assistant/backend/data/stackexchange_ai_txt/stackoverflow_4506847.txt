In your example, I'd suggest doing the following which does not expose you to the security risks of 'eval': myData = JSON.decode($(this).attr("title")); In general it's a valid approach to holding non-secure data. You have a number of other options too: Use JQuery's .data() methods: myData = $this.data("foo"); In HTML5 you now can use custom data attributes (Eg "") as an attribute on any element. http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/ You could use Local Storage if you know it is available. http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/ You could use Backbone.js on top of Jquery to give you a more abstracted way of handling your data as Models. http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
