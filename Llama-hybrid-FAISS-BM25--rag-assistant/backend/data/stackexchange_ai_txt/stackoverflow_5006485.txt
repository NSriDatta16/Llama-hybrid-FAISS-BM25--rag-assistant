trapping Solution Explorer events

I've been tasked with creating an addin that prevents developers from changing the structure of a solution: they are allowed to edit code, but not move files, projects or filters around, or rename things. The reason is that the build commands are being intercepted by the addin and passed to a custom build tool. I know there are addins that do this, so it is possible. Does anybody here know which interfaces in EnvDTE or VSIP to use to catch drag and drop evetns on the solution explorer and possibly cancel them? Also, how to get a handle on these interfaces would be appreciated. Thanks ps.. This is for Visual Studio versions 2005 and 2008. 2010 will support a different API (MEF) for this.
