SSIS package not running when called as step in SQL Job

I have a .dtsx file (an SSIS package) that downloads files from an FTP server and imports data. It runs fine whenever I run it manually. However, when I schedule calling the package as a step in a SQL server agent job, it fails. The step it fails at is the one where I call a .bat file. The error in the job history viewer says this: Error: 2009-05-26 12:52:25.64 Code: 0xC0029151 Source: Execute batch file Execute Process Task Description: In Executing "D:\xxx\import.bat" "" at "", The process exit code was "1" while the expected was "0". End Error DTExec: The package execution returned DTSER_FAILURE (1). I think it's a permissions issue, but I'm not sure how to resolve this. The job owner is an admin user, so I've verified they have permissions to the directory where the .bat file is located. I've tried going into Services and changing the "Log On As" option for SQL Server Agent, and neither option works (Local System Account and This Account). Does anyone have ideas as to what other permissions need to be adjusted in order to get this to work?
