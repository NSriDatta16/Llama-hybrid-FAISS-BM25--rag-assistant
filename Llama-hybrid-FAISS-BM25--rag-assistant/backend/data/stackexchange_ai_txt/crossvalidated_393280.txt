See this previous answer of mine to another question: In Stan is there a way to use parameter posterior from old analysis as prior in new analysis? There I mentioned the idea to approximate the posterior samples by some distribution - if different parameters are correlated this might have to be some multivariate distribution. If one goes down that route, then a general purpose MCMC sampler that let's you specify your own prior distributions without any real restrictions (such as the PyStan python package or the R rstan package, which only limit you by not allowing discrete prior parameters) is a good options. In that case no matter what you approximate your posterior by, you can specify it as a prior. In terms of fitting some multivariate mixture distribution to posterior samples, there is a considerable difference in the quality of different implementations in terms of numerical stability and speed. E.g. in R the mclust package ( page 53 here has an example of using mclust for a bivariate normal approximation to a posterior) or the RBeST package have good algorithms at least for the bivariate normal mixture case that you could use or take a look at. I would assume other programming languages also have good packages for this sort of thing, but I do not know them.
