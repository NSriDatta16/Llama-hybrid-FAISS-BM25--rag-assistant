You can get nice grassy oscillation in the time series plots by changing the prior to $$\begin{split}\beta_0&\sim \mathcal N(11.66299, .1^2)\\ \beta_1 &\sim \mathcal N(-0.21623, .1^2)\end{split}$$ and changing the standard deviation of your proposal/candidate to $.1$ for $\beta_0$ (keeping it at $.01$ for $\beta_1)$ . Lastly, the acceptance probability is missing the factor involving the candidate distribution. temp $success x temp init
