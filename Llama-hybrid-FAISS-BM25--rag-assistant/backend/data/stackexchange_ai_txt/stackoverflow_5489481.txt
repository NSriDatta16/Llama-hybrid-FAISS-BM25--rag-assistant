Query JSON data from Azure Blob Storage with jQuery

I have some data in an Azure blob storage. The data is JSON and it has been saved with the "application/json" content type. My app would be hosted at "myapp.com", a domain that contains a CNAME to "myapp.cloudapp.net". I guess I should create a custom domain name like "storage.myapp.com" that poins to my Azure storage. But then? Can I use JSONP or other way to make JSON ajax calls to Azure storage? How would be the better way to do this? Thanks a lot.
