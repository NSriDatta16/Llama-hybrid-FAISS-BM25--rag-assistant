This is not an issue of small sample bias. Small sample bias refers to an interesting mathematical anomale of binary outcomes when the sampling distribution of the estimates are highly discretized. http://web.pdx.edu/~newsomj/cdaclass/ho_sample%20size.pdf In your sample of 2 observations, the model of 3 parameters -- the intercept, the $\beta_x$ effect, and the $\delta$ effect -- is oversaturated. The model is not even estimable. Add another observation and the estimates are, on average, correct. Whether $X$ should or should not be adjusted for has nothing to do with the sample size.
