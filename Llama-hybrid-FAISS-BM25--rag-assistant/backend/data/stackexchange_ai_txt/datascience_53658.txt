How to test dev set on Time Series data via forecasting

I'm implementing $3$ Bayesian Deep Learning models (links below) for my masters. I'm supposed to test them on a civil engineering time series data. My models should take a time series covariate vector ( $X_t$ = { $x1_t$ , $x2_t$ , ...}) as input and predict single values $y_t$ . I will use past values of $X$ , (e.g. $X_{t-1}$ , $X_{t-2}$ ) on each $y_t$ but the models won't be feed with past values of $y_t$ because these will not be available on a real situation. The data was generated daily , so every t is a new day. Summing up, the model shall take windows of X values (e.g. $X_{t-1}$ , $X_{t-2}$ ...) with a fixed window size, and them predicting a single y value. We will have multiple pairs $((X_{t},X_{t-1}),y_t)$ as our training data, for multiple values of $t$ . I have several years of data, and I've separated the data on some arbitrary point T so that the first years are used as training, and the last months of the last year of data are used as test/dev data. So, training examples are generated until $T (X_T,y_T)$ , and them $T+1, T+2...$ are used to test the models. The only value that matters on this forecasting task is the next day value ( $y_{T+1}$ ). Initially, I was training the model until day T, and then using that model to predict the annotations $y_{T+n}$ until the dev data stops. But then the people that gave me the data asked about retraining the model every new day of the dev set, and then predicting the next day: For example, on the first training, I would train until day T and then forecast T+1. Then I would add the real value of $y_{T+1}$ to the train set, retrain the models, and forecast T+2 and so on. Which approach would be more proper? The accuracy of the models drop when I try to retrain the models every day to predict just a single day, I can't understand why. I'm using DeepAR , DeepFactors , Enc-Dec-Forecaster (by Uber) and an ARIMA model just to compare. I'd really appreciate some help! EDIT: For clarity
