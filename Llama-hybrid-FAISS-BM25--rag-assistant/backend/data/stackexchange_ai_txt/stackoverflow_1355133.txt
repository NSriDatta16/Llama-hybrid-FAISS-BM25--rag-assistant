You can have two classes. One for the images that were already faded out, and another for those who were not. Like: and Now with jQuery you can do the following: $('#mybutton').click (function (){ $('.not_faded:first').fadeOut (); // your fade out effect $('.not_faded:first').attr ('class', 'faded'); }); This code gets the first image that belongs the not_faded class and makes the fade out effect. Then changes the class of that image to 'faded'. So the first image of the class not_faded, next time, will be the second one. Edit: check out Matt's solution, it's more elegant and takes full advantage of jQuery.
