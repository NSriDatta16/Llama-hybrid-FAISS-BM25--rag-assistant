How to compare and interpret results of two neural networks models?

I made two models of neural networks(different architectures), the first one gave me as result: Training Loss: 0.4195 Training Acc: 0.8325 Training Recall: 0.7266 Validation Loss: 0.4331 Validation Acc: 0.8483 Validation Recall: 0.7400 Test Acc: 0.7864 Test Recall: 0.7657 The second one: Training Loss: 0.3354 Training Acc: 0.8583 Training Recall: 0.7791 Validation Loss: 0.3791 Validation Acc: 0.8493 Validation Recall: 0.7773 Test Acc: 0.8254 Test Recall: 0.7602 The problem there is that although the second model gives a better loss value, the first model gives a better result on the test set, so how can we interpret and compare these results? and does it have a way to test the stability of a model? NB: the hyper parameters are the same for two models (batch size, learning rate, optimization algorithm) and the same validation and training sets
