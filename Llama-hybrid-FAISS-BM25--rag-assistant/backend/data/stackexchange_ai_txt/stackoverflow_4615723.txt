Try using the PMI within the WAS console under Monitoring and Tuning, this will allow you to trace both the JDBC and thread pool usage in real time, I would definitely pay close attention to the WebContainer pool and see if the size of the pool tracks with the JDBC connection. If the pools themselves are becoming exhausted you can increase the size to provide some legroom by upping the Maximum Connection Settings for the JDBC connection under Resources -> Data Sources -> $NAME -> Connection Pool, and the other connection pool settings under Server -> $SERVERNAME -> Additional Properties -> Thread Pool Ensuring that the database your connecting to also has sufficent free connections would also be an idea! :) If you are leaking pool connections, then its likely the code is missing a close connection somewhere.
