"a PCA-style rotation of the data that, instead of maximizing overall variance, maximizes inter-cluster separation". Discriminant analysis is exactly such a technique. A principal component maximizes variance along it. A discriminant function maximizes ratio between-cluster-variance/pooled-within-cluster-variance along it.
