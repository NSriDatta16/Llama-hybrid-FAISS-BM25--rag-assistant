Are Bayes factors practically applicable?

According to Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning on page 164, on average the Bayes factor will always favour the correct model. Given this, how can we use the Bayes factor in practice when we only have one dataset? When comparing multiple models, can we be sure that the model with the highest Bayes factor is closest to the true model? If not, does it even make sense to use the Bayes factor in practice for model comparison?
