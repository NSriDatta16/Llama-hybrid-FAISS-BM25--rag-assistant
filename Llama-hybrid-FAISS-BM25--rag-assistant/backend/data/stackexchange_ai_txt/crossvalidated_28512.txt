Using Python for building machine learning application

I'm currently using R to find the best approach to solving a machine learning problem. Once I've got the approach sorted, I will need to build this into an application which can be used by end users. My background is as a .NET developer. I see there are a few questions related to this, but my question is more about what I should use to build an end user product which incorporates machine learning. From what I've seen so far, R is very powerful but does not integrate very well with other programming languages (and even less well with .NET). So I'm trying to figure out the best approach for building the app. I see that Python is widely used by the ML community. Is this a good choice for building an app which will be delivered to users, or is it better as a scripting tool for prototyping etc? One benefit I can see is the range of machine learning libraries available, whereas .NET does not have a large range of libraries available. Performance concerns me given that it is interpreted. Is Python my best choice, or would it be better to build the algorithms I need from scratch in C++, C# etc.?
