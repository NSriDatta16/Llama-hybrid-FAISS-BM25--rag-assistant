The first answer works if your foreign key columns are exposed as properties in your conceptual model. Also, the GetSourceSchemaTypes() method is only available in some of the text templates included with EF, so it is helpful to know what this method does. If you want to always know the column names, you will need to load the AssociationType from the storage model as follows: // Obtain a reference to the navigation property you are interested in var navProp = GetNavigationProperty(); // Load the metadata workspace MetadataWorkspace metadataWorkspace = null; bool allMetadataLoaded =loader.TryLoadAllMetadata(inputFile, out metadataWorkspace); // Get the association type from the storage model var association = metadataWorkspace .GetItems (DataSpace.SSpace) .Single(a => a.Name == navProp.RelationshipType.Name) // Then look at the referential constraints var toColumns = String.Join(",", association.ReferentialConstraints.SelectMany(rc => rc.ToProperties)); var fromColumns = String.Join(",", association.ReferentialConstraints.SelectMany(rc => rc.FromProperties)); In this case, loader is a MetadataLoader defined in EF.Utility.CS.ttinclude and inputFile is a standard string variable specifying the name of the .edmx file. These should already be declared in your text template.
