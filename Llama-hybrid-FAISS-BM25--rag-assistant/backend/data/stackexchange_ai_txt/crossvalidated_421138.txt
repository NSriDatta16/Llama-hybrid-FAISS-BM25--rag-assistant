Mathematics to accompany statistics at master level

I'm starting on a master degree in statistics this fall, and at least at the moment I believe I want to go in the direction of statistical learning and/or bayesian statistics. My question is if there are any topics from mathematics that show up in master level statistics that it would be particularly useful for me to have a understanding of. From bachelor level I already have Calc1 through vector analysis, ODE's (and simple PDE's), discrete mathematics, abstract algebra and some complex analysis in the bag when it comes to math related courses.
