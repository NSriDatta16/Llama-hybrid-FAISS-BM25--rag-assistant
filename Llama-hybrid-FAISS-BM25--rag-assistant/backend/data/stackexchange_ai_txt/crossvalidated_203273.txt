Goodness of fit of vector error correction model (VECM)

I am trying to find the relationship between S&P and six macroeconomic variables using vector error correction model (VECM). What are the criteria for assessing the overall performance of the model? I got low $R^2$ (see the output below), but this is OK for I(1) time series, I guess.
