If a probability density $f$ is known up to a multiplicative constant, $$f(x)\propto \tilde f(x)\qquad\forall x\in\mathfrak X$$ meaning that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that $f(x)=c\tilde f(x)$ , the constant $c$ is determined by the constraint that $f(\cdot)$ is a probability density: $$c^{-1} = \int_\mathfrak X \tilde f(x)\, \text dx$$ See some of the many related questions: Why is posterior density proportional to prior density times likelihood function?
