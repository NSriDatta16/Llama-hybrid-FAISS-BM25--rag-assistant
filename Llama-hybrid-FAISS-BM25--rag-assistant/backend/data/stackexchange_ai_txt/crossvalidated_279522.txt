Is there any common point between Deep Learning and Kernel based Strategies like SVM?

Letâ€™s take for example a binary classification task To me it seems that both Deep Learning and Kernel based Methods seem to share the idea of not trying to learn a complex classification function directly in the Input Space but to first perform a mapping into a more convenient (in order to solve the task i.e. to optimize the error function) representation and then to solve the task in that space, learning a simpler function
