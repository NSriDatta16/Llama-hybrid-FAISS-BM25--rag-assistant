I've got an HTC and I had to download USB drivers from the HTC site before it would work in debugging mode. It worked fine as a mass storage device without the drivers but showed up as a 'generic' USB device in Windows Device Manager. Once I'd installed the HTC drivers it showed up as an 'Android USB Device' and debugging works fine for me. Check the LG support site to see if there are any XP USB drivers available or if they mention it as a known problem.
