Can TF-IDF be used for non-text data? Sure. I've used it very successfully on medical records where every ICD-10 diagnosis or procedure code is a "word" and every patient is a "document." Very common procedures like EKGs and lipid panels get lower weights. This allows LSA to be applied. While we ultimately went with an LDA model which doesn't need TF-IDF preprocessing, the LSA model with TF-IDF definitely worked as intended. what are some potential pitfalls of this approach? Many models, such as linear or logistic regression, ignore the scale of individual features; for those models, the "IDF" part isn't necessarily doing any work. However, if your using a regularized model such as ElasticNet, then the scale becomes important. Usually we want to standardize each feature by centering and scaling, but TF-IDF can also be used as a principle way to assign different scales to each feature. This brings us to a further complication: TF-IDF isn't one concrete formula like MSE. If you say MSE, I could write down the equation, but there are lots of variations of TF-IDF. Wikipedia lists several variations, for example. It's rarely possible to guess ahead of time which scaling strategy will work best. I recommend using cross validation to compare many scaling strategies, such as raw TF, centered and scaled, and several TF-IDF variants. Are there any links or references to existing applications of TF-IDF for non-text data? In addition to my own project, I've seen other papers that use TF-IDF on medical codes. I'm not sure where else its been used, but it's potentially useful anywhere you can make a clear analogy for "words" and "documents."
