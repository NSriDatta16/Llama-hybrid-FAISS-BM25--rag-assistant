Rather than calculating and averaging the correlations, I would recommend that you compute few simple metrics for each vendor: total absolute difference; max difference; total absolute squared difference. The vendor with least total absolute squared difference might be the best fit and closest predictor. But like Nick said it's ultimately you who needs to decide how to measure error. You may want to penalize being little wrong all the time less than being mostly right but at time being way off in predictions. I've made the assumption that all the vendor estimates are available for all the stores.
