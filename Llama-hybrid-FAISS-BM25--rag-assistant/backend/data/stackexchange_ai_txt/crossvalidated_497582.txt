Can I conclude heteroskedasticity in this case?

I plot a standardized residuals against the fitted values and it does exhibit a megaphone shape. It looks like there is more variation in the lower level of fitted values. I then conduct a Breusch-Pagan Test for heteroskedasticity. studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: reg4 BP = 87.88, df = 2, p-value The p-value is quite small, which indicates that I should reject the null hypothesis and conclude heteroskedasticity. At this point, can I safely conclude I do face a heteroskedasticity and do some remedial measurements to deal with it?
