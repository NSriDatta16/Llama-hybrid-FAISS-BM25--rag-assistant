this sentence is false I like maths and programming because they are fairly absolute. Human language communicates emotion and ambiguity. That's why I always end up arguing with people. If you don't want your computer to argue with you, and your compiler to make abstract random presumptions then stick with logical languages I recon. I imagine translating natural language into concrete semantics is much harder that extracting vague meaning from a sentence through NLP. Short of sentences like: call method on sigkill then quit program Which is pretty much what SQL-like in it's structure. You could go for some form of self-defining, axiomatic-like semantic setup (like Self or similar) with some lambda calculus affinity. edit : Sounds like Lisp. I retract that statement .. ())((()))()() Two examples from related question are LOLCODE and Inform7 ... both of which I would hate to program in.
