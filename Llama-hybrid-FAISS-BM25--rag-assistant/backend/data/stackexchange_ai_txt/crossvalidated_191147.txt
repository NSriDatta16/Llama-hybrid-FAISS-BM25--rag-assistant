Most likely reason behind this is that your predictors are highly correlated. Check if this is the case by computing a correlation matrix. If this is indeed the case, then a more appropiate method of estimating the logistic regression would be a regularized approach, like Elastic Net (glmnet package in R). Another option is to do dimensionality reduction. Yet another option is to simply accept thatboth models may choose different variables when high correlation among them is present.
