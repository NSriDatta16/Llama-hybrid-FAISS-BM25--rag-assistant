If your information can be used by any other application you could use a service or as they are called in Android, a Content Provider . This way you make the information available to all the applications on the phone. This is a great way of encouraging other developers to build their applications with the info that you've provided. This is just something that you should consider, if it's something strictly related to you're application you can go on with the thread just as CaseyB stated.
