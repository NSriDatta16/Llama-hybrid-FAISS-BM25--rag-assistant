THe use of #! tags in URLs are in the news recently, with updates to a well known blog. http://isolani.co.uk/blog/javascript/BreakingTheWebWithHashBangs has a good description of what they are best used for - and when they can be bad. I think your use in a gallery is quite valid. In short, a URL like http://lifehacker.com/#!5753509/hello-world ... is rewritten by Google, and other compatible web-spiders as http://lifehacker.com/?_escaped_fragment_=5753509/hello-world ... Google may index them twice, but you can also use the canonical meta-tag to ensure it knows what the 'official' copy is.
