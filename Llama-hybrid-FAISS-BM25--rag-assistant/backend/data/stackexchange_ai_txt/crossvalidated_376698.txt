Most models in python or R libraries need to be retrained from scratch. Bayesian models can, in theory, incorporate new observations sequentially, but in practice it is often the case that they are retrained (or the posteriors are approximated by analytic distributions and then used as priors in the next round of fitting. Point is, the model needs to be refit one way or another). It might be beneficial to monitor your model's performance over time. Once performance starts to degrade, you can retrain your model with more recent data. Alternatively, you can schedule models to retrain quarterly or yearly. EDIT: Look up on-line algorithms which learn sequentially from data, point by point.
