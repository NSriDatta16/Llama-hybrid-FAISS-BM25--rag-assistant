Hey guys I got a vps which run solusVM. I'm now trying to install ruby 1.9.2 in it. I follow this guide : after I run this command apt-get update apt-get -y install build-essential zlib1g zlib1g-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev I got this error below root@makserver:/usr/local/src/ruby-1.9.2-p0# apt-get -f install Reading package lists...
