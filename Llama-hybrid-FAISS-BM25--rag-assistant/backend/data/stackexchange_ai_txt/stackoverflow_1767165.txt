git and empty folders

So I see Git doesn't recognize folders, or should I say when the only change between commits is addition of empty folders to the working tree they're not show in git status after git add . . How would you handle the need to add empty folders to the working tree (for runtime storage) and have them be reflected/created when other repositories pull from the current repository (one in which the folders were added)?
