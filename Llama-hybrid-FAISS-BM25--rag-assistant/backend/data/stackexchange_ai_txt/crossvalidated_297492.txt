I think root mean squared error (RMSE) is not a valid loss function when defined on a single forecast error, as there it reduces to the absolute error (as you note yourself). The Diebold-Mariano test considers two random variables $e_1$ and $e_2$ that generate forecast errors $e_{1,i}$ and $e_{2,i}$ for $i=1,\dots,n$ where $n$ is the number of times a forecast is made (and an error committed). The test aims at assessing whether the expectations of some function (absolute value, square, ...) of $e_1$ and $e_2$ are equal. Meanwhile, the "mean" in "root mean squared error" refers to averaging over a number of elements, thus it takes more than one error as its argument. As such it does not fit into the framework of the Diebold-Mariano test. But you could also think as follows. Consider a group of errors (e.g. $5$ consecutive errors) as a single element; thus instead of two scalar random variables $e_1$ and $e_2$ you have two vector-valued random variables $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$. Take RMSE as your loss function. If you have a sample of $n$ realizations of $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ (corresponding to $5n$ "individual errors"), then you can use the Diebold-Mariano test to assess whether the population RMSEs of $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are the same.
