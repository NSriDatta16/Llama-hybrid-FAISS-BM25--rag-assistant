Actually you have correctly listed the major differences between the covariance pattern models and GEE models. One thing I would like to add is that, for the Section 6.2.5 "Random Effects Structure" of Hedeker and Gibbons (2006), the two models would be characterized as subject-specific (conditional) models and population average (marginal) models respectively, though the two coincide for linear cases. See my answer here: What is a difference between random effects-, fixed effects- and marginal model? I would say the two are numerically equivalent, though they use different estimation methods. See the example in Stata below. Note that the covariance pattern models can be fitted with command mixed , but the random effects are suppressed by the option noconstant . Of course, we can turn to REML instead of ML to obtain unbiased variance estimates. . webuse pig . mixed weight week || id:, noconstant residuals(exchangeable) Mixed-effects ML regression Number of obs = 432 Group variable: id Number of groups = 48 Obs per group: min = 9 avg = 9.0 max = 9 Wald chi2(1) = 25337.48 Log likelihood = -1014.9268 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ weight | Coef.

When we add the option robust , only the standard errors change. . xtgee weight week, corr(exchangeable) robust GEE population-averaged model Number of obs = 432 Group variable: id Number of groups = 48 Link: identity Obs per group: min = 9 Family: Gaussian avg = 9.0 Correlation: exchangeable max = 9 Wald chi2(1) = 4552.32 Scale parameter: 19.20076 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 (Std.
