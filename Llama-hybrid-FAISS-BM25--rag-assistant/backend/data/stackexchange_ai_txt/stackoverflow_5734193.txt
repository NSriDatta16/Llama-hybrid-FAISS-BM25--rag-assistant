If none of your CUDA memory allocations fail, then your problem isn't that you are out of memory (if you were it could be due to fragmentation, not necessarily due to 100%+ consumption). If you are getting a x-mas tree effect, then you probably have a kernel that is writing outside of allocated memory. Check the indexes of pixels/array-cells you are accessing and the memory offset calculation of their position in the output buffers. You can also try using 1D index while invoking the kernels, to make calculations simpler. (You can model any multi-dimensional array as a long 1D array.)
