Label Propagation for weighted graph

I am working on "community detection" on a big network graph and I've been using the Label Propagation Algorithm from GraphFrames (Spark package). However, my graph is weighted and I was wondering whether I can leverage some community detection algorithms which take into account weights. My main limitation is that I should run the algorithm in parallel Any ideas which algorithm should I look at?
