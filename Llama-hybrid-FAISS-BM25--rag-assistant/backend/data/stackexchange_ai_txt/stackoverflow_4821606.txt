Problem in mapping fragments in Entity Framework

I am using Entity Framework and I ran into an odd build error. I am building a forum and I set up a table in the database for "ignores" when people don't like each other they will ignore someone. The table has two columns and together they are the primary keys. PK InitiatingUser PK IgnoredUser When EF maps this table I get this error: Error 7 Error 3034: Problem in mapping fragments starting at lines 1467, 1477:Two entities with possibly different keys are mapped to the same row. Ensure these two mapping fragments map both ends of the AssociationSet to the corresponding columns. I opened up the edmx in the XML editor and navigated to the offending lines. I am just getting started with EF and I don't understand what is going on or what the issue might be. Edit The relationships between ignores used to have foreign keys mapping both initiating user and ignored user to the primary key (username) of users table. That was how it was when I first mapped EF to this table. I have since deleted the FKs to see if that would help but it didn't.
