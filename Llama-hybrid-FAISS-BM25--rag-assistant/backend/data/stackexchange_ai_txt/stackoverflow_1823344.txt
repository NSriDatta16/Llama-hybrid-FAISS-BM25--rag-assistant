I converted your packet trace snippet into a format understood by text2pcap so I could convert them into the pcap format for viewing in Wireshark (a very handy packet capture and analysis tool): Looks like some sort of IPv4 multicast traffic at a very rough guess. Here's what I got from the first packet (rest came up as malformed): No. Time Source Destination Protocol Info 1 0.000000 7b:1a:00:90:7f:43 00:00:00_24:c4:b8 0x0fa1 Ethernet II Frame 1 (31 bytes on wire, 31 bytes captured) Arrival Time: Dec 1, 2009 00:33:05.000000000 [Time delta from previous captured frame: 0.000000000 seconds] [Time delta from previous displayed frame: 0.000000000 seconds] [Time since reference or first frame: 0.000000000 seconds] Frame Number: 1 Frame Length: 31 bytes Capture Length: 31 bytes [Frame is marked: False] [Protocols in frame: eth:data] Ethernet II, Src: 7b:1a:00:90:7f:43 (7b:1a:00:90:7f:43), Dst: 00:00:00_24:c4:b8 (00:00:00:24:c4:b8) Destination: 00:00:00_24:c4:b8 (00:00:00:24:c4:b8) Address: 00:00:00_24:c4:b8 (00:00:00:24:c4:b8) .... ...0 .... .... .... .... = IG bit: Individual address (unicast) .... ..0. .... .... .... .... = LG bit: Globally unique address (factory default) Source: 7b:1a:00:90:7f:43 (7b:1a:00:90:7f:43) Address: 7b:1a:00:90:7f:43 (7b:1a:00:90:7f:43) .... ...1 .... .... .... .... = IG bit: Group address (multicast/broadcast) .... ..1. .... .... .... .... = LG bit: Locally administered address (this is NOT the factory default) Type: Unknown (0x0fa1) Data (17 bytes) 0000 08 00 45 00 01 10 f4 4e 00 00 40 06 2f 13 cb 7a ..E....N..@./..z 0010 9d .
