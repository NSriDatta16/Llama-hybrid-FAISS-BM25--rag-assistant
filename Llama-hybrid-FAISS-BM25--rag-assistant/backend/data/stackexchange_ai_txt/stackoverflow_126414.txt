I once joined a team which has been handed over a pile of steaming crap from outsourcing. The original project - a multimedia content manager based on Java, Struts, Hibernate|Oracle - was well structured (it seems like it was the work of a couple of people, pair programming, wise use of design patterns, some unit testing). Then someone else inherited the project and endlessly copy-pasted features, loosened the business rules, patched, branched until it became a huge spaghetti monster with fine crafted piece of codes like: List stuff = null; if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) { stuff = findStuff(); LOG.debug("Yeah, I'm a smart guy!"); for (Stuff stu : stuff) { LOG.debug("I've got this stuff: " + stu); } } methodThatUsesStuff(stuff); hidden amongst the other brilliant ingenuity. I tamed the beast via patient refactoring (extracting methods and classes more of the times), commenting the code from time to time, reorganizing everything till the codebase shrunk by 30%, getting more and more manageable over time.
