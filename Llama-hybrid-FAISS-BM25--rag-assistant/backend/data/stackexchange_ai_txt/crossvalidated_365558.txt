How can we represent that in case of example 2 - the variation is much more significant than the example 1 because of a higher mean? Significance means, in general, the probability of the result when some hypothesis is right (often a null hypothesis). You could see it as a measure for anomalies. Thus significance, in order to mean something, you need (1) a hypothesis (or more hypotheses plus prior believes about them in the case of Bayesian analysis) and (2) an assumption of the distribution of the data when the hypothesis is right. In your case the the test would often be presented in terms of a test for a hypothesis that would be a null result (no effect). E.g. you test whether "the variation is the same ". If you find a result that would be an anomaly (ie a significant result) then you consider the 'alternative hypothesis', there is not 'no effect'. In your case, if you assume that those data are normal distributed then you could use the F-test for equality of variances . However, possibly your data is not supposed to be having equal variance in this sense, and you are asking for a different concept of equal variance. Then your data should be scaled somehow in order for a comparison of variance to make sense. For instance, if you measure the height of two times five people and estimate the variance of those people in inches for one group and in centimeters for the other than you will likely get a significant result against the hypothesis that those variances are the same. But it would be a nonsense test to make the comparison of variances with different scales.
