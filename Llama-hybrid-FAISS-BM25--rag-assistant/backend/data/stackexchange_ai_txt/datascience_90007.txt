Calculation of PCA

Consider the following data set: Now, we need to calculate the principal component analysis for this data. Here are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors calculated for the covariance matrix of this data: So the principal component is: Now, when I have tried to do so by hand, I have found that the eigenvalues are 1.28 and 0.0492 (which are identical to the above solution). Surely, the principal component corresponds to the eigenvalue = 1.28. However, when I tried to solve for the eigenvector, the solution was [[0] [0]] as the augmented matrix of BX=0 Was [[1 0 0] [0 1 0]]. So where is the problem here? And also how can I find the transformed data after I calculate the principle component? Edit: the covariance matrix is
