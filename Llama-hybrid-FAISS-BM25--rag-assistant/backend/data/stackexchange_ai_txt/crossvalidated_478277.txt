Neural network based on twitter followers, what would be my features?

I was thinking of training a neural network that would be able to classify twitter users according to their followers. For example, I would like to know if a user is "gamer" or not by the people they follow (not the number, but the list of the people they follow). I'd have a dataset of people who are gamers or not based on the accounts they're following and train them. The problem that I find is that the number of followers of each person will vary ... One person could follow thousands of users while another could only follow hundreds, so since the list of followers of each person won't be the same lenght, how could I determine my feature there? This would be an example of my dataset: Features would be every people an account is following, and the label would say if it's a gamer or not. As I said, the problem I can see is that the number of labels won't be the same...
