Determine max, min, average, etc Retrieve index when value first exceeds 500 Retrieve 400th number The relational data model was designed for this kind of analysis - and Oracle's SQL is more than capable of doing this, if you model your data correctly. I recommend you focus on transforming the array of floats into tables of numbers - I suspect you'll find that the time taken will be more than compensated for by the speed of performing these sorts of queries in SQL. The alternative is to try to write SQL that will effectively do this transformation at runtime anyway - every time the SQL is run; which will probably be much less efficient.
