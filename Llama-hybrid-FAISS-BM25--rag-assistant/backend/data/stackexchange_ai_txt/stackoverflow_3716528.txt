Multi-panel time series of lines and filled contours using matplotlib?

If I wanted to make a combined image like the one shown below ( original source here ), could you point me to the matplotlib objects do I need to assemble? I've been trying to work with AxesImage objects and I've also downloaded SciKits Timeseries - but do I need this, or can is it as easy to use strptime, mktime, and strftime from the time module and roll my own custom axes? Thanks ~
