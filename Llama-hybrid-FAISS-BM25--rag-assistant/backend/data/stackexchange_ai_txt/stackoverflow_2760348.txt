Unit Testing and motivation to do so

I'm currently Unit Testing an application that isn't build to support unit testing very well, lot's of dependencies, refactoring and the developers who build the application didn't think of unit testing when they started developing. My job is to do research for unit testing, unit test the application and bring unit testing into the organisation. When I'm working on the application and am writing the unit tests, it sometimes can become pretty difficult to keep up being well motivated and write good tests for difficult parts of the code. Now my question(s) related to this are: 1. How can you keep yourself motivated to write good unit tests? (for legacy code) 2. Is it important to motivate your colleagues in writing unit testing? 3. As an employer, how can you keep your employees motivated in writing good unit tests?
