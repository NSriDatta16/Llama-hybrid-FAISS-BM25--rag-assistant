The are a number of considerations to take account of. You present two alternatives for the number of points after one hour: 3.2353 0.839875 Your first method is an OLS model that minimises the differences between observed and predicted points. It does this by using an intercept term. Therefore your first prediciton is actually a base of 2.9530 and then 0.2823 for each hour. You can force an OLS model to go through the origin, at the penalty of increasing the size of the residuals (and possibly biasing your model): lm(points~hours-1) Call: lm(formula = points ~ hours - 1) Coefficients: hours 0.3269 sum(residuals(lm(points~hours-1))) [1] 78.61759 sum(residuals(lm(points~hours))) [1] -1.104672e-14 So here the prediction is that each hour adds 0.3269 to the points. Your second method does not have an intercept term, but also it does not take into account any deviation from the data points. It is highly influenced by outliers, particularly those with few hours. Furthermore, as you are calculating the average of a rate, the harmonic mean is more appropriate: 1/mean(hours/points) [1] 0.3563906 Which at 0.3563906 points per hour is much closer to the OLS estimates.
