Android Clearing all EditText Fields with Clear Button

How do I clear all the EditText fields in a layout with a Clear Button . I have a registration Activity that has about 10 different EditTexts . I know I could go and grab a reference to each specifically and then set.Text("") ; But I am looking for a more dynamic elegant way. Possibly grab the Layout and loop through all the items in there looking for EditText types and then setting those to "" . Not sure how to do that though and tried searching on the web for it but no luck. Any sample code?
