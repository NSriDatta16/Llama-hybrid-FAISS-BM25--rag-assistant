Normally, you should have some kind of a PRIMARY KEY . There are some really really special situations when you don't want to, most notably heap-organized (non-clustered) log tables which don't have any indexes to speed up inserts. Note that in MySQL , InnoDB tables cannot be heap-organized so this only concerns MyISAM tables. Also note that a PRIMARY KEY can be composite, like in a many-to-many relationship table. You will not have an id column in such a table but you will have a composite primary key composed of the id columns of the tables related. See this question for more details: Should each and every table have a primary key?
