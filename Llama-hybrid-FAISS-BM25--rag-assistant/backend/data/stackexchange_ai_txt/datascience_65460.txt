Are there any Python libraries for predicting the closest value to a correct label out of a variable-size list of possible label values?

Imagine I have the following dataset: |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | possible labels | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 1 | 5 | {1, 4} | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 2 | 2 | {2} | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| | 4 | 3 | {3, 5, 6} | |---------------------|------------------|------------------| and my goal is to be able to predict a value that is the closest to the set of possible labels. That is, this is a regression problem. (A sub-optimal solution I would also accept as an answer would be for my goal to be to predict a value that belongs to the set of possible labels, not taking into account the distance between the predicted value and the elements of the set.) Does this have a name? Are there any Python libraries (for deep learning, if possible) that solve this? Or should I define my custom loss function? If I have to define my custom loss function, could you suggest me a library/point me in the right direction? My main problem with that is that the set of possible labels has variable size! Thanks!
