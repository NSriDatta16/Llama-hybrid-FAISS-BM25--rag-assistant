The simplest possible answer is that PyPy is simply not yet as fast as hotspot and Psyco never will. Writing a reasonable JIT is a long and tedious process and it took for example many years for hotspot to get where it is (with a lot of funding as well). The more complex and dynamic the language is, the longer it takes. On the bright side, we have good examples how JITs for dynamic languages can be very fast, take LuaJIT for one, which can beat C or JVM on many examples. There are good news however: According to speed center PyPy got 27% faster on average in the past 100 revisions, so it'll happen eventually.
