For snapshot replication you can check indeed if both jobs have run (snapshot agent and distribution agent), but for merge and transactional you cannot since the agents run continously. For transactional you can insert a tracer token and verify when the tracer token is marked as distributed to the subscriber, using sp_posttracertoken and sp_helptracertokenhistory .
