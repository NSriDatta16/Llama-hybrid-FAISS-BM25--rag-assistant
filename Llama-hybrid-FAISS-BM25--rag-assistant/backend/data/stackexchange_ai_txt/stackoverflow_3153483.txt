How do I pass a var from one model's method to another?

Here is my one model.. CardSignup.rb def credit_status_on_create Organization.find(self.organization_id).update_credits end And here's my other model. As you can see what I wrote here is an incorrect way to pass the var def update_credits @organization = Organization.find(params[:id]) credit_count = @organization.card_signups.select { |c| c.credit_status == true}.count end If it can't be done by (params[:id]), what can it be done by? Thanks!
