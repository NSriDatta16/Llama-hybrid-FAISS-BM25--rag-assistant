How can I force the web browser to reload a newly deployed Flash file without clearing the cache?

When I deploy a new .swf file in an HTML file as shown below, I have to clear the browser cache before the new .swf file loads in the browser. Is there anyway to force the browser to load the .swf file when I replace it with a new one on the server. Thanks, Chirag
