What is currently the best HTML/CSS/Javascript configuration?

I'm getting more into jQuery and so have set up a HTML/Javascript/CSS base site which I use for all my tests. Since these tests will eventually turn into PHP and ASP.NET MVC websites, I want to use this opportunity to get the basics down right again for modern browsers and web standards before building the scripting languages on top of it. I've selected to use: XHTML 1.0 Strict UTF-8 encoding as few CSS references as possible (put everything in 1 CSS file for loading speed) as few Javascript references as possible ( 1 javascript file plus the jquery code base reference - I assume using the Google jQuery code base is best practice for speed) I check my code as I build it with the http://validator.w3.org Is there anything else I need to consider? Here is an example of one of my test websites: index.htm: Text XHTML Page Text First Second Third Fourth here is another paragraph main.cs: p.highlighted { background-color:orange; } h1.highlightTitle { background-color:yellow; } h1.deselected { background-color:#eee; } p.regular { font-weight: bold; } main.js: google.load("jquery", "1.3.2"); function highlightIt() { $('#selected') .toggleClass('highlighted'); } function countThem() { alert("there are " + $("p.main").size() + " paragraphs"); } function highlightTitle() { $("h1").toggleClass("deselected"); }
