Regular linear regression (e.g. the lm or glm functions in R) handles negative values just fine. One model you could try would be: model1 If you've got a lot of data (and several rows per player and per opponent), you could also try this model: model2 This will give you a model that includes a coefficient for each player, and for each opponent_team_id. These coefficients will represent the average points expected for a player, as well as the average points expected against a given opponent. Have you every run a regression model before? What's the goal of this analysis?
