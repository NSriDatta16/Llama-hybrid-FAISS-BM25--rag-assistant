wx.TreeCtrl drag and drop, copy and move

I'm trying to implement drag and drop on a wx.TreeCtrl and I need to handle both "copy" and "move" operations (if the user keeps CTRL pressed). First of all, I searched the wiki for an example and I'm confused as to which method to use.. Should I use DropSource/DropTarget or just handle EVT_TREE_BEGIN_DRAG and EVT_TREE_END_DRAG? If the latter, how can I tell if the user is requesting a "move" operation? (wxPython 2.8.9.1 on Ubuntu Jaunty)
