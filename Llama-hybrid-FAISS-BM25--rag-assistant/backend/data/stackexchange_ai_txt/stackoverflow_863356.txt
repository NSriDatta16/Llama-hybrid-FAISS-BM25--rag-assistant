jQuery: How to select "from here until the next H2"?

I'm setting up a very straightforward FAQ page with jQuery. Like so: What happens when you click on this question? This answer will appear! This is all inside a very specific div, so I'll be selecting the header with $('#faq h2') . Simple, right? Click on the H2, and use this.next() to make the next paragraph show up. (The caveat with this page is that a non-programmer will be maintaining it, which is why I'm not using classes: there's no guarantee that any new entries would have the right classes in them.) So! The problem: What happens when you click on the next question? That is an interesting conundrum. Because the maintainer is kind of long-winded and many answers will span a few paragraphs. So how, without adding in div s and classes and whatnot, can I have my this.next() routine select everything between the question-that-was-clicked-on and the next question (H2 header)?
