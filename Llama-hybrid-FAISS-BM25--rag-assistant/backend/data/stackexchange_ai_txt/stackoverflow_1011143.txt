It is a good practice to organize files in meaningful folders and build up namespace from that structure. Java has been following that rule for many years and it works out to be good. Also note that when you have a lot of sub namespaces as above, it is time to consider levelizing as suggested by Patrick (well, you know him?) http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2009/02/15/re-factoring-re-structuring-and-the-cost-of-levelizing.aspx
