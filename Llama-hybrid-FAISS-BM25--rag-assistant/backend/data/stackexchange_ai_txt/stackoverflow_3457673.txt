Elegant way to create a dictionary of pairs, from a list of tuples?

I have defined a tuple thus: (slot, gameid, bitrate) and created a list of them called myListOfTuples . In this list might be tuples containing the same gameid . E.g. the list can look like: [ (1, "Solitaire", 1000 ), (2, "Diner Dash", 22322 ), (3, "Solitaire", 0 ), (4, "Super Mario Kart", 854564 ), ... and so on. ] From this list, I need to create a dictionary of pairs - ( gameId , bitrate ), where the bitrate for that gameId is the first one that I came across for that particular gameId in myListOfTuples . E.g. From the above example - the dictionary of pairs would contain only one pair with gameId "Solitaire" : ("Solitaire", 1000 ) because 1000 is the first bitrate found. NB. I can create a set of unique games with this: uniqueGames = set( (e[1] for e in myListOfTuples ) )
