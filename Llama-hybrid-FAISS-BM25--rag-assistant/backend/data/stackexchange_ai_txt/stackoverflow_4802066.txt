On a typical Android device, the .apk files for an app are stored with write permissions only for those in the system group. So unless you are running on a rooted device that can change those permissions, it's not possible to modify these APKs. If you need to update resources, your best bet is to download them into the external storage space on the phone, and check for a version of the file on the SD card before defaulting to the version in the APK.
