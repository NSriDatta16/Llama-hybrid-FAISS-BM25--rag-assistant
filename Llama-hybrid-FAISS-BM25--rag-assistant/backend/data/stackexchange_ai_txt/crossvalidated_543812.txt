Time series model sample ACF in R

I have to simulate a sample of size $n=1000$ for the model $X_t=0.9 X_{t-1}+ Z_t$ with $(Z_t)$ iid student t-distributed with 10 degrees of freedom. I have to plot the sample ACF for the first 20 lags with the program acf in R. I'm not the best to R but I thought that I have made a plot: set.seed(123) # Simulate 250 observations from the described MA(1) model ma1_sim Then I get the plot: But I'm not sure that this is correct and I can't see anywhere in my problem the value for sd so I have just set it to 0.1. Can anyone help me with the problem and maybe correct some of my code?
