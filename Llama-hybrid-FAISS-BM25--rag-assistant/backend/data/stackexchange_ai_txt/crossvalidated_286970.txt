You may want to consider giving an estimate of the population size, to put the results of your case study in context and enable your readers to relate your four cases to the size of the larger group they are part of (especially if that group is small as doing so can provide a justification for why metrics of your four cases should be considered - I am assuming they should be). Also, you could consider reporting your findings alongside findings from similar, more representative samples, in order for your readers to get an explicit sense of data from a similar process. As the limited sample size results in extremely low statistical power, I'd discourage you from making any comparative claims in terms other than hypotheticals.
