Magento frontend and backend page looks different

I am a newb in magento and recently started looking at it to create a store for my client. I am not sure but i tried installing firephp extension and soon after that Iâ€™m having my screen looks like the screenshot. ** please check the link provided! Do I have to make any installations to get everything working as normal or what am I suppose to do to go to the normal screen. I have also changed the inline translation option to NO if thats what it requires. Any help would be appreciated. Cheers I have also posted this question on the magento forum http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/193499/
