I don't know much about neural networks but I know a fair bit about babies. Many 2 year olds have a lot of issues with how general words should be. For instance, it is quite common at that age for kids to use "dog" for any four legged animal. That's a more difficult distinction than "car" - just think how different a poodle looks from a great Dane, for instance and yet they are both "dog" while a cat is not. And a child at 2 has seen many many more than 5 examples of "car". A kid sees dozens or even hundreds of examples of cars any time the family goes for a drive. And a lot of parents will comment "look at the car" a lot more than 5 times. But kids can also think in ways that they weren't told about. For instance, on the street the kid sees lots of things lined up. His dad says (of one) "look at the shiny car!" and the kid thinks "maybe all those other things lined up are also cars?"
