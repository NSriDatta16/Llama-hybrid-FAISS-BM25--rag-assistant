The suggestions made so far are all excellent but are focused on the most advanced and sophisticated techniques using R software. For an excellent and intuitive overview of classic multivariate techniques, the underlying framework for the most up-to-date approaches, including regression, ANOVA, factor analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, contingency table analysis and structural equation analysis, Dillon and Goldstein's Multivariate Statistics published by Wiley in the 80s remains a classic. It's lucid and applied in its examples without being overly theoretical or wedded to software. Dillon and Goldstein is the book I would recommend to anyone who wants an understanding of where modern machine learning methods originated.
