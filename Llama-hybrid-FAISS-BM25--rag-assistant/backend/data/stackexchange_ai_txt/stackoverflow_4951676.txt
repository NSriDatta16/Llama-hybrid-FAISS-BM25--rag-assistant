CellSetGrid is an Open Source ASP .Net (c#) control, which offers pivot table like functionality. [This used to be available for download in this site: www.SQLServerAnalysisServices.com Now the site does not host this control anymore. So I have uploaded the source of the control - CellSetGrid here. http://www.box.net/shared/6gi0n79q6t 1) You can build the source 2) Add this as a Control in Visual Studio toolbox. 3) Drag and Drop control to a web form 4) Set the connection string to the cube 5) This will show all the dimensions and measure groups so you can drag n drop what you want to get a pivot table like functionality
