You can find the rectangle of the UIImageView in the coordinates of your (outermost) view using CGRect r = [iv convertRect:iv.bounds toView:self.view]; Then it's a matter of checking if r goes out of bounds, e.g. like this: CGRect i = CGRectIntersect(r,self.view.bounds); if ( CGRectIsNull(i) ) { NSLog(@"way out of bounds"); } else if ( !CGRectEqualToRect(i,r) ) { NSLog(@"partly out of bounds"); } else { NSLog(@"self.view envelopes imageview"); } Of course, this should be put in your dragging code, with the NSLog() statements replaced with appropriate handling (e.g. by only updating location in the last case, or by translating the rect back into view if needed)
