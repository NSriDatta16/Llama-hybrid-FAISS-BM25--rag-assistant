Display embed images in Flash/Flex Builder

i'm using image embedding in Flex 4 (the same goes with Flex 3). I have one class with a lot of [Embed(source="../assets/icons/icon1.png")] public static const image:ClasS And i reference them using: When i run the application i see the icon but in Flash(Flex) Builder i can't see the images while working in Design mode. Is there any way to enable image visualization in Flash Builder design mode ? or a better way to include resources. thanks
