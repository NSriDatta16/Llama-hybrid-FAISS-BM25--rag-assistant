I think that the solution might depend on how you want to use the data. But I'll make a simple suggestion. Perhaps the most simple approach would be to use a covariate to remove the seasonality. Do you have a time series of a strong driver? E.g., air temperature might correlate very well with sea surface temperature. Regress water temperature against air temperature, and check to see if the residuals contain the appropriate pattern (or lack thereof). If this approach works for surface temperature, maybe it'll work equally well for subsurface temperatures. Obviously this method will not work for certain applications.
