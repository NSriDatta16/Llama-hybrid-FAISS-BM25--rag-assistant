There's a comment about just this issue in the DDAnnotation.h file. // NOTE: Since @synthesize by default is done by the LLVM 1.5 compiler (with // flag -Xclang and -fobjc-nonfragile-abi2), we don't need to create method // -setCoordinate: and its ivar anymore. Check out WWDC 2010 Videos, Session // 144 - "Advanced Objective-C and Garbage Collection Techniques", for more // details.
