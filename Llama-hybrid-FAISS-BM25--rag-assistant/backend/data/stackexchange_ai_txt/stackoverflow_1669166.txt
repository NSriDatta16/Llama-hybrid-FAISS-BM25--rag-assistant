when the user clicks "ok", it logs out every connected user then it installs all pending updates. the update installation process does not execute in explorer. i think it executes under WinLogon, maybe through a Winlogon notification package . i don't know which system call would trigger this behaviour automatically... however, you can have a look at the Windows Update Agent API which should allow you to control automatic updates programmatically.
