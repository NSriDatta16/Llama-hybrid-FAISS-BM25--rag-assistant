OS X Process control

I'm writing a process-controller kernel extension for leopard. The application enables me to suspend process's with SIGSUS and to make the computer sleep. My problem is when an application that uses video / audio (e.g iTunes or GarageBand) is suspended and then I try to make the computer sleep, the sleep process waits on the audio / video application to end with a timeout of 30 seconds. In reality, when I try to put the computer to sleep when an audio / video application is suspended, the computer hangs for 30 seconds (probably the suspended application is not responding to the sleep request) and then it sleeps normally. When I wake the computer and send SIGCON to the video / audio application, it continues normally. Is there a way to change that 30 second wait time out? Or to make it not wait at all? Or any other solution?
