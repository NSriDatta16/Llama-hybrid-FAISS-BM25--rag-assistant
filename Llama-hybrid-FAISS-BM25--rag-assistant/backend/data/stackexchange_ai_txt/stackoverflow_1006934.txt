Eclipse JavaScript Editor: content assist for js files, autocompletion

I'm trying Eclipse (with JavaEE and Web Development plugins) as a JavaEE/GoogleAppEngine IDE. In HTML editor if I put a in I automatically get content assist for JavaScript in the referenced file. I was wondering if it was possible to obtain content assist for other JavaScript files (e.g. jQuery or homebrew js library) inside JavaScript editor.
