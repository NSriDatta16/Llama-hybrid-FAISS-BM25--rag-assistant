Django - how to tell if a template fragment is already cached?

I am using Django's Template Fragment Caching so in a template.html file {% extends 'base.html' %} {% load cache %} {% block content %} {% cache 500 "myCacheKey" %} My html here... {% endcache %} {% endblock %} This is working fine - I can see it's getting cached and hit but the view is doing something expensive to provide data to this view and thats getting called every time. In views.py def index(request) data = api.getSomeExpensiveData() return render_to_response('template.html', {'data':data} ) So how do I tell if the cache is avail before the call to api.getSomeExpensiveData()? I can't use cache.get('myCacheKey') as the cache isn't found - does it use some naming scheme and if so can I either use something like cache.get(cache.getTemplateFragmentKey("myCacheKey")) or cache.getTemplateFragment("myCacheKey")
