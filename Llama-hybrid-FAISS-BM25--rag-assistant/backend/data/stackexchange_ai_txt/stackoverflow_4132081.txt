All the code I have seen, defines prototype members outside of the function, e.g.: function clsDragStack(divWithin,divConstrain,arrOptions){ this._selectStack=[]; //... }; clsDragStack.prototype = { selected: function() { return this._selectStack; } }; It should not matter what is contained in the array. With your code, every time you create a new clsDragStack object, the prototype function selected is changed to return the _selectStack of the newest generated object. So every existing object will return the new (empty) array.
