You can still do cross-validation with time series, but don't just take data points at random. A rolling window is a good way, like: 1st: ~~~~ train ~~~~ train ~~~~ test 2nd: ~~~~ train ~~~~ train ~~~~ train ~~~~ test 3rd: ~~~~ train ~~~~ train ~~~~ train ~~~~ train ~~~~ test Where test size is about the same size as your forecast horizon
