I'm trying to figure out the same thing right now :-) I've found the sbt-undercover-plugin , which uses Undercover to generate a pretty nice looking HTML report for code coverage. I worked really well the first time I used it, but this morning my reports all show 0% coverage, so YMMV. I'll update as I find other options. Edit: The Scala Code Coverage Tool looks a bit more robust. It at least provides its own Maven repo, so you don't have to deploy locally to your build machines.
