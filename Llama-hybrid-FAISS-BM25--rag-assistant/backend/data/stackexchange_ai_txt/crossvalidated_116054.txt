It seems that perhaps you want a model that better captures the stratification in your data. You might want a multi-level model. This would capture that the gene is not only between these two groups of species but that there are different species in each group. An example of such a model expressed in R's lmer function would be: lmer( presence ~ group + (1|species), family = 'binomial' ) In this case you're looking for a fixed effect of group while recognizing that there is an additional random effect of species. (BTW, you were testing a proportion with a t-test, which is a no-no for many reasons including, you know the variances are unequal, the data may not be normally distributed, and there are better solutions that correctly handle binomial data like logistic regression, binomial tests, binomial confidence intervals.)
