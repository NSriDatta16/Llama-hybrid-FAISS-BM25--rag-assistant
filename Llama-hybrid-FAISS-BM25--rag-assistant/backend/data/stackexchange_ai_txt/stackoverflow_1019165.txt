well, it seems like this at the beginning, but when you'll refactor your code more, you'll get to some behavior for your organization class... one example that i might think of now is if you have people (employees), you may want to associate them with organization. so, you might have a method AssociateEmployee(User employee) that might find its place in your organization class. Or you might change location of the company, instead of setting parameters like address, city, state in three steps, you might add ChangeLocation(Street, City, State) method.. Just go step by step, when you encounter some code in you BL/service layer that seems like it should belong into the domain, move it down to the domain. If you read Fowler, you will get it very soon when you see it in your code.
