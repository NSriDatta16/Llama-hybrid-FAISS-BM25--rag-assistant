Typically, in a snapshot fact table you do not have changes. You usually have a date/time dimension which is used for the granularity of the measurements and not a DateStart/DateEnd. Similarly you do not have any SCD information. The fact snapshot is taken and the Date and Time dimensions are attached to those facts. If those facts repeat identically each month, so be it. Dealing with determining which facts are valid at a given time is more processing than you really want your DW or your ETL to handle - that kind of design (effective dates, etc) is more effectively used in a live OLTP-type system where complete history is kept in the live system. The point of the DW is to optimize for reporting, not for space, and thus there is a direct snapshot date/time dimension which allows you to easily index and potentially partition the data without a lot of date arithmetic or comparisons. As far as your dimensional model, be careful that you aren't succumbing to the too-many dimensions problem. Remember that dimensions do not have to correspond to entities in the real world. The choice of how dimensional attributes are grouped into dimension tables should be informed by 1) query needs, 2) data affinity and change behavior, 3) business organization. You might want to look into using one or more junk dimensions.
