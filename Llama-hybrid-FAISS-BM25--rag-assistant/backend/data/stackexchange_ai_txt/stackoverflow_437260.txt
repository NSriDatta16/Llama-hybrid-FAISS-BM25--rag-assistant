I've had exactly this setup - ISAPI PHP on a production server running windows 2003/IIS for the last couple of years. The majority of code on the site is PHP there's a little ASP too. Never had a single issue with it. PHP on Windows is extremely stable. Personally I like it because I can then easily use my favourite database - SQLServer - the so-called WISP stack. Disclaimer is that this isn't a particularly heavily used server - as can be seen from having SQLServer on the same box - but it fronts a publicly available service sector website and the a significant web application for the same organisation so does see significant real-world use.
