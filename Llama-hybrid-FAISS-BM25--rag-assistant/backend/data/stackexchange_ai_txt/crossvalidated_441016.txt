Multiple one-sample t Test

I have a sample that can be divided into three groups. I now want to compare if any of the three groups differs from a given mean. I have thought about conducting multiple one-sample t Tests but I do not know if I need to correct for alpha? I am really not sure. On the one hand, it is not a pairwise comparison, but on the other, it is still multiple testing. What would you say? Is there maybe a more elegant way to it than to conduct multiple one-sample t Tests? Kind regards, Helena
