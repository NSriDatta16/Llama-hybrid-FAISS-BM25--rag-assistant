EdM brings up some good points, please read them carefully. The solution to your problem is to not use the baseline_hazard_ , but the cumulative_baseline_hazard_ cph.cumulative_baseline_hazard_.loc[365, :-1] * np.exp(np.dot(X, cph.params)) in some R survival programs it represents a set of some "average" values of the predictors. So read the manual carefully. This is what lifelines does, so you need to "demean" the matrix X first.
