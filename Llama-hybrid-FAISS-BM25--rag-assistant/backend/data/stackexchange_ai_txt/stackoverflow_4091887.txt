How would you go about writing a simple programming language?

Possible Duplicates: Methodologies for designing a simple programming language Learning to write a compiler I would like to write a programming language with a syntax similar to QBasic but even simpler. I want it to be for beginning programmers. Its simplicity will encourage aspiring programmers not to give up and get them interested in programming. For example: Instead of QBasic's PRINT "Hello World!" I would use Write "Hello World!" or a little more like VB Write ("Hello World") How would I go about adapting the basic syntax to make my language?
