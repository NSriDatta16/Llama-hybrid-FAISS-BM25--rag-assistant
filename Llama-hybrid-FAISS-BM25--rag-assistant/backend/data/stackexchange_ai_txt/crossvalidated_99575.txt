Weird looking binned residual plot

My binned residual plot is quite strange looking, the 95% confidence lines are so very jagged, with points between. I have colored this "inside" of the 95% confidence interval because it is really hard otherwise to tell which points are inside and which are outside. This plot was made in R. This is from a generalized estimating equation-logistic regression, with many correlated clusters and a AR-1 correlation structure. I am not sure if this is a reasonable way for this plot to look or if I have done something wrong. Has anyone else had a plot that looks like this? Thanks in advance, Jesse
