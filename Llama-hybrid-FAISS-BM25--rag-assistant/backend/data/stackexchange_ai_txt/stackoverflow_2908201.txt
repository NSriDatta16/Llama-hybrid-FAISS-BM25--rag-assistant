In addition to the books suggested by Alex and nevan (of which I'd recommend Marcus Zarra and Matt Long's newer Core Animation book , given its greater quantity of iPhone coverage), I taught a class on iPhone Core Animation recently. The video for that class can found on iTunes U . My class notes, with detailed coverage of Core Animation, can be downloaded here (in VoodooPad format). I also gave a presentation on Core Animation at the recent iPadDevCamp in Chicago, for which the slides and sample code can be found here .
