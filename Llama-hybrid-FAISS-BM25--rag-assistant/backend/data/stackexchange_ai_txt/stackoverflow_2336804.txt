Open source embedded filesystem (or single file virtual filesystem, or structured storage) library for C

I'm not sure what the "general" name of something like this might be. I'm looking for a library that gives me a file format to store different types of binary data in an expanding single file. open source, non-GPL (LGPL ok) C interface the file format is a single file multiple files within using a POSIX-like file API (or multiple "blobs" within using some other API) file/structure editing is done in-place reliable first, performant second Examples include: the virtual drives of a virtual machine whefs HDF CDF NetCDF Problems with the above: whefs doesn't appear to be very mature, but best describes what I'm after HDF, CDF, NetCDF are usable (also very reliable and fast), but they're rather complicated and I'm not entirely convinced of their support for opaque binary "blobs" Edit: Forgot to mention, one other relevant question: Simple Virtual Filesystem in C/C++ Another similar question: Is there an open-source alternative to Windows compound files? Edit: Added condition of in-place editing. Edit: whefs superseded by: whio_epfs
