There's nothing wrong with having immutable data structures that internally use mutation (so long as the thread safety is well advertised). It's just that structs get copied all the time, so you can't do much with mutation. This isn't a problem in C/C++ because structs are usually passed by reference, whereas in C# it is rare to pass structs by reference. Since it's hard to reason about structs that are passed by value, mutable structs are discouraged in C#.
