As Kibbee hinted at above, the argument of leveraging existing .Net developers doesn't hold much water. It is impossible to be an expert in all facets of .Net development. The platform is just too big. The same goes for Java. The only thing Silverlight has going for it from a skills perspective is that you can code in your favorite .Net language. That advantage is fairly small if you are already doing any significant web development that utilizes JavaScript since Action script is a variation. So really to convert a programmer to either Flex or Silverlight is all about learning the platform's API.
