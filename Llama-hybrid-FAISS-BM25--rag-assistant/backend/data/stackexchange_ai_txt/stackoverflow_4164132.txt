Please post more details: fragment of code and name of the library file would be very useful. I had similar problem when I tried to specify file path using slashes instead of (double) backslashes (windows convention). Next thing: remember that your program looks for the library file in the same directory where the exe is (if you don't specify the path explicitly).
