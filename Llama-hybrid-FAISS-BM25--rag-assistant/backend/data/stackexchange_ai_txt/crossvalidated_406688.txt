NEAT was my first approach to the world of Neural Networks. I was like you, not understanding what was going on or what to do. I coded my first NEAT code in Javascript. A couple of months ago I wrote it in Kotlin and finally I decided to move to Python. As the paper is not very specific in some important details, each library has the author's interpretation of NEAT. I am writing currently my own algorithm based on it, (like this guy also did): https://towardsdatascience.com/neuro-evolution-on-steroids-82bd14ddc2f6 The most important part is that you understand how the math works. My first NEAT algorithm on javascript took me around one month, between literature, understanding and finding answers for not very detailed points of the text. My second implementation took me around 2 weeks, and I moved everything to Python in around 3 days. So, I recommend you to read the paper and go in depth about how neural networks work. The type of nets that pure NEAT generates have arbitrary topology, which you can't activate in one timestep, but you need multiple activations to take them to the end. Check also the NEAT users page: https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html It has lots of answers of unanswered questions of the paper. And I totally recommend you to do it. As I did my whole implementation from scratch (including neural networks) I can be pretty much flexible about what I want to do.
