How does Fisher LDA work?

Intuitively, how does Fisher LDA work? From this Linear discriminant analysis and Bayes rule: classification I completely understood the Bayesian approach but I'm not able to relate it to the Fisher's one described there. What's the relation between the linear combination of predictor and posterior probability in Bayesian approach? Why do the coefficients' estimate have that form? I know that this might be a trivial questions but I'm studying this on my own and my mathematical background is weak.
