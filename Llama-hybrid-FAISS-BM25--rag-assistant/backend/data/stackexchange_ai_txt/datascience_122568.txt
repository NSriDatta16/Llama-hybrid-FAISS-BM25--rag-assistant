Is it a problem to store your vector database in memory?

I'm learning ChatGPT/LLM Development and am regularly coming across all different kinds of vector database implementations. Some of them, e.g. Chroma , currently only support in-memory implementations for Python. My initial reaction when I read that is "how can that be enough memory?". For what use cases are in-memory vector databases suitable?
