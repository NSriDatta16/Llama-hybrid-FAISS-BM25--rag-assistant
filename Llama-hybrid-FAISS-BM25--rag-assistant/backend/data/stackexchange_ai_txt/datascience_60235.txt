To construct sentence embeddings Spacy just averages the word embeddings. I do not have access to Spacy right now, else would have give a demonstration but you can try: spacy_nlp('hello I').vector == (spacy_nlp('hello').vector + spacy_nlp('I').vector) / 2 If this also gives False , it will be because the float values might not be exactly equal after the computation. So, just print them out separately and you will see that they are really close.
