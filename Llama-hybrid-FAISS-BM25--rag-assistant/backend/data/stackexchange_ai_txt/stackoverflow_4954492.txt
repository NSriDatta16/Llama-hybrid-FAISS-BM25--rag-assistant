Erlang - Math and Code Elegance Question

Its a very tiny bit of math and more a question of the most efficient, most elegant way possible. If I give an integer such as 1.50 or 1.22 or 10.99 How can I get rid of the number to the left of the decimal and output the right side as an integer or float, for example .50 or 50 .22 or 22 .99 or 99 It matters what the fastest way to do it is. I would rather not turn it into a string if possible. Thanks for the help. BR
