Each Dicom file is composed by a series of tags. Some tags store the study data, other tags store the patient data, some tags store the image data and properties and so on. The tags are organized in groups, so each piece of information is identified by a group ID and by a tag ID. The groups are ordered within the file, and the tags are ordered within the groups. The first group in the file (usually with ID 2) contains the tag that specifies the transfer syntax: the transfer syntax is a sequence of number that specify the format of the following groups and the compression format used for the images. The group 2 is always stored uncompressed and with the explicit VR little endian transfer syntax. Most of the compression formats are applied only to the images data: only the deflate compression is applied to all the groups and tags When a dicom reader wants to read a file, it just need to parse the first tags to understand the transfer syntax of the following tags and compression scheme used for the images or file.
