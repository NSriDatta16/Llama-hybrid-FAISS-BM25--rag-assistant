Installing python setup.py into an alternative path doesn't find installed package

I have a test setup file, which I made for a simple "hello world" script. I have a package named mytest which has a function hello . Now, I have a very simple setup.py . Everything works fine, if I just run python setup.py install . But if I want to install lib into home folder ( python setup.py install --home=/home/blah ), the package is not available anymore (running import mytest in python gives me ImportError: No module named mytest ). Should I add pth-file manually into site-packages folder? I tried it (with contents /home/blah/lib/python , where my package is put) and importing mytest worked fine. Shouldn't it be done automatically? Or have I missed something? EDIT: output of install: ago@dellbert:~/py/mytest-0.1$ python setup.py install --home=/home/ago/py/ running install running build running build_py copying src/mytest/mytest.py -> build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/mytest running build_scripts copying and adjusting src/main.py -> build/scripts-2.6 running install_lib copying build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/mytest/mytest.py -> /home/ago/py//lib/python/mytest byte-compiling /home/ago/py//lib/python/mytest/mytest.py to mytest.pyc running install_scripts copying build/scripts-2.6/main.py -> /home/ago/py//bin changing mode of /home/ago/py//bin/main.py to 755 running install_egg_info Removing /home/ago/py//lib/python/mytest-0.1.egg-info Writing /home/ago/py//lib/python/mytest-0.1.egg-info and setup.py: from distutils.core import setup setup(name='mytest', description='test', author='Ago', author_email='email', version='0.1', package_dir={'mytest': 'src/mytest'}, packages=['mytest'], scripts=['src/main.py'] ) Folder structure: -src: -mytest: __init__.py mytest.py main.py setup.py main.py is just an executable which imports mytest and calls function to print hello world. But I have tried to just run import mytest in python to see, whether lib is installed.
