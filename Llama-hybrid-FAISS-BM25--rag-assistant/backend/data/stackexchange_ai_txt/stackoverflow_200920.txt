Embedding Intellisense Xml Documentation in Assembly?

I have an assembly containing very thorough XML-based documentation, which is used through Sandcastle to generate the help-files for the product. We also use the output XML files for providing proper Intellisense in Visual Studio when programmers use the assembly obviously. In order to do this, it seems we have do both supply the user with the assembly ("assembly.dll") and the documentation ("assembly.xml"). Is it somehow possible to embed the documentation within the assembly, so we'd only have to supply the single assembly-file and Visual Studio would be able to extract the information? Maybe embedded as a resource or something like that?
