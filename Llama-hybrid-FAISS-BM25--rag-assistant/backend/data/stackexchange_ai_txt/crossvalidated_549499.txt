Can we have an explicit representation of inverse of a softmax function?

As we know, logit is the inverse of logistic function in case of binary classification. Similar to this, I am willing to derive results for multinomial classification, for that I need to get an explicit representation of the inverse of a softmax function. It would be a kind helpful for me, if someone explain the above inverse with relevant characterisations to derive multinomial logistic regression.
