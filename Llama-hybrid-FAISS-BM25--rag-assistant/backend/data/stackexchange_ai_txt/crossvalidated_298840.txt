Can someone tell me is this research on light exposure at night linked to breast cancer is garbage?

I saw the report on the study that claims the following: The study found a direct relationship between a woman’s neighborhood nighttime light level before diagnosis and her later risk of developing breast cancer: The higher the light level, the higher the risk. It just doesn't pass my "sniff test", and sounds like a total garbage of a research. Can someone with experience in epidemiology comment on the statistics they use here? The paper is here: Environ Health Perspect; DOI:10.1289/EHP935 Outdoor Light at Night and Breast Cancer Incidence in the Nurses’ Health Study Peter James, Kimberly A. Bertrand, Jaime E. Hart, Eva S. Schernhammer, Rulla M. Tamimi, and Francine Laden
