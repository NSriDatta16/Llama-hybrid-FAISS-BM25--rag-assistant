What kind of independent variables can I use for multiple regression?

I'm very new to statistics. My assignment requires me to use one statistical method taught during lesson so I only have a choice between multiple regression, logistics regression and MANOVA. My research proposal is to look at the effects of violent video games and aggression. My lecturer suggested me to use multiple regression, so I can look at what factors predict aggression when playing video games. After reading through several journal articles, I've come out with a few factors that may affect aggression, the types of violent video games played (collaborative or competitive), realism (how much the game relates to reality), family history and gender. I could set aggression as my dependent variable but I'm not sure how my independent variables could work. Looking at the list of independent variables I came out with, I need to let my participants play a few kind of games (collaborative vs competitive and realism vs non-realism). Then when should I measure their aggression, after they played each game? Wouldn't that make it two dependent variables? I'm really confused. If there's a way to do this with logistic regression or MANOVA please help me with it too! Thanks!
