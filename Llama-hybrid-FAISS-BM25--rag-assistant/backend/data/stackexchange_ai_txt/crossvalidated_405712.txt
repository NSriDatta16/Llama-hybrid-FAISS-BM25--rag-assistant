Model ensembling - averaging of probabilities

From the BatchNorm paper, section 4.2.3, ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167 ), The ensemble prediction was based on the arithmetic average of class probabilities predicted by the constituent networks. Is there a theoretical basis for doing this? Is the output value after averaging of individual probabilities, still a valid probability?
