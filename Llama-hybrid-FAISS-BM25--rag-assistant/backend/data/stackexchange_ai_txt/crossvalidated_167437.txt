It looks like you may have used a linear SVM (i.e. an SVM with a linear kernel). Depending on the base learner, ADABoost can learn a non-linear boundary, so may perform better than the linear SVM if the data is not linearly separable. This of course depends on the characteristics of the dataset. See this page on wikipedia for more information about kernel methods.
