You can create the view with the buttons in it in IB, then drag that view into the Library window and save it. The catch is, there's no “link” between them; editing one won't change anything about the others. If you want that, you'll need to make a subclass of NSView instead. I thought of creating a subclass of NSView which, when loaded, replaces itself with another view which it loads from a nib file, setting the connected object as File's Owner, but I'm not convinced this is the cleanest method. That could work. I don't think that's really all that dirty; the reason init methods return an object is that they explicitly can return a different object. However, I'm not sure how you'd handle views of different frames, since the loaded view will have whatever frame it has in the nib. Another way would be to load the buttons from a nib, but you'd have to adjust their frames before adding them as subviews.
