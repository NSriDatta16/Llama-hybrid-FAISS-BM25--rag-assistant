Finding outliers in binary data

Say you have data from 10 different sensors about the occurrence of some event - e.g. motion sensors. Each sensor records 1 if they detected the motion sensors and 0 if they didn't. If you have 10 binary "reports" from these sensors, which should all ideally be identical, how can you detect outliers? E.g. in case the reports are 1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1 then the outliers are sensors 1, 5 and 10. E.g. in case the reports are 0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0 then the outliers are sensors 5 and 8. I looked at some literature on outlier detection in binary logistic regression but I don't think this is exactly what I'm looking for as the data is purely binary. (Correct me if I'm wrong)
