Reinforcement learning algorithms

I want to study and develop some application using reinforcement learning machine learning methods. I am already familiar with classification problem using supervised learning. Can someone suggest me some material (links, youtube tutorials, pdf notes, ...) or some simple script in Rstudio (using maybe the iris dataset) to start studying from? Thanks!
