I do not believe that this is a question of Bayesian vs. frequentist frameworks. It is a question of having the correct (predictive) distribution and minimizing the expected loss with respect to this distribution and a specified loss function. Whether the predictive distribution is delivered by a Bayesian or by a frequentist is irrelevant - all that matters is how far it diverges from reality. (Of course, getting only a single realization makes it hard to assess this, but again, that is orthogonal.)
