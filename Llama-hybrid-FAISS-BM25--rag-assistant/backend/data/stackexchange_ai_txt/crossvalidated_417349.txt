I think you might be confusing different topics, imputation, clustering, modelling. 1- If your data is missing, one pracince is to impute the data. So you can easily impute it with mean, or if the data is skwed, with the median. You can also predict that variable from other variabels. 2- You mentioned center of origin a few times I am not sure what it is related to. But one thing that is important with SVM is that you need to standardscale the data. In other words, all the features should have the same mean and variance.
