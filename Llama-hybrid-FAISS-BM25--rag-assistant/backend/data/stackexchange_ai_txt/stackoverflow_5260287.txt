Same mouseover/-out effect for many buttons

Last time I touched flash was 10 years ago, or so... In other words, I'm quite rusty. I am going to make a interactive map of Europe. I want the strongly green circles to have a mouseover/-out effect (First I was thinking some size-change, but I think maybe I'll go for opacityfading). I have a couple problems. The code under is working, but Is there a good way to either force the fadingout(...) to finish, before fadingin(...) is called? If not, is there a smart way to get the current opacityvalue when fadingin(...) and make that the start value. If the user moves the mouse outside quickly, the effect is not looking very nice. Also, what is the best way to get these functions to work with every circle in the map? If the user drags the mouse around, I want this to create a tracing effect. import fl.transitions.Tween; import fl.transitions.easing.*; var outTween:Tween; myButton.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OVER, fadingout); myButton.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OUT, fadingin); function fadingout(event:MouseEvent): void { outTween = new Tween(myButton, "alpha", None.easeNone, 1, 0, 1, true); } function fadingin(event:MouseEvent): void { outTween = new Tween(myButton, "alpha", None.easeNone, 0, 1, 1, true); }
