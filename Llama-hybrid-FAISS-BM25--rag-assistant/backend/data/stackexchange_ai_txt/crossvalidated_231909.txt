Can I exclude a fixed factor from a glmer to test the main effect of different continuous variable?

I'm unsure how to proceed to report my effects. I have a glmer to run a logistic regression: glmres.RU.conf.full = glmer(correct ~ choiceConf.scaled * condition + (1 + choiceConf.scaled|subject) + (1|cityPair), data = myDataForglm.RU, family = binomial) I'm interested in two things: (1) the interaction between choiceConf.scaled * condition and (2) the main effect of choiceConf.scaled . Testing my interaction effect doing a likelihood ratio test is straightforward: glmres.RU.conf.sum = glmer(correct ~ choiceConf.scaled + condition + (1 + choiceConf.scaled|subject) + (1|cityPair), data = myDataForglm.RU, family = binomial) anova(glmres.RU.conf.full, glmres.RU.conf.sum) Df AIC BIC logLik deviance Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq) glmres.RU.conf.sum 7 4467.4 4513.5 -2226.7 4453.4 glmres.RU.conf.full 8 4469.3 4522.0 -2226.7 4453.3 0.0606 1 0.8056 I am unsure about what the correct null model to test the main effect of choiceConf.scaled is. I can think of two approaches. First, I could compare a model including the two fixed effects vs. one including only the fixed factor I'm not interested in. glmres.RU.conf.sum = glmer(correct ~ choiceConf.scaled + condition + (1 + choiceConf.scaled|subject) + (1|cityPair), data = myDataForglm.RU, family = binomial) glmres.RU.null = glmer(correct ~ condition + (1 |subject) + (1|cityPair), data = myDataForglm.RU, family = binomial) Df AIC BIC logLik deviance Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq) glmres.RU.null 4 4471.8 4498.2 -2231.9 4463.8 glmres.RU.conf.sum 7 4467.4 4513.5 -2226.7 4453.4 10.443 3 0.01515 * Note that the AIC and BIC go in different directions. For the BIC, the null model is better (presumably because it's penalizing the 3 Df difference too strongly). So I tried to find a way to compare models that don't differ so much in complexity. I could do this by never considering the effect of condition in my model at all (I'm not interested in it for now, after all). glmres.confOnly.full = glmer(correct ~ choiceConf.scaled + (1 + choiceConf.scaled|subject) + (1|cityPair), data = myDataForglm.RU, family = binomial) glmres.confOnly.null = glmer(correct ~ 1 + (1 |subject) + (1|cityPair), data = myDataForglm.RU, family = binomial) anova(glmres.confOnly.full, glmres.confOnly.null) Df AIC BIC logLik deviance Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq) glmres.confOnly.null 3 5178.4 5198.2 -2586.2 5172.4 glmres.confOnly.full 6 5082.8 5122.4 -2535.4 5070.8 101.6 3 But this sounds incorrect to me. Is it ok to exclude factors (that are known to have a significant effect) from a model? Given that the BIC values are so different between the first and the second approach, I suspect it's not correct. Any other comments welcome.
