List of Lua derived VMs and Languages

Is there a compendium of virtual machines and languages derived or inspired by Lua? By derived, I mean usage beyond embedding and extending with modules. I'm wanting to research the Lua technology tree, and am looking for our combined knowledge of what already exists. Current List: Bright - A C-like Lua Derivative http://bluedino.net/luapix/Bright.pdf Agena - An Algol68/SQL like Lua Derivative http://agena.sourceforge.net/ LuaJIT - A (very impressive) JIT for Lua http://luajit.org MetaLua - An ML-style language extension http://metalua.luaforge.net/
