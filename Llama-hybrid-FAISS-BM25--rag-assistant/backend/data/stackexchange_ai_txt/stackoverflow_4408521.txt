How will increasing each memory allocation size by a fixed number of bytes affect heap fragmentation?

I have operator new() replaced in my C++ program so that it allocates a slightly bigger block to store extra data . So the program performs exactly the same set of allocations except that now it requests several bytes more memory in each allocation. Otherwise its behavior is completely the same and it processes exactly same data. The program allocates lots of blocks (millions, I suppose) of various sizes during its runtime. How will increasing each allocation size by a fixed number of bytes (same for every allocation) affect heap fragmentation?
