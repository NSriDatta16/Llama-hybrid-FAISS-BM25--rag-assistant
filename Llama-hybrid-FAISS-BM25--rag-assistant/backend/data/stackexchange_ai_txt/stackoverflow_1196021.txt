Problem when trying to access NSArray

I'm trying to initialize an NSArray in the loadView method. And when I initialize it, it has a certain address in the memory. Then when I touch the screen I call the refresh method. When I debug the blends array here, it has the same address, but the content is {(int)[$VAR count]} objects... Here is my code: @implementation MCPickerViewController #pragma mark Overriden methods - (void)loadView { [super loadView]; blends = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Piepje", @"Paapje", nil]; pickerView = [[MCPickerView alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] applicationFrame]]; pickerView.delegate = self; [self setView:pickerView]; } #pragma mark Delegate methods for MCPickerView - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self refresh]; } #pragma mark Personal methods - (void)refresh { NSLog(@"count: %i", [blends count]); } @end I hope someone can help me, cause I'm stuck for a long time! Thnx!!
