Some of sklearn's algorithms have a parameter called class_weight that you can set to "balanced" . That way sklearn will adjust its class weights depending on the number of samples that you have of each class. For the random forest classifier, try the following and see if it improves your score: rf = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight="balanced") # also add your other parameters!
