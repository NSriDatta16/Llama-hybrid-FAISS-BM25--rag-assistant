Cocoa Touch Question. Using KVO in a touch sequence context

I would like to use KVO in the following context: 1) In touchesBegan:withEvent: I alloc/init an instance of an object that I then observe via KVO My intent is to observe varous behaviors of the object throughout its life time. 2) In touchesEnded:withEvent: I assign this instance to an NSMutableArray and release the instance reference since NSMutableArray now retains it. I also must remove the oberver of the instance via removeObserver:forKeyPath: This is problematic because I now have lost all observation unless I add the observe back again to the array element which smells bad. Is there a way to have the observer remain attached to the object regardless of who owns it? Thanks, Doug
