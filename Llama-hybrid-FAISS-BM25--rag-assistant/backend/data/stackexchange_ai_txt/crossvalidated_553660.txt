One class SVM and centered data

I understand that the one class SVM try to separate the normal training data point from the origin. My guess is that, if we centered the data in a normalisation step, the OCSMV will works poorly since the data will be artificially closed to the origin. This is, in my opinion, still valid with a polynomial kernel since this kernel conserve the centerness of the data around the origin. So should we not centered the data if using a kernel that conserve the proximity of the data to the origin (linear, polynomial, ...) ? without kernel with polynomial kernel
