Has anyone successfully implemented this MSDN solution for Sharepoint External Libraries using Silverlight/WCF?

Has anyone successfully implemented this MSDN solution for Sharepoint external libraries? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd440954.aspx Some background: We will be providing file upload/download capabilities to both Intranet and Extranet users. In some cases, user uploads will be very large : sometimes twice the WSS3/MOSS2007 2GB limit. This MSDN solution looked compelling because we can leverage much of what Sharepoint has to offer - versioning, metadata, authentication, authorization, and workflow - but still manage very large files. Here are some specific questions I have about the MSDN solution: 1. The architecture shows file uploads/downloads passing through asmx web services in Sharepoint. Wouldn't these asmx services load entire uploads into memory? 2. Security. How granular is it? Can individual files in the external library be assigned explicit permissions, or are permissions only set at the list level?
