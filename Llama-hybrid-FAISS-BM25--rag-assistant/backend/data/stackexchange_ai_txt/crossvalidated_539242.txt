I've covered this topic on other threads listed below. I will address your specific questions here. So how does this a-posteriori distribution compare to the sample mean point estimate? Is the expected value of the a-posteriori distribution equal to the sample mean? Is the standard deviation of the a-posteriori distribution equal to the standard deviation of the sample mean? Often the mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution will be similar to the sample mean and its standard error, but not always. It depends on the selected prior distribution and the probability model for the data. Which one of the two methods is the better one - or does the Bayesian approach just give you more information (it gives you a distribution whereas the frequentist estimation only gives you point values) The short answer to this question is that it depends on what you want to measure, the experiment or the experimenter. The frequentist defines probability in terms of a long-run frequency of the experiment. Inference on an unknown fixed parameter uses confidence levels and p-values based on the concept of sampling from repeated experiments. Historical data (external information) is incorporated into an analysis by pooling observations through the likelihood or performing a summary-level meta-analysis (Johnson 2021a) . The frequentist can construct a confidence distribution or confidence curve that shows the plausibility of each hypothesis using p-values. This is analogous to the Bayesian posterior. Bayesians define probability as the belief of the experimenter, so there are no limits to how the prior can be formed to influence the inference on a parameter. It also means these statements of belief are unfalsifiable. Rather than incorporating historical data (external information) through the likelihood, Bayesians will incorporate this through the prior. If the prior distribution is chosen in such a way that the posterior is dominated by the likelihood, Bayesian belief is more objectively viewed as a form of confidence based on frequency probability of the experiment (Johnson 2021b) . This is an argument for using frequentist methods. Is it possible to get point estimates like in the frequentist estimation from an a-posterior distibution (e.g. the expected value for an point estimation for the true mean)? Yes, Bayesians will use the mean, median, or mode of the posterior distribution as a point estimate for a parameter. In non-normal settings and when considering non-linear transformations of parameters, using the posterior mean can introduce bias in estimation (considering that the parameter is an unknown fixed quantity).
