Find signal form in 1D Data

I'm new to machine learning and was thinking about a problem I had in my data analysis. I need to detect a peak in a captured 1d signal. The peak form from the measured data can be fitted with a function which varies in maximum amplitude and width (Let's keep it simple for now). I want to detect where that peak is inside the 1d signal and if that peak follows a learned structure. The first problem I have is to detect the peak because it is not always the highest. At the moment I use some smoothing with savitzky golay which works quite well and sharper peaks are much lower in amplitude after that. I was thinking of training a simple feed forward network and presenting it with the 1d data but the data might be scaled depending on how the signal was measured (Time series data with different capturing length). Is there any good literature on this topic or do you have hints for me on how to preprocess the data and extract the features?
