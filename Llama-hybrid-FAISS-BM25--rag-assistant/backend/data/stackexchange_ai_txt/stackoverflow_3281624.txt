Get away with built-in dragging html elements

I have a problem with html-objects that moving when I´m dragging them, you know the transparent "ghost" -copy of the element that appears when you holding down the mouse and drag it. My problem is that it interrupt my mouse event. I have a image that should be able to move inside a div when you dragging it with the mouse. I have to events for that, first one for mousedown that trigger mousemove-event, mousemove handles the movement of the image. mousedown is no problem but when I´m moving the mouse with the button down the transparent "ghost" - copy of the elements appear and interrupt my mousemove-event. Is that any one how knows how to get around or fix this thing?
