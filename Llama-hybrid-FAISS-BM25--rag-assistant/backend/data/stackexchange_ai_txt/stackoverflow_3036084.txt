You can run some tests among the users to find out the right number compromising responsiveness / performance. Also you can adjust that timeout dinamically depending on the network traffic. For example, for every sucessful resolv , you save how much time it took you to resolv it. And every hour (for example) you can calculate an average and set double of its value as timeout (Remember that "average" is, roughly speaking, "the middle"). This way if your latency is high at some point, it autoadjust itself to increase the timeout period.
