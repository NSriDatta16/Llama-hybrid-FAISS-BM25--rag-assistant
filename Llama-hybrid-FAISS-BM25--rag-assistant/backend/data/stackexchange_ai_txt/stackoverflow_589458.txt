Django: How to redirect to an external URL?

[Django 1.0.2] I have a view set up like this: (r'^redirect/(?P \d+)/(?P .*)/$', 'django.views.generic.simple.redirect_to', {'content_type': SiteType}, 'clickout'), When I get the following URL, two different things happen on local development server and on remote mod_wsgi server: # GET "/redirect/2/http://www.example.com//" # Remote server ends up (note the missing slash in the end) "http://mydomain.com/example.com" # Development server works as expected "http://www.example.com/" I have inspected the HTTP headers and it really tries the wrong URL: """HTTP/1.x 301 MOVED PERMANENTLY Date: Thu, 26 Feb 2009 06:58:35 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.52 (Red Hat) mod_wsgi/2.0 Python/2.5 Etag: "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" Location: http://mydomain.com/example.com Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Vary: User-Agent,Accept-Encoding Content-Encoding: gzip Content-Length: 20 """ What could be the problem? How can I redirect to an external URL? Edit It appears embedding URLs inside URLs is not a good idea. Both apache and mod_wsgi are collapsing double slashes. ( here is an explanation ) But giving the target URL as a parameter works fine: "/redirect/2/?url=http://www.example.com/" Thanks a lot Sean F from Webfaction support for helping me out.
