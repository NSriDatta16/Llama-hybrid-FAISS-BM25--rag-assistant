I decided not to go with Sphinx 4 because its based on Hidden Markov models which is primarily used for sequencial analysis auch as speech recognition and even multimodal inputs to an interface based on the input sequence. Insted I went with a software called Praat, its for speech processing and synthesis. There is also a "plugin" if you like, called "Akustyk" which is used to analyse vowels and so on. May be that direction will be of value for you, i'm not sure. You can then use mathlab and use the pattern recognition toolbox to implement your neural networks, GMM, or whatever approach you wish to pursue. Hope it was helpful.
