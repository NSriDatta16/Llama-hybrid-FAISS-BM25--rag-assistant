Rearranging a collection without Add/Removing items?

I have a TabControl that can be rearranged by dragging/dropping the tabs. The current process removes an item from the list and adds it to a new location. I had some performance issues switching tabs because of how complex the tabs are, so found an alternative which stores the rendered tabs and reloads them when requested. My only problem with it is that when dragging/dropping tabs, it re-renders each tab and causes the same delay. Is there a way to simply Move the item in the collection instead of Adding/Removing it? Or failing that, is there a way to cancel the addition/removal in the OnItemsChanged event during a drag/drop operation? The process affects the visual of the control, so I need to actually cancel the add/remove event if it was caused by a drag/drop operation (users can also add/remove tabs normally).
