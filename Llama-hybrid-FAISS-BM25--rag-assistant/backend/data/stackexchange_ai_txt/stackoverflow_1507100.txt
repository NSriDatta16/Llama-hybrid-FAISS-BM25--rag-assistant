Apple keeps the iPhone pretty locked down. I don't think you'd find it easy to query anything from the iPhone without some low level code over USB. IS there a specific reason you need to do this? Can you not just look in the Organizer window in Xcode and see what devices are connected there? The Organizer shows the UUIDs and more information about connected devices, including crash longs, the iPhone's console, screenshots and provisioning.
