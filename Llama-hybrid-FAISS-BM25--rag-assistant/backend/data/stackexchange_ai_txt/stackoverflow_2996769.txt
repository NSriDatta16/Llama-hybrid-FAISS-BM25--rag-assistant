I cant say what they are all for but I know that most of them are needed annoyingly as Magento does use allot of JS. This does not answer your question but you can minimise their effect with Magento 1.4.01 (probably in 1.4.0 as well) by going into System -> Config -> Advanced -> Developer -> JavaScript settings and then merge them all so you only have one HTTP request (same can be done with CSS). I would guess that the "most correct" way to go about removing them would be to make a new theme that does not need them and not include them as they would not be needed so in answer to question 2 i would say templates would most definitely be the way forward. I cannot remember the exact template that controls this but I'm sure I have seen one that has a big list of JS / CSS includes
