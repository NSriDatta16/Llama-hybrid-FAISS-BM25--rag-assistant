Besides the excellent references given by sebap123 , from the Deep Learning Book by Ian Goodfellow et.al, The recurrent neural network [given] is universal in the sense that any function computable by a Turing machine can be computed by such a recurrent network of a finite size. The output can be read from the RNN after a number of time steps that is asymptotically linear in the number of time steps used by the Turing machine and asymptotically linear in the length of the input . Hope this helps!
