This is for a case when several variables sum together to 1, in each observation. My answer will be intuition-level; this is intentional (and also, I'm not an expert of compositional data). Let us have i.i.d. (hence zero-correlated) positive-valued variables which we then sum up and recompute as proportions of that sum. Then, In case of two variables V1 V2 , if V1 is said to vary freely then V2 has no room for freedom (since V1+V2=constant) and is fully fixed; the greater is V1 the lesser is V2, the lesser is V1 the greater is V2. Their correlation is but $-1$ and is always so. In case of 3 variables V1 V2 V3 , if V1 is said to vary freely then V2+V3 is fixed; which is to say that inside (V2+V3) each of the two variables are still partly free: they are on the average $1/2$ times fixed each, full fixed in total. So, if any one of the three variables is taken as free (like we took V1), any of the remaining two is expected $1/2$ fixed. So that the correlation between them is $-0.5$. This is the expected correlation; it may vary from sample to sample. In case of 4 variables V1 V2 V3 V4 by the same reasoning we have that, if we take any one of the four as free then any one of the remaining is expected to be $1/3$ fixed; so, the expected correlation between any pair of the four - one as free the other as $1/3$ fixed - is $-0.333$. As the number of (initially i.i.d.) variables grows, the expected pairwise correlation grows from negative towards $0$, and its variation from sample to sample becomes larger.
