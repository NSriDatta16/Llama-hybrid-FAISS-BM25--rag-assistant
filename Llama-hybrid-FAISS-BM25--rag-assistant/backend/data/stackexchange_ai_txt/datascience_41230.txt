Vectors have perspective form the point of view of Mathematics, Physics and Computer science. I suggest you to go through Grant Sanderson's video on vectors on his channel 3BLUE1BROWN or rather go through his entire series on ESSENCE OF LINEAR ALGEBRA , for a better visual understanding of Linear Algebra. Talking about feature vectors , they are nothing but a collection of all the features (Individial property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed) arranged in a specific way. It is an n-dimensional vector of numerical features that represent some object that is required by the machine learning algorithms. Just go through this Wikipedia article from where I have written about feature vectors.
