Assuming we're talking about the same WaveIn.cs, the constructor of WaveLib.WaveInRecorder takes a WaveLib.WaveFormat object as a parameter. This allows you to set the audio format, ie. samples rate, bit depth, etc. Just scan the audio samples for peaks or however you're detecting "taps" and record the average distance in samples between peaks. Since you know the sample rate of the audio stream (eg. 44100 samples/second), take your average peak distance (in samples), multiply by 1/(samples rate) to get the time (in seconds) between taps, divide by 60 to get the time (in minutes) between taps, and invert to get the taps/minute. Hope that helps
