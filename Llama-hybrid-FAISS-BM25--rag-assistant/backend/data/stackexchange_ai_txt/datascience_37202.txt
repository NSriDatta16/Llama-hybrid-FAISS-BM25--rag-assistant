Poker tournament winner prediction

I am trying to solve poker tournament winner prediction problem. I’ve millions of historical records in this format: Players ==> Winner P1,P2,P4,P8 ==> P2 P4,P7,P6 ==> P4 P6,P3,P2,P1 ==> P1 I want to find the best algorithm to predict winner from set of known players. So far I have tried decision trees, XGboost without much success. I’ve done my research and could not find answer anywhere else.My apologies in advance if same problem is answered in different terms on stack-overflow.
