On a modern pipelined processor you need to take this into account: a mispredicted branch costs a lot stores and loads take a long time caches may speed up both reads and writes, but if it's a multi-cache architecture and b is being modified in more than one cache, multiple writes may mean multiple cache evictions and may offset the performance of the cache. Read with conditional write has at least one memory access and a branch that may mispredict. Assuming the branch is taken 50% of the time, you have 1.5 memory accesses on average, plus the chance of mispredicting. Unconditional write has exactly one memory access and no branch whatsoever. Now you need to balance the cost of mispredicting with the cost of a store, which changes depending on how many cache agents you have.
