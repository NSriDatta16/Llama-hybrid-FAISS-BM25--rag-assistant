Spaces in batch script arguments

I have a batch script which needs to perform an action on each of its arguments. Each argument is a file name (there are not switches), and of course file names may contain spaces. The batch script is run either by dragging files into the .bat icon in Explorer or by entering the files at the command line, enclosing arguments with spaces in quotes. Within the batch script, there are problems with handling arguments with spaces. If I use %* as follows, the quotations are ignored and each 'word' between spaces is treated as an argument. for %%x in (%*) do ( echo %%x ) I have also tried using shift , which doesn't seem to work right either, choking on files with spaces in their name: :next if not %1 == "" ( echo %1 shift /1 goto next ) What is the ideal way to iterate through all arguments? In Bash, one would simply use "$@" and everything Just Worksâ„¢, but of course that doesn't seem to be the case with Windows batch scripts.
