Time series forecasting with constraints

I want to predict the passenger flow volume of an airline route, which subjects to supply capacity constraints of the route (i.e., the passenger flow volume should not be higher than the supply capacity). Are there any algorithms that could be used to do this kind of forecasting problem with constraints?
