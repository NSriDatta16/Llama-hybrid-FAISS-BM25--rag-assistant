Specific plugins per workspace

I came across this post and wondered if there is a way to activate only a few of all of my installed plugins depending on the workspace I currently work in. For example - If I organized my workspaces like this /workspaces /java /jee /php ... I don't need the Android-Plugin if I'm working on my Java EE-Projects and so on. I also came accross this, suggesting to deactivate some capabilities for each workspace . But this not an option, as apparently no plugin is registered as capability. Thanks, m Edit: BTW, I am using Eclipse 3.5 Galileo
