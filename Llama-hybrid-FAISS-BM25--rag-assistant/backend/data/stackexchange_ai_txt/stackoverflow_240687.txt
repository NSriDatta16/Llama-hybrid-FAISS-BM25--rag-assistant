Eclipse should have some sort of Java search built-in where you could specify that... Else, instead of writing one large monster regexp, try chaining together a bunch of greps: grep -r static . | grep -v final in the 1st statement, the -r causes the grep to recurse over a directory tree starting at the local directory, the results get piped to the 2nd grep which removes all the final 's. Keep adding -v until everything superfluous is removed from the results. This is usually easier --albeit less elegant-- than figuring out a complicated regexp to take care of everything.
