Move Rectangles over Controls

I have a Panel (PanelBase) with a TextBox. I need to draw and drag a rectangle over the textbox using doble buffer to eliminate the flicker. To do that I'm puting a transparent panel over de PanelBase and draw the rectangle. How can I clear the last graphics in the transparent panel?
