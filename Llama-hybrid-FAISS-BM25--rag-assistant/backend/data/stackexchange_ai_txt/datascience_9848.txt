How to combine PCA and MCA on mixed data?

Suppose I have mixed data and (python) code which is capable of doing PCA (principal component analysis) on continuous predictors and MCA (multiple correspondence analysis) on nominal predictors. Is it possible to combine results from PCA and MCA into one?
