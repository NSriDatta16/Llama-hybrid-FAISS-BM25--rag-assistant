Writing less code shouldn't be your goal. In the end it's all about TCO (Total cost of ownership). While owning less code can improve the TCO, there is one factor that has a much greater impact for TCO: maintainability. You should write the most maintainable code. Start by reading Robert Martin's Clean Code . Update: Also you say “I have lots of comments” . This is a point where you might improve your code. As you will learn from Martin’s book, good code hardly needs any comments. Martin says that “comments are lies” and “should be reserved for technical notes about the code and design.” . Update 2: While I'm add it, here are my favorite quotes from Robert Martin's book: "a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change [Single Responsibility Principle]" [page 138] "More than three [method arguments] is very questionable and should be avoided with prejudice." [page 288] "The First rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that." [page 34] "Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long" [page 34] "The statements in a function should all be written at the same level of abstraction" [page 304] "Comments should be reserved for technical notes about the code and design." [page 286]
