Storage with fast read (slow write), able to store large amount of records

I'm searching for fast key-value\structured storage for lots of long strings. I'll update them seldom (and completely). I (will) store some often-update data (as users ect.) in MongoDB; as run-time update small DB (for chat) I ('m going to) use Redis (it's so pity, AFAIK, there is no ability to store data not in memory). Why won't I simply store it in MongoDB? Well, I'm optimization-maniac :), so, when I found out, that MySQL is faster than MongoDB in simple key-value reading (from some articles; also was said that MongoDB was designed for very fast write, not read) I was a bit disappointed. So, what about fast for read storage that can store really lots of information. Also, it's a C++ project. PS: what about storing it as files? What if there will be really A Lot of records.
