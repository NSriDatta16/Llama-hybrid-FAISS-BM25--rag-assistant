NLP programming tools using PHP?

Since big web applications came into existence, searching for data (and doing it lightning fast and accurate) has been one of the most important problems in web applications. For a while, I've worked using Lucene.NET , which is a C# port of the Lucene project . I also work using PHP using Zend Framework's Lucene API , which brings me to my question. Most times for providing good indexing we need to perform some NLP tools like tokenizing , lemmatizing , and many more, the question is: Do you know of any good NLP programming framework/toolset using PHP? PS: I'm very aware of the Zend API for Lucene, but indexing data properly is not just storing and relying in Lucene, you need to perform some extra tasks, like those above.
