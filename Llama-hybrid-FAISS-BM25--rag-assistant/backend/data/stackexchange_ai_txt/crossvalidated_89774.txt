Calculating error/accuracy in Logistic Regression

I am using Logistic Regression to create a binary classifier in R. Wrote a predictor for test data, and calculated the mean of my predicted result (I guess it can be translated to the efficiency of my method). I did find some references to training and test errors calculation, but can't seem to understand how to calculate them from the predicted fit. Any reference will help! glm.fit=glm(salary~age+workclass+fnlwgt+education+education.num+marital.status +occupation+relationship+race+sex+capital.gain+capital.loss +hours.per.week+native.country, data=trainAdults,family=binomial) summary(glm.fit) glm.probs=predict(glm.fit,newdata=testAdults, type="response") glm.probs[1:10] glm.pred=ifelse(glm.probs>0.5,"2","1") setattr(testAdults$salary,"levels",c(1, 2)) attach(testAdults) table(glm.pred,salary) mean(glm.pred==salary) plot(glm.probs) boxplot(glm.probs) Result of summary: Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -3.6016 -0.6337 -0.3539 -0.0786 3.3131 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.433467 0.029795 -48.111
