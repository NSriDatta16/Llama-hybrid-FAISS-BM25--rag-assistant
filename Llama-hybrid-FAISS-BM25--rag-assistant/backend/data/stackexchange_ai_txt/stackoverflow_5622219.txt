Style of tabulation : replace spaces by dots

For a multiple choice questions, I would like to format text like this : Answer............................A LongAnswer....................B VeryVeryVeryVeryLong Answer............................C (Display in a RichText or a Label) Data come from an XML like this : Answer LongAnswer ... I tried with 3 labels in horizontal layout for each lines but it doesn't work for the third case. Now I use tabStops for alignment, it work well, but I can't find how to replace spaces by dots in a proper way.
