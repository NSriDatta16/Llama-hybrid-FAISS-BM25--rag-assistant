Why is One Class SVM predicting that half my dataset consists of outliers?

I am currently working on a dataset with 14 continuous features, a categorical target over five classes, and 90,000 samples. My current goal is to explore outliers in the dataset, and to that end I have been experimenting with Scikit-Learn's implementations of Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One Class SVM. Here is a summary of the number of outliers detected and the two most-outlying classes for each model: Local Outlier Factor identifies 830 outliers (44% in class 3 and 29% in class 0) Isolation Forest identifies 16,430 outliers (52% in class 3 and 25% in class 2) One Class SVM identifies 45,000 outliers (34% in class 3 and 31% in class 0) I might also add that Local Outlier Factor and One Class SVM's third most-outlying class is also class 2. But to the point, I only have a rudimentary understanding of each of these algorithms and overall limited experience in outlier detection, so I am having a hard time interpreting these results. Moreover, it seems highly odd that the one class SVM would decide that exactly half my dataset is outlying, and I would like to understand why class 3 consistently makes up the largest proportion of the set of outliers. If anyone could point me towards some analytic techniques or explanations which might help me better analyze these results, I would be very appreciative.
