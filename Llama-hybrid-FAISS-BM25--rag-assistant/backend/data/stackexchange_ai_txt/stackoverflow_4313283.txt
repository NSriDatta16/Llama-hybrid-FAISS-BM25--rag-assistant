Online or offline text to html entities converter

Does anyone know of any online or offline software that will take, say, a paragraph of text with quotes and other characters in it and convert it to html entities ? I am not looking for the normal alphabetic characters to be converted, just the quotes and dashes etc. Reason I ask is that we have a copywriting department who insist on using Word for writing copy for websites but copying and pasting this into a site whilst having to find the strange characters is time consuming and tedious.
