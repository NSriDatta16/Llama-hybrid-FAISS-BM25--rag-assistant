Normalisation of data along with KFold Cross Validation

I am working on a project of disease prediction where I have to create survival prediction using the given data by applying machine learning classifiers. Along with the survival prediction I will then have to select important features, features that contribute more to the prediction using different feature selection techniques. After selecting those features I am going to apply Machine Learning classifiers on those selected features and will check if selected features with ML classifiers yields more accuracy or not than just applying ML classifiers on all the features. Also, I am using K-fold cross validation to split my data into test and training set and using mean accuracy as the measurement. My questions are: Should I / can I normalise my data using Standard Scaler before applying K-fold CV? If yes, how can I do the same? (I apologise in advance if I am unable to frame the question properly, I am new to this platform).
