Organizing c# code into different files

I've gotten to a point where my main code file is about a thousand lines long and it's getting un-manageable; that is, I'm starting to get confused and not know where to locate some things. It's well-commented but there's just too much stuff. I'd really like to be able to organize my code into different files, each with its own purpose. I want to get all the help VS gives me as I type when I edit these other files. A picture can say a thousand words: alt text http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/7848/codeorganizationscreens.png Is what I'm trying to do even possible?
