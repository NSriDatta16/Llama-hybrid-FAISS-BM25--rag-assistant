Random forests visual introduction-level reference or tutorial

I have seen several references, but am looking for something easy to follow that illustrates Random Forests in regression and feature importance applications. I want to make sure that I explain this at the 101 level. Something like this , but more pictorial like this pdf . I am having a hard time getting across a concrete high-level example of how predictors are being chosen and making them tangable to a general audience.
