How to determine current Page.Title value from UserControl

I have a MasterPage, several content pages - each of the content pages have a UserControl. In the MasterPage, I'm setting the Page.Title programmatically based on Page_Init "Request.UserAgent.Contains....", so that the content pages end up with different page titles based on this. Each content page has its Title set to blank (Title=" "), but when the page renders, the pragmatically generated page title shows up in the browser tab. In the UserControl code behind, I need to access the content page's (parent page) Page.Title value, and base on this, display some text: If(Page.Title == "something") { Lable.Text = "something"; } else if (Page.Title == "somethingElse") { lable.Text = "somethingElse"; } However, my label remains blank when using this code. What is the way I need to determine the current Page.Title to what the MasterPage has set it as? C# Please
