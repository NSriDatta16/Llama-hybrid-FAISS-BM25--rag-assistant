Suresh, Terracota does provide significant boost in performance when used in Java EE application servers. The Terracotta Server can be thought of as a shared L2 for all machines to leverage. Access to the L2 costs more than access to the L1—in the case of Terracotta, this is due to the fact that the L2 is across a network connection from all JVMs—but the L2 is cheaper than other I/O such as database or messaging that would otherwise be invoked. In contrast Zing Platform (Azul-Systems) scales by removing the heap size limitations, allows each instance to scale to hundreds of GBs of heap memory and tens of cores seamlessly and elastically. Conventional JVMs can't scale beyond 2-3 GB. Application server clustering does not provide caching. Clustering is used for load-balancing and fail-over and simplify few administration tasks. Clustering improves horizontal scalability, Caching improves vertical scalability. Having both is a killer combination :)
