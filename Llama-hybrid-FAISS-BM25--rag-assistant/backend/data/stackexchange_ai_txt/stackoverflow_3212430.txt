How to load a png image received through http post to OpenCV IplImage format

I am writing a webserver which receives an image and do some processing and replys with results. The image is in the png format. It is received as a byte[] via POST using PHP. I have to convert this byte[] to OpenCV IplImage format. What are the steps I should follow to get this done? The way I am currently doing it is reading the image and saving it on the hard drive and parse the file path to OpenCV cvLoadImage() function. I believe doing the way described in the above paragraph is much efficiant than this. Or is there a way to parse the byte[] directly to some OpenCV function without trying to convert it to IplImage format myself? Thank you..
