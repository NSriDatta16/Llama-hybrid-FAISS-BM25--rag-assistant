Assuming that you are embedding a vimeo player using their iframe embed code, this error is coming from the Vimeo javascript code within the iframe. See http://vimeo.com/forums/topic:28447#comment_3658475 for their comment on this - in short you'll have to live with it until they rewrite their embed code!
