My advice is to use HTML4 Strict or HTML5. Valid, in standards mode, with CSS for layout. You'll get all the benefits that are commonly associated with XHTML, but without any of the problems. Remember: XHTML DOCTYPE does not enable parsing of document as XHTML . It only enables standards mode, the same which is available to HTML 4 Strict and HTML 5. XHTML/1.0 has identical semantics and practically identical CSS support as HTML 4.01. Valid HTML 4.01 is parsed unambiguously just like valid and well-formed XHTML/1.0. XML DOM gives you namespaces support, but takes away support for document.write and innerHTML . Without proper XML MIME type set in HTTP headers (not document itself) all you get is parsing of everything as HTML and HTML DOM. XHTML is still not supported in Internet Explorer at all (including IE8). The best you can get in IE (and Googlebot) is XHTML misinterpreted as HTML with syntax errors (whether that's 70% or 30% of your audience, it's still something to think about). Try forcing "XHTML" websites to use actual XML mode , and you'll quickly notice that almost nobody uses XHTML. They just slap wrong DOCTYPE on their HTML: http://schneegans.de/xp/?url=http://www.wired.com/ http://schneegans.de/xp/?url=http://script.aculo.us/ These "XHTML" pages work only because they're usually interpreted as HTML.
