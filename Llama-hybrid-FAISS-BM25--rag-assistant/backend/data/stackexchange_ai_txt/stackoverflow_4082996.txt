What is bothering you is the repeating pattern used for flow control--and it should bother you--but there isn't too much to be done about it in Java. I get really annoyed at repeated code & patterns like this, so for me it would probably be worth it to extract the repeated copy & paste control code and put it in it's own method: public Method findMethod(Class clazz) int i=0; Method candidateMethod = null; while(candidateMethod == null) { switch(i++) { case 0: candidateMethod = getMethodByAnnotation(clazz); break; case 1: candidateMethod = getMethodByBeingOnlyMethod(clazz); break; case 2: candidateMethod = getMethodByBeingOnlySuitableMethod(clazz); break; default: throw new NoSuitableMethodFoundException(clazz); } return clazz; } Which has the disadvantage of being unconventional and possibly more verbose, but the advantage of not having as much repeated code (less typos) and reads easier because of there being a little less clutter in the "Meat". Besides, once the logic has been extracted into it's own class, verbose doesn't matter at all, it's clarity for reading/editing and for me this gives that (once you understand what the while loop is doing) I do have this nasty desire to do this: case 0: candidateMethod = getMethodByAnnotation(clazz); break; case 1: candidateMethod = getMethodByBeingOnlyMethod(clazz); break; case 2: candidateMethod = getMethodByBeingOnlySuitableMethod(clazz); break; default: throw new NoSuitableMethodFoundException(clazz); To highlight what's actually being done (in order), but in Java this is completely unacceptable--you'd actually find it common or preferred in some other languages. PS. This would be downright elegant (damn I hate that word) in groovy: actualMethod = getMethodByAnnotation(clazz) ?: getMethodByBeingOnlyMethod(clazz) ?: getMethodByBeingOnlySuitableMethod(clazz) ?: throw new NoSuitableMethodFoundException(clazz) ; The elvis operator rules. Note, the last line may not actually work, but it would be a trivial patch if it doesn't.
