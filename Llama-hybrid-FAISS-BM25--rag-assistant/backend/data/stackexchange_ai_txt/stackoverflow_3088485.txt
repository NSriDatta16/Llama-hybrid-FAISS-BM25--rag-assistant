how to revert position of a jquery UI draggable based on condition

I have an element which is draggable and an element which is droppable. Once the dragged item is dropped on the dropzone I am trying to execute the following jquery psuedo code: if(draggedelement == value){ $(draggedelement).hide(); } else{ $(draggedelement).revert(); } where the revert() function moves the dragged item back to its original postion. How would one accomplish this? P.S. I am aware of the draggable 'revert' option, however this only activates if the dragged item does not make it to the dropzone.
