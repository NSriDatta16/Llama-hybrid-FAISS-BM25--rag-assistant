WebClient has no notion of what kind of HTML it is downloading. If the site you're accessing is doing some sort of sniffing, use HttpWebRequest and set the UserAgent property to some really old browser. You can set the User-Agent header using WebClient as well, but you have to set the header directly as there's no associated property.
