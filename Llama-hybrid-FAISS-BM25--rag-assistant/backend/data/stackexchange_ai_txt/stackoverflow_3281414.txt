I'd suppress the warnings and worry about more important things. I'm not sure it makes sense to impose such an arbitrary limit on the size of a file or method. It's not so much the numbers 50 & 500 themselves, but the fact that there is such a number. Where does it come from? Why is 50 lines considered readable, but 58 isn't? As demonstrated here, concentrating on these metrics can be counter productive, and draw attention away from real issues. Perhaps time might be better spent, and good design principles better served, ensuring something like proper separation of concerns, for example. Split your lines and methods according to what should logically go in them, rather than breaking them up to meet arbitrary size criteria.
