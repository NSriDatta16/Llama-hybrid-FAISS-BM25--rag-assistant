I can imagine it could be a very good idea and very efficient in many scenarios to use a LinkedList if the data item one uses has intrinsic logic for a previous and next item anyway, for example a TimeTableItem or anything that is somehow time-related. These should implement an interface, so the LinkedList implementation can leverage that and doesn't have to wrap the items into its own node objects. Inserting and removing would be much more efficient here than using a List implementation which internally juggles arrays around.
