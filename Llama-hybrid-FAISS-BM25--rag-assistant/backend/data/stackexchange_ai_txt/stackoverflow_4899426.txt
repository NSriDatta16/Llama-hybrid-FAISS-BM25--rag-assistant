Well, you might not be open to this option if you have several controllers in your module, but it is a valid solution without creating extra rewrite rules in your .htaccess, etc. It is possible to set your "articles" module up with an IndexController.php instead of an ArticleController.php. Then you could access the pages with [http://]mydemostore/article/archives/01/2011.... where archivesAction() is a method in the IndexController.php. Magento automatically maps the IndexController.php to /yourmod/index/ or just simply /yourmod/.
