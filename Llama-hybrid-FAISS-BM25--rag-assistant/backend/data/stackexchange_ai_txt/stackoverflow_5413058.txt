Drag and drop not working

I have an upload/download web service that I created with WCF. Im using c sharp as the language. I have allow drop enabled on my textbox that accepts the items to be dragged into it, but it does not allow me to do it, I still get that no sign hovering over it. Is there something that Im missing? FYI I made another program using the exact same code and I was able to drag and drop items no problem. private void FileTextBox_DragEnter(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { //Makes sure that the user is dropping a file, not text if (e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.FileDrop, false) == true) //Allows them to continue e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy; else e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None; } private void FileTextBox_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { String[] files = (String[])e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop); foreach (string file in files) { FileTextBox.Text = file.ToString(); } }
