I think you have to man-up and deploy the software. unless you are working in an organization that has some kind of serious data security issues and or SOX issues with allowing the unclean to deal with the production end of things. I agree with the first comment - SCRUM has nothing to do with it. In fact I would think it's far better for you to be deploying as you'll know first hand how well things are working and be right there to get feedback from those users.
