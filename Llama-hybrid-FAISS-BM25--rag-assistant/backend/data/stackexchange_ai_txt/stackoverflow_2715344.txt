I ended up solving this with Web Deployment Projects [1] by pre-compiling the whole web application into two separate assemblies and then digging into the right assembly with Assembly.GetTypes() to instantiate the correct Page for the given HTTP request. It puts more on the shoulders of the plug-in developers, but yields better performance with the added benefit of having all plug-ins completely verified by the ASP.NET compiler before they're executed in a (security sensitive and fragile) web context.
