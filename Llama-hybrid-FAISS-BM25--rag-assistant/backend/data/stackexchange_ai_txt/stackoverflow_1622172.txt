For a standards compliant and broad suite of mail tools (and other IETF standards) I have several times found /n software's IP*Works to be a good API. I've used it in both incoming and outgoing scenarios. For the outgoing scenario, I used it for large mail-out support, and on my current project I use it for large scale IMAP mail retrieval for heavy use incoming customer support mailboxes. I've never had any compliance issues (so far so good). The suite supports much more than just IMAP and SMTP. It can be found here , and I've found the cost to be quite bearable considering what you get for your money.
