Rolling your own crypto is a VERY VERY BAD idea. Read it, repeat it loudly, do it again. Especially for hash functions. Cryptographers around the world are currently in the process of designing a new hash function, through the SHA-3 competition . It began in 2007, it will supposedly end in 2012, and several dozens (more probably hundreds) of smart people who specialize at cryptographic design (read: PhD and more) work hard at it. Assuming that you can, by yourself in a few weeks, do better than all those people in five years, verges on the preposterous. It turns out that building a secure hash function is a difficult problem (on a theoretical point of view, we do not even know if a secure hash function can really exist). Building a secure block cipher is quite easier. The designer of Blowfish (Bruce Schneier) is one of the designers of Skein , one of the candidates for SHA-3. Note that he did not reuse Blowfish for that. Note that he also published in 1998 the Twofish block cipher, a candidate to the AES selection process, as a much advanced successor to Blowfish; Twofish was much more scrutinized than Blowfish, so even for symmetric encryption you should not use Blowfish but Twofish (or, better yet, use the AES, aka "Rijndael", which was preferred over Twofish).
