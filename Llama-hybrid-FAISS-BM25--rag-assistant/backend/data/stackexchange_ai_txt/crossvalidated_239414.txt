Cross validation step by step description

I am a statistics novice. I therefore kindly ask for your understanding with this basic question: I want to cross validate the results of my logistic regression. So far I have divided the overall sample into two sub-samples (testing and holdout). I have run the logistic regression on the testing sample and afterwards run the same model on the holdout sample. I now have two regression outputs, but I am not sure on what to do next. How does the cross-validation work? Can someone please explain me how I should proceed. Which measures do I need to compare and when can I say that the model is valid? Thank you very much in advance
