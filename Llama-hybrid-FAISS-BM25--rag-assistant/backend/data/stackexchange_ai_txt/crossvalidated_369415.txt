If you're willing to specify a model for how all this data arises, then fitting a Bayesian model to the dataset is an option. Then you can draw missing values from the posterior predictive distribution and do not just get an average prediction, but also the uncertainty around it (by looking at the posterior predictive distribution). This is called "multiple imputation". For several simple scenarios (e.g. you assume all values - at least after suitable transformations - follow a joint multivariate normal distribution) there are standard functions in most software packages to do this. For more complicated examples, you may have to hand craft this (which can be challenging for truly complex cases).
