I used PCA to represent 2d in 1d then I found the median of the points and partitioned the data based on that point in 1d (if the median was like 0.5 all the points less than 0.5 are in partition1 and all the points more than or equal to 0.5 are in partition2). To find the line I use the scikit-learn's pca.component_ property and set the slope of the partitioning line to slope = -pca_component[0,1] / pca_component[0,0] We have the slope and a point (median point's index) so we can pass a partitioning line between points in 2d.
