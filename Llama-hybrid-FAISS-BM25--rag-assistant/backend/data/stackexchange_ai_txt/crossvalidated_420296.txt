How to combine different results of a stochastic classifier

I'm writing a paper about a machine learning-based system and using CNNs on a GPU cluster to compare two methods of feature engineering. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the algorithm, I couldn't get the same results on every run. For getting trustable results I run tests ten times for each method but, I don't know how to aggregate ten accuracy, precision, recall and f-score value to one. Is there a standard way to aggregate these scores, or can I just average these values?
