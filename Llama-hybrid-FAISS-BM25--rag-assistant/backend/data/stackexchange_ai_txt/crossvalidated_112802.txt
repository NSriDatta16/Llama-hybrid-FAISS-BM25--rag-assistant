Sorry you haven't gotten and attempts at answers. Would recommend Max Kuhn's book for coverage of this issue. This is a fairly broad issue. Just add some bits: ROC curves are popular, but only make sense if you're trying to understand the trade-off between the cost False Negative and False Positive results. If CostFN=CostFP then not sure they make sense. The c-statistic and other derived measures do still have use. If you want to maximize accuracy - just tune your model for this (caret package makes this easy), don't go making an ROC curve. Everyone uses the probabilities derived from RF models. I think think some thought should be given to doing this - these are not probabilistic models, they aren't built to do this. It often works. At a minimum I would produce a validation plot of RF probabilies on new data if I was really interested in probabilies The simplest way would be to use "simply reclassify those with values greater than 0.7 as present, and those If cost(FN) does not equal cost(FP), then you need to make the RF cost- sensitive. R does not makes this easy. The weighting function in the RandomForest package doesn't work. The best option is to play around with the sampling, undersample majority case to get cost function you want. But the relationship between sample ratio and cost isn't direct. So you might want to stick with (3) Update Regarding Class weights Andy Liaw: "The current "classwt" option in the randomForest package has been there since the beginning, and is different from how the official Fortran code (version 4 and later) implements class weights. It simply account for the class weights in the Gini index calculation when splitting nodes, exactly as how a single CART tree is done when given class weights. Prof. Breiman came up with the newer class weighting scheme implemented in the newer version of his Fortran code after we found that simply using the weights in the Gini index didn't seem to help much in extremely unbalanced data (say 1:100 or worse). If using weighted Gini helps in your situation, by all means do it. I can only say that in the past it didn't give us the result we were expecting."
