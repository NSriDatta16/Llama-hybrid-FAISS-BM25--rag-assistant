Your example doesn't hide the string at all; the string is still presented as a series of characters in the output. There are a variety of ways you can obfuscate strings. There's the simple substitution cypher , or you might perform a mathematical operation on each character (an XOR, for instance) where the result feeds into the next character's operation, etc., etc. The goal would be to end up with data that doesn't look like a string, so for example if you're working in most western languages, most of your character values will be in the range 32-127 â€” so your goal would be for the operation to mostly put them mostly out of that range, so they don't draw attention.
