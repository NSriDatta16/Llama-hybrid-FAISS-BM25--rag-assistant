Brian is right. You need to consider a video as a bunch of concatenated images. 30 FPS (Frame Per Second) video has 30 frames on every second of it. You run your model (segmentation, detection, classification or any other vision models does not matter) on the frames within the video stream. UNet is a heavy model to deploy on a mobile so you've tried a pruned version of it. The lack of accuracy might be caused of the model you used, the angle of camera. You might want control your use case. If low accuracy still remain you try other segmentation models like Yolov8 (might have pruned versions to deploy on edge & mobile), Faster-RCNN etc. Cheers
