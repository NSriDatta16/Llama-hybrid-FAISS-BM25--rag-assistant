How can I extract paragaphs and selected lines with Perl?

I have a text where I need to: to extract the whole paragraph under the section "Aceview summary" until the line that starts with "Please quote" (not to be included). to extract the line that starts with "The closest human gene". to store them into array with two elements. The text looks like this ( also on pastebin ): AceView: gene:1700049G17Rik, a comprehensive annotation of human, mouse and worm genes with mRNAs or ESTsAceView. However I am stuck with the following script logic. What's the right way to achieve that? #!/usr/bin/perl -w my $INFILE_file_name = $file; # input file name open ( INFILE, ' ) { chomp; my $line = $_; my @temp1 = (); if ( $line =~ /^ AceView summary/ ) { print "$line\n"; push @temp1, $line; } elsif( $line =~ /Please quote/) { push @allsum, [@temp1]; @temp1 = (); } elsif ($line =~ /The closest human gene/) { push @allsum, $line; } } close ( INFILE ); # close input file # Do something with @allsum There are many files like that I need to process.
