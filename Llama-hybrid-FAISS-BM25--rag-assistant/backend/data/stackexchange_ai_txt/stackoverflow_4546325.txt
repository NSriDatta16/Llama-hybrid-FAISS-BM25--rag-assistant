does nhibernate3 have any problem with applyfilter

i've just migrated from hibernate 2.1.2 to 3 now i have a problem in one of class maps i needed a property to be conditional in this way: public class ActivePartyConditionFilter : FilterDefinition { public ActivePartyConditionFilter() { WithName("ActivePartyConditionFilter") .AddParameter("condition", NHibernate.NHibernateUtil.Int32); } } public class PartyMap : ClassMap { Schema("organizationstructure"); Id(p => p.Id); Map(p => p.IsApproved) .Not.Nullable(); Map(p => p.IsActive) .Not.Nullable(); ApplyFilter ("IsActive = :condition"); } i didnt have any problem with this in previous version, but in this version the line ApplyFilter ("IsActive = :condition"); would make an unusable join when it wanna execute the query
