I would not use any feature detectors but recurrent neural networks. They are very good for symbolic sequences: for example, they are able to recognize context sensitive languages. Check out Biologically Phoneme Classification with LSTM neural nets (Graves, Schmidhuber) for an explanation of how to use RNNs for classification. See Generating Text with Recurrent Neural Networks (Martens, Sutskever, Hinton) for an impressive symbolic application of RNNs.
