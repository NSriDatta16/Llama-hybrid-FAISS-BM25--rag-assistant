Can I add custom version strings to a .net DLL?

I can add custom version strings to a C++ DLL in Visual Studio by editing the .rc file by hand. For example, if I add to the VersionInfo section of the .rc file VALUE "BuildDate", "2008/09/19 15:42:52" Then that date is visible in the file explorer, in the DLL's properties, under the Version tab. Can I do the same for a C# DLL? Not just for build date, but for other version information (such as source control information) UPDATE: I think there may be a way to do this by embedding a windows resource, so I've asked how to do that .
