Multiple Hypothesis Testing for Time Series

So I know that ANOVA is normally done for multiple hypothesis testing but it cannot be done for time series. However, what I have found for time series is only for two datasets. Here I am looking at several time series, call them Data1, Data2, ..., DataN, which are various observations in time. These are all subsets of a broader time-series. In particular I am looking at COVID waves to see whether the second derivatives (acceleration plot) are statistically different from one another to compare the "shape" of the waves. I am considering something like a statistical test to measure $$J_{t;ic}=|\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}(\frac{dI_{ic}}{dt})|$$ (where $$\frac{dI_{ic}}{dt}$$ is the daily number of reported cases in the i th wave in region c ). I would like it tested at the one-sided statistic $$\tilde{t}_>=\frac{J_{t;ic}-J_{t;jc}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{Jt;ic}+\sigma^2_{Jt;jc}}} \forall i\neq j$$ as a second derivative closer to 0 implies a wider curve, and an absolute second derivative i smaller than an absolute second derivative j implies that i is wider than j .
