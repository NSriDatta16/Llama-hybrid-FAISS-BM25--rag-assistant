An engineering solution would be: Create a language detector, feed the input to the detector, based on the language type classification, send the input to the appropriate model, that is if the language is french, feed the input directly to the CamemBERT. The output will be as accurate as the CamemBERT multiplied by the accuracy of the language detector. But if you are asking if the model weights can be manipulated so that we can get a new fully unified model, it is still in a research phase.
