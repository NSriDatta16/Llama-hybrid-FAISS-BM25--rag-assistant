I think it depends on what exactly you're doing with the GANs. If you're generating images, the two most popular (to my knowledge) are the Inception Score [1] and Frechet Inception Distance [2] . GANs aren't my direct area of study, but I don't think you can miss starting with those two. Actually, Goodfellow himself endorsed FID (a year ago) on twitter, so I'd start there.
