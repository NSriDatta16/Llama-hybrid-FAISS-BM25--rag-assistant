To solve your problem, you have to use a cluster algorithm . First, you need define a similarity metric, than you need to count the similarity between your input tuples (all Z3) and the rest of the database. You can speed up the process using algorithms, such as k-means . Please take a look on this question, there you will find a discussion on similar problem as yours - Finding groups of similar strings in a large set of strings . This link is very helpful as well: http://matpalm.com/resemblance/ . Regarding the implementation if you have a lot of tuples (and more than several machines) you can use http://mahout.apache.org/ . It is machine learning framework based on hadoop. You will need a lot of computation power, because cluster algorithms are complex.
