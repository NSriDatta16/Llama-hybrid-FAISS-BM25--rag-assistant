There are probably more than 20 different software applications that offer testcase repositories, testcase management and test management. These three phrases mean different things. Prices vary from downright cheap to enterprise class. of the applications that do test management, all the tools probably do 80% of the same thing. standard rule of 80/20 applies. There are a couple applications that are better because they offer valuable functionality the others don't. (everyone will have their own features but they are not universally valuable) buyers need to ask themselves these 10 questions: 1) if they want to be locked into a suite of products that does everything, albeit not as well, vs best of breed technologies, 2)if they want to use a product as designed by the vendor or customize the software to make it their own platform. 3) if they want out of the box flexibility to integrate with any other infrastructure or pay professional services for customizations, 4) if they want to submit a bug from the TM tool into a JIRA/Bugzilla or want a UI that allows one to do all defect activities within the TM tool which saves time to do more testing 5) if they want to rely on users to manually refresh screens to know about changes or use technology to have the changes automatically pushed to them 6) if they want customisable dashboards per project or per customer or if one size fits all 7) if they want to use past project history to predict finish dates for current projects and plan future projects vs use one's gut feel. 8) if they want to have their outsourced company manage them or if the company wants to manage their providers 9) if they are willing to force their organization to change software app year over year in the event a selection of an entry level tool is made or if one's better selecting an application they will use for years to come. 10) if they want to make a business decision to manage the testing team with accountability and visibility or let them testers choose a tool they like for their day to day use. Ask your vendors if they have can do the above. I hope this helps
