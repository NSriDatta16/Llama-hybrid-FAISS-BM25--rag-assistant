I don't know of ways to find SEs for SVM (they're not my thing), but if you want to compare the imputation methods, you can at least do each imputation 1000 times and find an estimate for the SE of the correct classification percentage from the variance over your repeated imputations. To be correct, you'd need to add a variance component from the method (SVM) itself, but if the difference is already smaller than (the desired multiple) of your SE, you know the difference is not significant. Little and Rubin provide this approach in much more detail.
