Error using Merge Replication to SQL Compact 3.5

We are getting the following error when syncing with sql server (2005 SP3): Initializing SQL Server Reconciler has failed. Try again.; The merge process could not connect to the message file from Subscriber '{F238C7BC-E13B-40E4-99F2-F11A203BD65A}:W:\http_content\Secure\SECURE_PROD\data_merge\30.18F5D9B4BCC7_B1415013-9FB7-424A-AB45-643A0D4A6320.IN'. Check to ensure that the server is running.; The subscription to publication 'COREPublication' could not be verified. Ensure that all Merge Agent command line parameters are specified correctly and that the subscription is correctly configured. If the Publisher no longer has information about this subscription, drop and recreate the subscription. As far as I can work out, everything is fine on the sql server side. I've done all the checks mentioned in the error message. Can anyone tell me what this error message actually means? Is it unable to read the shapshot file off the server? (this is my guess currently).
