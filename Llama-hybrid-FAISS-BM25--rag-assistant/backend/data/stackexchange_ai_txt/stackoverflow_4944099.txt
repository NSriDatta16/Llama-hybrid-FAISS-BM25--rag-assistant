According to the wiki , kgdb was merged into the kernel in 2.6.26 which is within the last few years. kgdb is a remote debugger , so you activate it in your kernel then you attach GDB to it somehow. I say somehow as there seems to be lots of options - see connecting GDB . Given that kgdb is now in the source tree, I'd say going forward this is what you want to be using. So it looks like Linus gave in. However, I would emphasize his argument - you should know what you're doing and know the system well. This is kernel land. If anything goes wrong, you don't get a segmentation fault; you get anything from some obscure problem later on to the whole system coming down. Here be dragons. Proceed with care; you have been warned.
