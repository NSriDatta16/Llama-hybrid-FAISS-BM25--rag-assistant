Definitely they can. I can target you to a nice paper . Once I used it for soccer league results prediction algorithm implementation, primarily aiming at having some value against bookmakers. From paper's abstract: a Bayesian dynamic generalized model to estimate the time dependent skills of all teams in a league, and to predict next weekend's soccer matches. Keywords: Dynamic Models, Generalized Linear Models, Graphical Models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods, Prediction of Soccer Matches Citation: Rue, Havard, and Oyvind Salvesen. "Prediction and retrospective analysis of soccer matches in a league." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series D (The Statistician) 49.3 (2000): 399-418.
