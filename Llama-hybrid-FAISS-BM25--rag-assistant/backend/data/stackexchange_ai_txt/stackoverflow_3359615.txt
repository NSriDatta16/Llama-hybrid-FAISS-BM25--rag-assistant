@joe the trouble is you have to generate the config file. in theory he could do that by writing a little helper program that adds all of the files in a DIRECTORY to the config file, but you'd have to use the directory name without a file filter i.e. do myhelper.exe coveragedirectory NOT myhelper.exe coveragedirectory*.xml command line length limits are a "feature" of DOS 1.0 and hence of the emulator built into windows. Have you tried using powershell?
