MapKit Annotations and User location

I followed this tutorial to make my first app: http://icodeblog.com/2009/12/21/introduction-to-mapkit-in-iphone-os-3-0/ I would really like to know how to sort the annotations in the Table in order of distance to the user (the nearest annotation is the first one on the table) How is it possible to do that? I understand that I must use the CLLocation to find the user's location but then I have no idea. Could any one help me? Cheers, Thank you in advance for your much appreciated help, EDIT: I've added details: the data is not in an array, it is implemented in RootViewController.m in this form: -(void)loadOurAnnotations { CLLocationCoordinate2D workingCoordinate; workingCoordinate.latitude = 40.763856; workingCoordinate.longitude = -73.973034; iCodeBlogAnnotation *appleStore1 = [[iCodeBlogAnnotation alloc] initWithCoordinate:workingCoordinate]; [appleStore1 setTitle:@"Apple Store 5th Ave."]; [appleStore1 setSubtitle:@"Apple's Flagship Store"]; [appleStore1 setAnnotationType:iCodeBlogAnnotationTypeApple]; [mapView addAnnotation:appleStore1]; ... and so on. How is it possible to do it then? You can find the source code here: icodeblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/iCodeMap.zip teddafan
