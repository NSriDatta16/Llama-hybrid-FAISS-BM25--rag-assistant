Open Notepad. Type the following lines into it (obviously replace the folders with your ones) @echo off rem you could also remove the line above, because it might help you to see what happens rem /i option is needed to avoid the batch file asking you whether destination folder is a file or a folder rem /e option is needed to copy also all folders and subfolders xcopy "c:\New Folder" "c:\Copy of New Folder" /i /e Save the file as backup.bat (not .txt) Double click on the file to run it. It will backup the folder and all its contents files/subfolders. Now if you want the batch file to be run everytime you login in Windows, you should place it in Windows Startup menu. You find it under: Start > All Program > Startup To place the batch file in there either drag it into the Startup menu or RIGH click on the Windows START button and select Explore, go in Programs > Startup, and copy the batch file into there. To run the batch file everytime the folder is updated you need an application, it can not be done with just a batch file.
