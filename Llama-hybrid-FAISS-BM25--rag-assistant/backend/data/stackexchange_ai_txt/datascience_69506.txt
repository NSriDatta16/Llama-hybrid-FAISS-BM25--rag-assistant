Inception Score (IS) and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID), which one is better for GAN evaluation?

IS uses two criteria in measuring the performance of GAN : The quality of the generated images, and their diversity based on the entropy of the distribution of synthetic data. On the other hand, FID uses the Inception network to extract features from an intermediate layer. But how can I know that what to be used in a given situation. Any comparisons between them or recommendation for usage?
