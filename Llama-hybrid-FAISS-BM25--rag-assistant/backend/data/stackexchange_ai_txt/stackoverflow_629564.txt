Prototype/Scriptaculous: Selecting groups of paragraphs ( ) by clicking on them

A list of paragraphs ( ) is given. As soon as the user clicks on paragraph A the class of paragraph A changes to "activated". Now the user selects paragraph B and all the paragraphs between A and B change their class to "activated". By clicking on B again, only A remains with the class "active". By clicking on A the class "active" gets removed on all paragraphs between A and B (including A and B). It shouldn't be possible to "deactivate" any paragraph between A and B. The selection between A and B should always be a uninterrupted list of selected paragraphs. Can anyone give me a hint on how to realize this with Prototype/Scriptaculous? The application is implemented in Rails, so any hint in RJS would even be more appreciated!
