Flex 3 browserManager.fragment question

I need some help. I've got a Flex 3 website. I can't read the var o below. If I have a URL that looks like this: http://mysite.html#view=my-important-stuff What will o equal? private function parseUrl(e:BrowserChangeEvent = null):void { var o:Object = URLUtil.stringToObject(browserManager.fragment); } So, what is the fragment that var owill be? Will it be "my-important-stuff"? Or do I get everything after the hash, "view=my-important-stuff" I've got a viewStack and the viewStack.selectedChid is equal to "my-important-stuff" and I'm having problems grabbing that string from var o. Thank you. -Laxmidi
