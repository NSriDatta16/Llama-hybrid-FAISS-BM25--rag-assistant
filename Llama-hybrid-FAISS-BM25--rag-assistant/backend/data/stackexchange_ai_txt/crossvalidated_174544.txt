deciding between classification and regression in random forest

I'm about to take my first stab at creating a model but have no idea as to where I should begin. I am trying to predict student exam performance. More specifically, I want to predict when students do well, especially the top performers. Is this a classification or regression problem? I have the numerical grades but am more concerned about a small subset at the top of the curve. Also, are there any algorithms that would fare better at predicting this group? Given the nature of my columns and everything I've read in texts/online I assumed a random forest would be appropriate.
