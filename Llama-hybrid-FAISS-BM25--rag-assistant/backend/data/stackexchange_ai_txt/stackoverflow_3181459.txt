ok i just stumbled upon arr.transpose arr = [['a', '1'], ['b','2'], ['c', '3']].transpose first = arr[0] second = arr[1] compared to the answers above arr.zip , arr.map , and the foreach , which is more efficient? Or which is the most elegant solution? OR (Thanks to comment by JÃ¶rg W Mittag - see comment below) first, second = arr.transpose
