Assuming that your input is not infinite (as in the case of a network stream that you never plan on closing) I might consider using a subshell to put the data into a temp file, and then a series of other subshells to read it. I haven't tested this, but maybe it would look something like this { cat inputstream > tempfile }; { grep tea tempfile > tea.txt }; { grep coffee tempfile > coffee.txt}; I'm not certain of an elegant solution to the file getting too large if your input stream is not bounded in size however.
