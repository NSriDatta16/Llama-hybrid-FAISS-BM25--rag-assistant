Widget for facebook problem

I've just finished making a widget for use on facebook, through Clearsprings. This is the second one we've made and the first one was fine. This time I ran into some problems when trying to embed it into facebook. The problem is the SWF won't embed, so I've gone for HTML option. However this puts it in an iFrame which then sits on top of the facebook layout, menus etc. Obviously not intended behavhiour, and it also stops the user from clicking add. Any ideas on what I could do to get around this? EDIT: Solved, the issue with the embedding was a maxium document height. Re-did 600 instead of 800px high and it was fine.
