where can I get Microsoft.Practices.SmartClient.DisconnectedAgent.dll?

I'm rebuilding a project that uses: Microsoft.Practices.SmartClient.DisconnectedAgent.dll And I can't find it anywhere as a download: Smart Client Software Factory â€“ April 2008 - this creates the folder "SCSF-Apr2008" with a "lib" directory that has lots of "Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.*" DLLs but not the DisconnectedAgent one I need. Smart Client Software Factory - May 2007 - many sources say this download has it but it is actually just a zip file with two .chm files Does anyone know where I can download Microsoft.Practices.SmartClient.DisconnectedAgent.dll ?
