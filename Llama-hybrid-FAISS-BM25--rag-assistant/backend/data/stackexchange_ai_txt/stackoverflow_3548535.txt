Organizing CSS and Javascript in a single template multiproject site

Let's start with a bit of context . What do I have in my hands? Multiple web applications (All .NET: WebForms and MVC) Common UI template Each application has also it's own UI elements. Multiple files for css/javascript. Some common to all applications, some specific to the application. Tenths of files per page = multiple requests per page = slow. Question: Do you have any ideas or comments on my ideas to achieve the following Goals? Reduce the number of requests to the minimum. Minify css and javascript. Use a CDN to distribute them. Have a life and be able to manage the UI area. Idea 1 Centralize the UI in a project. Every UI widget will be there with a sample (that can be tested later). I can "build" the ui: minify, group, publish to a global known place. Applications can link to these global files and use the UI elements. This will force a bit of discipline when doing the UI. It won't be a "hack some CSS and you're done". And after 3 months everything is full of hacks and you don't know where to start when fixing something. The bad : you work on an application but the UI part you have to work it first in another project. Go there, create your widgets, and then use them in your app. Idea 2 Forget the idea of the CDN and use some dynamic .NET minifier/packer. I will share the basic UI parts and every application will generate dynamically the packages they need in runtime. The bad : No CDN, dynamically generate something that you know is static, no centralized place for the UI (you have a common base, but nothing else).
