The following is assuming you are trying to get the app installed on another iPhone or iPod Touch: One point: don't send the private key, it is only needed for signing and thus only for development. All that needs to be sent is the app (usually zip'ed for transmittal) and the Ad Hoc Distribution Provisioning Profile. The provisioning file needs to contain the device ID of the phone it will be installed on. Recipients of the application will need to drag the application file and Ad Hoc Distribution Provisioning Profile into iTunes, then sync their iPhone to iTunes to install.
