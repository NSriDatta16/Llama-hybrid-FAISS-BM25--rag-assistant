jQuery: using click only on single element: using .slideToggle and .nextUntil to hide and show all sorts of content on click of a mouse

Heys! Ill cut right to the subject, here's the jquery code: jQuery(function() { jQuery('.entry-content h1').nextUntil('h1').hide().prev().click(function () { jQuery(this).nextUntil('h1').slideToggle(); });}); here's the html: Header 1 Paragraph 1 Text Some more text Some Images and a div InBetween header text text Now this works almost like its supposed to, on toggle the content under the h1s slide visible and when toggle again, they slide up. BUT the problem is that the efect happens also when clicking on an image of h2. I've tried to search the net for this, but havent got the answer yet :/ i'd much appriciate the help :) Simpe little script, for a page with loads of content of different kind that have "InBetween" h1's to shorten the page by hiding the content under them, and showing when clicked.
