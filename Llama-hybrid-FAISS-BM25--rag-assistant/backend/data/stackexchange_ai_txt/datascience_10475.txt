Fuzzy Rules with more than two variable in python

I am trying to build a fuzzy inference system in Python using skfuzzy library. I have 4 variables depending on which output class is decided. def fuzzInferenceself(): ### Input ### hf_very_poor = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0, 0.15, 0.3]) hf_poor = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [2.5,0.3,0.45]) hf_average = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0.4, 0.5, 0.75]) hf_good = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0.7, 0.85, 0.9]) hf_very_good = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0.875, 0.92, 1.0]) vc_less = fuzz.trimf(visited_count, [0, 0.05, 0.1]) vc_average = fuzz.trimf(visited_count, [0.05, 0.2, 0.35]) vc_many = fuzz.trapmf(visited_count, [0.3,0.45,0.55,0.7]) vc_a_lot = fuzz.trapmf(visited_count, [0.65,0.8,0.9,1.0]) rm_very_poor = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0, 0.15, 0.3]) rm_poor = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [2.5,0.3,0.45]) rm_average = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0.4, 0.5, 0.75]) rm_good = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]) rm_very_good = fuzz.trimf(hotel_facility, [0.85, 0.9,1.0]) ## output #### class_very_poor = fuzz.gaussmf(class_score,1,0.5) class_poor = fuzz.gaussmf(class_score,1.75,0.65) class_average = fuzz.gaussmf(class_score,2.25,0.75) class_good = fuzz.gaussmf(class_score,3,0.25) class_very_good = fuzz.gaussmf(class_score, 3.5, 0.5) def hotelFaclilityClassification(self,A): hf_vp= fuzz.interp_membership(hotel_facility, hf_very_poor, A) hf_p= fuzz.interp_membership(hotel_facility, hf_poor, A) hf_av= fuzz.interp_membership(hotel_facility, hf_average, A) hf_gd= fuzz.interp_membership(hotel_facility, hf_good, A) hf_vg= fuzz.interp_membership(hotel_facility, hf_very_good, A) return dict(hfVP = hf_vp, hfP = hf_p, hfAV = hf_av,hGD = hf_gd, hVG = hf_vg) def visitCountClassification(B): vc_l = fuzz.interp_membership(visited_count,vc_less) vc_av = fuzz.interp_membership(visited_count,vc_average) vc_mn = fuzz.interp_membership(visited_count,vc_many) vc_al = fuzz.interp_membership(visited_count,vc_a_lot) return dict(vcL = vc_l, vcAV=vc_av, vcMN = vc_mn, vcAL = vc_al ) def roomFacilityClassification(C): rm_vp = fuzz.interp_membership(room_facility,rm_very_poor) rm_p = fuzz.interp_membership(room_facility,rm_poor) rm_av = fuzz.interp_membership(room_facility,rm_average) rm_gd = fuzz.interp_membership(room_facility,rm_good) rm_vg = fuzz.interp_membership(room_facility,rm_very_good) return dict(rmVP = rm_vp, rmP = rm_p, rmAV = rm_av, rmGD = rm_gd, rmVG = rm_vg) A similar function for price is: def priceClassification(D) . The rules are as follows: If Hotel facility score is Very good, visited count is a lot, room facility is very good, prices is less then class is very good. I do not understand how to code the rules. All sources I have seen takes one input and one output variable. But this is not the case in my code. Can anyone give me a good resource or idea about how to code this rule?
