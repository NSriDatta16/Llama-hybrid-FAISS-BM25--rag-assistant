Example of interpretation of logistic regression

I was looking at a paper by Pell JS 2009, regarding smoking and survival following acute coronary syndrome. Part of the analysis carried out in the paper was a logistic regression with results as shown below: I have 3 questions about these results: As seen in the univariate analysis, is it right to say that only serum cotinine (>0.9) is statistically significant, despite the p-value for serum cotinine being 0.005? Has the strength of association between serum cotinine and all-cause death after adjustment has increased or decreased after multivariate analysis? Given that the p-value has decreased but the point estimate and SE of all categories of serum cotinine has increased (except Given the fact that of the 3 factors tested in multivariate analysis only age is associated with all-cause death, I was wondering if we could determine the nature of the association between serum cotinine and age given the changes of ORs for serum cotinine? I understand that if serum cotinine and age are collinear, the p-value for serum cotinine would become less significant. Therefore, since this did not happen, are Age and serum cotinine independent from one another? References: Pell JS, Haw S, Cobbe S, Newby DE, et al.
