How Do You Organise Your External Libraries In A Large Code Base

Just wondered how the community organises .net DLL libraries when working in a big team and with tens of different solutions? I am particularly curious about whether people choose to have some sort of 'library' folder which contains all the external DLLs that all projects use and whether people version their DLLs or just overwrite the DLL when a new release of the DLL happens and hope that the .NET solution on next recompile picks this up I am also not clear whether you can simply drop a different version of a DLL into a folder and have the solution pick this up or whether .net enforces you to use a specific version (Note: We dont need to sign any of our assemblies)
