Obviously without regexp there won't be such an elegant solution, unless you write your own PL/SQL function that does the same job. Otherwise you would have to do something like this: with data as (select '500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood Shores, CA' string from dual) select nvl(min(pos),0) from ( select instr(data.string, 'Apple') pos union all select instr(data.string, 'Park') pos union all select instr(data.string, 'Shores') pos ) where pos > 0;
