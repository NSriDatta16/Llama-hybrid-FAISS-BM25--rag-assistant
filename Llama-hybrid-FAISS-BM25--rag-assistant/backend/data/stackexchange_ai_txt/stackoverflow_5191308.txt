What we use at our place is Selenium . It has a few quirks, but overall it has allowed us to increase test coverage enormously, with I think a few thousand new system tests clicking around. Note that one can argue if this is really "unit" testing. That depends on your stack, I guess. We have to have our system running for this, so it's more integration testing. For pure unit testing of JS we use QUnit , and HTMLUnit has proven somewhat popular as well, for "middle of the road" tests that don't use a real browser but still gives you a DOM and whatnot.
