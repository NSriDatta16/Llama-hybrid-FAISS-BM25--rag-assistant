Add MKAnnotation in UIView, not in MKMapView

It's possibile to add an mkannotation in a uiview . I don't have ( and I don't want ) a mkmapview , but I want the annotation with the callout in a uiview. How can I add this point ( with callout ) on screen? Something like: MKAnnotationPosition newPos; newPos.center.x = 200; newPos.center.y = 250; to positioning the annotation in uiview. thanks, alberto.
