Alright, for some reason it was looking for a PEAR file in a non-existant location. Magento included this in line 27 of PEAR.php: $_pearDir = dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__))) . DS . 'downloader' . DS . 'pearlib'; However, this led it to a directory that included "/includes", which wasn't correct. I ended up just putting $_pearDir = dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__))) . DS . '../downloader' . DS . 'pearlib'; Notice the only difference is the "../" in front of downloader to remove the "/includes" directory from the path. But my real question would be why Magento would have this error in the first place. This couldn't have happened to everyone who installed Magento on an Ubuntu server, right?
