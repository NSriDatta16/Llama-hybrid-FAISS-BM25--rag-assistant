With 50 objects and the processing time you've given on average you are doing 12 seconds worth of processing every second. Assuming you have 4 cores, you can get this down to an execution time of 4 seconds via threading. Every second. This means that you're going to start off behind and slip further behind as time goes on. I know you said you tried to think of a way to make it more efficient, but couldn't, but I fear you're going to have to. The problem as stated now is computationally intractable. You're either going to have to process the objects in a rotating window (so each object gets hit once every 4th cycle or so), or you need to make your processing run faster.
