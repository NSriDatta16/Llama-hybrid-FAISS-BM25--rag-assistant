I would say to use a code coverage tool to check if these function are already tested somehow. Theoretically if your public API is passing all the tests then the private functions are working fine, as long as every possible scenario is covered. That's the main problem, I think. I know there is tools for that working with C/C++. CoverageMeter is one of them.
