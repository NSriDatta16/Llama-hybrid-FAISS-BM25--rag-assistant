One answer: create table charge( entity char(2) , amount int ) ; insert into charge( entity, amount) ( 'DF', 10 ) ; -- defualt; insert into charge( entity, amount) ( 'AK', 15 ) ; -- alaska; insert into charge( entity, amount) ( 'HI', 15) ; -- hiwaii; Then: select coalesce( amount,( select amount from charge where entity = 'DF') ) from charge where entity = 'DC'; get you the default amount. alternately: select amount from charge where entity = ( select coalesce( entity, 'DF') from charge where entity = 'DC'); In other words, use a null result and coalesce to either replace non-existent results with a default result, or to replace a non-listed entity with a default entity. Do you want a general technique/idiom , or a detailed design for a specific case? This is a general idiom. If it's a specific case, look at what Robert Harvey said: "All of the other rules appear to be additive.". If so, your design becomes very simple, a table of charges, or (better) a table of charges, a table of jurisdictions, and a many-to-many relation. Again, this only works in an additive case; create table surcharges ( id int not null primary key, description varchar(50) not null, amount int ) ; create table jurisdiction ( id int not null primary key, name varchar(50) not null, abbr char(5) ); create table jurisdiction_surcharge ( id int not null primary key, jurisdiction_id int not null references jurisdiction(id), surcharge_id int not null references surcharge(id) ); insert into charges (description, amount) values ( 'Outside Continental US', 15 ); insert into jurisdiction (name, abbr) values ( 'Mainland US', 'CONUS'); insert into jurisdiction (name, abbr) values ( 'Alaska', 'AK'); insert into jurisdiction (name, abbr) values ( 'Hawaii', 'HI'); insert into jurisdiction_surcharge values ( jurisdiction_id, surcharge_id) values ( 2, 1 ); insert into jurisdiction_surcharge values ( jurisdiction_id, surcharge_id) values ( 3, 1 ); List charges: select a.* from charges a join jurisdiction_charge b on (a.id = b.surcharge_id) join jurisdiction c on (c.id = b.jurisdiction_id) where c.abbr='AK'; Sum charges: select sum(a.amount) from charges a join jurisdiction_charge b on (a.id = b.surcharge_id) join jurisdiction c on (c.id = b.jurisdiction_id) where c.abbr='AK';
