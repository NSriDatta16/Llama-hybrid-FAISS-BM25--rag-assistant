To calculate an AIC, you need a likelihood. Correlation coefficients are not a likelihood (crucially, they don't change when you change the data size, while the likelihood is proportional to the number of observations). Here is an example of how to define a likelihood for a dynamical model https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/BayesianTools/versions/0.1.3/topics/VSEM Note that you will have to recalibrate your model parameters, as the parameters might depend on the definition and parameters of your error term, which is part of the likelihood. For a time-series model, you should probably specify a likelihood that accounts for autocorrelation, e.g. AR1
