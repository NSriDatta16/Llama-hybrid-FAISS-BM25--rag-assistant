Ontology and machine learning

this is a newbie question, so be tolerant. I have a dataset of people who bought products, and those products are under a "text" classification. I have Music, Games, Books, and so on as categories. What I like to do is to reclassify the product in a way where "Book" may be "Book -> war -> with alien", afaik this is something named ontology. The possible subcategories are already defined, however, they are not year connected. How to proceed to have this done in an automatic way?
