I would double check all of the bullet points on this page: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring Name your file jquery.[insert name of plugin].js, eg. jquery.debug.js All new methods are attached to the jQuery.fn object, all functions to the jQuery object. inside methods, 'this' is a reference to the current jQuery object. Any methods or functions you attach must have a semicolon (;) at the end - otherwise the code will break when compressed. Your method must return the jQuery object, unless explicity noted otherwise. You should use this.each to iterate over the current set of matched elements - it produces clean and compatible code that way. Always use jQuery instead of $ inside your plugin code - that allows users to change the alias for jQuery in a single place. See below for an explanation and a more elegant solution. For example, you say you are using $(this) but you should be using jQuery(this) . I doubt that that is the problem, but you should follow the documentation closely just in case there are some unexpected behaviors being caused by not following one of them. Are you returning the jQuery object? Other than that, you really need to post the source of your anims plugin so we can try to see what might be wrong.
