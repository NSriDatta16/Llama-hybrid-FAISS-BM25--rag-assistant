An analysis of variance will show that there is a significant difference somewhere. As an assist, it might be useful to plot the average number of deaths by season for the 35 years. Comparative boxplots with whiskers and notches would place the median deaths (with 95% confidence intervals) side-by-side for visual comparison. This is easily done in R. Such a plot also shows the distribution by season (answers the question about normality), and provides much more information than just significance.
