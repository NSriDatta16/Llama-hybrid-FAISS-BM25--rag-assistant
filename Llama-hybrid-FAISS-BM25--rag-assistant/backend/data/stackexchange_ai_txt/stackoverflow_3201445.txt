How to delete all database data with NHibernate?

Is it possible to delete all data in the database using NHibernate. I want to do that before starting each unit test. Currently I drop my database and create it again but this is not acceptable solution for me. ========================================================== Ok, here are the results. I am testing this on a database (Postgre). I will test CreateSchema(1), DanP solution(2) and apollodude217 solution(3). I run the tests 5 times with each method and take the average time. Round 1 - 10 tests (1) - ~26 sec (2) - 9,0 sec (3) - 9,3 sec Round 2 - 100 tests (1) - Come on, I will not do that on my machine (2) - 12,6 sec (3) - 18,6 sec I think that it is not necessary to test with more tests.
