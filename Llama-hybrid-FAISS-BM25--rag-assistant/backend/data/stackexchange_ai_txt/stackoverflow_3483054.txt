Check these tutorials http://gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=46 http://gotoandlearn.com/play.php?id=129 I think that if the video is embed in a MovieClip as you did it , the only behavior you can expect is what you're getting at the moment. It will play but you won't have any control over it. Why do you insist on embedding it? It will make your file bigger and the video won't play until the swf has completely loaded. It's a short video but it still will take far longer than accessing it via progressive download. Admittedly the second tutorial doesn't have much relevance but why not add it , it gives you more scope on how to deal with media in Flash. OSMF is a new framework and I think it makes sense to know about it.
