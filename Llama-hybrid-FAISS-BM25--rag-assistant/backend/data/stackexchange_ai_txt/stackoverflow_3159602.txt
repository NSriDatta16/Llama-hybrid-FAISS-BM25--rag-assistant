Inner joins using LLBLGen?

How could I do a simple join using LLBLGen? table1 - clientTable (address, phone, etc) table2 - employeeTable (name, etc) table3 - clientEmployeeTable (clientid, employeeid) I'm filling out a datagrid using the employeeId with fields for the client information (address, phone, etc) and I'm not sure how I could retrieve this using LLBLGen. I suppose I could create a stored procedure but maybe there's an easier way? I'm completely new with LLBLGen. I've been using stored procedures meanwhile but maybe there's a better way. // in stored proc SELECT (my specific fields) FROM [client].[List] abl INNER JOIN [client].ClientGroup cg ON cg.ClientGroupId = abl.ClientGroupId // in code DataTable dt=RetrievalProcedures.GetEmployeeNote(EmployeeId); rgridNotes.DataSource = dt;
