How can I get a session timeout page to bubble up out of an iframe?

I've got a web app in asp.net that uses an Infragistics control for making tabs. Each tab is an iframe, which is nice because only the current tab's page is rendered instead of rendering all of the tabs. However, when a page times out within one of the iframes, only that iframe redirects to the login page instead of the whole window. Is it possible to bubble this up somehow to have the whole site redirect to the login page instead of just the iframe?
