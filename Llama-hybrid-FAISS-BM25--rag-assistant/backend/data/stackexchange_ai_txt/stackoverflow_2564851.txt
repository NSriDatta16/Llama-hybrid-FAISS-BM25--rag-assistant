Lazy loading - do not make the AccountCollection objects inside the Users unless it is accessed. Alternatively, you can have it retrieve the account collections at the same time as the users and avoid 1 + 9000 database trips. Have more selective collection retrieval methods (i.e. what are you going to do with 9000 users? If you need all their information, it's not so much of a waste). Have smaller "digest" objects which are used for long lists like dropdowns and lookups - these objects are simple read-only business objects - usually containing only a small amout of information and which can be used to retrieve fully blown objects. If you are doing pagination, is the list of users loaded once and stored in the web server and then paginated from the cached copy, or is the collection loaded every time from the database and pagination done by the control?
