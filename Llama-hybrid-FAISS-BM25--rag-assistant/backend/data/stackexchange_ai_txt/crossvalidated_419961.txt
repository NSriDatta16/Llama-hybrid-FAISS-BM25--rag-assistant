Is there a Continuous Conditional Variational Autoencoder?

Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) are an extension of Variational Autoencoder (VAE). In VAEs we have no control on the data generation process, something problematic if we want to generate some specific data. Say, in MNIST, generate instances of 6. The question is, so far I have only been able to find CVAEs that can condition to discrete features (classes). Is there a CVAE that allows us to condition to continuous variables, kind of a stochastic predictive model?
