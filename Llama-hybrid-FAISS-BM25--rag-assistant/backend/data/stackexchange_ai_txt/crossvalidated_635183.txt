is there hidden cost function for hidden layer in the neural network?

In the case of a neural network,are there different cost functions for different hidden layers? or is there one cost function for the final layer ? For example, in the neural network, the hidden layer has sigmoid and Relu activations, and the output layer has linear activation. So, Will the cost function be MSE depending on the final output layer's activation? or Will there be different cost function for different layer- hidden Cost function log loss for sigmoid activation in hidden layer ?
