Linux lib / include organization for cross-compiled libraries?

We are cross-compiling an application for an embedded Linux target under desktop Linux. For testing and other purposes we are using statically linked libraries with our application. The testing library we are using is CMockery . My question is: Where should the static libraries and include files for CMockery live, given that we are cross-compiling? If we weren't cross-compiling, things should go in /usr/local/lib . Some suggestions from our team have been: /opt/google/lib and /opt/google/include /opt/ embeddedLinuxDistro /usr/local/share/google/lib (and include) /usr/local/ arch /lib (and include) Any pointers appreciated!
