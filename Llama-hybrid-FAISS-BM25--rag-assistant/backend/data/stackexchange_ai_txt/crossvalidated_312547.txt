Frequent and severe spike during Reinforcement learning

I apply reinforcement learning to solve a specific problem(time-series prediction). Here is the training curve. The red one indicates the cumulative reward each episode, the blue one indicates the prediction error. . The network is trained in tensorflow, optimized by Adam. And the specific RL method is proximal policy optimization. I wonder how to avoid such terrible spike.
