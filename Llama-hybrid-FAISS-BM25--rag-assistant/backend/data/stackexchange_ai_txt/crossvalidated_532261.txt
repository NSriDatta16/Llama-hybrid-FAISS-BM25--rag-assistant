Bayes formula assumes that there is a distribution over every quantity, so there is no need to rewrite it. Bayes formula applies to both discrete and continuous random quantities. If the quantities are discrete then the $p()$ are probability mass functions. If the quantities are continuous, then the $p()$ are probability density functions. You refer to the possibility of "fixed" quantities in your comments, but there are no fixed quantites in Bayes formula. If $\theta$ was fixed (i.e., known) then the formula would be pointless. If $D$ was fixed, then it could not provide evidence about $\theta$ . In Bayesian applications, $D$ is observed and $\theta$ is an unknown parameter that determines the distribution of $D$ . In this context, $p(D|\theta)$ is the likelihood function , the probability (i.e., the likelihood) of observing that particular $D$ value as a function of $\theta$ .
