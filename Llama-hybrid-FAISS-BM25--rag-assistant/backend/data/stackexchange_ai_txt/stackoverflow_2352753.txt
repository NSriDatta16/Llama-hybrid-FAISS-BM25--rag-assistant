it depends on organization of your data. If you use pointers or automatic memory inside your objects, it will be difficult. If you can organize your objects to be contiguous in memory, you have two choices: send memory as bytes,cast it back to object type on the receiver or define mpi derived type for your object. If however you use inheritance, things will become complicated due to how objects are laid out in memory. I do not know your problem, but maybe can take a look at ARMCI if you manage memory manually.
