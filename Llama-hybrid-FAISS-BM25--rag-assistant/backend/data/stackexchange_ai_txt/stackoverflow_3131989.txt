No. The operating system's idea of a default media player (if it even has such a concept) is not accessible to the web browser, and most media players can't be controlled from a web page's JavaScript code anyway. (With good reason: exposing a highly complex program like a media player to the Internet is a dangerous proposition. If just one bit of code in the handling of any format the player can read has an exploitable bug, then now every web page you visit could embed a media player and use the security hole to take over your machine. Indeed, this has happened many times in the past with Windows Media Player, QuickTime and RealPlayer, even though they were designed to be Internet-facing.) You can embed a particular media player that was designed for it, and fall back to another media player if not available. So you could try to embed WMP, then fall back to QT if that failed, and fall back to Real if that failed. But really, the days when it made any sense to do this are long gone. Today's it's all about the HTML5 and Flash video. The embedding of media players is dead, and good riddance to it.
