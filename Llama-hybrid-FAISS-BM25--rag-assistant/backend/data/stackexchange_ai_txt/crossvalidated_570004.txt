How to adjust regression for colinearity within certain levels of categorical variable?

I'm analyzing results from a large workforce survey, with approximately 110,000 responses to each question. We are interested in how certain demographic variables impact employees' opinions, so we construct inverse probability weights to adjust for non-response and then run weighted linear regression on each question. Most of our independent variables are made to be categorical. Two in particular are: age_factor and length_of_service_factor , or how long someone has been in the organization. These two variables aren't in general colinear: vif() from the R package car gives GVIF of 1.8 for age_factor and 2.3 for length_of_service_factor . However, they are apparently correlated for certain, low levels of age_factor ; clearly an employee who is 24 will not have had a job for more than 10 years! For instance: 95% of employees 25 and under have lengths of service of less than 1 year or 1-3 years. 75% of employees 26-29 years old have lengths of service of less than 1 year or 1-3 years. Looking at regression coefficients and least-square means, employees 26-29 expressed dissatisfaction across almost all of the questions. However, the same statistics show that employees with less than 1 or 1-3 years of service responded relatively positively. So my questions: Are there transformations I can make to the predictor variables to remove the colinearity for younger employees? As I'm reporting on lower satisfaction for younger employees ( age_factor of 26-29 years old), how should I adjust for the positive coefficients for newer employees (shorter lengths of service)?
