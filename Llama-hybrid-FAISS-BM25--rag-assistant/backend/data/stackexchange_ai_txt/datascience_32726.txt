Optimal Dimension of Graph(Vertex) Embedding

Let's define a embedding of a graph structure G = (V,E) where $\mid V\mid=v, \mid E \mid=e$ Now define an embedding $f: V \to R^d$ where $d\in \Bbb N$ , an optimal dimension of embedding which contains every edge information of $G$ . (G is a directed graph and there exist no weight, thus it's not a network.) I'd like to find an infimum formula of $d$ represented with $v$ and $e$ . [Backgroud of this problem] I am trying to construct a neural network which can discern whether the given explanation of word is about the word "be" or the word "exist" . For example "having a real existence" is "exist". To do this, first I need to find the most smallest dimension of each words' corresponding embedding of vertex for training of my network.
