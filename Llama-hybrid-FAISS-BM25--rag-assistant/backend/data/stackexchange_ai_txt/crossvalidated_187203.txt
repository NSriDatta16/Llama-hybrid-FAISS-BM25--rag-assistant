Log-transforming time series data before cointegration testing

I am testing the cointegration between these variables: Gold Price (Ringgit), Exchange Rate - MYR to USD (Ringgit), Real Effective FX Rate Based on CPI, T-Bill 10 Years Rate, Consumer Price Index. Which variables should I take logarithms of before running the tests?
