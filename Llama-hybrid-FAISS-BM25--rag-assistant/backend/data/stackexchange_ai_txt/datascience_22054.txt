Why using deep learning at all? It seems you already have a big set of features. So maybe try using Random Forests? They are pretty good at handling outliers (in you ur case, useless 0 values). CNN are good for dealing with 2 dimensional input data, like pictures. RNN you should use when dealing with timeseries. In my opinion deep learning should be thus used, when dealing with abstract data.
