You don't need to allocate storage , You could probably pass your result variable into a function that does your magic stuff. Something like this. void magic(void *buffer) { // magic stuff } TypeName foo() { TypeName result; magic(&result); return result; } Or of course you could have your TypeName structure set up as bit-fields or whatever your magic code manipulate...
