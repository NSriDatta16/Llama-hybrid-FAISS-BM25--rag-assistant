Best way to determine that two sets of sample means are not different (with 95% confidence)?

I am given the averages and standard deviations of two sets of data. The average is computed by running a non-specific optimization algorithm 30 times and averaging the result. I am trying to determine if my data is "equal" to the data given in a research paper with 95% confidence. Which statistical test would be most apt for such a comparison?
