Bayesian Beta regression with random effects in R

Does anyone know of an R package that does (Bayesian) Beta regression with random effects? We know of Bayesianbetareg but this doesn't include random effects so I'm wondering if there is another package out there even if not on CRAN or if Bayesianbetareg can be coerced to include random effects. Any thoughts are much appreciated. If sharing some data is useful, we're happy to upload it.
