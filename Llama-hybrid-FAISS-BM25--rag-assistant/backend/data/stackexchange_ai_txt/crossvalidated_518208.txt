reconstruction error for PCA-analysis

I am working on an assignment for school where they ask us to perform PCA-analysis on a data set consisting of 500 data points where each data point is of dimension $p=256$ . You usually project your data set on the vector space spanned by the $q$ eigenvectors corresponding to the $q$ largest eigenvalues, so your $q$ of choice should be smaller than $p$ . However, if I take $q=256$ and perform PCA to reconstruct the original mean of the data and then compute the RMSE between the original mean and the reconstructed mean , I obtain that the RMSE equals 0.3063. Why is this the case? Wouldn't you expect the RMSE to be equal to zero if you take $q=p$ ?
