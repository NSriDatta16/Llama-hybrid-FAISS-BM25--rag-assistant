I work for a Ruby on Rails consultancy in Brisbane, Australia. Test-Driven-Development : This is pushed very, very hard in our office. Not testing is viewed as "incredibly stupid". You write the code, how do you ensure by way of an automated process such as CI, that it still works? Tests. Do you test? : See point one. Unit Testing : All the time, using RSpec. I'm "fluent" in Test::Unit and Shoulda also. Integration Testing : Again, all the time, Cucumber. Acceptance Testing : With our tickets we "deliver" them with an Acceptance Criteria. Then the client has to either "Accept" or "Reject" them by following the bouncing ball. The Acceptance Criteria has the bonus of also being what our Cucumber features are written in. Code Reviews && Pair Progamming : We pair. It's the instant version of code review. It's awesome because you can sit back and watch someone else work, they write the test and then you write the code to make that test pass. If you're sick then the other person knows what you were up to and can pair with somebody else. Innovative Technologies : Because we use Rails, we're really fond of REST. Agile : We work on 2 week iterations using Pivotal Tracker . Requirement Specification (How?) : Using features in Pivotal Tracker the client can specify what requirements they have and then we flesh them out (usually by talking with them) into acceptance criteria, and eventually Real World features. Continous Integration : We use a CI server I developed called construct . This was built with the idea of being like Integrity, but with background jobs and better support for branches. Now that Integrity has background building, there's still the branching support keeping us "ahead". Code-Coverage Tools : RCov sometimes. We're not really fussed with code coverage as we test EVERYTHING before we write it. If it exists, there's something that will test it. Communication (Wiki, Mail, IM, Mailinglists, other documents) : We communicate with our clients using Email primarily, but we also have "standups" with them using Skype. We've also used Basecamp for this. I'm wanting to use Google Wave for our next project, just as a little experiment. I think it'd be really helpful. Team size : We have 4 people in our team, usually 2 pairs unless someone's sick. Meetings : We have a "scrum"/"standup" in the mornings lasting about 15 minutes. The idea of this is that you go over what you did the previous day, any problems you encountered, what you're going to do today and something "new and shiny" you found. This should not turn into a project meeting. Those are for after the standup if required. Bug tracking : Again we use Pivotal Tracker. The client can file a bug here and then (ideally) write how to duplicate it. Then we write a test to ensure that this should never happen again (aka: Regression Testing) and it goes through the same work process as our features, we deliver and the client accepts.
