Are you dealing with simple or complex seasonality in your data? For example, monthly data may show monthly seasonality whereas hourly data may show daily and weekly seasonality. I think your decomposition would need to reflect whether the seasonality in your data is simple or complex. Simple seasonality would produce a single seasonal component when decomposing the time series into its component parts, whereas multiple seasonality would produce multiple seasonal components. For an example of the latter, see https://otexts.com/fpp2/complexseasonality.html . One way to retrieve the long term trend and seasonal component(s) in your time series would be using a GAM model. For this type of model, you can report an adjusted R squared and keep track of improvements in adjusted R squared associated with introducing additional systematic components to the model.
