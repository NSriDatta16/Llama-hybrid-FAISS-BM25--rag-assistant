Maciek and Robert already gave you some ideas on how to implement this. For the specifics of binding the columns of the DataGrid I strongly recommend Meleak's answer to that question.

I also know that the following suggestion doesn't help that and even makes that curve steeper. But your scenario is complex enough that I'd recommend to use PRISM .
