What's wrong with my Windows batch (.bat) file?

I created a simple batch file (.bat) containing a bunch of commands to be triggered automatically into the command window. The batch looks like this: mmd dll1.dll -mf -aW mmd dll2.dll -mf -aW mmd dll3.dll -mf -aW If I copy and paste the bunch of cmds into the command window, they are all correctly executed. However, if I try to directly drag the batch file into the command window and execute it, the first command starts and ends up failing to succesfully execute. Why? The command window where I run the commands needs to set a lot of environment variables before the commands can succesfully run. When I drag the batch file (with absolute path) it looks like I never set those variables. Don't the commands from the batch file run in the same context with the hosting command window? How do I do that then?
