Is this a question from the Cormen book? As I understand it, from reading the previous paragraphs in that book, the object that you store in the direct access table is 'your' object. So you can, as you suggest, store pointers to doubly-linked lists in the table with each list element having a pointer to the user's object. Then, the dictionary SEARCH operation returns a list element and the user must use a further step to get at his object. Likewise the DELETE operation takes a pointer to a list element. Does that make sense? I don't want to spoil your homework!
