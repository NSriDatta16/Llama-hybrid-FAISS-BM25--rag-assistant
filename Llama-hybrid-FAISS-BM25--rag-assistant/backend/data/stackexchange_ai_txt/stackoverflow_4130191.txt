Creating a web based "bulletin board pin map" using Jquery; drag/drop/collisions/etc

I'm looking to create a web based "bulletin board" so to speak, where the user can create/delete/drag/drop 'pins'--without being allowed to overlap 'pins.' Here is a diagram that should help illustrate what I'm trying to create: 'pins' are created, probably upon double click; they will prompt the user for a label. 'pins' cannot overlap; (the final shape will be larger, more oval like.) 'pins' will need to be able to "connect" with other 'pins' with a visual element (i.e. dotted line,) but not all pins will be "connected." I found GameQuery which allegedly supports bounding box collisions--but it's beyond important that the collisions be detected with ovals, not boxes (I know the above example might suggest otherwise, but that's just a diagram... not a mock up of the intended final design.) The 'pins' may also vary in size/shape, depending on label size... this should be taken into account as well I imagine, to ensure an approach conducive to all the UX variables. I've found Quadtree and Collision Detection along with this GameQuery collision demo , but it all sort of looks a little like gibberish. I'm looking to be pointed in the right direction, just so I know that what method I invest my time into, will work for my desired result... rather than busting my balls figuring out Quadtree and GameQuery for example, just to find it they won't work for this project. ... Also, if any experienced developers are willing to be a mentor for me on this project--I am prepared to offer my extremely refined design experience, for a few "I need help" questions along the way. How do I adopt an n-sided polygon into the pre-existing bounding box functionality of GameQuery? It doesn't need to be a perfect circle, but at least 8-sided.
