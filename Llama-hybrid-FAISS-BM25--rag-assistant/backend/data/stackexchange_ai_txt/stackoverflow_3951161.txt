For those finding this post later I worked out my own solution. Seems when the alex toolbar is installed it shows up in the user agent. You can redirect those users with php preg_match('/(Alexa)/i',$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])?header('Location: http://alexausersgohere.com'):null; You could also just redirect them by dumping this in your .htaccess file. Options +FollowSymlinks RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Alexa RewriteRule ^(.*)$ alexausersgohere.com#$1 [R=301,L] Make sure you double check that htaccess code I just wrote it as a demonstration, its un-tested I used php.
