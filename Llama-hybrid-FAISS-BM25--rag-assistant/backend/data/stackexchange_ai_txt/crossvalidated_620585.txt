The right way to find average change in percentages

I want find how much percentage changed on average. Am I doing it the right way? Say I start with value 100 and change the value by some percentage Can I say that the avg. change is 2.46 % (adding all percentages and dividing by 11)? If so, why doesn't the value tally (130.57 instead of 125.18) if I start with 100 and change the value by 2.46% 11 times? enter image description here
