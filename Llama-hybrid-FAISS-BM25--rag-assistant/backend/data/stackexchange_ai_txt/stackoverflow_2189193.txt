You sould definitely learn the basics of socket programming first so you understand a little bit about what's going on. Next, I would look into programming using WinPCap , which is a packet capturing library. It's not built directly for .NET but there are, I believe, .NET wrappers or if nothing else you could call the functions by using COM Interop.
