Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is a field dedicated to the study and development of machines that can learn, and the goal is of deep learning is to achieve eventually attain general artificial intelligence. Neural network is just one of the biological inspired model. In simple terms I would define deep learning a subset method in machine learning primarily using artificial neural networks which are inspired by human brain. See the following diagram. Classical machine learning uses classical statistics/mathematical modelling while deep learning use biological models aka neural networks.
