Your question is somewhat open-ended, but it sounds like you want is what is known as a " classifier " in the field of machine learning . In general, a classifier takes a piece of input and "classifies" it, ie: determines a category for the object. Many classifiers provide a probability with this determination, and some may even return multiple categories with probabilities on each. Some examples of classifiers are bayes nets , neural nets, decision lists, and decision trees . Bayes nets are often used for spam classification. Emails are classified as either "spam" or "not spam" with a probability. For you question you'd want to classify your objects as "high quality" or "not high quality". The first thing you'll need is a bunch of training data. That is, a set of objects where you already know the correct classification. One way to obtain this could be to get a bunch of objects and classify them by hand. If there are too many objects for one person to classify you could feed them to Mechanical Turk . Once you have your training data you'd then build your classifier. You'll need to figure out what attributes are important to your classification. You'll probably need to do some experimentation to see what works well. You then have your classifier learn from your training data. One approach that's often used for testing is to split your training data into two sets. Train your classifier using one of the subsets, and then see how well it classifies the other (usually smaller) subset.
