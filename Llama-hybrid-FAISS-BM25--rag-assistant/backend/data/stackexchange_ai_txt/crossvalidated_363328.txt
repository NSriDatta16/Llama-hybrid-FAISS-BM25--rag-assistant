Multivariate Logistic Regression models are the common way to solve these problems. Google Benter etc. That deals with 2 competitors at a time. So the number of horses in the race becomes irrelevant. You cannot work out percentage chances individually - they depend on the chances of all the competitors in the race. The sum of all the percentages = 100%. Trainer data etc is usually based on percentages over last two weeks or so. Less than 30 races gives unreliable data. It is recognized that too many data variables makes the solution worse. 5 key data items that are independent are enough. NN models are not successful because they are averaging models - they are not good in predicting for a specific race but OK for a whole season of races.
