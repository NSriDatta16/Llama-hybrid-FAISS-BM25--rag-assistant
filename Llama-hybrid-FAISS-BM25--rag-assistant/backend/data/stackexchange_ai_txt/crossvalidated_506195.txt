Expected value of a Gumbel variable conditional on Gumbel being the maximum of N iid Gumbel

I found the following results in Hanemann (1984) which I cannot find a proof for. I checked through simulation that it is right, but I would like to see an analytical proof... Hanemann, W. M. (1984). Discrete/continuous models of consumer demand. Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 541-561. He considers a discrete choice with $i=1,...,N$ options. The value of a choice is the sum of an intercept that is specific to each option $v_i$ and a random draw: $V_{i}^{F} = v_i + \zeta_{i} $ where $\zeta_{i} $ is an idiosyncratic taste shock. He defines with $M_i$ for the set of values of the vector $\zeta$ such that the option $i$ yields to highest to the agent, i.e. $A_i \equiv \left\{\zeta \mid V_{i}^{F}\geq V_{j}^{F}, \; \forall j \right\} $ . He further considers the case where $\zeta$ is a vector of i.i.d. random variables distributed Type 1 Extreme Value with scale/dispersion parameter $\sigma$ . Note that ${P}(\zeta \in A_{i})$ is the probability that option $i$ is actually chosen. Hanemann (1984) states the following results in equation (3.15) and I was wondering if one knew where to find the proof. \begin{equation} {E}\left\{e^{t \zeta_{i}} \mid \zeta \in A_{i}\right\} = \Gamma(1-\sigma t) \times \beta_{i}^{\sigma t}; \quad \text{ where } \beta^{-1}_{i} = {P}(\zeta \in A_{i}). \end{equation}
