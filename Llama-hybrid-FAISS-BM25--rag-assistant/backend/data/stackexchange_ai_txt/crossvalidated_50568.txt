Without details from your paper, I would conjecture that this discarding of highly-correlated variables was done merely to save off on computational power or workload. I cannot see a reason for why PCA would 'break' for highly correlated variables. Projecting data back onto the bases found by PCA has the effect of whitening the data, (or de-correlating them). That is the whole point behind PCA.
