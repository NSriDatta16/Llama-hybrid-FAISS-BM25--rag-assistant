adf.test returning p-value > 0.99 even when data is stationary

I have a pair of time series that I differenced and now take on values {-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1}. My goal is to test them for Granger causality and discover any lead/lag relationships. Since this requires the time series to be stationary, I ran adf.test on them and was surprised to find that the p-value for both were 0.99. I also got a warning saying p-value greater than printed p-value. I was hoping to learn what I'm doing wrong here, please let me know what further information I can provide.
