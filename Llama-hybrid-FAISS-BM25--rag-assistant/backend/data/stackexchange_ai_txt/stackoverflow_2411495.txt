touchlisteners and textviews

Actually I'm trying to implement an ontouchlistener into my android (1.5) application. therefore i implemented the "ontouchlistener" into the class, and then i put my code into the: public boolean onTouchEvent (MotionEvent e){ //code } The problem is, that if I am dragging over an (e.g.) Spinner or EditTextView than this Method isn't called. The only way to solve this which i figured out is to add an ontouchlistener to each of this views manually: ((Spinner)(findViewById(R.id.spinner1))).setOnTouchListener(tl); ((Spinner)(findViewById(R.id.spinner2))).setOnTouchListener(tl); (tl is the ontouchlistener) So isn't there a way to catch the touch event before it gets to each of those views? thanks in advance Ripei
