Embedding flv (flash) player in windows forms

I'm trying to the the flv Flash player from here in a windows forms application. I currently have it playing 1 .flv file with no problems but I really need to be able to play multiple files. Has anyone had experienace of using the playlists that this control offers or is there a better way to do this?
