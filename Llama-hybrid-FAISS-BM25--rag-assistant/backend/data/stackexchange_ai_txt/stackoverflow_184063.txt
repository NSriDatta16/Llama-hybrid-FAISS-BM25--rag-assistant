Code coverage tools for VS 2008

We're getting our feet wet with unit testing in VS 2008 Professional Edition and have hit what might be a pretty large snag: there appears to be no way to determine code coverage in this particular VS edition. It seems that this is something only available in VS Team System Development Edition. In other words, VS 2008 Professional Edition allows you to write all the unit tests you want, but provides NO WAY to check which code does not have an associated unit test (or how much code is covered by tests). Is this observation correct? If so, can someone recommend a 3rd-party tool to determine code coverage? I tried TestMatrix but was thoroughly unimpressed (The settings screen was hiding the OK and Cancel buttons at 120 DPI, running my current set of tests caused a complete VS lockup). A side question: Instead of a 3rd party coverage tool, and instead of upgrading to VS Team System Development Edition, would it make better sense to adopt NUnit and find a free/low-cost code coverage tool? We're not knee-deep in unit testing yet, and we want to choose a testing method which won't hamper our efforts down the line... and not break the bank.
