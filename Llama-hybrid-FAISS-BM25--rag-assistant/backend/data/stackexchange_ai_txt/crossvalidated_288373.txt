Structural equation modeling with repeated measures

I have data that I thought would lend itself easily to structural equation modeling, but I cannot figure out one issue -- how to handle repeated measurement in SPSS AMOS. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (labeled "structure"). They then completed 3 4-item scales (labeled "understanding", "dread", and "unknown"). I want to test whether understanding mediates the relationship between structure and dread and structure and unknown. The image below shows the path diagram I would use. The catch is that each participant completed these scales for 8 separate replicates (always in the same structure condition). I cannot find a way to specify this kind of design in AMOS. One solution I am considering is to average all the variables within participants, so instead of having 8 rows per participant, I only have 1. In a regression/ANOVA context, this is equivalent to removing the within subjects variance, giving me the correct between subjects tests. For the purposes of this analysis, I am not interested in differences between the replicates or interactions between the manipulation and the replicates (i.e. any of the within subjects variance). Since I am only interested in between subjects tests, I am hoping this procedure is equally as valid in SEM. [Edit: Given the mediator is also measured on each trial, this procedure is looking less valid the more I think about it.] Even if that does solve this problem, I am interested in if it is possible to specify repeated measures designs in SPSS AMOS and, if so, how it is done. If not, I would also like to know if other SEM software can do it.
