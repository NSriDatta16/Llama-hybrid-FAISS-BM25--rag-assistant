Without being able to use Firebug to right-click and Inspect Element on the header element (hint), I would say that there's some other CSS overriding or adding to your desired styling. Unless you can post a link to the page at hand or a full example of it (since the fragment doesn't contain any CSS that might be affecting it), you need to try the above for yourself and remove or override the appropriate properties.
