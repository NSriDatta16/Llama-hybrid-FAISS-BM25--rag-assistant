Fetch a Wikipedia article with Python

I try to fetch a Wikipedia article with Python's urllib: f = urllib.urlopen("http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&printable=yes") s = f.read() f.close() However instead of the html page I get the following response: Error - Wikimedia Foundation: Request: GET http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&printable=yes, from 192.35.17.11 via knsq1.knams.wikimedia.org (squid/2.6.STABLE21) to () Error: ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, errno [No Error] at Tue, 23 Sep 2008 09:09:08 GMT Wikipedia seems to block request which are not from a standard browser. Anybody know how to work around this?
