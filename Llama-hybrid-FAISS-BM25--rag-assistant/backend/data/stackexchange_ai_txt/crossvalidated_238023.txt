How to treat "impossible values" in sums of choose operators?

I am trying to prove that $2^n = \sum_{k=0}^{k=n} \binom{n}{k}$ using $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$. (Exercise v-a in Appendix 1 of Jim Pitman's Probability.) I prove it by induction and in the final step I end up with terms $\sum_{z=-1}^{z=p-1} \binom{p-1}{z}$ and $\sum_{k=0}^{k=p} \binom{p-1}{k}$. Since the choose operator is undefined for those terms I trucate the series and end up with: $\sum_{z=0}^{z=p-1} \binom{p-1}{z}$ and $\sum_{k=0}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k}$, each of which by inductive hypothesis is equvalent to $2^{p-1}$. Am I allowed to make this sort of trucations? Is there a more elegant way to deal with "impossible values"? Edit. Added my attempt at the proof below. The step I am not sure about is in bold. $n=0$ : $\sum_{k=0}^{k=0} \binom{0}{k} = \frac{0!}{0!0!}= 1 = 2^0$ $n=p-1$ assume: $2^{p-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k}$ $n=p$ : $\sum_{k=0}^{k=p} \binom{p}{k} = \sum_{k=0}^{k=p} \binom{p-1}{k-1} + \sum_{k=0}^{k=p} \binom{p-1}{k} = $ by setting $z=k-1$ and because $\binom{p-1}{p}$ is undefined ( $z=-1$ and $k=p$ "dissapear" ) $=\sum_{z=0}^{z=p-1} \binom{p-1}{z} + \sum_{k=0}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k} = $ by inductive hypothesis $= 2^{p-1} + 2^{p-1} = 2^{p}$ (Q.E.D.) Edit2. Neat solution to the final step (based on Charles Eliot's comment) is: $n=p$ : $\sum_{k=0}^{k=p} \binom{p}{k} = 1+1+\sum_{k=1}^{k=p-1} \binom{p}{k} = 1+1+\sum_{k=1}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k-1} + \sum_{k=1}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k} = 1+\sum_{k-1=0}^{k-1=p-2} \binom{p-1}{k-1} + 1+\sum_{k=1}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k} = \sum_{k-1=0}^{k-1=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k-1} + \sum_{k=0}^{k=p-1} \binom{p-1}{k}= 2^{p-1} + 2^{p-1} = 2^{p}$ (Q.E.D.)
