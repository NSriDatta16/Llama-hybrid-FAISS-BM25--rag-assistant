you could group already in the database. or sort by section and then iterate through and output the proper seperation code when the section changes. a temporary array is also a solution. given your example code maby this can point you in one possible directino (altough the temporary array is of course not an elegant solution but if the data is not that much it doesnt really matter) 'php','note' => 'bla'); $result[] = array('section' => 'php','note' => 'bla'); $result[] = array('section' => 'perl','note' => 'bla'); $result[] = array('section' => 'java','note' => 'bla'); $grouped = array(); for($i=0;$i
