I had to build web-based a pension remediation system to allow a pension fund to pay out 30m within a short period. It was extremely data-enty/data-query intensive, involved a significant number of records, and browsing for historical data decades into the past. The end users were quite happy with the resulting app, and the firm thought it was the best project they ever executed. I think the secret is to hold a good JAD session and build the UI that the users actually need. Sometimes the management is the wrong place to start for designing the app, you need to start with the actual clerk doing the work. Inculcating this into the mind of the management is a feat, but once you can convince them that all they need is to focus on the reports, not the data entry, you've won most of the battle. My experience with the actual person doing the data entry is that they honestly don't care about the technology, what they dread is yet another "improved" system that actually drags down their efficiency. If they can be convinced that the software that we build will make them work faster and better, they will be on board. Of course, we just need to ensure that we truly understand what the end user really wants in the UI, and the system overall.
