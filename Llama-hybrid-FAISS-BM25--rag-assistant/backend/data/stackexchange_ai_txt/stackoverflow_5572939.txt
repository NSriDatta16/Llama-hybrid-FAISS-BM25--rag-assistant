The stark theme out-of-the-box doesn't show submenuus in it's main menu either (2011/04). If you however go to admin/structure/blocks, and drag the menu block to the header region in the stark theme, it has submenus. You'll also have two menus then, the original one without submenus and the new one with submenus. You can disable the original one in admin/appearance/stark/settings. $2c, *-pike
