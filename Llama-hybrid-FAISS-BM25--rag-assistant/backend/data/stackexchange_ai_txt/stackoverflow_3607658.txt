Is there a standard way to convert from container to container ?

I have two classes A and B , and an implicit conversion operator exists to go from one to the other, so that: A a; B b; b = a; // Works Is there a standard way to convert a std::list to a std::list ? (Or even from std::vector to a std::list ). I know I can iterate trough to the list and build the second list item by item, but I wonder if there is a more elegant solution. Unfortunately I cannot use boost but out of curiosity as a bonus question, if boost can handle this, I'd be happy to know how too.
