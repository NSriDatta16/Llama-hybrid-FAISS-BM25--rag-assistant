How do I examine the configuration of a remote git repository?

I've got a git-svn clone of an svn repo, and I want to encourage my colleagues to look at git as an option. The problem is that cloning the repo out of svn takes 3 days, but cloning from my git instance takes 10 minutes. I've got a script that will allow people to clone my git repo and re-point it at the original SVN, but it requires knowing how I set some of my config values. I'd prefer the script be able to pull those values over the wire.
