Create a favicon for a link that is JavaScript?

I have a link on my site that is strictly JavaScript, that the users can optionally drag to their browser's link bar. Because there is no associated site with a Favicon, the link always gets a blank icon. Is there anyway to associate a Favicon with it at the time the user drags it? I am primarily interested in a Firefox solution, but IE would be nice, too.
