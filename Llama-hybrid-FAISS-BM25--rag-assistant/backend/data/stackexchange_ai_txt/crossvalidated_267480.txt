ARIMA model with extremely small estimated $\sigma^2$ in log-transformed data

I analyzed a time series data set using ARIMA model. And if I fit an ARIMA model using the original data, the estimated $\sigma^2$ is in the normal range, say 100. But when fit the same model using the log-transformed data, the estimated $\sigma^2$ becomes extremely small, say 0.00001. Note that the variance of the original data is about 8000 and the variance of the log-transformed data is 0.002. Is this normal? If so, how can I make prediction intervals using the model based on log-transformed data (because the se is so small)?
