With Hannanâ€“Rissanen (1982) algorithm to fit parameters for an ARIMA model you actually always do an AR regression as first step, even for an pure MA model: AR(m) model (with $m > max(p, q)$ ) is fitted to the data Compute error terms for all $t$ : $\epsilon_t$ = $y_t - \hat{y}_t$ Regress $y_t$ on $y^{(d)}_{t-1},..,y^{(d)}_{t-p},\epsilon_{t-1},...,\epsilon_{t-q}$ (For a pure MA model the regression would be done only against the error terms $\epsilon_{t-1},...,\epsilon_{t-q}$ ) To improve accurancy optionally regress again with updated model parameters $\phi,\theta$ from step 3 So your suspicion that one needs some kind of model first, before one can compute the error part can be converted into an iterative algorithm for fitting the parameters of an ARIMA model.
