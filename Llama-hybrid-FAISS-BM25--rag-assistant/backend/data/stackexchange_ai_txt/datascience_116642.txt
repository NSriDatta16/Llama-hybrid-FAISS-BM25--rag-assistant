What are MLM and NSP models actually used for after they've been trained?

I am a Python programmer working with deep learning nets and I have recently built my own language models as well as I have fine-tuned popular models like BERT. MY question is - after these models have been successfully trained, what are they used for? I understand that masked-language models can predict what the masked word is, but what is the point? What is a real-world application of this model? The same question goes for next-sentence prediction models - what is a real-world application? Thank you.
