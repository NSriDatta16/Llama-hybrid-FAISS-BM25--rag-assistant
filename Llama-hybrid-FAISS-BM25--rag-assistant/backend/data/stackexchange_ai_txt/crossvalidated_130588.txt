I think you have two options to consider if you do not want to go with Time Series like ARIMA. The first one is Generalized Linear Models, which is basically a linear regression that allows you to characterize the residuals with other distributions other than Normal. This includes lots of methods such as Ridge Regression, LASSO, and Automatic Relevance Determination Regression. The second is Exponential smoothing where you average out the smooth out the previous set of data. This includes Holt winters (for trends), Brown model, and there is also a dampened model for things like growth and decay. Not sure if this helps but you can also put prediction bands on data or use something like GARCH to have a range for your predictions.
