No, a prediction interval need not contain the mean. I think some of your confusion might be mixing prediction intervals and confidence intervals. While the goal of a prediction interval is to contain with some certainty future values of the random variable, the goal of a confidence interval is to contain the true mean of distribution. As you mentioned in highly skewed distributions these ideas seem to be at odds with each other. The important thing is to recognize the value in each of the statistics provided. The predictive value of the mean is: 1) Cumulative: As more samples come in, their average will tend toward the true mean. So if the cumulative value is of interest (for instance, if you're gambling and dealing with winnings or losses you're interested in cumulative effects) then the mean is very useful. 2) Minimizes Squared Residuals: While squared residuals are a somewhat arbitrary quantity of interest it is worthwhile to know what your prediction is minimizing. If however your goal is to minimize the absolute error in your predictions, the mean forecasted value of 6,000,000 is not what I would go with.
