Can anyone offer advice on how I can continue to work on this web project without eating too much of the cost myself? Transparency and communication are your best tools. If your clients can't understand why something that once took a week now takes three weeks, you need to be able to explain better. Depending on the client's area of expertise, you may be able to find a metaphor that resonates with them - trying to build a Prius on a Model T frame, say, or trying to write War and Peace with a typewriter with no vowels. Don't be ashamed of your honest estimates, and don't be bullied. And share with your customer as much as they can bear about your process and the obstacles you face - you may even find that they have some worthy suggestions. With respect to the issue of technical debt - and I agree that this is the underlying problem - TDD will take you far, as will the frequent refactoring that broad test coverage permits. Think about what design would have permitted all your changes easily - and work toward that design, incrementally, with tests and refactoring. Maybe you have to eat the costs of that, because the functionality is all already paid for. But, looking forward, include costs for refactoring in your estimates - and don't think of it as padding. Padding is (arguably) dishonest; maintaining the design of your code to accommodate future changes is an honest requirement of your work.
