Android state file does not find dpi dependent drawable

I have a state file for buttons which worked fine until I put drawables into res/drawable-mdpi . I had only drawable in res/drawable-hdpi but I want the app to work on all displays. The state file is placed in res/drawable as I read it on some websites. That way it is also done by google with the standard drawables but Ecplise keeps telling me that it can't find drawable with value @drawable/button_normal . The drawables are definitely at their places. So what am I doing wrong here?
