If your server is getting noticeably slower in your busy season it may be because of saturation rather than anything inefficent in the database. Basic queuing theory tells us that a server gets hyperbolically slower as it approaches saturation. The basic relationship is 1/(1-X) where X is the proportion of load. This describes the average queue length or time to wait before being served. Therefore a server that is getting saturated will slow down very rapidly when the load spikes. A server that is 25% loaded will have an average service time of 1.333K for some constant K (loosely, K is the time for the machine to perform one transaction). A server that is 50% loaded will have an average service time of 2K and a server that is 90% loaded will have an average service time of 10K. Given that the slowdowns are hyperbolic in nature, it often doesn't take a large change in overall load to produce a significant degradation in response time. Obviously this is somewhat simplistic as the server will be processing multiple requests concurrently (there are more elaborate queuing models for this situation), but the broad principle still applies. So, if your server is experiencing transient loads that are saturating it, you will experience patches of noticeable slow-down. Note that these slow-downs need only be in one bottlenecked area of the system to slow the whole process down. If you are only experiencing this now in a busy season there is a possibility that your server has simply hit a constraint on a resource, rather than being particularly slow or inefficient. Note that this possibility is not antithetical to the possibility of inefficiencies in the code. You may find that the way to ease the bottleneck is to tune some of your queries. In order to tell if the system is bottlenecked, start gathering profiling information. If you can find resources with a large number of waits, this should give you a good starting point. The final possibility is that you need to upgrade your server. If there are no major inefficiencies in the code (this might well be the case if profiling doesn't indicate any disproportionately large bottlenecks) you may simply need bigger hardware. I have no idea what your volumes are, but don't discount the possibility that you may have outgrown your server.
