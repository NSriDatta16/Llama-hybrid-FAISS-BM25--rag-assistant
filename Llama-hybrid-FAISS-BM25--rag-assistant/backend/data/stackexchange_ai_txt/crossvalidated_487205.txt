Determine whether an error is random?

We have two measurements of the temperature of the same object as: $T_1 = 46 \pm 2 F$ and $T_2 = 58 \pm 6 F$ . Normally, the agreement between the measurements could shown to a standard deviation by taking their average: $52 \pm \sqrt{36+4}$ . What would the best approach to determine whether the disagreement is due to random measurement error and not to physical change in the object's actual temperature ? Is this best explained in terms of probabilities? Please explain.
