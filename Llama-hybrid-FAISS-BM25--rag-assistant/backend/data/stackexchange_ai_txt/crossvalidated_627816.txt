To partially answer question 1, you could look at this paper: Park, J., Müller, J., Arora, B. et al. Long-term missing value imputation for time series data using deep neural networks. Neural Comput & Applic 35, 9071–9091 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-022-08165-6 The authors write: We assume that the target time series variable has one large gap and that the supporting variables that explain the target variable are fully observed. and Unlike the referenced studies, the main contribution of our work is a method for filling a long continuous gap (e.g., multiple continuous months of missing daily observations) in a single variable of a multivariate time series dataset. Another key difference between the previous studies and our research is the size of the datasets used. Our focus is on smaller datasets that have fewer variables than the cited works. Usually, these types of datasets are hard to use and tend to be discarded in analysis and modeling efforts. Our approach would enable greater use of time series datasets that have multi-year gaps in a variable, which are common in many long-term environmental monitoring observations.
