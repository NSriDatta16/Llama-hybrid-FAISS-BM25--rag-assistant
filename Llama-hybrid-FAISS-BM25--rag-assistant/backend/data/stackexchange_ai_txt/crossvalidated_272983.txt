Have you looked at this paper? A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02216 ) For the sparsity, a few works I have known use time index as an additional input to the RNN (such as Recurrent Recommenders Networks ( http://alexbeutel.com/papers/rrn_wsdm2017.pdf )). Not sure if these suggestions will work for you, but at least you can try.
