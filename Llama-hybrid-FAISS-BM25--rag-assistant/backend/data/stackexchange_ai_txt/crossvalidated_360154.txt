Predictive Mean Matching as Single Imputation?

Multiple imputation is known to be advantageous compared to single imputation. However, in practice there are often non-statistical reasons why multiple imputation can not be used (e.g. the data recipient isn't educated enough to deal with multiple data sets; the boss of a company doesn't want it; ...). Predictive mean matching (PMM) is a bayesian imputation method that is known to be one of the best imputation methods, when multiple imputation can be applied. Now, I am wondering whether PMM could also be used as single imputation method, when multiple imputation is not possible. Consider the following example: You have a typical data set including a continous variable (e.g. income / age) with missing values. The data can be imputed only once (single imputation). You have to choose between typical single imputation methods (e.g. stochastic regression imputation / hot deck imputation) OR predictive mean matching. Illustration in R: # Create some example data set.seed(95159) # Seed N The simplified example doesn't reveal a substantial difference between stochastic regression imputation and single predictive mean matching. However, in more complex data scenarios (e.g. heteroscedastic data), predictive mean matching is usually advantageous. Question: If multiple imputation can not be used, is there any reason, why single predictive mean matching should not be used instead of typical single imputation methods such as stochastic regression imputation?
