I think Tarpey's logic and yours go astray by confusing frequentist and Bayesian notions of probability. Under frequentist conceptions, which are the context of confidence intervals, probability isn't epistemic; it's the limiting frequency of a random process. The confidence of a 95% confidence-interval construction procedure (that is, a lower bound for the probability that intervals constructed by the procedure will contain the true value for which they are constructed) is 95% regardless of who you are, what you know, and how much data has been collected. Importantly, the probability belongs to the procedure that constructs the confidence interval, rather than any individual interval. If you want an interval that really does have a 95% probability of containing a population value, and you're ready to adopt the Bayesian, epistemic view of probability that's necessary for this, you want not a confidence interval but a credible interval. Importantly, a 95% confidence interval need not also be a 95% credible interval .
