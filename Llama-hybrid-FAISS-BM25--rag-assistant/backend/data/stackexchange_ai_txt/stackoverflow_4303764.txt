How to format/indent output of an XSL Transformation

I am trying to output a fragment of html code. But I need it to be pretty-printed/indented. Is there any way to do this without using &#xa; and &#9; ? I have used the following line without any results. Follwoing is the c# code; XslCompiledTransform XSLT = new XslCompiledTransform(); XSLT.Load(xslPath); using (XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter(writePath, null)) { if (isTopLevel) { XSLT.Transform(XMLDocumentForCurrentUser, writer); } else { XsltArgumentList xslArg = new XsltArgumentList(); xslArg.AddParam("MenuIndex", "", menuIndex); XSLT.Transform(XMLDocumentForCurrentUser, xslArg, writer); } } // I write the output to file //All this works fine, only now I need the HTML to be readable (in the browser's view source or any notepad) Does anybody know of a way to format(atleast indent) XSLT output?
