How to drop controls onto a panel in a user control?

I have created a UserControl that has 3 panels. What I what to do is expose one of the panels to the Visual Studio designer so you can drop controls inside that panel. Currently I have the UserControl on a form but dragging say a text box over it will have the text box paint over the UserControl and not be a part of the user control.
