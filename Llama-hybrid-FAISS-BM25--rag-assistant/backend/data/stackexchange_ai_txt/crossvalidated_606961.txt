Numeric categorical variables as factors or one hot encoded before using random forest?

I am performing a random forest model in R using caret = rf method. I have 20 explanatory variables and most are continuous but a few are categorical and numeric. For example, there are 6 categories of soil drainage coded as 1-6 class = integer. Before running the model I converted these categorical variables to factors using as.factor(). df1000 Should this type of variable (nominal categorical) be one-hot encoded instead?
