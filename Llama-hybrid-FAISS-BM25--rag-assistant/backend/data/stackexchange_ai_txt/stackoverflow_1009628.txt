Are you talking actual drag-drop operation here, or when the user moves the form? If it is the movement itself, you might be able to use the ResizeBegin event, which is raised when the user starts to move the form. This together with LocationChanged and ResizeEnd should cover your needs. However, the ResizeBegin and ResizeEnd events are (of course) also raised when you start and end resizing the form, not only when you are moving it.
