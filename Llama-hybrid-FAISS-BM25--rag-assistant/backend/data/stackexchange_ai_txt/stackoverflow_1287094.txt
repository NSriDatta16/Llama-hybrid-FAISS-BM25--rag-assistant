There is a result transformer for this, see the documentation. Quote: Note that the kittens collections held by the Cat instances returned by the previous two queries are not pre-filtered by the criteria! If you wish to retrieve just the kittens that match the criteria, you must use SetResultTransformer(CriteriaUtil.AliasToEntityMap) . IList cats = sess.CreateCriteria(typeof(Cat)) .CreateCriteria("Kittens", "kt") .Add( Expression.Eq("Name", "F%") ) .SetResultTransformer(CriteriaUtil.AliasToEntityMap) .List(); You could also use filters that get activated using session.EnableFilter(name) . There is a similar question here .
