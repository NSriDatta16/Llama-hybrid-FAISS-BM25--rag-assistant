stationary distribution of a markov chain

I am trying to find all the stationary distributions of the $3\times 3$ transition matrix below. because of the third state, the chain isn't irreducible however that isn't a sufficient condition for there not to be a stationary distribution. I have used $\pi\mathbb{P}=\pi$ to work out $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ but I fail to get a solution even with the knowledge that $\pi_1+\pi_2+\pi_3=1.$ I am not sure where I am going wrong. $$\mathbb{P}=\pmatrix{ 0.4 & 0.6 &0\\ 0.2 & 0.8 &0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\ }$$ solving the three simultaneous equations, I get $\pi_1=1/3\pi_2$ and $\pi_3=1-2/3\pi_2$ i don't know where to go from there the fact that the third state is an absorbing state not connected to the other two states is why i have come to a dead end but i am not sure how to find the stationary distribution
