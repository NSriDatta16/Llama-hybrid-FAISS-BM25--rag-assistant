Can interaction estimates be affected by a total number of events

I am testing the interaction of two dummy variables, say Var1 and Var2 in a set of cancers. For each cancer type I want to model the number of response events Y : Y ~ NB(Var1 + Var2 + Var3 + Var1:Var2 + offsetVar) Var2 here stratifies labels of different cancers, for example, when I am looking at ovarian cancer Var2 = "1" for cases where data comes from ovarian cancer patients and Var2 = "0" for non-ovarian. Var3 is needed to control for confounding variable and offsetVar is used to be able to control for the maximal number of events Y that could have happened. Regression is performed separately for each cancer. In the end, I would like to answer a question, if there any cancer-type-specific input in the frequencies of Y and what is their effect size. Therefore, I have to look at the coefficients before Var1:Var2 variable. I have a different amount of data available for different cancers - however, I don't expect the interaction term to be dependent on this but rather on some intrinsic features of different cancers. However, after I perform a PCA on the set of coefficients where rows are cancer types and columns are coefficient estimates for different genes I have first PC (~ 50% of variance) and the order of cancers along this PC is matching the ordering by a total number of Y events per cancer type. If I understand everything correctly, this shouldn't be happening. If you have any idea of what is going on, I would be very happy to hear it.
