I'm not sure I understand your question correctly, but... I have a property bag of generic objects and would like to have the retrieval delegated to a generic method. ... sounds like you're looking for information on "double-dispatching"? Imagine you have three classes: abstract class A {} class B extends A {} class C extends A {} And two methods to do something with objects of type B and C: void DoSomething(B obj) {} void DoSomething(C obj) {} The problem is that when all you have is a variable of static type A...: A a = new B(); ... you cannot call DoSomething(a) because at compile time only its static type (A) is known, so the compiler cannot decide if it should call method DoSomething(B obj) or DoSomething(C obj). This is where double dispatching comes in. Some languages support it out of the box, others like C++, C# and Java don't. But you can implement it yourself in these languages as well. For an example see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch And: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern
