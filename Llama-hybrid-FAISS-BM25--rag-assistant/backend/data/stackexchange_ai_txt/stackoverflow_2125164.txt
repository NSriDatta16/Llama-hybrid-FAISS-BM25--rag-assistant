Hudson build failed using Python & Coverage

I completed this tutorial from Joe Heck to set up Hudson for Python . Everything worked perfectly except the Coverage section. My build failed with this output: [workspace] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/hudson6222564272447222496.sh + coverage run tests/run.py --with-xunit You must specify at least one of -e, -x, -c, -r, or -a. I tried to include the Execute argument, -x, but got an exception that was ultimately caused by a permissions failure: IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'nosetests.xml' Has anyone gotten Coverage working successfully with Hudson ?
