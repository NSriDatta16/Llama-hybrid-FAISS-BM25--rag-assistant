Multivariate Logistic Regression in R or SAS

I was wondering whether there is a specific procedure in either R or SAS which can handle binary correlated data (multivariate logistic regression). More specifically I have a sample of 400 individuals who have selected their food likes among a variety of available options (binary). Also the participants indicated their age, whether they are active or not and their gender. The food options were: pizza, salad, cheese cake and juices. I wanted to know whether there is a procedure in either R or SAS which can explore the correlations between the food options among different demographics for prediction modeling purposes (e.g. younger males who are active and like salad tend to like juices as well).
