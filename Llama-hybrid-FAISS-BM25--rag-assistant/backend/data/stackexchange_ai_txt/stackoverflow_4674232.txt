I received this error when I built my Ajax request in a "hacky" way, echoing the contents directly instead of sending them out through the layout. Once I sent them out through the layout, the errors disappeared. See my own question here: Best way to output ajax data from a Magento Admin Extension props to @alan for his answer to my question.
