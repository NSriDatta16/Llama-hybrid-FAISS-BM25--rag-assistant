What is "query writer, new query in SQL Server Management Studio Express

Using: SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2008, C# website asp.net Okay, I have always used SQL Server 2005 Express and its Management Studio as a host and a design interface to create tables from design view only. All the queries, transaction, retrieval and anything needed during run time of the website is done using Visual Studio 2008 sql "connection open, then form command statement, and execute reader etc its all done using Visual Studio 08 c#" So I was wondering that there is a query writer thing in SQL Server Management Studio Express. What is it for ? can it be used in place of vs08 c# queries? how to call it from web sites c#? can it use for variables queries like where id = @input etc Please provide links to tutorials which explain how to use SQL Server studio and Visual Studio 2008 together I searched the net but cannot find the answer
