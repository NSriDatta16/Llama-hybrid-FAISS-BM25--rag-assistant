I think your data access pattern is fine. What you are not doing is coupling your BLL to the OracleDAL. You are coupling to the DAL interfaces. A certain bit of coupling is absolutely required or you could never get anything done. I assume that your DataFactory and the INewsItemRepository classes exist outside your DAL Layer. The following is an example of how my solutions are organized. I don't use ActiveRecord, so this may not suit you perfectly. Core (Project) Domain Business Entities Data Repository Interfaces **Your DataFactory** OracleData (Project) Data Oracle Repository Implementations SqlData (Project) Data Sql Repository Implementations UI (Project) Hope this helps.
