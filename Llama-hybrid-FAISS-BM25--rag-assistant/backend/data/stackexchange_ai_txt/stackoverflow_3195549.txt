Typically, Lua is the better choice for embedding into another project. Python is better as a standalone platform because the library support is so much broader. See Lua Versus Python for more details. Personally, I use both very frequently depending on the job at hand. I always use Lua for embedding into C/C++ applications or scripting functionality that is imported from C/C++ shared libraries (i.e. a DLL). Python is always my first choice for standalone tasks that do not require low-level C/C++ code.
