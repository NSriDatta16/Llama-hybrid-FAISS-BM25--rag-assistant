Since that wasn't mentioned here, I'll briefly go over the method I have been using rather successfully on a moderately visited forum. Note, that I will only explain the basic idea. There are several variations that can be implemented to make automated spam even harder. What I do is this: Introduce some constant as salt. This constant is unique to your site and it's supposed to be a secret. Use the remote IP, user agent, hour of the day (note that this can make it fail if the hour switches in between requesting and sending the form) and similar data to calculate a salted hash (MD5, SHA1) ... another input to it is the original field name of the forum element (e.g. email , name , ...) so that each field name is now computed per client. I prepend some letter or similar to make sure the name doesn't start with a digit, which can cause problems. User sends the form. Receiving script has the same input data (i.e. it does not have to be sent via the form or so). After the receiving script uses the same method as in 2., it can evaluate the form data and take respective action. Again, this can be combined with other means. But the unique salt will allow this to be widely used - different salt values make it impossible to predict the field name easily, even if the method to compute the hash is known. Other means will have to be used to disguise the respective form input elements if the spammers get smart, though (i.e. if they don't just look for the name of the field). It's simple, 100% screen-reader-compatible (i.e. usable even for blind people) and worked wonders for me. It cut down tremendously on spam in a forum I manage. Hope it'll help you, too.
