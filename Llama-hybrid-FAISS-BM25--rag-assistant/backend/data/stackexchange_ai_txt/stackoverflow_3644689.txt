"Win32 DLLs are mapped into the address space of the calling process. By default, each process using a DLL has its own instance of all the DLLs global and static variables. If your DLL needs to share data with other instances of it loaded by other applications, you can use either of the following approaches: •Create named data sections using the data_seg pragma. •Use memory mapped files. See the Win32 documentation about memory mapped files." http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h90dkhs0(VS.80).aspx You cannot share pointers between processes, they only make sense to the process that alloc'd it. You're likely to run into issues.
