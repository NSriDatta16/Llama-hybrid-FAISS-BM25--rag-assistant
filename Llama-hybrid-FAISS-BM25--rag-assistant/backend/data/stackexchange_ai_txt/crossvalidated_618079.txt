How to analyse this plot?

How to interpret this fitted vs data(actual) plot? My data is time series and there are many observations for the y variable for one year. How to analyse it if my data is a time series? This is a multiple linear regression model. I am confused on how to analyse it. So, this is my time series linear model. My objective is to find the variable that has the most influence on the life expectancy. So, I was told to do this fitted vs actual data plot. But, I do not know how to analyze it. This is the correlation heat map. This is how my data looks like, that's y I have 756 observations. My original data Then, I categorised the age variable. Then, I made age >60 to be the baseline (1). And another thing is, the entries for female and male is the same. Same goes for race variable.
