Inference for the average treatment effect for Bernoulli trial

In the book of Imbens and Rubin, they discuss four common classes of assignment mechanisms that fit into this framework: Bernoulli trials, completely randomized experiments, stratified randomized experiments, and pairwise randomized experiments. Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 are then for completely randomized experiments. Chapter 9 and 10 are for the last two experiments, respectively. This makes me curious, why the book does not discuss inference for the Bernoulli trials. The following might be the reason. One common disadvantage of Bernoulli trials is that, because of the independence of the assignment across all units, there is always a positive probability (although small even in modest samples, and essentially zero in large samples) that all units will receive the same treatment. In that case, there will be no evidence in the data about the potential outcome values under the treatment that is not represented in the data. Even when there is a single unit being assigned one treatment and many assigned the other treatment, there will be limited evidence about the potential outcomes under the former treatment. However, If I am correct, these are reasons why this Bernoulli randomization is not common in practice (In contrast, some papers suggests that Bernoulli trial (also simple randomization) can be used when sample size is 200 or more). But do the reasons also prevent making inference for the average treatment effect?
