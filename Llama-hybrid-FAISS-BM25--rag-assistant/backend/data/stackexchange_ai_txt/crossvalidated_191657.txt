How to compute the variances of PCA-transformed variables?

In principal component analysis (PCA), what is the covariance matrix in the new space of reduced dimensionality, i.e. the covariance matrix after multiplying the data by the eigenvector matrix? I know it should be a diagonal matrix because they are orthogonal, but what is the formula to calculate the variances (or the whole covariance matrix)?
