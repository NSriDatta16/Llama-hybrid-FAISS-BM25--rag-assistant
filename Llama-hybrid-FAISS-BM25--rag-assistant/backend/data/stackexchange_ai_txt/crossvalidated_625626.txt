You have a binary response ( osteophytes ), for which logistic regression is a good general approach. You have non-independence due to multiple measurements on the same participant and multiple measurements by the same examiner . The non-independence due to participants can be addressed well using mixed-model s, also known as hierarchical models. Since you have only 4 examiners, which is a rather low number of levels for a random effect, you may want to include examiner as a fixed effect instead. You will need to consider whether including a device x examiner interaction is a good idea or not. You are primarily interested in establishing that the cheaper device is not worse i.e. establishing non-inferiority . This can be done with logistic regression, and we have some info at this thread: Noninferiority Using Logistic Regression . So, use a mixed-effects logistic regression with a random effect for participant. Then check for non-inferiority of the cheaper device.
