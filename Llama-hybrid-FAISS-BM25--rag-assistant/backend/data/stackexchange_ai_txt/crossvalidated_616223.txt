What is wrong with my coefficient's standard error?

I am running an ordered logistic regression for my thesis. I am trying to test the relationship between counterterrorism aid and state repression levels in recipient countries. I ran my regression, and for my first model, my International War control variable has a coefficient-value of 38.007 and a very large standard error value (158,641,489.000). This seems very wrong to me, but I do not know what the problem is. The independent variable of International War is binary 0 = the given country was not part of an international war in the given year, 1 = the given country was part of an international war in the given year. the dependent variable is ordinal, ranges from 0 to 2. O meaning there were many state sponsored disappearances and 2 there were none. Does anyone know how this is possible and what it means? Did I do something wrong with my data?
