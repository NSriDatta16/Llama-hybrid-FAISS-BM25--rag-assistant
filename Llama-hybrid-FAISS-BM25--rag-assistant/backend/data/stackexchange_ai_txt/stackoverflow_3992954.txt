better jUnit test coverage needed

Good evening everyone Suppose your code has the following statement: if (string ends with char 'y') { if ((char before last is not 'e') || (char before last is not 'a')) { return (something awesome); } } So that's simple enough i thought ... Test1: input = "xy" (last char is y, char before last is not e or a) Result - partial coverage ... What other tests i am missing? If this was and && instead of ||, i suppose test would be far easier, but || confused me a bit. Can you suggest Test2,3,n? Thank you
