Rejection Sampling: the bound and the implementation with R

I've been reading about rejection sampling for Bayesian Statistics, and I have the following example: Given $y\sim N(\theta,1)$ , $p(\theta)\sim Cauchy(0,1)$, $q(\theta |y)=p(\theta |y)p(\theta )$, $g(\theta )\sim N(y,1)$ and y=1 Then, the example says: $\frac { q(\theta |y) }{ g(\theta ) } =\frac { exp\left\{ -\frac { { (y-\theta ) }^{ 2 } }{ 2 } \right\} \cdot \frac { 1 }{ 1+{ \theta }^{ 2 } } }{ \frac { 1 }{ \sqrt { 2\pi } } exp\left\{ -\frac { { (\theta -y) }^{ 2 } }{ 2 } \right\} } =\frac { \sqrt { 2\pi } }{ 1+{ \theta }^{ 2 } } \le \sqrt { 2\pi }$ $ \\ $ I understand almost everything, but the last step is not so clear for me (the inequality), because according that, $M=\sqrt { 2\pi } \\$ But I read the following definition: $M=\underset { \theta }{ sup } \quad \frac { q(\theta |y) }{ g(\theta ) } $, and I think $M=\frac{\sqrt { 2\pi } }{2}$ My second doubt is about the implementation Of this example with R. Assuming the first M, I use the following code th Am I implementing it in the correct way? Is it correct my histogram of the posterior? I
