In addition to what Himanshu Rai said, Deep learning is a subfield which involves the use of neural networks.These neural networks try to learn the underlying distribution by modifying the weights between the layers. Now, consider the case of image recognition using deep learning: a neural network model is divided among layers, these layers are connected by links called weights, as the training process begins, these layers adjust the weights such that each layer tries to detect some feature and help the next layer for its processing.The key point to note is we don't explicitly tell the layer to learn to detect edges, or eyes, nose or faces.The model learns to do that itself.Unlike classical machine learning models.
