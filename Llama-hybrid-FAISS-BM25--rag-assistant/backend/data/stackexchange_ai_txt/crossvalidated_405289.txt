Estimating death based on repeating sequence?

Currently I'm working on a project, and I reading up on Survival Regression with Coxâ€™s proportional hazard model, which looks like it will work to answer the questions I want to ask. My issue is that my data is not in the duration / event form, and I'm not sure how to convert it into this form. For simplicity sake let's say I'm recording repeat customers who visit my shop, now I know two things about them, I know when visit and I know when they don't. They haven't "signed up" to be my customers and when they stop shopping with me they don't "unsubscribe", and I want to create a metric that determines the likelyhood that a customer will continue to shop with me. How can I determine a "death" event without a death event, do I factor in an average shopping interval? If they don't return within their standard deviation I count them as "dead?" If someone has shopped within a month do I automatically count them as alive and right-censor them?
