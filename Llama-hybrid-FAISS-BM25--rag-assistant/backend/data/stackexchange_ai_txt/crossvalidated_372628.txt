How many sunrises are worth observing?

The one-sun version of Laplace's sunrise problem provides a Bayesian argument that, if on all $n$ mornings in recorded history the Sun has risen, its probability of doing so tomorrow is $\frac{n+1}{n+2}$ . In fact, if the Sun rises on a proportion $p$ of mornings, the Bayesian prior $p\sim U(0,\,1)$ becomes a Bayesian posterior $p\sim \operatorname{B}(k+1,\,n-k+1)$ if $k$ of $n$ mornings had sunrises. So if we consider an event we can seriously imagine only happens sometimes (but I'll talk of morning sunrises for convenience), $n$ data change our estimate of $p$ 's distribution from a uniform distribution to a Beta distribution. In theory, we get more confident with every new observation. Returning to the simple case $k=0$ , the probability $\frac{n+1}{n+2}=\mathbb{E}p$ gets slightly larger as $n$ increases. However, some kinds of sunrises take real effort to monitor, e.g. "electrons will always spiral left in this magnetic field". There comes a point where it's not worth checking again. In theory, one could defend this with the solution of an optimisation problem. For example, if we discount the increase $\frac{n+1}{n+2}-\frac12$ in $\mathbb{E}p$ with a $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ factor to represent the cost of reducing empirical standard errors, we're left with the question of which $n$ maximises $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(\frac{n+1}{n+2}-\frac12)$ . The answer's $n=2$ , by the way, but I'm sure this isn't the right or standard way to do this. Can we quantify in terms of some trade-off the optimum amount of data to gather? In other words, do what I just did above, but... probably some more sensible choice of the utility function. Also, I really struggled with the choice of tags for this question, so I'd appreciate better ones if there are any.
