Should I normalize all data prior feeding the neural network models?

My understanding is most of the tutorials recommend normalizing / scaling the data prior feeding the tensorflow models. Doesn't normalization require that data conforms to the normal parametric distribution? What good is a non-linear model if scaling / normalizing is a pre-requisite prior using the non-linear model such as tensorflow? So back to the question, should I always normalize / scale my data prior feeding my tensorflow models?
