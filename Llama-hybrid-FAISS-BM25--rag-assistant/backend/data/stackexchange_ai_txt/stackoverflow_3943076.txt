I agree with fudgey about using live (delegate isn't an option in 1.3.2) if possible. If your plugin doesn't support that though (which I'm guessing it doesn't since it's not working), you can pass a function to .load that will run when the content is loaded. Here you will want to hook up these new elements to your plugin. For example, so for instance say you wanted to use draggable from jQuery UI on all divs inside content , you might do $(document).ready(function() { var init = function(){ $("#content div").draggable(); }; init(); setInterval(function(){ $("#content").load("load_contents.php", init) },20000); }); If you do this with your tooltip plugin and whatever else, you are reloading into content, it should work. Be careful to call the init method only on content within #content so you don't end up adding tooltips twice to other areas. Using a plugin that uses delegate (upgrade to latest jQuery) or live will avoid having to do the selection and rebind each time you add elements, making for faster reloads.
