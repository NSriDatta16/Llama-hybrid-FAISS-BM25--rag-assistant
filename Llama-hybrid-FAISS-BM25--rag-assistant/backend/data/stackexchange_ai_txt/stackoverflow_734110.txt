Persistent data structures in Java

Does anyone know a library or some at least some research on creating and using persistent data structures in Java? I don't refer to persistence as long term storage but persistence in terms of immutability (see Wikipedia entry ). I'm currently exploring different ways to model an api for persistent structures. Using builders seems to be a interesting solution: // create persistent instance Person p = Builder.create(Person.class) .withName("Joe") .withAddress(Builder.create(Address.class) .withCity("paris") .build()) .build(); // change persistent instance, i.e. create a new one Person p2 = Builder.update(p).withName("Jack"); Person p3 = Builder.update(p) .withAddress(Builder.update(p.address()) .withCity("Berlin") .build) .build(); But this still feels somewhat boilerplated. Any ideas?
