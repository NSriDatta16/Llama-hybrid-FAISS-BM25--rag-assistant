The behaviour is indeed simpler to reproduce with more data points. Reproducing an example similar to that in the follow-up comment to my first reply: library(CausalImpact) total.points With the default tuning parameters (argument model.args ), the CausalImpact fit mainly explains the time series with a strong random walk component and little noise superimposed. The prediction bands displayed in the post-intervention period reflect this fit by being narrow in the beginning and becoming broader later on. Fit and prediction bands are "valid", but probably not the best model fit given the knowledge about the time series. One can force CausalImpact to attribute the fluctuations to noise rather than signal by adjusting the prior for the random walk component: impact Note that the two plots look very similar when the models are fitted without any regressors at all. This shows that CausalImpact does not wrongly learn from the independent time series x2 : the factor accounting for the tight fits is the random walk component, not the regressor. When using the useful regressor x1 instead of x2 , the fit is also tight in the pre-intervention period, but it does not get as wide in the post-intervention period.
