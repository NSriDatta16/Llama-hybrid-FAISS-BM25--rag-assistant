Tim's answer is a great way to handle things if you have the ability to run the initial query in a second thread and the logic (paging / sorting / filtering) to be applied to the results requires action on the server ..... otherwise .... If you can use AJAX, a 500 row result set could be called into the page and paged or sorted on the client. This can lead to some really interesting features .... check out the datagrid solutions from jQueryUI and Dojo for inspiration! And for really intensive features like arbitrary regex filters and drag-and-drop column re-ordering you can totally free the server. Loading the data to the browser all at once also lets you call in supporting data (page previews etc) as the user "requests" them .... The main issue is limiting the data you return per result to what you'll actually use for your sorts and filters. The possibilities are endless :)
