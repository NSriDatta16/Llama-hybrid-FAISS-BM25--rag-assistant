Your code is working just fine. Its just that modern day webservers won't allow you to connect without properly authenticating yourself, using user-agen, headers etc. Try the following commands on your shell. telnet yourserver.com 80 GET /index.html HTTP/1.0 If the response is same as what you get using C++ program, then basically all you need to do is send more info to properly authenticate yourself. user_agent = 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT)' headers = {'User-Agent': user_agent} And send this data along with your GET request.
