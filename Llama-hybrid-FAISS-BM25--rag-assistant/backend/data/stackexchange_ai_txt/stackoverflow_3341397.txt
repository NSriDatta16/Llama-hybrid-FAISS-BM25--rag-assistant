The elements in the DOM are just objects themselves, organised into a tree structure, so they have next and previous siblings at the same level, their own list of children, a parent. From this you can walk around the structure of the tree and manipulate it. You can obtain the object(s) inside a jQuery object by using indexing notation: var caption = $('#caption'); var domElement = caption[0]; Then domElement will contain one of these .
