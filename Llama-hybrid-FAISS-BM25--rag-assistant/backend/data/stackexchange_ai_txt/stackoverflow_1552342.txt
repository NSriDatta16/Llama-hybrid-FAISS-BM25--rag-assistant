MAGENTO getting the descriptions from a sub category

Hi I'm new to magento and have been trying to set up a static block that displays a list of sub categories within a category. I've been succesfull a grabbing the sub-category images and names, but for some reason I can't seem to get the descriptions to show. Here's the code can't anyone explain why it won't work and how I can fix it? I've commented out a few lines because I was trying different things to get it to work. helper('catalog/output'); $category = $this->getCurrentCategory(); getCurrentChildCategories(); ?> $this->htmlEscape($_category->getCategoryDescription());?> getIsActive()): ?> getURL() ?>" title="htmlEscape($_category->getName()) ?>"> " */ ?> getURL() ?>" title="htmlEscape($_category->getName()) ?>">htmlEscape($_category->getName()) ?> getURL() ?>" class="moreLink">[MORE...] getDescription() ?>--> getDescription()): ?> categoryAttribute($_category, $_description, 'description'); ?> -->
