How to reference XIB files from a parent XIB

If I create a custom UIView in ChildView.xib - how do I reference that from MainWindow.xib? I tried to drag a UIView to MainWindow.xib and associate it with the same ChildView class. I made the ChildView.xib's owner a ViewController from the MainWindow.xib and in ChildView.xib, I connected the childView IBOutlet to the view but when I start the app, the view in ChildView.xib doesn't get loaded automatically. Is this possible? At a basic level, I guess I'm asking how to connect UIViews from separate XIB files to an IBOutlet reference in some other XIB ... like MainWindow.xib. FWIW, I know how to do this in code (manually instantiating with NSBundle) but in this case, I want to know how to do it completely in IB (Interface Builder).
