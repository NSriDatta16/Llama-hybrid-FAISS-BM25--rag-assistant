Guidelines for formatting XML Namespace

I have not developed web services applications that publicly faced the Internet. As I begin to consider the issues of exposing schema definitions to a wide audience, I believe a certain amount of consideration should be spent on properly formatting the schema namespaces. Has anybody come across a guideline document that advises how to go about standardising the namespace format for an organisation's XML schemas? things like using FQDNs vs paths http://schemas.organisation.com/ vs http://organisation.com/schemas styles to include version paths http://organisation.com/schemas/submissions/2006 or http://organisation.com/schemas/submissions/v1 organisation by date or subject matter http://organisation.com/schemas/2006/submissions/ vs http://organisation.com/schemas/submissions/2006 etcetera 12 jan 2010 UPDATE: on revisiting this issue once again i feel it should just be wiki since there cannot be a right answer on this, if ever there are actually any written papers.
