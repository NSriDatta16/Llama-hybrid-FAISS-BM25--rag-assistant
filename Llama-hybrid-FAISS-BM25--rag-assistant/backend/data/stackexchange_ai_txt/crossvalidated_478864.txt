Since you’ve decided on an imputation method relying on MCAR (missing completely at random) data, I infer that your data are indeed MCAR. In this case, you should impute the missing values after the exclusion criteria are applied, for two reasons: Speed (because there are fewer data points to process, downstream of exclusion criteria); Bespoke imputation for your data of interest. (Whereas, imputing all 30 variables before exclusion would tap into a larger, less specific population than the one under study.) The caveat in the above is that it’s based on my inference that because you've chosen hotdeck you have MCAR data. If I’m mistaken, then: Don’t impute any data using hotdeck; use something such as multiple imputation by chained equations ( MICE ), for which there are toolboxes. Impute the data before the exclusion criteria are applied. Basically, see the other answer here by Robert Long. Good luck! References: Missing Data Problems in Machine Learning by B. Marlin (2008) Section 9.6 of The Elements of Statistical Learning , arguing for multiple imputation when data are not MCAR
