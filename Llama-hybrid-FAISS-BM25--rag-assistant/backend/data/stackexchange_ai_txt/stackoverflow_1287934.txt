not reimplementing GUI controls on new 'platform'

We're doing some serious games interface work. Games allow unique new interfaces, but we also want to avoid having to reimplement traditional 2D controls, we want to leverage the years of refinement to windows controls. How would we go about hosting and rendering .NET controls in a '3D' context? 3D in the sense of, eventually they will have to go through the game engine/opengl, but this could easily just be by painting the control to a texture and putting a textured quad on the interface.
