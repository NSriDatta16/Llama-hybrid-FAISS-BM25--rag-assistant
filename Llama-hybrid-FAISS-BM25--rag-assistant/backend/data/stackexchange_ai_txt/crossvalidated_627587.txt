Should main effects and interaction terms be included in Kmeans clustering? (hierarchical principle in clustering analysis)

Let's say I'm trying to cluster observations based on five features, including: n_emps : Number of employees n_cust : Number of customers If I were to declare cust_per_emp by dividing n_cust by n_emps to account for the average number of customers per employee, would it make sense to keep all five features plus the new one, or should I drop n_emps and n_cust , leaving the three original features plus the new one? In other words, in clustering analysis is there something like the hierarchical principle of additive models? For instance, in linear regression, it would be recommended to leave n_emps , n_cust and cust_per_emp . However, in KMeans, if two observations have similar values for n_emps and n_cust , then they should have simliar values for cust_per_emp as well.
