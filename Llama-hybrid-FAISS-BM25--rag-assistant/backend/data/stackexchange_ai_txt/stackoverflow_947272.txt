Laying out a database schema for a calendar application

I want to write a calendar application. It is really recurring items that throw a wrench in the works for the DB schema. I would love some input on how to organize this. What if a user creates an event, and inputs that it repeats everyone Monday, forever? How could I store all that in the database? I can't create infinite events. Do I simply put a table in there that holds the relevant info so I can calculate where all the events go? If so, I would have to calculate them every time the user views a new part of the calendar. What if they page through the months, but they have a ton of recurring items? Also, the schema needs to handle when a user clicks an item and says "Edit this one in the sequence" not all items in the sequence. Do I then split the one item off of the sequence? Update 1 I have not looked at iCal at all. To be clear, I think saving the info that allows you to calculate the recurring items, and splitting off any that differ from the sequence is a great way to store it to be able to transfer it. But I think that in an application, this would be too slow, to do the date math all over the place.
