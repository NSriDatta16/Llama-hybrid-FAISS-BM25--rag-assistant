Test for significance when looking at 2 proportions?

I am very new to statistics, and I would appreciate any help. I have two independent groups of physicians, A and B. Each physician group is measured on how successful they are at certain quality-of-care measures for patients, all of which are nominal data (screened or not screen, at goal or not at goal). I am trying to figure out if the rate of screening in each group of physicians is statistically significant. From what reading I've done, possibly a chi squared test (with group A the expected outcome and group B the observed outcome)? Or a TOST (two one-sided tests)? Can a T-test be done if my data are not averages?
