PHP Modify Array

I have the following array: array(a, a, a, b, b, c, c, c, c, d, d); When I loop through it and echo it, the result is: a a a b b c c c c d d How ever I want to echo it in such a way that it displays: a b c d a b c d a c c Here is the array in a grid to better explain what im trying to achieve Current a a a b b c c c c d d What im tryin to do a b c d a b c d a c c How would I do this? Seeing some of your answers, its clear I didnt explain it well enough :/ i should have included what the array keys should look like: 0a 1a 2a 3b 4b 5c 6c 7c 8c 9d 10d 0a 3b 6c 9d 1a 4b 7c 10d 2a 5c 8c Heres how i need the arrays to be organised, by key 0a 1a 2a 3b 4b 5c 6c 7c 8c 9d 10d 0a 3b 6c 9d 1a 4b 7c 10d 2a 5c 8c
