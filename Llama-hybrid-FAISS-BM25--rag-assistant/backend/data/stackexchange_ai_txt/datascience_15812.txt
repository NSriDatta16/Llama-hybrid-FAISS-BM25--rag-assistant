Check similarity between time series

I have time series of parameters A , B , C and D . All of them are under influence of the same major conditions, but each one has minor differences. They are placed in different locations, A , B , C are in local1 and D is in local2 . I would like to know which one ( A , B , C ) has the major similarity to D . How should I approach this issue?
