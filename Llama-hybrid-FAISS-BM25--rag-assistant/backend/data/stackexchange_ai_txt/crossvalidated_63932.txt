What is going on here is a multiple comparisons issue. You have 10 df for interaction so you can look at 10 independent interaction effects (although I suspect the 10 you are actually looking at, i.e. the 10 regression effects, are not independent). The 10 df interaction test will be significant at some level if and only if Scheffe's multiple comparison test can find an interaction effect that is significant at that level. So using Scheffe's method you would not be able to find an interaction regression coefficient that is significant. What is being report as P values for the regression coefficients are equivalent to looking at Fisher's LSD multiple comparison methods, which is notoriously easier at declaring significance. So basically you have one method that is declaring no effects and another that finds a few but since they are different methods that is not surprising. You need to decide what standards you want to use. (A more sophisticated use of LSD would not look at individual coefficients unless the overall test was significant.) Another way of thinking about this is that the 10df interaction test is an average of ten 1df tests and if the interaction effects are not very striking they can get lost in the process of averaging them. However, if you look at them individually, you can see their effect. I will not get into the main effects issues. But I think what R is telling you most strongly about the interactions (P=.00513) is that the differential effect of using Nutrients a and d changes depending on whether you use the unnamed Herbivore or the Paired Herbivore. If the differential effect of a and d can change, then there has to be some effect for the pair a and d, however the regression coefficient for Nut. d (which really looks at their difference) SEEMS to be saying there is none -- but it only seems to be saying that because main effects in the presence of interaction get so convoluted that they are not worth trying to figure out.
