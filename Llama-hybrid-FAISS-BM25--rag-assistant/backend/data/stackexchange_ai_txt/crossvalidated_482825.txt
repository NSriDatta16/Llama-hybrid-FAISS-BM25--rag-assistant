Short answer: The final model (the logistic regression models) should only include those not lost-to-follow-up. Longer answer: Setting aside the multiple imputation (MI) for other variables, let's focus on loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) exclusively. Informative LTFU (a common cause of the outcome and LTFU) can result in bias from the parameter of interest. There are two approaches we can consider to account for informative LTFU: re-weight all the values not-LTFU, or 'fill-in' those LTFU. Inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) are to adjust for informative LTFU. IPCW do this by re-weighting the data, so that the variables related to LTFU are no longer related in the weighted population. Therefore, you can conduct a complete case analysis of the data with those weights. Under this approach, we don't need to 'fill-in' any of the missing data. Multiple imputation is one approach to fill-in the values for those LTFU. Instead of re-weighting the data, we 'make up' the missing outcome data for those LTFU. We propose some model that is predictive of the outcomes, estimate the parameters for that model based on the observed data, and then fill-in the missing outcome values for those LTFU. This is another approach and relies on a different modeling strategy (i.e. we are filling in the missing values rather than re-weighting). Under the assumption that the model for IPCW is correctly specified, there is no need to use any of the imputed outcome data for those LTFU. You can combine these two approaches (augmented-IPW) but they are done in a special way.
