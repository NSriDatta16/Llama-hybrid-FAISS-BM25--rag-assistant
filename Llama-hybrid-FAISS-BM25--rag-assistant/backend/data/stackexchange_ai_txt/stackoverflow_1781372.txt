How to style content of pages without adding css class to element?

I use CMS for client and client doesn't know CSS he use WYSIWYG editor to put content in pages. Client adds Paragraphs, images, images in paragraph (left or right floated), ordered and unordered list, Tables. Problems comes when he want to add images in paragraph (left or right floated). and without adding css class it's not possible. And i don't want to add in content because WYSIWYG editor can't manage div and client works in WYSIWYG mode. How to style content of pages without using css class?
