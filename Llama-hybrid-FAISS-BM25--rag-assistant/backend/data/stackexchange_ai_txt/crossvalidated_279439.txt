A few suggestions: 1) There might be a cointegrating relationship. You could fit an error correction model. In this case you would still do the regression in differences, but include terms for the lagged level of the cointegrating relationship, as well as lags for the differences of each of the variables. 2) Fitting models in differences instead of levels almost always leads to a lower R squared. However, R squared it not the main criteria of statistical analysis. It matters more if the model helps you predict bank loss rates better. 3) I would push back against the idea that unemployment has a unit root. Over long periods of time, unemployment is fairly mean-reverting. If you're only using about 25 years worth of data, you might not see it. You could also try to find other data sources that could proxy your time series of bank loss rates. 4) Unemployment typically follows regimes: if it is going up, it keeps going up, and if it is going down, it keeps going down. This effect is driven by the state of the economy, monetary policy, and the growth of labor supply. Extracting information about the regime might improve the analysis. One benefit of this analysis is that we have more information, courtesy of the BLS, about the unemployment rate than we do about bank losses. 5) Include more independent variables if you can and it is reasonable.
