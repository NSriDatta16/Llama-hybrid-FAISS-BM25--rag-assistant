this sending email message. I suspect that the problem is in the way that you are constructing and / or sending the mail message; e.g. in the content type / character set that you are specifying. But we can only guess, unless you post the relevant code ... As @Paŭlo Ebermann suggests, if you are embedding a special character directly in your code, then you can run into compilation problems if the compiler reads your source code using the wrong character set / encoding. You can avoid these problems entirely by using Unicode escapes; e.g. change your code to say: String message = "stackoverflow \u00AE"; instead of String message = "stackoverflow ®"; IMO, this is a good idea ... even if this is not what is causing your problem.
