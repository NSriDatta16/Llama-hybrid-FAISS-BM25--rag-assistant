Use Auto-complete wherever possible on your text input fields. If using selects or combo boxes with related information try and use chain selects to organise the information. Where results depend on location try and serve relevant results. Also remember to keep the search form as simple as possible even down to one text field. To refine the search you can have an alternate form as an "Advanced Search interface".
