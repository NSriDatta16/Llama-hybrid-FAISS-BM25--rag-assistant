Thoughts on best method for testing for differences in slopes of lines (time series data)?

I have 4 sets of 50 year data (one value per year for each of the 4 different categories)- and would like to test for differences in the slopes of the lines. I think ANCOVA is appropriate- though maybe not as these are time series data? And ...how to do post hoc pairwise comparisons? The data are estimates of parasite production for each year under 4 different climate scenarios ranging from hot and dry to cold and wet (parasite production is directly dependent on temperature).
