MySQL Workbench is a visual database design tool developed by MySQL. It is the successor application of the DBDesigner4 project. You can see a video presentation here The first preview version of MySQL Workbench was released in September 2005 and was not included in the MySQL GUI Tools Bundle. Development was started again in 2007, and MySQL Workbench was set to become the MySQL GUI flagship product. Version numbering was started in 5.0 to emphasise the fact that MySQL Workbench was developed as the successor to DBDesigner4. MySQL Workbench 5.0 and 5.1 MySQL Workbench 5.0 and 5.1 are specialized visual database design tools for the MySQL database.

Being the foundation for all other editions, it will benefit from all future development efforts. The proprietary "Standard Edition" extends the Community Edition with a series of modules and plugins. As this business decision was announced soon after the takeover of MySQL by Sun Microsystems, this has caused speculation in the press about the future licensing of the MySQL database. ###Community reception and reviews Since its introduction MySQL Workbench has become popular within the MySQL community. It is now the second most downloaded product from the MySQL website, with more than 250,000 downloads a month. Before that, it was voted Database Tool of the Year 2009 on Developer.com. MySQL Workbench has been reviewed by the open source community and print magazines. Related tags mysql mysql2
