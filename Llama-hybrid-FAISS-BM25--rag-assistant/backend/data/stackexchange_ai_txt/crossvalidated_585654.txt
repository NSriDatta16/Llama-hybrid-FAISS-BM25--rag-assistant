When adding batch norm layer do I need to added to all layers in DNN?

While developing deepfm model network I want to add batch norm layer because model seems to suffer from vanishing gradient. There are embedding layers, 2 layers a in deep model part and one dense that connects fm model and deep model. If I want to add batch norm which layer do I added on? What do I have to look at to judge certain layers needs batch norm?
