Something similar to the Sketchflow map for actual applications?

I was very excited when i first used sketchflow, and i fell in love with the little navigation thing at the bottom. http://img600.imageshack.us/img600/9835/a31ae82fde614b3592e0ab8.png i have a program that has to follow a certain navigation scheme, and i was wondering if it was possible to create some sort of chart like this, for organization and reference purposes easily in the VS2010 Ultimate IDE.
