License problem embedding Mono?

I'd like to embed Mono into an .exe file but the problem is the license, because a LGPL library can only be linked with LGPL code. However, I'd like to build a commercial app, so I ask if is possible to use a stub that launches a DLL version of the Mono runtime and executes my app. Or do you know a better way to do this? I need a cross-platform framework and Mono seems good, but there are some problem to pack it in one file, so you know a "free" way to do this?
