HTMLMenuCollection does not implement IList . The ICollection cast works because they both inherit from ICollection . Also, you're upcasting from a List to an HTMLMenuCollection , which won't work because HTMLMenuCollection is not inheriting from List , and regardless the upconvert can't work since the compiler will consider HTMLMenuCollection to have more data (even if it doesn't) than a List . It might be more useful to pass the list into a constructor, and have the internal implementations of the ICollection methods just pass to whatever container field you're storing it in internally.
