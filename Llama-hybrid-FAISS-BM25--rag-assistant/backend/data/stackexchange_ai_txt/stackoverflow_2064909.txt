Missing code coverage tab in VS localtestrun.testrunconfig?

I am relatively new to unit testing and was attempting to add some code coverage to my unit tests. Yet i can't find the code coverage tab in Visual Studio 2008 in the localtestrun.testrunconfig, is there any missing Add-in or tool? Thanks, DMS
