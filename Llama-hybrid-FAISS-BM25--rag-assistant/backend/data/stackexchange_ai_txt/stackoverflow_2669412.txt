how to do it is indicated in the link you give: print "* recording" for i in range(0, 44100 / chunk * RECORD_SECONDS): data = stream.read(chunk) # check for silence here by comparing the level with 0 (or some threshold) for # the contents of data. # then write data or not to a file You have to set the threshold variable and compare with the average value (the amplitude) or other related parameter in data each time it is read in the loop. You could have two nested loops, the first one to trigger the recording and the other to continously save sound data chuncks after that.
