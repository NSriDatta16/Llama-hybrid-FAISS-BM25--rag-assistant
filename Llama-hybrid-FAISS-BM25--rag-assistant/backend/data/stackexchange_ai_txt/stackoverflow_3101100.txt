python: trouble printing short utf-encoded strings

(The following is using Python 2.6.1) I have 2 strings: >>> a = u'\u05e8\u05db\u05e1' >>> b = u'\u05e8\u05db\u05e1 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e0\u05e1' I encode them: >>> ua = a.encode('utf-8') >>> ub = b.encode('utf-8') >>> ua '\xd7\xa8\xd7\x9b\xd7\xa1' >>> ub '\xd7\xa8\xd7\x9b\xd7\xa1 \xd7\x94\xd7\x99\xd7\x90 \xd7\x9e\xd7\x90\xd7\x99\xd7\xa8\xd7\x94 \xd7\x91\xd7\xa4\xd7\xa0\xd7\xa1' and try to print: >>> print ua ×¨×›×¡ >>> print ub רכס היא מאירה בפנס Why does ub print in Hebrew characters while ua doesn't? ua is just the first few characters of ub , so it seems as though string length is somehow the problem, which is weird. (For the record, this came up trying to parse a webpage with BeautifulSoup -- I couldn't tell why some paragraphs came out readably while others didn't.)
