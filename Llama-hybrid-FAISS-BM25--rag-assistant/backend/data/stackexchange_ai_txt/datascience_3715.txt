This seems to be a standard regression problem in which there are two goals: Obtain a predictive model that can be used for prediction. Which variables seem to be the most important ones to be used. For both the above problems use an ensemble model. Consider both a random forest and a gradient boosted machine. Both these models will use the independent variables and predict the Hospital time. Additionally, through variable importances, you can obtain which variables are the most important ones and have the most impact in predicting the output.
