Using Fractional Polynomials for Logistic Regression Modelling in R

I am learning logistic regression modeling using the book "Applied Logistic Regression" by Hosmer. In chpaters, he suggested using Fractional Polynomials for fitting continuous variable which does not seems to be related to logit in linear fashion. I tried the mfp package and can give exactly the same verbose as the book. But I don't know how to write the transformed variable based on the output of fractional polynomials. The book only shows example of the transformed variable when $J=2$ with $p_1=0$ and $p_2=-0.5$ (page 101) and when $J=2$ with $p_1=2$ and $p_2=2$ (page 101), But what about the others? Currently my case is $J=2$ with $p_1=-1$ and $p_2=-1$. I know little about fractional polynomials and the book seems not giving sufficient hits on this part. Can anyone refer me to some place which I can know how to write the polynomial? Thanks.
