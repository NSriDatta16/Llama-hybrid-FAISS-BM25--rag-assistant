I see the others have posted some very working solutions based on .live , but I figured I'd put my solution anyway, First, I'd suggest you change your markup a bit, if you can, like so, Like Save Like Save Like Save This gives a more readable and semantic structure for the markup, making it easier to read and follow. Next, for the code, I strongly encourage using .delegate method instead of .live . $('div.sublike-box').delegate('a.sublike-btn', 'click', function (e) { $(this).next('div.sublike-form').toggle(); }); should do the trick.
