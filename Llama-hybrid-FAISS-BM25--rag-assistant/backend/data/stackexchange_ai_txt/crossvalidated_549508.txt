How to prove that LDA has a similar form to Logistic Regression for the binary classification example?

I was studying the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, et al. and saw the following line on page 151: In the LDA framework, we can see from (4.12) to (4.13) (and a bit of simple algebra) that the log odds is given by: $$ log \left(\frac{p_1(x)}{1-p_1(x)}\right) = log \left(\frac{p_1(x)}{p_2(x)}\right) = c_0 + c_1(x) $$ How can this proved?
