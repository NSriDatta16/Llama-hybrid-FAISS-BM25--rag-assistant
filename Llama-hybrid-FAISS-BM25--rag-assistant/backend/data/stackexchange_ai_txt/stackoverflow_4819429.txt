Is there a more elegant solution? Why not just reinterpret the struct as an array of char? struct m_ { int i1; int i2; int i3; }; // ... m_ m; char* data = static_cast (static_cast (&m)); Any object can safely be reinterpreted as an array of char. Of course, you still have to worry about alignment, padding, the sizes of your data types, and potential endianness and other representation issues, but presumably you know that since you're writing the serialization implementation.
