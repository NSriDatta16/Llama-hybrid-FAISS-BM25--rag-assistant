Can a new independent variable be produced from the dependent variable in variable engineering?

I have a question. I have a data set, my goal here is to estimate player salaries. My variables are salary, number, year, error etc. I thought of creating a variable such as average salary by making salary / year, but I am not sure if salary creates a problem because it is my dependent variable.Will this be a wrong behavior?
