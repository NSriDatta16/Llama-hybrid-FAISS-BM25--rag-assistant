It looks like you are new to programming. Perhaps you have an advanced mathematics degree? If you really don't understand that the notion JQuery can detect faces is a joke, you need to learn a lot before you will be ready to detect faces. If you're lucky you can find an easy out-of-the-box solution. Unfortunately, face recognition is in the class of problems that tend to lack easy out of the box solutions. JavaScript is right out. http://rubyforge.org/projects/opencv/ is a Ruby binding to OpenCV. The pitiful documentation (autogenerated API docs only) at http://doc.blueruby.mydns.jp/opencv/ mentions a face_detect.rb that might be helpful. As with most bindings, you should also consult the documentation for the original library e.g. http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/FaceDetection You should also understand that face detection (where are the faces in this photo?) is a different and easier problem than face recognition (whose face is it).
