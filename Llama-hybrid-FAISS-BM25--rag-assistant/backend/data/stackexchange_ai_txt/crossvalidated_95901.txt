A Bayesian would agree with you, a frequentist would not. This is a matter of opinion, perspective, and philosophy. I think that it does a lot of harm to the statistics community to attempt to argue that one method is always better than the other. Many problems will have Bayesian and frequentist solutions that are similar so long as the Bayesian does not have too strong of a prior.
