First, you are transforming your training set and test set independently. What you want to do instead is perform PCA on your training set, obtain the coefficients, train on the transformed data, and the transform your test data using the training PCA coefficients before prediction. See this MATLAB thread for instructions. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, given the multiple features families (textual, visual, and auditory) you have in your dataset, I'm not sure that the PCA transform is a valid choice.
