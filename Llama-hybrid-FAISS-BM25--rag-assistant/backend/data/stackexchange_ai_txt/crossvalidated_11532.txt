Importing time series from SQL base into R

I have a number of regular daily measurements in a MySQL database that I'd like to manipulate using R. When it's returned from RMySQL, it looks like this: > memdata date vsize 1 2011-04-22 3535.178 2 2011-04-23 5680.516 3 2011-04-24 5468.914 4 2011-04-25 4761.044 5 2011-04-26 4403.515 6 2011-04-27 4459.155 7 2011-04-28 4889.884 8 2011-04-29 5290.908 9 2011-04-30 5370.952 > str(memdata) 'data.frame': 9 obs. of 2 variables: $ date : chr "2011-04-22" "2011-04-23" "2011-04-24" "2011-04-25" ... $ vsize: num 3535 5681 5469 4761 4404 ... Since many of the time series libraries expect ts objects, I'd like to convert the data frame into one, but there doesn't seem to be a straightforward way of doing that. This site has a lot of good examples, but none that deal with daily data. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
