Managing file uploads in JSP/Servlets

Once again a very beginner-ish question, but here I go: I would like to use a servlet or similar to copy an uploaded file (from an html file select) to a permanent location. This is all I need to do with the file. I am currently going with using the Apache Commons FileUpload and IO libraries. Is there no easier or more elegant solution?
