Binary Logistic Regression: Direction of B's different in multiple than in bivariate cases

I am interested in the combined effects of 12 continuous/interval predictors on a dichotomous/binomial outcome and thus am using logistic regression. First I ran 12 separate bivariate logistic regressions. All had positive B's. Then when I ran the multiple logistic regression (enter method), some of these predictors have now become negatively associated with the outcome. I'm not sure what to make of this result. Is this unusual? What does this mean when this happens? Thanks so much for any guidance! Bonnie
