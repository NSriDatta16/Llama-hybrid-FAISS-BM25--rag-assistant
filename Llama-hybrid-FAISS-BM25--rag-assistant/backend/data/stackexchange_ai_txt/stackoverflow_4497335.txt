Organising T4 Templates

I have begun using T4 Templates for a few DAL enhancements. However, I find they quickly get unwieldy and often produce poorly formatted code. I am wondering if anyone has any good tips on organising these templates, and on getting great formatted code at the end. So far my experience is: Stick to what existing published templates do (e.g. SubSonic) If indentation is playing up attempt a blank line after the closest #> Lots of comments.
