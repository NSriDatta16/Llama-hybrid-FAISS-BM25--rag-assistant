Your object is not actually an AR object, usually indicating that some data retrieval has failed ( Table.find_by_name('nonexistent name') will return nil ). If all you want to do is shut off the visible warnings, you can turn off whiny_nils in your config, otherwise do an is_a? test before trying to access the object's attributes and handle the failure case gracefully.
