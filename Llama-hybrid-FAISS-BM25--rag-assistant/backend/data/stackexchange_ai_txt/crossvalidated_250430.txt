Yes, the same centroid update by vector average works. See m=1 case in the Section 2.2 of this paper . w's are the weights and the weights are all 1 for base k-mean algorithms. The paper uses properties of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to establish the condition that minimizes the cost function for k-mean. Also remember that cosine similiarity is not a vector distance. Cosine dissimiliarity is. (This should be a good search term.) Hence when you update the partition, you are looking for arg max as opposed to arg min .
