p-values unstable using quantreg::rq in R

Using R, I m performing a backtest on a time series by using quantile regression (quantreg::rq) on a number of features. These features are selected based on a condition such as p-values If I run the routine multiple times, I always end up with the same betas/coefficients on the features, however p-values are unstables, and this happens ceteris paribus! Ex: for feature 1, there might be the case that it is selected on a first trial and then it is dropped because p values are, respectively, 0.049 and 0.0536. Nothing has changed in the input DF (checked multiple times)! This happens still when I set a specific set.seed. Does it relate to some specific random sampling used to determine the level of significance automatically by R? Tks
