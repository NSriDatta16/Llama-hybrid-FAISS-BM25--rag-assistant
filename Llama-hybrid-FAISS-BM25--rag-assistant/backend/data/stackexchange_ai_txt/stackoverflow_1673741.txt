Persisting more than one object in Delphi 7

This is not a duplicate but a follow-up to " Persistent Objects in Windows XP/Delphi 7 ." I need to persist more than one object in Delphi 7, and the objects are a class family. RRUZ's answer suggests I inherit from TPersistent and use TJvAppXMLFileStorage , but when I use its WritePersistent method, it overwrite one object with the next object in the XML file. I have to save objects (TAlarms, and descendants) later in a database, so I have to recover them from the file. How can I persist more than one object in the same file and then load these objects from the file?
