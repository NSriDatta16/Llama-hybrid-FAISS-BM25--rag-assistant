Julia - To Learn or Not to Learn?

I'm relatively new to data science, having done some machine learning projects at work. My background is in R, although I have some experience in Python. I'm considering choosing one language and getting really good at using it for data science / machine learning. Now, I've read various articles touting Julia 's strengths - namely ease of use and massive speed benefits. It sounds almost too good to be true! So my question is, is there any particular reason(s) why I should choose Julia over R/Python? Or alternatively, is there any reason(s) why I shouldn't choose Julia over R/Python?
