Disclosure of possible conflict of interest: I teach (on-line) at UOC I agree with Kodiologist that there are on-line certificates with little value. However, there also exist on-line universities within the same system of public universities than the brick-and-mortar universities of the same country, subjected to the same quality controls and with a comparable prestige - at least, within the same range of prestige of off-line universities in the same country. The most known example worldwide is The Open University in the UK, and in Spain there are UNED and Universitat Oberta de Catalunya . I teach at UOC and at off-line universities and the level of knowledge that students reach is equivalent - for example, in basic statistics courses that I've taught in both places. Furthermore, I know people getting jobs and working with their UOC degrees just as they would with a degree from an off-line university. I suggest to search in prestigious on-line universities for courses in your topic. In UOC there are some masters and courses related to economy and data science that might interest you, although I do not have direct knowledge of those courses because I'm teaching in other studies and can't give an informed opinion on them. And as a final comment: Brick-and-mortar universities have some advantages, but on-line universities might ease a lot the logistics of studying. I suggest giving a try to the prestigious ones. Anyway, I must agree with Kodologist that books and Internet free resources are a great way to learn nearly anything, too.
