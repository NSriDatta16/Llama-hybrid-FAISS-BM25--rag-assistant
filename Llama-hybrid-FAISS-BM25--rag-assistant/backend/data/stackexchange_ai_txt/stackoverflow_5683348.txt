Not sure if the same problem, because I never used applets, but I've also had issues when trying to run SWT-Browser based applications with bundled xulrunner through webstart. One workaround for this was setting a policy inside the java code (just before creating the Browser instance...) Policy.setPolicy(new Policy() { public PermissionCollection getPermissions(CodeSource codesource) { Permissions perms = new Permissions(); perms.add(new AllPermission()); return(perms); } public void refresh() { } } I remember Windows XP was still unable to run JNLP with this. But Windows 7, several versions of Linux and Mac OS X could.
