Best statistical test for aggregated group rate vs individual rate?

I'm looking to test the difference between an aggregated group weight (weighted average) vs an individual group rate? For example: Let's say we have 4 companies: A - 35/60 = 58% B - 120 / 400 = 30% C - 80/100 = 80% If I add the counts and then average I get 235/560 = ~42%. However, the weighted average is 56%. I'm not interested in knowing whether there is a difference between all these companies. I specifically want to test whether the weighted average is different to company D (30/70 = ~43%). If I use a Chi-square with the total counts of the companies, I don't really test the weighted average of A, B, C against D. What I'd like to confirm is whether a proportions z test is the most appropriate and reliable test for this scenario?
