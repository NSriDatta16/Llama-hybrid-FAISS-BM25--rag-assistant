First a minor terminology thing, but the function you've defined is actually called the sigmoid and not the logit, which is the inverse of the sigmoid function. Secondly you're missing a minus sign and it should instead be $1 / (e^{- w^T x} + 1)$. Most importantly you're adding an error term to the sigmoid when there is no such thing in logistic regression. The way you should generate $Y_i$ is by sampling from a Bernoulli distribution with $1 / (e^{- w^T x_i} + 1)$ as the success probability. If you do this then you should get the right estimates in your simulation.
