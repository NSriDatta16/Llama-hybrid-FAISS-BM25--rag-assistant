There are two mistakes here. First in the OrganisationModule class you need to provide Resources as property. Currently it is not a property, you need to write Get and/or Set Then for Binding we need below expression Foreground="{Binding Path=ForegroundColor,Source={x:Static Modules:OrganisationModule.Resources}}" />
