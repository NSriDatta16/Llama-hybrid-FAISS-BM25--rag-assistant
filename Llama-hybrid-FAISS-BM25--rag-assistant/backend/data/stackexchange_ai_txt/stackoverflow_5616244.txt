How to get a reference to current DropTarget, upon drop failure with YUI 2.8.1 DragDrop?

I'm using the DragDrop component - its basically the 'grouped drop objects' example - but I cannot for the life of me obtain a reference to the DropTarget object at the time I dropped my drag object... when the DropTarget is "incorrect". I tried intercepting onInvalidDrop , can't seem to catch references to a DropTarget there, 'this' default scopes to the Dragged object. I tried putting a conditional within onDragDrop for whether a drop result was a legal target, hoping to see some result... nothing. I then tried to do the same with onDragEnd as with onDragDrop , no cigar. I simply want to deactivate the DropTarget the user failed on. I have the styles ready, I have isTarget ready to be applied... but nothing to apply it to? URL: http://codefinger.co.nz/_testing/yui_dragdrop/dragdrop_test.html
