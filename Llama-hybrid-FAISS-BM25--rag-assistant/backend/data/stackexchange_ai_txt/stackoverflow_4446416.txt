VS2010 Test Runner - Unable to start agent process

I can't run any tess in VS2010. Even tests that have run before. I remember setting some services to manual start a few weeks ago, but can't remember what! Problem: Which agent process / service do I need to start to make this work? Edit: Even after uninstalling and reinstalling Studio2010 (and taking off the Novell Netware Client which I though may be an issue) it still doesn't work.
