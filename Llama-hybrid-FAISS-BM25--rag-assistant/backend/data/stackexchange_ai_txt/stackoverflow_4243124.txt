The Wikipedia article referenced above seems to only refers to "coupon codes" only for UPC12 barcodes which are slightly different from EAN13 barcodes. According to the offical GS1 site http://gepir.gs1.org/v31/xx/gtin.aspx?Lang=en-US this barcode is not defined as belonging to anyone (or country) so it is probably used internally by some organization for a custom application. The GS1 site lot of information on barcode standards and formats.
