Unrolled Linked List In computer programming, an unrolled linked list is a variation on the linked list which stores multiple elements in each node. It can drastically increase cache performance, while decreasing the memory overhead associated with storing list metadata such as references. It is related to the B-tree. - Wikipedia XOR Linked List XOR linked lists are a data structure used in computer programming. They take advantage of the bitwise exclusive disjunction (XOR) operation, here denoted by âŠ•, to decrease storage requirements for doubly-linked lists. - Wikipedia
