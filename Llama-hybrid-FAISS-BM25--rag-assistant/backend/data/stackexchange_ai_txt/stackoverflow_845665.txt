How to cancel drop event in YUI drag & drop utility?

We are using drag & drop utility between one source and multiple targets. We have a restriction that one of the target can only have one child element while the other ones can have multiple items. I have tried subscribing dragDropEvent of the proxy item and returning false in case the destination target has multiple child elements, with out much luck. var m = new YAHOO.example.DDList("dli" + j, 'documentSelection'); m.subscribe('dragDropEvent', function(e){ if (e.info == 'ulMasterDocument' && $('#ulMasterDocument').children().length > 1){ e.event.canceBubble = true; return false; } return true; }); Is this code correct? Or do i need to subscribe some other event? Thanks
