How to do multi class classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

In every book and example always they show only binary classification (two classes) and new vector can belong to any one class. Here the problem is I have 4 classes(c1, c2, c3, c4). I've training data for 4 classes. For new vector the output should be like C1 80% (the winner) c2 10% c3 6% c4 4% How to do this? I'm planning to use libsvm (because it most popular). I don't know much about it. If any of you guys used it previously please tell me specific commands I'm supposed to use.
