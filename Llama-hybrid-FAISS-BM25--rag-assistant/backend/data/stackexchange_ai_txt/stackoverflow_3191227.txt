Core Data - Following Keypaths

I am new to Core Data and am stumbling on the right way to set up a query. My managed object model includes the classes Apartment, Lease, and what I would otherwise call a join table called ApartmentLease. This looks like: /-----------------\ /-----------------\ /-----------------\ | Apartment | | ApartmentLease | | Lease | |-----------------| |-----------------| |-----------------| | number | | startOn | | occupantName | |-----------------| | endOn | | monthlyRate | | apartmentLeases |-\ |-----------------| | occupantPhone | \-----------------/ \->>| apartment | |-----------------| | lease | So what I have tried to model is that a Lease can have many Apartments and each Apartment in the lease has its own start and ending dates. So my question is: Given a range of dates, how can I query the Apartment object and get back an array of all the Leases that occupied the Apartment during that date range? Thanks and sorry for my horrible ASCII art! Bert
