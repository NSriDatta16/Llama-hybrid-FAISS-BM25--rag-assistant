Unfortunately, you can't generate ROC curves from that data. To construct ROC curves, you have to be able to rank the test set from strong positive to strong negative . For that you need scores, which measure the level of confidence that a data instance belong to the positive class (e.g. signed distance to the separating hyperplane for SVM and predicted probability for Naive Bayes). Predicted labels alone do not contain enough information to construct ROC curves. In response to edit-2: yes, you can construct an ROC curve based on that data.
