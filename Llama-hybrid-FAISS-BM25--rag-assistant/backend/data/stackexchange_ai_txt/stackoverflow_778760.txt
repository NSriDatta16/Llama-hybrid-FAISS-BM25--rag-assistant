Connecting to MS SQL Server with JRuby

I'm working on a project that involves some scripting and data storage. The database that I have available to me is MS Sql Server and it is on a windows platform. Despite this I'm looking to leverage Ruby to write the script, specifically JRuby. There are a couple of reasons for this I would like to leverage Prawn to create pdfs I just like Ruby JRuby and Rawr will allow me to bundle the dependencies so that I don't have to worry about having ruby on the target machine(s). When using Matz ruby I can use 'win32ole' for easy database connectivity. However this doesn't work in JRuby for obvious reasons. What is the bast way to connect to MS Sql from JRuby/Java to perform simple Select and Update statements? Thanks in advance.
