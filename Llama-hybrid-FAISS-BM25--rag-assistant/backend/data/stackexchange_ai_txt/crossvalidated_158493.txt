How to compare ARIMA model in R to actual observations used to create the model?

I've been using the R forecast package's auto.arima() function to fit an ARIMA model to my time series data. I want to see how good of a fit the ARIMA model is to my original data. I hope to plot my original time series and the ARIMA simulation on the same plot and see how well they match up. How can I do this? Thanks!
