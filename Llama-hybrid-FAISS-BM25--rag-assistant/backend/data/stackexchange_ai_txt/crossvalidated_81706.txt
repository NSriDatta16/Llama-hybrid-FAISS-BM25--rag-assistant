You have two options: In case you assume the tests were similar: Pool the test results, so you have twenty tests results with a mean and standard deviation. In that case, both students with score 99 have performed equally. In case you assume that one of the tests was harder than the other: If the professor set up two tests, it might still be that he under- or overestimated some questions. If at the end of the exams, he sees that the means of the tests are not equal he can correct for this variance "across" tests. He will then use only the variation "within" tests to give students a final score. In that case, both students with 99 will not score equally on the tests. In case you would like to correct for this variance across groups, you have many options but consider these easy ones: Just correct for the average difference, i.e. subtract the difference in average for each score within a group; Assume a distribution in each group, and calculate the standardised scores (i.e. z scores); Forget about the distribution in a group and calculate the rank of each test within a group. (the highest score in each group gets 20/20, the median score 10/20 and the lowest score 0/20).
