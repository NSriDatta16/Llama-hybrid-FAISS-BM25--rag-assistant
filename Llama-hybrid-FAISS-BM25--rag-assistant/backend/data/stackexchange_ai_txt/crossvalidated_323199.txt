About autocorrelation function

I am a little bit confused with the next example given in Brockwell and Davis,Time Series Theory and Methods, page 98. In the example, is computed the autocorrelation, and at some point, the author says that $Corr(Z_2,X_1)=0$ I donÂ´t have clear why, because If I see the expression $$X_t=0.9X_{t-1}+Z_t$$ clearly $X_t$ depends on $Z_t$. Moreover If I write in particular $Z_2=X_2-0.9X_1$ evidently $Z_2$ is depending on $X_1$, how the correlation can be 0 ??
