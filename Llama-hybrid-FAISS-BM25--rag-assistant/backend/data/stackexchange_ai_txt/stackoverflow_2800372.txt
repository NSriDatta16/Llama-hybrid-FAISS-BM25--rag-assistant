If you are trying to verify the code will work in Python 3.x, I would suggest a script that copies the source files to a new directory, runs 2to3 on them, then copies the unit tests to the directory and runs them. This may seem slightly inelegant, but is consistent with the spirit of unit testing. You are making a series of assertions that you believe ought to be true about the external behavior of the code, regardless of implementation. If the converted code passes your unit tests, you can consider your code to support Python 3.
