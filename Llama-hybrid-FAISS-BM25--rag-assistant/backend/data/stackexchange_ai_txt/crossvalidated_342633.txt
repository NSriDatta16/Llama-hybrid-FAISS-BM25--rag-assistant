Can VIF and backward elimination be used on a logistic regression model?

I'm conducting a study on mandatory reports in the healthcare sector. I've got a sample of 760 visits (690 individual patients ). I will use a binary logistic regression model to see if my independent variables will affect if a child is reported or not (yes/no). Reported will be set ass dependent variable. I've checked for multicollinearity using VIF. I have two questions: Is it okay to use VIF when the variables are categorical (1/0)? If no, is there another way to check for multicollinearity? Can I use backward elimination to exclude variables that are not significant? Or is there a better way to select the model? Really appreciate if someone could help me!
