Why does my ROC curve have a sharp edge?

I was working on a random forest model in R and I got a ROC curve that looks like this. This is very odd since there is no curvature. The data does have mostly qualitative features with only 2-3 quantitative features. The data is also mostly one class (i.e. 80% of my data is in one class and 20% in the second class). It seems to favor sensitivity over specificity. The other issue is that the performance says that it only has 3 data points. I have a lot of data so I am not sure why it says only 3 points. Could someone explain what is happening with this ROC curve and why there is no curvature? This is my code for the ROC curve plot. #Test pred
