Hard to know without a backtrace/more info what is triggering the error. It looks like you are using sessions stored in a database, and that a query related to that is failing. Try setting the third argument to getApplicationConfiguration to true (which will turn debug on) and see if you get more output. At a guess, it looks like the account app is using PDO session storage, and is failing to connect to the database or something?
