For image clustering, I don't suggest you to start with clustering techniques immediately. First, run some dimensionality reduction model. The most powerful dimensionality reduction technique is represented by Autoencoders . If you are familiar with Deep learning, use Autoencoders to generate compressed, dense representations of the images. Alternatively, you can use "lighter" models, such as PCA, kernel-PCA, or some manifold learning technique. This first step has the advantage of reducing noise, multicollinearity, and sparsity in your data. Most importantly, it can save you from the curse of dimensionality. Once you have compressed the original data, then I suggest you to run k-Means clustering (or another technique if you prefer). Its results will be much more meaningful and easy to interepret.
