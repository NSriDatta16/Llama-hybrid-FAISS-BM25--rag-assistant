skb and Scatter gather feature

I have few questions related to the SKB. when we try to allocate a skb using alloc_skb( ) all the headers related to the skb will be allocated, for example a l4 header,l3 header,l2 header etc., I have seen sizeof(struct sk_buff) as 188. this must with all the header -- Am I correct? The content of skb is going to contiguous with all the headers.(considering a liner skb without any fragments). correct? Scatter gather(SG) - a hardware feature used to fetch data from different memory locations to copy(DMA) to device memory. If the skb is going to be liner and if it is within the MTU size, SG will not be used. ? If the skb is non-liner and if the size exceeds MTU size, SG will be used. When we wil hit skb as non-linear case, in the sense skb having multiple fragments. Please confirm? Thanks, Kumar
