Intuitive explanation of the paper "Generalized Random Forests" (Athey, Tibshirani, Wager)

This seems like an exciting approach to uplift modelling, but the only resource that I can find is this paper and it is too brief, notation-heavy and dense to be of any use to me. I have an honours degree in mathematical statistics, but it is not nearly enough to decipher this paper. Irefuse to put methodologies into production that I can not on any level understand. Are there people who could code this algorithm themselves based on the material presented in this paper? Can somebody give an intuitive/simpler description?
