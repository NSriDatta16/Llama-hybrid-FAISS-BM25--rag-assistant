There's this (unfortunately only available as a cached version) pretty old blog post from Bea Stollnitz, which pretty much covers your question. It has a nice implementation of drag n drop with an adorner showing a "ghost image". Basically drag and drop in WPF is quite the complicate procedure that - if you want some custom DragAdorners - involves adding a bunch of attached dependency properties for handling setup of all the events involved and especially for displaying the adorner in a way that doesn't interfere with the dropping code. Bea's code works by having a helper class that sets the owning Window 's DragOver event handler and AllowDrop right before the actual drag drop operation, that way you can control all the moving in between the actual drag source and the drop target.
