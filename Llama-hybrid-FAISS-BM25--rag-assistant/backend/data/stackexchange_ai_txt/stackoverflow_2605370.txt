An object is automatically destructed when it "goes out of scope". This could be referred to as "automatic storage reclamation", but that actually refers to garbage collection (there are several papers with that phrase in their name that use the term to mean garbage collection). When it is used to ensure proper pairing of open/close, lock/unlock, or other forms of resource acquisition with their appropriate release, then it is known as the design pattern of Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) , which is somewhat ironic given that the main aspect of RAII is not the resource initialization or acquisition, but rather its destruction.
