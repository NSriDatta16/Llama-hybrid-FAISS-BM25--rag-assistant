Do you have a thing like that little black bar in your textures? I've encountered similar problems when I have done something wrong. Here's a small check-list: Have you have mipmapped your texture or not, and check what parameters does it have. glTexParameters. (WRAP_S, WRAP_T, MAG_FILTER, MIN_FILTER...) texture's dimensions. (If there's non-power-of-two -textures allowed, it may cause graphic glitches, depending about how you load your textures) Are you are drawing that flashing bar on top of your rectangles? Whether there's something that's causing the black bar, in your texture. Alignment of the animation frames. Blending and alpha-blending. If something in the list is vague for you, it's good exercise to read about them. I also do a good guess: I believe you aren't wrapping your textures in any direction, and that the animation frames are a bit misaligned, so that your application has a bit wrong texture coordinates/height in the quad you are drawing. I hope my advices make sense. I have only experience with the usual opengl, not the OpenGL ES that's graphics pipelines have been pruned to make it more compact, cleaner and more elegant.
