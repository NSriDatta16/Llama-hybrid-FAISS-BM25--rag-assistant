IE8 regexp finding newline characters

I'm using javascript regexp to replace newline characters with html paragraphs. In FireFox, Safari and Chrome I have no problem, but in IE8 it fails to find any newline characters at all. I have tried both /\n/g and /\r\n/ but without success. Has anyone else had a similar problem?
