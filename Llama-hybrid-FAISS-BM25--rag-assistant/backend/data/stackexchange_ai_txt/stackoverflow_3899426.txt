Resource interpreted as document but transferred with MIME type text/css

Resource interpreted as document but transferred with MIME type text/css This is the error that's showing up in Google Chrome Inspector. The file is: http://www.doanddare.org/css/style.css It is being rendered by a php processor. How can I fix this error? The headers being returned are: Request Headers Accept:application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Cache-Control:max-age=0 User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.63 Safari/534.3 Response Headers HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 10 Oct 2010 07:35:04 GMT Server: Apache content-style-type: text/css Expires: Thu, 10 Oct 2030 03:50:23 GMT Cache-Control: max-age=631138519, public Content-Encoding: gzip Vary: Accept-Encoding Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/css Connection: Keep-Alive Could it be something to do with the request headers being sent as a document and the response headers returned as a css file? If so, how should I control the request headers? Thanks for any help.
