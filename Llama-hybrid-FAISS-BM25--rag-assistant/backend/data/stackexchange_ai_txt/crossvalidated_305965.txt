Can I use the CLR (centered log-ratio transformation) to prepare data for PCA?

I am using a script. It is for core records. I have a dataframe which shows the different elemental compositions in the columns over a given depth (in the first column). I want to perform a PCA with it and I am confused about the standardization method I have to choose. Has anyone of you used the clr() to prepare your data for the prcomp() ? Or does it adulterate my solutions. I have tried using the clr() on the data before using the prcomp() function in addition to using the attribute scale in prcomp() . data_f_clr https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/prcomp.html scale is described to scale the data, so they have unit variance. Since my data have a very different scale that is what i wanted, I think. The problem is, that I receive a different solution, when I use the code above or when I skip the clr() (which makes the more wanted result). But I want to know why is the clr() disturbing in that case?
