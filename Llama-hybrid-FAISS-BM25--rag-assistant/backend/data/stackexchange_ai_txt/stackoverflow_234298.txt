Pre 3.5 and without access to the machine itself or machine/domain policy, I think you're out of luck. The brute force approach is to go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > MS .NET Framework X.X Wizards > Adjust .NET Security on each machine and set the security level for the Local Intranet zone to FullTrust. The security risk with this approach is that now you're trusting all .NET code that's available on your intranet, which may not be what your organisation wants. The more surgical approach is to give your .NET assemblies a strong name by signing them with your development team's private key (which can be generated by .NET). Then do a once-only install of a policy on your users' machines that trusts all assemblies signed with your team's key. Now all of your team's .NET assemblies will be fully-trusted no matter where they're physically located.
