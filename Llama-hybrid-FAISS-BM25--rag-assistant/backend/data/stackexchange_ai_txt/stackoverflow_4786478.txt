string str1 = dr["RAGStatusCID"].ToString(); This calls the .ToString() method on the object returned from the dr["RAGStatusCID"] call. It is guaranteed to return a string or null. string str2 = (string)dr["Description"]; This attempts to cast the object returned by dr["Description"] to a string. If the object returned is not a string, then an exception is thrown.
