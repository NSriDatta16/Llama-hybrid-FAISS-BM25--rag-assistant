Anomaly detection on time series

I'm a beginner using machine learning (I finished Ng's course), I'm using scikit-learn in python. I want to find the best way to detect anomalies in our system. We have ongoing events that occur at a schedule (every few min/hours), and I want to detect when something abnormal happens. Example data: ID | epoch-time | duration (Sec) | status | is_manual 0400 | 1488801454 | 500 | completed | 1 0401 | 1488805055 | 500 | completed | 1 0402 | 1488812254 | 40000 | failed | 1 6831 | 1488805050 | 200 | failed | 0 . ... (Millions of examples) . 0014 | 1488805055 | 1200 | completed | 0 so for example event ID 0400 occurs once every hour. I want to tell when it does not run. What I plan to do is feed the algorithm all the events from the last 10 minutes. Main questions: How to treat the ID column? What is the best approach I should take?
