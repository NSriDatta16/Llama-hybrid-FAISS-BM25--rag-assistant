Have you looked at sweepers? I use them heavily in some of my apps and they work well and keep the caching separate from your model. Instead of clearing the cache in the model, you create a sweeper that observes for changes. You can specify when to clear the cache based on save, update, etc. Saves you from coding that stuff directly in the model. Just create a directory like app/sweepers and drop in one for each model you want to clear cache for. This specific example is for action cache, but you can probably apply something similar to your fragments. class WidgetSweeper "widgets",:action=>"show",:id=>widget.id) expire_action(:controller=>"widgets",:action=>"index") end end I did a writeup on action and fragment caching here with more details including how to cache based on conditions: http://www.cowboycoded.com/2010/07/14/performance-exercise-1-rails-cache-cash/
