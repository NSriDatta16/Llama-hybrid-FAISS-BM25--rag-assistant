Does discriminator converge to probability 0.5 in GAN just for the output of generator?

We know that in GANs, discriminator converges to 0.5. I want to become sure that the following statement is true: Discriminator converges to 0.5 for the examples generated by generator and for the real examples; but for the examples that are not as good as the real instances, the discriminator is sure that it is a fake example. In other words, for real instances or instances generated by the trained generator $P_D(x)=0.5$ ; but for samples that are a little deviated from the true distribution $P_D(x)=1$ . This is because after training the GAN, both generator and discriminator are good, so the discriminator is really good at detecting out-of-distribution samples.
