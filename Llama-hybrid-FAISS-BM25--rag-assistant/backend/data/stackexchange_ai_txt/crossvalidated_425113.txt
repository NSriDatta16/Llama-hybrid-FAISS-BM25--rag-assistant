You haven't really analyzed the setup of the raven paradox; or rather, you've analyzed an extremely constrained variant of it. You say: We now observe a number of green frogs... Since we did not make any other sightings... You started from a uniform prior and observed a universe consisting only of green frogs. Of course your subjective probability of $P(GF)$ is going to tend towards 1, and of course your subjective probability for the other three cases is going to tend towards zero. That's what I'd think to, if literally every thing I'd seen since birth was a green frog. Since you've never observed either a black frog nor a raven of any kind, you never had an opportunity to update your prior about $P(B|R)$ in any way, so of course it sticks stubbornly at $\frac{1}{2}$ . If you do your analysis again and allow for a non-zero number of observations of BF or BR, you'll get an answer closer to the standard Bayesian analysis you mentioned.
