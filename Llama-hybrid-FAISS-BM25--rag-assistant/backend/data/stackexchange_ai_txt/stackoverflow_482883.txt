Getting a Google API Account

What URL can I visit to get myself a Google API Account? While sites point to http://www.google.com/apis and talk of "easy steps", I just can't figure it out. Background: There are places on the web that offer google services if you give them your Google API account key (in my case http://www.freesitemapgenerator.com and index retrieval). They say to go to http://www.google.com/apis , but that just redirects me to http://code.google.com . There are no "easy instructions" for me to follow to get an account. Am I going crazy here? (I have analytics and webmaster tools etc activated, so I somewhat know what I'm doing).
