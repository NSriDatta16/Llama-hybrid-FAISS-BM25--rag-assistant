Can the new client networking stack in Silverlight 3 directly connect to Azure Storage or Mesh?

From Tim Heuer : In Silverlight 3 weâ€™ve introduced the Client HTTP stack as an option as well. You must opt-in to use the client HTTP handling. This gives you the ability to go more than just GET/POST (i.e., more REST-ful verbs), using response status codes/headers, etc. You can opt-in to use the client HTTP stack on all requests, requests for a specific domain, or on a per-request basis like this: HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequestCreator.ClientHttp.Create(new Uri( http://api.search.live.net/qson.aspx?query=Silverlight)); My understanding is that the reason Silverlight couldn't directly access Azure Storage is that it was unable to sign the HTTP headers with authentication data. Would this bridge the gap and allow direct access to Azure Storage or Mesh? If so, how is that accomplished?
