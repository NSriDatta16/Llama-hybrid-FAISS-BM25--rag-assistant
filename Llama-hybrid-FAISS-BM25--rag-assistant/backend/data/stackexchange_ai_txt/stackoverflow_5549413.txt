What should i do to avoid single point of failure in cassandra?

I am using phpcassa library to get and set data into cassandra which i have installed on 2 servers.... I am making connection with my seed node using CassandraConn::add_node(' . .* . **', 9160); so while insertion automatically gets replicate on other node in cluster... but if my seed node dies (if i shut down the cassandra process) then my insertion will not work and i am unable to get data from the other node too:(, so am i doing the right thing... because in this way their is no use of cluster then.. as ideally if my one node dies in the other node should respond me.. any help will be appreciated?
