Fitting GEV to non-stationary time series of extremes (general stationarity question?)

I'm fitting the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) to a series of annual maxima of variable $X$. $X$ exhibits a linear trend. When I fit the GEV to $X$, I think I have the choice to Use linear regression to compute the slope over time, and remove the slope a) $X_i = B_0 + B_1 \times Y_i + e_i;~ e \sim N(0,Ïƒ^2)$; $Y$ is a time index, e.g., year. b) The residuals, $e$, of the regression are the stationary series, $X_s$ Introduce $Y$ as a co-variate into my ML fit of the GEV distribution So pretty much I can make the time series stationary, then fit the GEV, or I could introduce a co-variate into my GEV fit, and do it all at once. Ultimately I'm asking if I can use the two procedures interchangeably, or if one is more appropriate. For a bit more background, I'm interested in the answer b/c I actually have ~70 independent series of $X$, some of which are stationary, and some of which are not. If I wanted to detrend all of them, " just to be sure ", I'd rather use procedure 1. If I have to use procedure 2, I'd be more selective about which ones I detrended, b/c I don't want to introduce an extra parameter into the ML fit. This seemingly unfair trade-off made me suspicious of the validity of procedure 1: Am I fitting a parameter for free? I'm interested in the GEV parameters and their s.e.'s for each series of $X$, especially the shape parameter. I also want to create plots of "return level" vs. " return time ". The shape of these plots is determined by the GEV shape parameter, but the location parameter (I think) just shifts the return level up or down (i.e., across return time, return level is linear in the location and scale parameters, and nonlinear in the shape parameter).
