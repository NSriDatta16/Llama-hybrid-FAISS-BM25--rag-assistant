You can write a method NumberType findPhoneNumberType(String phoneNumber) { //logic to differentiate between various types of phone numbers. //advantage: you can also check for illegal phone number values. } You can call this method before calling the constructor you have mentioned. NumberType nt = findPhoneNumberType(number); PhoneNumber phoneNumber = new PhoneNumber(number, nt); I would also suggest to use Strings rather than ints for phone numbers.
