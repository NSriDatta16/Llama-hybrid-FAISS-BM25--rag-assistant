Shader Model 3 (SM3) describes the hardware capabilities that Direct3D 9.0c compatible graphics adapters must have (vertex shaders, fragment shaders, dynamic branching, unlimited texture indirections). SM3 is roughly equivalent to OpenGL 2.0. The SM3 generation of hardware is the last generation to have separate, independent processing units for the different stages of the render pipeline rather than the "unified architecture" of SM4 / OpenGL 3.0.
