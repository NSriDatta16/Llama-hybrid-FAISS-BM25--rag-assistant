Just a few thoughts which aren't covered in the link I pasted above ... Big data != data science. If you are a data scientist you may or may not be using big data tools. Your question wasn't clear if you understand this or not, but the distinction is important. There are various careers that 'fit' in the data science spectrum. Instead of repeating them here, I wrote a short blog a while back on building a data analytics team . People often broaden the term data scientist to include most of the elements in the team I describe. Learn some maths - if you don't already. The analytics part of data science is very heavy in maths. Expand on your data analytics algorithms, to include some clustering and classification as they are generally applicable, even if you think you are just going to be dealing with timeseries data.
