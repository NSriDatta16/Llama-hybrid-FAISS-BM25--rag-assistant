CSS cursors. What's the modern and propper way?

When moving over a dragable element I want the cursor to change to a hand and upon mouse down until mouse up I want to change to a "grabbing" hand. What is the proper, cross browser compatible way to do this? Googling this only brings up websites from year two thousand, with tutorials on IE6. BLA! Are there any good MODERN tutorials on this topic out there? If not, someone needs to write one. That'd make an excellent smashing magazine article!
