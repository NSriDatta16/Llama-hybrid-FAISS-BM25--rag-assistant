Your example seems to be a Panel Data rather than a time series, because there are both timestamps and "spatial" stamps (individual). However as the name states, a time series should be ordered by time continuously, that is Table B. But as this is actually a Panel Data that choice might have other consequences, for example if you want to model Dynamic Panel Data, and you have plenty time observations.
