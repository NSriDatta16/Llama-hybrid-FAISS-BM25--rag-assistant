Please provide some code example. Guessing from the text, you should look into the cgi module . Follow the examples, specially the cgi.test() function. cgi — Common Gateway Interface support Support module for Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. This module defines a number of utilities for use by CGI scripts written in Python. Quoting the FieldStorage description (using the cgi module): To get at submitted form data, it’s best to use the FieldStorage class. The other classes defined in this module are provided mostly for backward compatibility. Instantiate it exactly once, without arguments. This reads the form contents from standard input or the environment (depending on the value of various environment variables set according to the CGI standard). Since it may consume standard input, it should be instantiated only once.
