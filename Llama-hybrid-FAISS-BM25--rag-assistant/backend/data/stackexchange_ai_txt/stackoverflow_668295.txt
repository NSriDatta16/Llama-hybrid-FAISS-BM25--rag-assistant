This is generally done by a compiler directive. In C it will be a #pragma, and in Delphi Pascal it's {$O-}, {$O+} around the code in question. The precise syntax and method is implementation specific, so it's a question of checking the documentation for whatever system you are using. Not optimising a function away is quite straightforward, but once or twice I've seen cases where it's been necessary to tell the compiler not to optimise specific code. This is extremely rare and not something I've come across for a very long time, but it can occasionally happen. Cases where it does are generally where one is compiling against some old legacy code that was built before a later development in cpu technology - hyperthreading being a classic case in point.
