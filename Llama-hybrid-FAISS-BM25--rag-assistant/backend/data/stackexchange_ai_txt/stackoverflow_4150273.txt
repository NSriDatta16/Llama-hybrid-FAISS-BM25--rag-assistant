Not sure that ' application/json ' is supported as a valid enctype. According to the HTML401 specification: "W3C User agents must support the content types listed below (application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data). Behavior for other content types is unspecified." http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#form-content-type So I guess that support for this is down to the browser vendor. If you want to mimic the way jQuery and other javascript libraries work then you'll be using an xmlhttp request to post your data instead of using a FORM element, you dont need to tell the server what kind of content type you'll be sending when you do this, the server will assume (rightfully) that you are using application/x-www-form-urlencoded .
