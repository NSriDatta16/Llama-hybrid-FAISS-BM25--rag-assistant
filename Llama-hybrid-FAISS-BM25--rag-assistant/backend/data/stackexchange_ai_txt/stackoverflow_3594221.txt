How to create custom view with two independent sections, each slideable? I doubt that would be a "custom view" in Android. The main Zillow-style activity would be a MapView , a ListView , and an ImageView (for the photo), using LinearLayouts or a RelativeLayout for organization. I was wondering if this can also be done on the home screen and not only in new app... If you write your own home screen, sure.
