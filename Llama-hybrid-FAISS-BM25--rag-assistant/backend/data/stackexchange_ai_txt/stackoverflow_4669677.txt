Make param1 and param2 managed properties so that JSF will set them during bean's construction. @ManagedProperty(value="#{param.param1}") private String param1; @ManagedProperty(value="#{param.param2}") private String param2; (or if you're still on JSF 1.x, then you need to declare them as in faces-config.xml file instead) Then you can do the DB retrieval job in a postconstruct method which will be invoked directly after bean's construction and all managed property setting. @PostConstruct public void init() { this.result = someDAO.find(param1, param2); } (or if you're still on JSF 1.1 or older, then you need to upgrade to at least JSF 1.2 or better JSF 2.x) Finally just reference the result in the view. Your result is: #{bean.result} An alternative to @ManagedProperty in JSF 2.0 is the in the view. This allows for more fine-grained control of validation and conversion of them.
