Counting occurrences in a vector

This program reads strings of numbers from a txt file, converts them to integers, stores them in a vector, and then tries to output them in an organized fashion like so.... If txt file says: 7 5 5 7 3 117 5 The program outputs: 3 5 3 7 2 117 so if the number occurs more than once it outputs how many times that happens. Here is the code so far. #include "std_lib_facilities.h" int str_to_int(string& s) { stringstream ss(s); int num; ss >> num; return num; } int main() { cout > file; ifstream f(file.c_str(), ios::in); string num; vector numbers; while(f>>num) { int number = str_to_int(num); numbers.push_back(number); } sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end()); for(int i = 0; i Edit: Program is getting stuck. Looking for an infinite loop right now.
