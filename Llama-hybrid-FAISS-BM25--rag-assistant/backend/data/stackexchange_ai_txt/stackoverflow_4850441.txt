#pragma managed(push, off) Sets managed compilation option to the code after this line to off, and pushes to the stack previously active managed option. #pragma managed(pop) Restores last managed state from the stack. Code between these two lines is compiled as unmanaged. Code after pop line is compiled with the same option, as before the push line, whether it was managed or unmanaged.
