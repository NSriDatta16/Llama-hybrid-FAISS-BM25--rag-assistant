If your code is short enough to copy and paste, you might want to post it as a Python recipe . That site is a great resource for learning Python techniques and its best contents have been compiled into a book . If your code is reusable as-is then you should post your Python code in the Python Package Index (pypi). Organize your source code, read this tutorial on how to write a setup.py for your package. Once you have your free pypi account and have written setup.py , run python setup.py register to claim your package's name and post its metadata to the index. setup.py can also upload your package's source or binaries to pypi, for example python setup.py sdist upload would build and upload the s ource dist ribution. Once your package is a part of the Python Package Index, other Python programmers can download and install it automatically with a number of tools including easy_install your_package .
