I think mixed-effects logistic regression is enough. Two individuals as observations (level-1) are nested within each trial (level-2). You can add some individual's characteristics to explain the probability to win. It is reasonable to set some random effects to account for the correlation of two individuals within a trial. If you are more interested in "population-averaged" effects, you may use generalized estimation equations (GEE) to estimate the model. Of course, you can also try other link functions for the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), e.g. probit function or complementary-log-log function.
