Support Vector Machines (SVM) represent data examples as points in space and tries to create a mapping with a wide as possible gap between the separate categories. The data examples closest to the gap are called "support vectors". Those support vectors define the SVM classifier. If you are able to identify the support vectors, you can ignore all other data points and dimensions. Thus SVM can efficiently handle sparse data.
