You have a very exotic, but interesting question. It it correct that the only possibility to produce symbol table inside of COFF is usage of /Zd compiler switch which are supported till Visual C++ 6.0 and use the old linker switch /debugtype:coff (see http://www.debuginfo.com/articles/gendebuginfo.html#gendebuginfovc6 )? Is there any possibility to produce symbol table inside of COFF with at least Visual Studio 2008? My idea is try to produce a PE with a symbol table of storage class IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL and the section number 0 (IMAGE_SYM_UNDEFINED) with respect of linker switch /FORCE (/FORCE:UNRESOLVED or /FORCE:MULTIPLE) and an unresolved symbol either by /INCLUDE:dummySymbol or by /NODEFAULTLIB. My problem is that it's not easy to produce symbol table inside of COFF. Where you receive the test PEs?
