Qt designer plugin does not load in Eclipse CDT

I have installed the Qwt widgets and they run fine in Qt Creator and QT 4 Designer; however when I run the QT Designer via Eclipse CDT they don't show up. Any ideas what is wrong? I am on x32 Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and running Eclipse CDT 3.4.2 (Ganymede). Note the Qt add in otherwise is working fine and I can create and debug projects - but the additional widgets is the only thing not showing up. I also have checked the paths and ensured everything is there as far as I can tell. But of course something is not right. Here are the paths where I have checked this (NOTE: Eclipse is installed in /opt/eclipse) /usr/share/qt4/plugins/ /usr/local/lib /opt/eclipse/plugins/com.trolltech.qtcppdesignerplugins.linux.x86/dependentlibs /opt/eclipse/plugins/com.trolltech.qtcppdesigner.linux.x86_1.6.0/lib Thanks.
