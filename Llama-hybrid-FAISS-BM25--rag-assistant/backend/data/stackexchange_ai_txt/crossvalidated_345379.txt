Do I need stationary time series for Bayesian structural time series (BSTS)?

I'm trying to model with BSTS, with exogenous variables. It appears that my y-sequence is not stationary. Do I need to diff that to stationary? Or could BSTS handle that? P.S. I'm using R package bsts Thank you for your time! All the best, Kathy
