I use paperclip with S3 with default images in the public folder. It works fine. My default_url statement looks like this: :default_url => '/images/:attachment/missing_:style.png' which means that for my attachment named avatar, setup with the styles small and large, I must create and put these images in the public dir: /images/avatar/missing_small.png /images/avatar/missing_large.png It's pretty well documented . For your reference, or in the case the problem is really somewhere else, here is my full paperclip statement: has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :small => '60x60#', :large => '300x300#' }, :default_style => :large, :storage => :s3, :default_url => '/images/:attachment/missing_:style.png', :path => "users/:id/avatar/:style.:extension", :bucket => "bucket name", :s3_credentials => { :access_key_id => "access key id", :secret_access_key => "secret access key" }, :url => ":s3_alias_url", # These two are only required when you alias S3 - e.g. want to use cdn.example.com rather than s3.amazonaws.com :s3_host_alias => "my.aws.alias"
