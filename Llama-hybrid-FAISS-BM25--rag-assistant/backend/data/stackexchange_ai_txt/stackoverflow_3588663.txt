Replication and SQL Agent configuration is stored in the MSDB system database. If the server you are migrating to has the same version of SQL Server as the source server, you should be able to restore the msdb database along with your user database to get the replication configuration back. You will also need to bring over the security information from the source server to the target server. This information is stored in the master database, so you may be able to backup and restore the master database on the new server, or script out the logins and restore them on the new server.
