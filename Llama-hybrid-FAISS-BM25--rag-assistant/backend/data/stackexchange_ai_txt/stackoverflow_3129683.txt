If you were to succeed with using Paperclip for this, how would you get rid of the uploaded image once you no longer needed it? Without a database or some other form of persistent storage, how would you know where the image had been stored? I think that you have some conceptual issues here that you should rethink before you start hacking up tableless models that accept image uploads. But, if for some reason you really want to do it this way, then I would suggest just uploading the image without the benefit of a gem like Paperclip, which is really intended to make it easier to associate files with ActiveRecord objects. Just google for how you upload a file in Ruby, it's not really all that difficult.
