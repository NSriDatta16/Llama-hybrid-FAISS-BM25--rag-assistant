SVM is minimizing hinge loss with ridge regularization $$ \min_\mathbf w \sum_i(1-y_i \mathbf w\cdot \mathbf x_i)_+ +\lambda ||\mathbf w||^2 $$ So, the scaling will make differences when we have the regularization term. My hypothesis would be the original scale of your features impacts regularization on different features and make the performance better, but after the scaling, that disappears. For example, you have 2 features, the first feature is in scale of $10,000$ and second feature is in scale of $0.1$. if you do not perform scaling, the SVM will regularize much more on 2nd feature, and almost have no effects for the weight of on 1st feature. if you do perform scaling, the SVM will regularize both features equally You can validate my hypothesis to check the "feature importance" in your data. If you see, features in larger magnitude is much more important, at the same time you have "many useless features" in small scale. Then, my hypothesis might be right.
