I don't know any elegant ways to do this but my first shot would be something like this.. Sequence Container with the proc that has to run first. In that same sequence container put a script task that just waits 5-10 seconds or so before each of the 10 independent steps can run. Then chain the rest of the procs below that sequence container.
