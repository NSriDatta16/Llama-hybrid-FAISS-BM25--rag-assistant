Node classification/regression with Node2Vec

My question is about the correct use of Node2Vec for learning features for node classification/regression. Suppose we have n labeled networks (i.e., networks for which the classes/continuous values of the nodes are known) and m unlabeled networks. Both types of networks are isolated (i.e., the nodes of a given n or m network do not interact with the nodes of another n or m network). The goal is to predict the correct classes/continuous values for the nodes in the unlabeled networks. The approach I was thinking of using is: Use a single Node2Vec run to learn the embedding vectors for all of the nodes in all networks, both labeled and unlabeled. Train a supervised machine learning algorithm using the output of step 1 and the known classes/continuous values. Use the trained machine learning algorithm from step 2 to predict the classes/continuous values of all of the nodes in the unlabeled networks. Is this the correct approach? *A similar scenario is described in the documentation of stellargraph , although for a single labeled network.
