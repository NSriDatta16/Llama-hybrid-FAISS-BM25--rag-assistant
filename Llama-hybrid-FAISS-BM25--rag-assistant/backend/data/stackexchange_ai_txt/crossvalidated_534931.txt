Measure to capture within-chain fluctuations in MCMC?

I am using two kinds of updates for a particular parameter in MCMC estimation of my model. First update gives the following trace plot: Second update gives the following trace plot: Note that the acceptance densities are slightly different in the two kinds of updates. As you can see, the trace plot for the second type of update fluctuates much more. I wonder whether there is a "measure" that captures this fluctuation. Both chains end up having the same mean and STD, so those don't help. Is there something I could measure in order to keep track of this kind of within-chain fluctuation? Thanks for reading.
