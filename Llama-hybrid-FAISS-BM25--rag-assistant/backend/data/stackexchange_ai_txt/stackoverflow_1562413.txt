iPhone SDK view scrolling not rubber banding or using momentum from swipes

I'm having a fundamental problem with getting scrolling to work normally on my iPhone app. I have two views, each created in IB (although I've tried this programmatically and it makes no difference) which scroll very sloppily. Instead of the scrolling that we're used to (which is smooth and continues to scroll and eventually dampen and rubber band at the top/bottom), my scrolling only scrolls as long as my finger is in contact with the view. Swiping down quickly on a view has no more effect than swiping slowly. And when you scroll beyond the top or bottom, the view just stays there scrolled with empty area above/below. One of my views is a UITableView and the other is a UIScrollView. Both have exactly the same problem and are in different XIBs, coupled to different classes, so this is why I think I'm missing a key concept in general. My UITableView is a child to a UIView (since there is also a nav bar at the top) with my UIViewController's view connected to the UIView. The referencing outlets datasource and delegate are both hooked to the UITableView. Nothing is subclassed here aside from the ViewController of course which has overrides to populate the table. In the second instance, I again have a non-subclassed UIView which my UIViewController's view is connected to. I have a subclassed UIScrollView as a child to the UIView and then a have a subclassed UIView (with larger size than the scroll view) as a child to the subclassed UIScrollView. This in itself seems ridiculously complicated to me, but I was not able to get scrolling working at all with fewer than 3 views (again there is a nav bar at the top of the non-subclassed UI-View). I am overriding drawRect: in my UIScrollView, which is putting the content up fine except for this scrolling issue. Is there something I'm doing wrong organizationally? I've come across many suggestions on stackoverflow and other sites for UIScrollView and none make a difference. And I don't see anyone having scrolling issues with UITableView. I'm not pasting in any code because I would have to post full classes at this point (making the post ridiculously long) and I believe the problems to really lie with the way I'm using IB. Thanks!!
