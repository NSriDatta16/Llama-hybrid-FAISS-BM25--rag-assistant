If you add a column to a hive table, only the underlying metastore is updated. The required storage space is not increased as long as you do not add data The change can be made while other processes are accessing the table The change is very quick (only the underlying metastore is updated) You do not have to change the underlying files. Existing records have the value null for the new column I hope this helps.
