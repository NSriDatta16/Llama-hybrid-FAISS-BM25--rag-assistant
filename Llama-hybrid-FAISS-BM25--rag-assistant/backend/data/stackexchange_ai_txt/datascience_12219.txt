Difference: Replicator Neural Network vs. Autoencoder

I'm currently studying papers about outlier detection using RNN's (Replicator Neural Networks) and wonder what is the particular difference to Autoencoders? RNN's seem to be treaded for many as the holy grail of outlier/anomaly detection, however the idea seems to be pretty old to, as autoencoders have been there for a long while.
