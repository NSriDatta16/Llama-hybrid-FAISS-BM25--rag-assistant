Determining correlated product categories using store purchase history

I have a large dataset that contains product purchase history, like so: userID productID category subcategory 123 ABC Kitchen Knives 123 BEA Kitchen Organization 233 ZZS Electronics Phones For a first project, I'm looking to answer the question: "What discrete groups of categories/subcategories do shoppers tend to shop in?". For example, we may find that shoppers who buy Monitors are highly likely to buy Keyboards and Mice as well. Any direction on getting started on a problem like this is appreciated!
