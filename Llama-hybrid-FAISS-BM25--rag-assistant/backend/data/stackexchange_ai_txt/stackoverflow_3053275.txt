powerbuilder: link a drop down datawindow with its parent window

I have a datawindow(let its name be parent), in which I am displaying another datawindow(let us call it the child) as a drop down list. The parent takes two retrieval argument, named org_id and pccc_id . The child takes one retrieval argument named org_id , which should have the same value as the parent's org_id . Now I want to link these two retrieval arguments. How can I do that ?
