Not sure if this helps but ... I had some similar problem (generating CSV content on the fly) long time ago and all I can remember is that it had to do something with right Response methods being called. The code was something like this Response.Clear(); Response.Buffer = true; Response.AppendHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=export.csv"); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private); Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.MinValue); Response.Cache.SetLastModified(DateTime.Now); Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(1)); Response.ContentType = "text/csv"; Response.ContentEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode; ... //Some writing to the Response.OutputStream ... Response.Flush(); //I am not sure about the following line: Response.End();
