Method named 'BEST' in multivariate analysis - what is it?

I've read a few ecological papers where a 'BEST' procedure is used to assess effect of environmental parameters on biological community composition, after multivariate analysis like MDS. For instance in Kimball et al. (2014) : " Effects of environmental parameters (temperature and salinity) on community composition were analyzed with BEST relating the species abundance matrix to the Euclidean distance matrix of environmental parameters (normalized 30-day pre-collection average). " Unfortunately, no reference is given for this method and obviously when I try to look for 'BEST analysis' or 'BEST procedure', the results are not relevant. Does anyone know something about this method or any scientific reference about it ? Thanks ! Reference : Kimball, Matthew E., Wendy E. Eash-Loucks, et Kathryn M.
