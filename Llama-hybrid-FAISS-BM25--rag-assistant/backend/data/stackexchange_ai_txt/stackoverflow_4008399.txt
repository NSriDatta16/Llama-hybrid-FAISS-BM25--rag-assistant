You began by saying that you can't find an iterative implementation, so as a kind of answer to your question I'll offer one. Start with an array containing as many integers as you have sets, beginning with them all at 0. Each integer represents one set. const unsigned int x = 3; unsigned int *ar = calloc(x, sizeof(unsigned int)); Now, count upwards as if your array was an odometer, but with each digit rolling over when it reaches the number of elements in the corresponding set. You can then read off the elements by taking them from the sets using the index in your array: {0, 0, 0} = {1, 2, 4} {0, 0, 1} = {1, 2, 5} ... {0, 1, 2} = {1, 3, 6} And 0, 1, 2 is the last one before the whole array rolls over again.
