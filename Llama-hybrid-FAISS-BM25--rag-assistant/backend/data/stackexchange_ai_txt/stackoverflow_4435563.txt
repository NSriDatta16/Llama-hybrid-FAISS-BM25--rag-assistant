speed of parsing json structures

I want to make a simple database system, amd possibly use JSON as the main data format for importing and exporting (including full database backups) . So my question is: how fast is it to parse JSON, even from big JSON structures (think gigabytes), in comparison to speed when importing from other systems (like (faster) binary files, or (slower) XML)? EDIT: to clarify, I am wondering how fast it is to parse JSON (into some internal database format), but not how fast it would be as an internal storage mechanism. So this JSON data would not be queried etc., but just parsed into another format. Also, my main intent asking this question is I am wondering if JSON is any easier to parse than XML because of smaller delimiters (']' or '}' instead of '' or ''), and if it is maybe even similar in speed to binary formats because of the quite simple delimiters. (For example, maybe json can be parsed something like this: record delimiter = ascii code xx (xx being a brace or bracket) except where preceded by ascii xx (xx being some escape char).)
