Overview of Machine Learning To get a good overview of the field, watch the video lectures of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course . This course (CS229) -- taught by Professor Andrew Ng -- provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, learning theory, reinforcement learning and adaptive control. Recent applications of machine learning, such as to robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing are also discussed. Classifiers As for which classifier you should use, I'd recommend first starting with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for general applied classification tasks. They'll give you state-of-the-art performance, and you don't really need to understand all of the theory behind them to just use the implementation provided by a package like WEKA. If you have a larger data-set, you might want to try using Random Forests . There's also an implementation of this algorithm in WEKA, and they train much faster on large data. While they're less broadly used than SVMs, their accuracy tends to match or nearly match the accuracy you could get from one.
