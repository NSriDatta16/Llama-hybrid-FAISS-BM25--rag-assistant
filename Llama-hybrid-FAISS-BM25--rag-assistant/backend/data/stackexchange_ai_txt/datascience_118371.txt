Some answers given by ChatGPT are just beyond ridiculous, what could be the reasons?

Some answers given by ChatGPT are just beyond ridiculous, especially in Chinese (I am Chinese so I ask ChatGPT in both Chinese and English). Here is an example, The last answer 阉割政策是满清末期中国强制对男性实施阉割的政策。这一政策是为了限制人口增长和减少国家财政负担，但是它对受害者造成了巨大的心理和生理影响。阉割政策也破坏了中国传统文化中对男性身份和角色的认识，并对整个社会造成了深远的影响。该政策在1911年的中华民国成立后终止，但对中国文化和历史的影响一直持续到今天。 which means The castration policy was a policy of mandatory castration of men in China in the late Qing Dynasty. This policy was intended to limit population growth and reduce the financial burden on the state, but it had a huge psychological and physical impact on the victims. The castration policy has also undermined traditional Chinese cultural understandings of masculinity and roles and has had a profound impact on society as a whole. The policy ended after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911, but its influence on Chinese culture and history continues to this day. That is just absurd! And I have many examples like that. Apparently, its Chinese corpus has something to do with it. What other things have gone wrong?
