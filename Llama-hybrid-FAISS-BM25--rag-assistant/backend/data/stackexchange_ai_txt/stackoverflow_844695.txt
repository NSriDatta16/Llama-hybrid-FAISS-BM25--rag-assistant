The other solution, which is what I do, is every time you find yourself creating an action that doesn't fit into the RESTful actions, eg Search, so you might find yourself making a search action on an Article controller, what you could do instead of creating this action is create a Search controller instead, and use RESTful actions inside of that instead. There is no rule saying you need to use all the actions, you might only need one or two, but it keeps your API RESTful and your code organised. This is not a hard and fast rule, but I have certainly found it helpful when I try to decide where to put stuff.
