Suppose you have 20 trials and observe 5 successes. Using your prior, the following R code gives a 95% Bayesian posterior interval $(.501, .630)$ for the proportion of successes. Another run with a different seed gave $(.501, .629).$ [Maybe for fewer than 10 successes, you'd prefer a one-sided 95% interval, $(.5, .609).]$ set.seed(815) m = 10^7 p = runif(m, .5, 1) # prior x = rbinom(m, 20, p) pp = p[x == 5] length(pp) [1] 12951 # sufficient nr of cases hist(pp, prob=T, col="skyblue2", main="Posterior") q = as.numeric(quantile(pp, c(.025,.975))); q [1] 0.5011254 0.6304784 abline(v=q, col="red", lwd=2) If you got 18 successes in 20, then the Bayesian interval would be $(0.696, .970)$ and a frequentist Agresti-Coull interval $(0.684, .982).$
