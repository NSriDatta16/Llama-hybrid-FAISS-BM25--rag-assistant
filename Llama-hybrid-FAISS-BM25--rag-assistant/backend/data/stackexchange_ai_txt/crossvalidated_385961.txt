You should try logistic regression. Let $x=\text{number of clicks}$ , $n=\text{number of impressions}$ . Then $\text{CTR}=x/n$ , and in modeling that proportion directly you loose information. A logistic regression (possibly quasibinomial) gets at least the variance structure correct. In R you could do something like: mod A similar post with answer and example is Count explanatory variable, proportion dependent variable EDIT Good that you have tried some of my suggestions. Here some answers to your further edits: Look at this part of the output *Dispersion parameter for quasibinomial family * do there seem to be a substantial reduction? Look at the Deviance Residuals: from the output. Maybe most of the difference is in the extremes, but you could extract all of the residuals by resid(your_glm_object, type="deviance") and then plot against each other the residuals for each model, or their histograms. There is a version of AIC for quasi-models called QAIC (similar for BIC I suppose). A small paper about this in R (by Ben Bolker) is here . QAIC is implemented in some R packages, listed there. Getting predictions from this models: Use something like predict(your_glm_object, type="response", newdata=your_data_frame_with_new_data) For details see ?predict.glm .
