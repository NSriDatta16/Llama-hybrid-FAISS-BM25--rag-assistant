Not directly, but look at SQL Jobs . A job is a specified series of operations performed sequentially by SQL Server Agent. A job can perform a wide range of activities, including running Transact-SQL scripts, command-line applications, Microsoft ActiveX scripts, Integration Services packages, Analysis Services commands and queries, or Replication tasks. Jobs can run repetitive tasks or those that can be scheduled , and they can automatically notify users of job status by generating alerts, thereby greatly simplifying SQL Server administration.
