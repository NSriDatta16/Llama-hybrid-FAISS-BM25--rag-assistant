Primefaces Sortable dataGrid component not possible?

I looked over the component showcase and documentation and maybe I missed it but I was looking to make a component sortable, especially the dataGrid or dataList. The pick list has the sortable behavior but I don't see how to make it work like a sortable dataGrid or dataList. Something similar to this http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ I currently have two parts of the page. The bottom part is a draggable set of images and the top part is the drop zone to add those images to. Once I drag from the bootom to the top drop zone I want to be able to let the user reorder those images up top.. Any suggestions?
