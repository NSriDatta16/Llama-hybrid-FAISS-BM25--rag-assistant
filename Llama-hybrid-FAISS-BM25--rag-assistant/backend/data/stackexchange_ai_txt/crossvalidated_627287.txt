To a Bayesian, does a trick coin with two heads have 50% chance of flipping heads if they don't know that it has two heads? This sentence is a bit weird. How can a statistician contemplate the probability of a certain coin with two heads if they don't know it has two heads? The contemplated coin with it's properties is something that is assumed to be known. We use expressions like $P(\text{heads | trick coin})$ , the probability of heads given that it is known that the coin is a trick coin with two heads . What is possible is that a statistician is thinking about the probability of heads for a some unknown coin that is in reality a trick coin but they don't know that it is a trick coin. Yet, that statistician will have a model for a hypothetical trick coin that is: A trick coin with two heads has 100% chance of flipping heads. Note the Bayes rule: $$ P(\text{trick coin | heads}) \propto P(\text{heads | trick coin}) \cdot P(\text{trick coin})$$ The statistician may not need to know whether some coin is a trick coin (ie. the prior is $0 ). But, the statistician will model the outcomes of a trick coin as $P(\text{heads | trick coin}) = 1$ and not $P(\text{heads | trick coin}) = 0.5$ .
