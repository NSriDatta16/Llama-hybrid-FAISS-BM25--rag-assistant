Guidance needed ASP.Net app connection string

Net 2.0 / Visual Studio 2005 / ASP.Net web app I read many posts and comments on this site but either some are too confusing to follow for me or others don't meet my requirement. So I have a 3 tier application - UI, BLL, DAL. In my DAL, I created DataSets by draggin storedprocedures from the Server Explorer. So the connection string got hardcoded into the dataset file. I would appreciate someone explaining simple step-by-step what I must to so that when I pass connection string in the UI (main projects) Settings designer down to the BLL and thenn down to the DAL.
