Logistic Regression classifier works well during cross validation but fails on production data. Any suggestions why?

I generated a Logistic Regression classifier and tested it using k (10) fold cross validation. The Accuracy was about 81.8 and confusion matrix showed acceptable results on both classes (A& B): Recall: Precision: a: 0.4157303370786517 0.578125 b: 0.9215876089060987 0.8592057761732852 Before deploying the model to production I generated an overall version (based on the whole training set without cross validation) and tested it on the production data gap (from the time we took the training data until now). The thing is results now were horrible - accuracy of about 79.6 and classification that was almost totally biased to one side, see the confusion matrix - Recall: Precision: a: 0.013245033112582781 0.4444444444444444 b: 0.995777027027027 0.7982396750169262 Any suggestions why it can happen?
