Your best bet might be to look into a HTML Decoding UDF. I did a quick search and found this one: http://www.andreabertolotto.net/Articles/HTMLDecodeUDF.aspx You may want to modify it so it only decodes &gt; and &lt; . The one above seems to go above and beyond your needs. UPDATE @Cyberkiwi's solution seems to be a bit cleaner. I will leave this up in case the version of SQL Server you are running doesn't support his solution.
