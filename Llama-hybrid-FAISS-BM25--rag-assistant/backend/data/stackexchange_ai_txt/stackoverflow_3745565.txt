In terms of simulation systems, I recommend you search for "agent-based modeling" software. There are a lot of free toolkits available. The two I like the most are NetLogo and Repast. Also, it looks like you are implementing a "genetic algorithm". There are many good books and pages on that topic. Python is good, but so are many other languages. Most of your time will be spent doing the graphics: animating the fish so they look realistic. Unless you can find a free fish-animation-library.
