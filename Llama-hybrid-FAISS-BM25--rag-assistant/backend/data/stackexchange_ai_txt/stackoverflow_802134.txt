Changing user agent on urllib2.urlopen

How can I download a webpage with a user agent other than the default one on urllib2.urlopen ? urllib2.urlopen is not available in Python 3.x ; the 3.x equivalent is urllib.request.urlopen . See Changing User Agent in Python 3 for urrlib.request.urlopen to set the user agent in 3.x with the standard library HTTP facilities.
