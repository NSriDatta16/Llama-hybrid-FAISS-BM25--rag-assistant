I agree with Franks answer that you have effectively overfit in your approach. An important point: You are only using training and testing. By searching for the approach that performs best on testing, you are fitting to the test data. Any time you use a chunk of data to search through a possible space (whether thatâ€™s find best coefficients for a regression or choosing between RNN and CNN) you are by definition fitting to that data. A more robust approach would be to do a 3 part split: Training, Validation and Testing. Training is used to fit a particular model. Validation is used to search through the space of models. Testing is used to check that your favourite model from validation stills performs well OOS.
