OpenGL's fixed function pipeline does illumination only at vertices and then just interpolates. Since the walls of your rooms are just very large quads, every wall has only 4 vertices, so only 4 lighting calculations happen. For a spotlight effect you'd need a lot more lighting calculations. So you've to refine (i.e. tesselate) the walls' meshes, or use per pixel lighting (i.e. do lighting calculations on the fragment level â€“ this is done using shaders).
