Best option for embedding fonts in webpage (SEO, speed, cross-compatibility)

I have a font i've downloaded, its a True Type Font. I'm developing my own portfolio website so i'd like to get it fairly high up in Google (i can do the SEO for it) but i'm wondering what options i have for using this font for menu items, headings, etc..i've checked out Cufon but they wont let me upload it because it wasn't valid. I'd rather not use Flash..what other options have i got?
