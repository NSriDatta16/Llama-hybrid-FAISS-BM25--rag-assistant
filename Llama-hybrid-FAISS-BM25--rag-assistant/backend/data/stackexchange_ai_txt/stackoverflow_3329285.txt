Did you try adjusting the page size ? A table like this might gain from having a different (i.e. the largest?) available page size. PRAGMA page_size = 32768; Or any power of 2 between 512 and 32768. If you change the page_size, don't forget to vacuum the database (assuming you are using SQLite 3.5.8. Otherwise, you can't change it and will need to start a fresh new database). Also, running the operation on floats might not be as fast as running it on integers (big maybe), so that you might gain speed if you record all your coordinates times 1 000 000. Finally, euclydian distance will not yield very accurate proximity results. The further you get from the equator, the more the circle around your point will flatten to ressemble an ellipse. There are fast approximations which are not as calculation intense as a Great Circle Distance Calculation (avoid at all cost!)
