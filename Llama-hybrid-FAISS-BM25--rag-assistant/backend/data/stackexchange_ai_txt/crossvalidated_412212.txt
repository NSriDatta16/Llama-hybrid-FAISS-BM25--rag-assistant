Determining the optimal number of clusters using plots of Bayesian Information Criterion

I am having trouble interpreting the results from an Expectation Maximization clustering using mclust and the Iris flower data, Using R . Reproducible example If one were to investigate Plots 1 and 2, how do these graphics lead one to determine that the optimal number of clusters should be 3?
