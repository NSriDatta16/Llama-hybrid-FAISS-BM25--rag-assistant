How to generate simulation paths for Weibull distribution in R?

I'm trying to generate simulation paths across time in R for survival and hazard functions using the Weibull distribution. Here are the steps I'm taking so far. I need direction because I'm not able to generate simulation paths with the below: First: Here's an example of a single basic hazard curve generated in R which works fine (code followed by image): # function for hazard: weibHaz Second: Generate random numbers from Weibull distribution and store them in simulated_data , using same parameters as in the above hazard curve: set.seed(123) # set a seed for reproducibility simulated_data Third: plot the simulation results (code followed by image): # ts() creates a time series object from the simulated data # frequency = 1 indicates the time series data is not periodic ts_data The third step above obviously shows incorrect results. I need to see 20 curves over 80 time periods. The below image shows the type of simulation paths I've generated before using other data and using autoregressive time-series models. This is the form of output data and plot I'm looking for for the hazard curve generated with the Weibull distribution. Any recommendations for doing this correctly?
