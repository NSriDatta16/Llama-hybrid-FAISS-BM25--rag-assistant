I would suggest you look into how to launch programs from a CDROM with Java Web Start as this appears to be very similar to what you want to do. This allows you full control over the launch process in a standard way, but requires you to create a well-behaved JNLP application. (Note, you need Java 6 installed on each PC for this to work, but then your life will be quite easy on)
