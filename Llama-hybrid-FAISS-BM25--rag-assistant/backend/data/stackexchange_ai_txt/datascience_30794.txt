Principal Component Analysis and abnormal data

I know that PCA is good in differentiating between anomalies and normal data and it helps to differentiate between them when it tries to transfer the data to another dimension. I mean it can somehow maximize the separation between the regular and irregular data points. I also have seen this in my codes. However, someone has asked me to prove it! by a simple detailed example (e.g, a simple 2*2 matrix)? Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.
