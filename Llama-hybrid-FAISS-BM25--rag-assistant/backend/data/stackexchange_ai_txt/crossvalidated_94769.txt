Quantifying applicability domain for predictive models?

I have a big dataset and I want to build a classification model (svm, rf, ann etc.). Then I split the original dataset into training set and test set. I build the model using training set. After it was done, I use the model to predict the test set. Here, the training set and test set should be similar in data structure, that means they are located in the same data domain, right? If the test set is not located the data domain of the training set, then the prediction result for the test set should be worse than those in the train set domain. it is right to express this? So, how can I quantify the applicability domain for a predictive model? that means, when I have the new dataset, how can I check if it located in the applicability domain of the model? some links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicability_domain http://www.moleculardescriptors.eu/tutorials/T7_moleculardescriptors_ad.pdf Any points are appreciated.
