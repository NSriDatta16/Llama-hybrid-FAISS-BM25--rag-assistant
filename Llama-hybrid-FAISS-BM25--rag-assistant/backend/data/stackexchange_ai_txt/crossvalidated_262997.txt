how big was the difference in validation/test accuracy between the two? The performance of the fine-tuned CNN depends upon the size of your dataset and the similarity between your dataset and dataset on which pre-trained CNN was trained. So there is no general pattern in the difference in validation/test accuracy between the two. If training from scratch yielded higher accuracy, how many training images did you have per class? The dataset having 500 - 5000 training images per class is definitely not sufficient to train large models like inception from scratch. To improve the performance of a pre-trained CNN, you should try to backprop till last 2-3 inception block during training on pre-trained inception model. For More detail : Transfer Learning
