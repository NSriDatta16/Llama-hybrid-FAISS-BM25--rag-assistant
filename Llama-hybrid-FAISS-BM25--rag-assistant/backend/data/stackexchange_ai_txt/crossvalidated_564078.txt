It seems like you are trying to obtain an estimate for the discriminative capability of a logistic regression model. Let me propose a fifth method: The optimism corrected bootstrap estimate of the AUC for your model. The optimism bootstrap corrected estimate is discussed in the following books: Elements of Statistical Learning, Regression Modelling Strategies, and Clinical Prediction Models. For a review, I suggest you read these. As compared to the methods you describe, the optimism bootstrap has the benefit of using all the data to estimate the AUC and using all the data to estimate the optimism. No data is held out per se as would be in cross validation. Because you're using python, I will point you to my blog post on the optimism bootstrap here .
