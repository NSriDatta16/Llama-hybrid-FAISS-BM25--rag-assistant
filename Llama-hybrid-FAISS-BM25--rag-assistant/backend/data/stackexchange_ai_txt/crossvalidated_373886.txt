Covariance Estimation of time series with mixed frequencies

I have three times series $x_{1,t}$ , $x_{2,t}$ and $x_{3,t}$ . For the first two time series ( $x_{1,t}$ and $x_{2,t}$ ) I have daily data, but for the last one, I have monthly data (let us assume that it is a daily process, but I can observe it only at month end). How do I estimate the $3\times 3$ covariance matrix for the daily process ?
