What is the proper way to compute predicted probabilities in a fixed-effects logistic regression?

Predicted probabilities are quite helpful to interpret the output of logistic regressions. One can compute a predicted probability as follows: $$ P = \frac{exp(\beta + \beta_0)}{1 + exp(\beta + \beta_0)} $$ where $\beta$ is a given coefficient and $\beta_0$ is the intercept. I am trying to compute the predicted probabilities of a fixed-effects logistic regression, where there by default lots of intercepts. Consider this example in R . How would you compute the predicted probability of dist_km ? library(fixest) data(trade) fe 1e6) ~ dist_km + Product | Year, trade) summary(fe) #GLM estimation, family = gaussian, Dep. Var.: +(Euros > 1e+06) #Observations: 38,325 #Fixed-effects: Year: 10 #Standard-errors: Clustered (Year) # Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) #dist_km -0.000206 0.00000166 -124.2128 7.2167e-16 *** #Product 0.001405 0.00013337 10.5380 2.3094e-06 *** #--- #Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 #Log-Likelihood: -23,304.5 Adj. Pseudo R2: 0.078249 # BIC: 46,735.6 Squared Cor.: 0.098652 I'm thinking of using the weighted mean intercept of all fixed effects as $\beta_0$ ( weighted.mean(fixest(fe)[1], table(trade$Year) / sum(table(trade$Year))) ). Does it make sense?
