Assuming you have params[:review] as the attributes' hash, you need to do a merge! : params[:review].merge!(:user_id => current_user.id) @review = @place.reviews.build(params[:review]) Edit: I'm also assuming you'll use this is on create method. Edit #2: It's not gonna work on new method because, as you can find at railsapi.com , the build method "only works if an associated object already exists, not if itâ€™s nil!" Edit #3: I'm not sure if this is the best way, but I tested here and It worked... You have this parameters: {"commit"=>"Submit", "action"=>"create", "city_id"=>"prague", "controller"=>"places", "place"=>{"address"=>"fsdfsdf", "name"=>"sdfsdfsd", "reviews_attributes"=>{"0"=>{"content"=>" \r\n\tsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdf sdfsdfsdf \r\n"}}, "website"=>"", "city_id"=>"1036", "place_type"=>"1"}} So you can access reviews' attributes this way: params[:place][:reviews_attributes] and, to merge the user_id attribute, you can do: params[:place][:reviews_attributes].each_value { |v| v.merge!(:user_id => current_user.id) } Now params[:place][:reviews_attributes] looks like this example: {"0"=>{ "user_id"=>"1", "content"=>" \r\n\tsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfsdf sdfsdfsdf \r\n" }}
