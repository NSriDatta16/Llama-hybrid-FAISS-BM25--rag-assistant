Finding a sample to represent a known population

Entire Population: 30,000 Known properties of population: Age, gender, height, weight, Ideal representative sample size: ??? This is for a mailing list test group selection. Problem constraints: Certain people can't be included in sample because they are on a do-not-mail list. Sample group must have similar age, gender, height, and weight to entire population (known) I imagine I have to randomly select members from the entire population that are not on the do-not-mail list and compare the average and variance of the sample compared to the entire population. If the average and variance of the sample and entire population are similar, then I have a good sample? I'm not sure if I'm on the right path or if there is an easier way.
