Option (a) sounds better from a conserving resources point of view. Instead of using the square-root symbol, why don't you use an image (using the com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.Image class)? I think a more elegant/simple solution might be to use the checkbox class for your menu items. That way you could have automatic ticks/checks instead of having to use an image or the square-root symbol. Also, you will be able to "grey-out" items with setEnabled(false) . Otherwise, you will have to write your own widget or add your own functionality to your menu labels in order to "grey-out" items.
