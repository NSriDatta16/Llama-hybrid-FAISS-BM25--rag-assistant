Should I do the sorting and computation in the view, and then pass it? Yes, definitely. It is not really a matter of performance (as Django's querysets are lazily evaluated, I suspect the final performance could be very similar in both cases) but of code organization. Templates should not contain any business logic, only presentation. Of course, sometimes this model breaks down, but in general you should try as much as possible to keep into that direction.
