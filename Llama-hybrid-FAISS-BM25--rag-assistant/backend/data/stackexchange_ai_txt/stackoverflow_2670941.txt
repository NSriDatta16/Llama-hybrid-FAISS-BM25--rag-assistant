NSXMLDocument objectByApplyingXSLT with XSL Include

I'm having some trouble with XSL-processing when there are stylesheets that include other stylesheets relatively. (the XML-files may be irrelevant but are included for completeness - code is at the bottom). Given the XML-file: Edward Jenner and the XSL-file: referencing this stylesheet in the same directory called included.xsl: Sorting example how can I make it that the following code fragment: NSError *lError = nil; NSXMLDocument *lDocument = [ [ NSXMLDocument alloc ] initWithContentsOfURL: [ NSURL URLWithString: @"file:///pathto/data.xml" ] options: 0 error: &lError ]; NSXMLDocument *lResult = [ lDocument objectByApplyingXSLTAtURL: [ NSURL URLWithString: @"file:///pathto/style.xsl" ] arguments: nil error: nil ]; does not give me the error: I/O warning : failed to load external entity "included.xsl" compilation error: element include xsl:include : unable to load included.xsl I have been trying all sorts of options. Also loading XML documents with NSXMLDocumentXInclude beforehand does not seem to help. Specifying the absolute path to the to-be-included XSL file works flawlessly. Is there any way to make the XSL processing so that a stylesheet can include another stylesheet in its local path?
