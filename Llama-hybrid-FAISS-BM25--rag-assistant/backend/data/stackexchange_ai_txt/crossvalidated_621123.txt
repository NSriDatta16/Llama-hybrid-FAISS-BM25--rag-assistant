Answer: Option 4 - Bootstrap all predictions, regardless of state I attempted to answer this question using simulation: 35 groups/states Number of samples follows neg binomial with mean ~130 Predictions and actuals drawn from separate normal distributions for each group Parameters for individual group prediction and actual normal distributions themselves drawn from normal distributions 100 bootstrap samples used to calculate intervals 500 trials of dataset creation and bootstrap estimates run On this particular simulation, bootstrapping across all predictions was the only method that adequately covered the intervals it was intended to. I don't have good intuition at this point why the others overestimate/underestimate.
