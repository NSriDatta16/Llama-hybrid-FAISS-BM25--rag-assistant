Test for significant difference in ratios of normally distributed random variables

Related to Analysing ratios of variables and How to parameterize the ratio of two normally distributed variables, or the inverse of one? . Suppose I have a number of samples from four different continous random distributions, all of which we can assume to be roughly normal. In my case, these correspond to some performance metrics of two different filesystems (say, ext4 and XFS), both with and without encryption. The metric might be, for example, the number of files created per second, or the average latency for some file operation. We can assume that all samples drawn from these distributions will always be strictly positive. Let's call these distributions $\textrm{Perf}_{fstype,encryption}$ where $fstype \in \{xfs,ext4\}$ and $encryption \in \{crypto,nocrypto\}$. Now, my hypothesis is that encryption slows down one of the filesystems by a bigger factor than the other. Is there some simple test for the hypothesis $\frac{E[\textrm{Perf}_{xfs,crypto}]}{E[\textrm{Perf}_{xfs,nocrypto}]}
