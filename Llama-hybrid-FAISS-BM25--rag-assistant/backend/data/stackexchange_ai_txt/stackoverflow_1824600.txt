How to handle fragmentation of auto_increment ID column in MySQL

I have a table with an auto_increment field and sometimes rows get deleted so auto_increment leaves gaps. Is there any way to avoid this or if not, at the very least, how to write an SQL query that: Alters the auto_increment value to be the max(current value) + 1 Return the new auto_increment value? I know how to write part 1 and 2 but can I put them in the same query? If that is not possible: How do I "select" (return) the auto_increment value or auto_increment value + 1?
