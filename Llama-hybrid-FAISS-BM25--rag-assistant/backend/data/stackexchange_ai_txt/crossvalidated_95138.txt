You should normalize your data before passing it to your SVM. For SVM it is recommended to linearly scale each attribute to the range $[-1, +1]$ or $[0,1]$ However, it is very important that you use the same scaling factors for training and testing sets. Suppose you scaled the training data from the range $[-10, +10]$ to $[-1, +1]$. If a testing data attribute lies in the range $[-11, +8]$ you must scale it to $[-1.1, +0.8]$ So to answer your question: normalize your training set perform training normalize your test set using the same scaling factor as the training set perform predictions
