Sampling from an Improper Distribution (using MCMC and otherwise)

My basic question is: how would you sample from an improper distribution? Does it even make sense to sample from an improper distribution? Xi'an's comment here kind of addresses the question, but I was looking for some more details on this. More specific to MCMC: In talking about MCMC and reading papers, authors stress on having obtained proper posterior distributions. There is the famous Geyer(1992) paper where the author forgot to check if their posterior was proper (otherwise an excellent paper). But, suppose a we have a likelihood $f(x|\theta)$ and an improper prior distribution on $\theta$ such that the resulting posterior is also improper, and MCMC is used to sample from the distribution. In this case, what does the sample indicate? Is there any useful information in this sample? I am aware that the Markov chain here is then either transient or null-recurrent. Are there any positive take-aways if it is null-recurrent ? Finally, in Neil G's answer here , he mention's you can typically sample (using MCMC) from the posterior even if it's improper. He mentions such sampling is common in deep learning. If this is true, how does this make sense?
