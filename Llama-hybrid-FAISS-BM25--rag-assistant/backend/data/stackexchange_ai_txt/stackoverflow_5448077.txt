Converted from a comment as suggested by Merlyn Morgan-Graham The way an array is declared depends on what language you use. If you are writing pseudo-code you can decide it yourself as long as it communicates the intent and the desired result. The array can be declared as array = [] , int[] array = new int[] , int array[] , array = array() , Â´array = {}` etc. In some languages you have to declare the size of the array beforehand and in some languages the arrays expand when needed
