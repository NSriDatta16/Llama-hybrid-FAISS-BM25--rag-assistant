MLP, logistic regression with very badly prediction on training data set

I have a problem with my MLP model (one hidden layer, wrote from scratch in python). When I'm trying to solve logistic regression problem with 3 (1, 2, 3) classes, and first train on training data set, next try to make prediction, and when I'm predicting on the test dataset, acurracy is >90%, but when I'm trying to make prediciton on the training dataset, acurracy is very bad. I also tried to append test and training datasets and train on this summary data set and after that try to predict apart test and training data set and results was very good. I tried on many different hyperparameter settings, but the result was similar. Does anyone have any advice?
