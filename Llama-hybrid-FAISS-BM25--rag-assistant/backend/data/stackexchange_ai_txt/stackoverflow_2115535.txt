Oracle Data Versioning/Partitioning Strategies/Best Practices

not sure if the subject entirely conveys what I'm trying to achieve, but let me explain: We are building an application that uses Oracle as storage backend. Each year, last years dataset will be "Archived", and a new instance created and populated from scratch. What are the options to do this within the same schema? Keep version information on a record level (we presume this will be too slow for our use-case). Keep version information on a table level, so for each new version, we will re-create all the tables but with a new version prefix. (We like this solution, since we can do it all in code). ? Is there not something like partitions/personalities/namespaces available that will allow us to achieve this in Oracle? My oracle experience is rather limited, any assistance will be greatly appreciated!
