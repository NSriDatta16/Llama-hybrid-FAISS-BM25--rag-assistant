So you want every sentence in your .tex file to start on a new line, but without introducing extra paragraphs? Is that correct? Possibly you could go through your file and, every time you see a '.' followed by whitespace and a capital letter, insert a newline. e.g. in python: import re sentence_end = r'\.\s+([A-Z])' source = open('myfile.tex') dest = open('myfile-out.tex', 'w') for line in source: dest.write(re.sub(sentence_end, '.\n\g ', line))
