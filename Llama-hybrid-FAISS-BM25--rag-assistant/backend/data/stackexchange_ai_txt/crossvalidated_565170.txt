Computing a p-value of a 2-sided Chi-squared test for one variance

Below is a simple question from a textbook. I answer the question by computing the critical values for a critical region $\alpha = 0.05$ for a Chi-squared distribution (42.95, 86.83) and then commenting that the chi-squared value (63.75) is within the interval. However, the book gives a p-value and I don't know how this is calculated. Aflotoxins produced by mold on peanut crops in Virginia must be monitored. A sample of 64 batches of peanuts reveals levels of 24.17 ppm, on average, with a variance of 4.25 ppm. Test the hypothesis that $\sigma^2$ = 4.2 ppm against the alternative that $\sigma^2 \ne 4.2$ ppm. Use a P -value in your conclusion.
