Noise of same order of magnitude than seasonality in a time series

everyone! I'm new in this field of statistics and I looked for an answer to this question here but couldn't find any related questions. I'm working with the Lending Club Loan Data, available on Kaggle and I'm trying to decompose a time series into trend, seasonality and noise. This is what I got using the decompose command from R, setting its type to additive. The plot on the right side is the same graph in the log scale. The random noise seems to be of the same order of magnitude as the seasonality without even considering those strange peaks after 2014. Does this fact (noise of same magnitude as seasonality) mean the time series has no seasonality at all?
