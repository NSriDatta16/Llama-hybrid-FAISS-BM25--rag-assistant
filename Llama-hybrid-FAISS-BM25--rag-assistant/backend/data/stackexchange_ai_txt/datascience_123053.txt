Why does everyone use BERT in research instead of LLAMA or GPT or PaLM, etc?

It could be that I'm misunderstanding the problems space and the iterations of LLAMA, GPT, and PaLM are all based on BERT like many language models are, but every time I see a new paper in improving language models it takes BERT as a based an adds some kind of fine-tuning or filtering or something. I don't understand why BERT became the default in research circles when all anyone hears about publicly is GPT-2,3,4 or more recently LLAMA-2. I have a feeling it has something to do with BERT being open-source, but that can't be the whole story. This question might not be specific enough, please let me know. Thanks.
