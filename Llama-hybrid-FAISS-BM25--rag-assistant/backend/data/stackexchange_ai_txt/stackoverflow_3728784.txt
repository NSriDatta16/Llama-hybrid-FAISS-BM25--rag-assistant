You should take a look at the options tutorial and the options reference . Simply manipulate the min, max, and numberTicks options to create an x-axis that is better formatted for your purposes. You'll likely also want to set the pad option to zero as well. As an example, I recently used this to create ticks at 0%, 20%, etc, and to ALWAYS display 0-100% on the y-axis: 'yaxis' : { 'min' : 0, 'max' : 100, 'pad' : 0, 'numberTicks' : 6 }
