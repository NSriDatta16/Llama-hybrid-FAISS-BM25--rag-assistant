This question is primarily opinion based, but I think there is enough here write an answer down. There could be many reasons to code one own's sampler for a research problem. Here are some of them Proposal: As fcop suggested in their comment, if the sample is M-H, then coding your own sampler lets you play around with proposal distributions to get the best mixing sampler. Flexibility: In built programs might not give you the flexibility you want. You might want to start at a specific random value, or use a specific seed structure. Understanding: Coding your own sampler helps you understand the behavior of the sampler, giving insights to the Markov chain process. This is useful for a researcher working on the problem. Onus: If the data on which I am making all my Bayesian inference comes from a program that I didn't code up, then the onus on the inference is no longer on me. As a researcher, I would like to take full responsibility of the methods/results I present. Using in-built methods does not allow you to do that. There are probably more reasons, but these are the four that make me code my own samplers.
