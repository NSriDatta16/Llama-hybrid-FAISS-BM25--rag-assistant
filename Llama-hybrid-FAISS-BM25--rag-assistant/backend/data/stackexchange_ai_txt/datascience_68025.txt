How to get sentence from embedding vector with Universal Sentence Encoder?

I'd like to ask, if there is possibility to get sentence (or word) from embedding vector using Universal Sentence Encoder ? First of all, I've clustered my embedded sentences and I've got a vector which is representing center of the cluster, and now I want to convert this to some sentence which will have the best meaning for this specific cluster. Best regards.
