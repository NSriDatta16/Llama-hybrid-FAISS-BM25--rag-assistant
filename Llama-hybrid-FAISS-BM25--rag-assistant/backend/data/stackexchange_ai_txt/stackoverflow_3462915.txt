I'm normally the one of the very few Python experts who steadfastly defends regular expressions (they have quite a bad reputation in the Python community), but this is not one of those cases -- accepting (say) '333.444.555.666' as an "IP address" is really bad, and if you need to do more checks after matching the RE, much of the point of using a RE is lost anyway. So, I second @Mark's recommendations heartily: IPy for generality and elegance (including support of IPv6 if you want!), string operations and int checks if you only need IPv4 (but, think twice about that limitation, and then think one more -- IPv6's time has way come!-): def isgoodipv4(s): pieces = s.split('.') if len(pieces) != 4: return False try: return all(0 I'd far rather do that than a convoluted RE to match only numbers between 0 and 255!-)
