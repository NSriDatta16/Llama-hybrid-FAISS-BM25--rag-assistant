MD5 is considered deprecated - at least for cryptographic purposes, but I would suggest only using md5 for backwards compatibility with existing stuff. You should have a good reason to go with md5 when we do have other hash algos out there that aren't (at least yet) broken. Problems I see with the approach: Duplicate objects, because the url identifier is different (As arend mentioned) URLs changing The latter being the one that might be important - this could be done as simply as a remove and an add. That is, if these ids are never visible/storable outside the database. (Like as a component of a URL.) I guess these won't be a problem for DOIs. How would it work with a non-autonumber integer id setup, but where the offline inserter agent creates the numbers? (Can use a dedicated range of numbers, maybe?) Might have a problem with duplication should two users independently add the same url?
