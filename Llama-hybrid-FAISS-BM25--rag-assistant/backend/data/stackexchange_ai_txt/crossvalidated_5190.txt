What you seem to be referring to is called "shrinkage" . This allows you to share strength across groups and is frequently used in hierarchical Bayesian models. The (very) basic idea is to impose a prior distribution over the entire population and place more weight on the prior for those groups that have few samples, much like you would for any Bayesian analysis. The best reference I can think of for this is ch. 8 of Peter Hoff's book: "A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods", but if you don't have access to this book, I'm sure any book on Bayesian statistics will talk about this (search for "group comparison", "hierarchical modeling", or "shrinkage"). I know that Robert Gramacy has done some work on this as well, so you may wish to check out his publications.
