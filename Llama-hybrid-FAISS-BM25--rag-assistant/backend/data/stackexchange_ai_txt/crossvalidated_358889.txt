Face morphing using GAN

I need to morph multiple faces. Here is the desired result: I already tried to find facial landmarks using dlib shape predictor and then morph multiple faces, but unfortunately sometimes shape predictor gives wrong results. So now I think I can use some type of Generative adversarial network(GAN) for this task. As I understand they can do something similar to my task, e.g. CycleGAN . Also, I already saw article which has similar intermediate result (you can see it in the figure 4, but it's not exactly what I need). Finally, a couple of years ago I heard about type of GAN which exactly do multiple faces morphing, but I can't find it now unfortunately. So, can you advice GAN which exactly do multiple faces morphing? Or can you advice appropriate type of GAN and how can I change it for multiple faces morphing?
