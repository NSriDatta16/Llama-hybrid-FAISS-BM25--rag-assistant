Suggest you be liberal with your database column lengths (for your varchar ), but strict on your application in enforcing size/lengths. The business logic may change over time. Your application tier will be the keeper and enforcer of those rules. Your database shouldn't have to adjust often to the changing business rules regarding length. Defining a column of type varchar(100) doesn't cost you anything today. The length is variable up to 100, so your performance and storage won't suffer at all. Application and database changes/maintenance are expensive; database storage is cheap. Some other detailed suggestions, if you will: don't store age . Derive it from a date (birthdate) by using math (Today-Birthdate). passwords shouldn't be stored or have a max length! all your string fields -- define them as varchar(256) or 1024 and be done with them. Let your application enforce the business rules of the day.
