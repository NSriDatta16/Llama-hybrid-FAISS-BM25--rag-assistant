Which one should be applied first: data sampling or dimensionality reduction?

I am working on binary classification problem. Data set is very large and highly imbalanced. Data dimensionality is also very high. Now I want to balance data by under-sampling the majority class, and I also want to reduce data dimensionality by applying PCA, etc... So my question is that which one should be applied first: data sampling or dimensionality reduction? Please also give argument in favor of your answer. Thanks in advance
