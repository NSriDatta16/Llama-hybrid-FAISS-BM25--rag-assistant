Incorporate luck in statistical modelling

I was wondering if it is possible (and if yes, how is it done) to incorporate a luck component in statistical models. So let’s assume I’d perform a regression on the goal difference between two teams in order to model the outcome of a sports match. How could I also model a random luck component that would make the underdog draw or win in certain rare cases? And what if I took it a step further and tried to model the match outcome using neural networks? Is is possible to include luck in this case?
