I use Debug.Assert . I organize the tests in modules. In each module I maintain a Sub RunAll that calls all the test methods in that module. To run all tests in the project, I have a module AllTests with a RunAll that calls RunAll in all the test modules. Simple and works great without any fuss. MSDN article on VBA Debug.Assert
