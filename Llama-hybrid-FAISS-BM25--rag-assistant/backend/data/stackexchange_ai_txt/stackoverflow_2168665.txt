If you're a police officer looking for underage drinkers, you can do one of the following, and De Morgan's law says they amount to the same thing: FORMULATION 1 (A AND B) If they're under the age limit AND drinking an alcoholic beverage, arrest them. FORMULATION 2 (NOT(NOT A OR NOT B)) If they're over the age limit OR drinking a non-alcoholic beverage, let them go. This, by the way, isn't my example. As far as I know, it was part of a scientific experiment where the same rule was expressed in different ways to find out how much of a difference it made in peoples' ability to understand them.
