It is possible in theory, the question is why do you want to do it. Note that PHP functions deal with the data stored in PHP data structures and frequently require various PHP structures and settings to be initialized in order to work. So, if you want to add your C code to PHP, look at writing PHP extensions . If you want to have PHP engine inside your C program, this is possible with embedding , but it's very rarely done as for most tasks it's an overkill. If you just want to reuse some code, PHP license is like BSD, so you can just take the code in most cases, provided you follow the license, but be careful about these external dependencies I mentioned above.
