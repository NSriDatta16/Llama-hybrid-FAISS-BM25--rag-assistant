If $h$ is nondifferentiable, then using GANs is not straightforward. One example of where you might want to do this is sentence generation, where an LSTM models a (conditional) probability distribution across possible sentences and the function $h$ samples one particular sentence from the distribution. A discrete clustering would also be nondifferentiable. In this case, it is necessary to use reinforcement learning techniques. For example, the popular REINFORCE algorithm has been used to train GANs for the sentence generation task. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05473 .
