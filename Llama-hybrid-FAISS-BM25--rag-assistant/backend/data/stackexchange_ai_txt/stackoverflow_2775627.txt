I don't think you can really have too much code coverage. I think you need to determine what code runs the "regular course of business" in the application and have that completely covered. For the remaining code that isn't in the normal course of business, start whittling that down by doing the most critical first. Abnormal business that isn't terribly important has low gain for getting good code coverage on it.
