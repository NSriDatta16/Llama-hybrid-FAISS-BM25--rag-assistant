There isn't a means to do this with the standard Spring namespace. Rob Harrop's response to a request to add the schema to the configuration: In general, this kind of functionality should be pushed into the connection pool since there is no really elegant and performant way to do this via a decorator. The pool can set the schema once per connection it creates, whereas here you have to set it each time a connection is retrieved. If you're desperate to set the proxy in your configuration, the submitter included some code for a proxy to allow the schema to be specified.
