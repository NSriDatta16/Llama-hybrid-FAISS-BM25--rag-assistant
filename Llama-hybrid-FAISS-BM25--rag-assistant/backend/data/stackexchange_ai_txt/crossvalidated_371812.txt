Imputing nested time series data with R

Does anyone know what is the superior algorithm to impute data in time series? I had strong dropouts over time because it was free to participants how many times to participate in my study (otherwise I would have received a even samller sample). Now I wished I could impute the missing measurements at least till the 5th or 6th meeting but preferably for all measurements. Since I want to find out if there are effects over time, I don`t want to use the LOCF algorithm (and would rather prefer chained equations or something similiar). Another difficulty is that I have nested data (people in groups) and need an algorithm that considers the structure of my data. Can someone help me?
