Drag & Drop Reorder Rows on NSTableView

I was just wondering if there was an easy way to set an NSTableView to allow it to reorder its rows without writing any pasteboard code. I only need it to be able to do this internally, within one table. I have no issue writing the pboard code, except that I'm fairly sure that I saw Interface Builder have a toggle for this somewhere / saw it working by default. It certainly seems like a common enough task. Thanks
