Checking the result of running process with C#

This post has the following code. Process p = new Process(); StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("/COVERAGE "); sb.Append(exeFileName); p.StartInfo.FileName = "vsinstr.exe"; p.StartInfo.Arguments = sb.ToString(); p.Start(); p.WaitForExit(); // Look at return code â€“ 0 for success The comment says I need to check the return code, but p.WaitForExit() doesn't return anything. Q1 : What return code do I need to check? Q2 : Normally, how one can check if running process is OK or not?
