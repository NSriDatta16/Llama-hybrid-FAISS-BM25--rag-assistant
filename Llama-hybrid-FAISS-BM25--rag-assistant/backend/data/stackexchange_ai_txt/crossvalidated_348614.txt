Has I constructed LSTM model in a right way in Keras?

Here's a description of a model I'd like to get: A vanilla LSTM model with similar size as our model. Specifically, a two-layer sacked LSTM is constructed, with 128 and 32 hidden states, respectively, followed by a fully connected layer for the final output. This neural network also takes 28 days as input, and predicts the next day. # design network model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=train_X.shape)) % 28 days model.add(LSTM(32, input_shape=128)) % 128 units for previous layer model.add(Dense(1))
