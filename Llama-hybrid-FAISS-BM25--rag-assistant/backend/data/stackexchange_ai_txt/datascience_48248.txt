To compute f1_score , first, use this function of python sklearn library to produce confusion matrix. After that, from the confusion matrix, generate TP , TN , FP , FN and then use them to calculate: Recall = TP/TP+FN and Precision = TP/TP+FP And then from the above two metrics, you can easily calculate: f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) OR you can use another function of the same library here to compute f1_score directly from the generated y_true and y_pred like below: F1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average = 'binary') Finally, the library links consist of a helpful explanation. You should read them carefully.
