Difference-in-differences when treatment status is revoked

I am trying to analyze the effect of receiving "elite" status on a university's number of international first-year students. I have a perfectly balanced panel of 17 universities over an 18-year time period. It consists of universities who received and retained the elite status, some universities who received and lost the elite status, and some who made it to the final round, but were eventually not awarded the elite status. The universities received the elite status at 3 different points in time. My understanding is that DiD allows for the treatment to be "switched off" again (although much of the literature seems to discuss it in terms of "before" and "after," suggesting that the treatment will remain in place forever after it is "switched on"). Can you suggest any literature that analyzes a similar situation (where the treatment is "switched off" again), or anything else that might be important here, also for DiD? I know the literature regarding standard errors following the Bertrand et al. (2002) paper and wild bootstrap.
