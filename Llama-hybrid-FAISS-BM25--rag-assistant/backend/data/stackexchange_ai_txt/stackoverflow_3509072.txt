The WConio module should be all you need to accomplish this. WConio.textbackground(color) sets the background color without changing the foreground. See below for the color constants. WConio.textcolor(color) sets the foreground color without changing the background. See below for the color constants. The constants it refers to are not actually listed on the page, but are at the top of the WConio.py file: BLACK = 0 BLUE = 1 GREEN = 2 CYAN = 3 RED = 4 MAGENTA = 5 BROWN = 6 LIGHTGRAY = LIGHTGREY = 7 DARKGRAY = DARKGREY = 8 LIGHTBLUE = 9 LIGHTGREEN = 10 LIGHTCYAN = 11 LIGHTRED = 12 LIGHTMAGENTA = 13 YELLOW = 14 WHITE = 15 So a full call to set the text foreground colour to red would be: WConio.textcolor(WConio.RED)
