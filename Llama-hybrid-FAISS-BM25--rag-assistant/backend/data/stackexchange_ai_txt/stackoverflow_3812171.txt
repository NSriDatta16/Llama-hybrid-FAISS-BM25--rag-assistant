File Upload/Download module in PHP

I have a online PHP application to which I want that the Admin should be able to upload files at file system using PHP / HTML forms and the other users can download the files. The application should log the number of downloads for a specific file. The files should appear in proper folders as organized by the admin. I am searching for such a module that should be able to do these generic tasks. If you know such then please share your comments.
