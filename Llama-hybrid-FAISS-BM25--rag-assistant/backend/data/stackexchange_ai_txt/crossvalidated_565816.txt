Interpret ratio odds in a binomial logistic regression model to demonstrate effects of variables on the model

I built a binomial logistic regression model and I want check the effect of the independent variables on the model.This is the model step.model I ran logistic.display(step.model) to get the ratio odds as I researched and I would like to interpret those numbers to demonstrate the effect of the variables on the model. Can anyone help?? Thank you logistic.display(step.model) Logistic regression predicting decision : 1 vs 0 crude OR(95%CI) adj. OR(95%CI) P(Wald's test) P(LR-test) Exposure (cont. var.) 2.16 (0.81,5.75) 3.22 (1.12,9.29) 0.031 0.027 VehAge (cont. var.) 0.96 (0.9,1.03) 0.94 (0.88,1.01) 0.11 0.096 BonusMalus (cont. var.) 1.01 (0.99,1.03) 1.02 (1,1.04) 0.052 0.065 Log-likelihood = -133.6208 No. of observations = 801 AIC value = 275.2415 ```
