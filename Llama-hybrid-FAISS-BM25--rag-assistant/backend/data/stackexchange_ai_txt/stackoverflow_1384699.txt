As the mako homepage points out, Mako's advantages are pretty clear: insanely fast, instantly familiar to anyone who's handy with Python in terms of both syntax and features. Genshi chooses "interpretation" instead of ahead-of-time Python code generation (according to their FAQ , that's for clarity of error messages) and an "arm's length" approach to Python (e.g. by using xpath for selectors, xinclude instead of inheritance, etc) so it might be more natural to people who know no Python but are very competent with XML. So what's your "audience"? If Python programmers, I suggest Mako (for speed and familiarity); if XML experts that are uncomfortable with Python, Genshi might be a better fit (for "arm's length from Python" approach and closer match to XML culture). You mention "the average Joe", but Joe doesn't know Python AND xpath is a deep dark mystery to him; if THAT was really your audience, other templating systems such as Django's might actually be a better fit (help him to avoid getting in trouble;-).
