Isnt measuring source usage of ML models an important subject? The efficiency of machine learning models is very important. Since machine learning is primarily an empirical field, hardware choices matter. Why there are no standards for this? There are standards, one of which is MLPerf . MLPerf has separate categories for training and inference. For inference, MLPerf measures resources in joules. Joules matter when deploying a machine learning model in a resource-constrained environment. Other inference metrics include predictions per second and latency.
