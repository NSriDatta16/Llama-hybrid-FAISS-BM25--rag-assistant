Touch Began method issue?

I have created an app in which I want to use the touchbegan method. For this I have used the following code: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //Get all the touches. NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; //Number of touches on the screen if([allTouches count] > 0 && self.view!=comparedView.view) { //Navigate to next screen here likewise you generally do ActionViewController *actController = [[ActionViewController alloc] init]; UINavigationController *nvController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:actController]; nvController.navigationBarHidden = YES; CGRect frame = [[nvController navigationBar] frame]; frame = CGRectMake(0.0,0.0, 320.0, 460.0); [[nvController navigationBar] setFrame:frame]; [self setView:[nvController view]]; [actController release]; } } On touch on anywhere on screen for my 1st view the following code will be executed and it will go to the next view. But problem is that when i go to the last view and touch on the imageview in that view the above method is called. I am not getting how it is taking place.
