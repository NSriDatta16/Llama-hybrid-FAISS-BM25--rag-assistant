I think you just need to include another column of variable in your actual data set which contains the lagged values of the dependent. You can chop the current data that you have to training data and testing data. You use the training data to create a random forest model and adjust it depending on its performance on the testing data. If you have a satisfactory model you can then forecast the 2 years flow rate. Now, to forecast the flow rate, while using its lagged values, you'll need to do a recursive forecasting, predicting one day at a time and using the predicted value as your input in the next forecast. Hope this helps.
