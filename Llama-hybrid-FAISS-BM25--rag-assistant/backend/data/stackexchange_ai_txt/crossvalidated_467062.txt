Suppose there are 100 students in all and that test scores are normal. Then the range $W$ of scores has $E(W) \approx 5\sigma,$ where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation of scores. I estimated this mean from a simulation in R, as shown below. [In R, range returns min and max, so one needs diff to get the actual range.] w = replicate(10^5, diff(range(rnorm(100)))) mean(w) [1] 5.015726 So it might be reasonable to assume that individual students have a standard deviation that is about $1/5$ of the range of the 100 students. Group size matters in such approximations. If the group/class has only about 30 students, then 4 is a better divisor than 5. w = replicate(10^5, diff(range(rnorm(30)))) mean(w) [1] 4.083182 This method probably wouldn't work well for tests where the best students have scores that are close to the maximum possible score. Then the SD of best students might be much smaller than is typical of the population. Your response to @norvia's question leads me to believe you might have data that would permit a regression approach. If so, you might regress SD on range (max - min) and average scores across the whole group and see if that helps to predict SD for an individual student in the group from his/her average. If you're trying to get an individual's SD from the range of only $4$ tests during the term, then divide the range by $2.$ w = replicate(10^5, diff(range(rnorm(4)))) mean(w) [1] 2.059537 For very small normal samples, $S$ is well estimated as a fraction of $W.$
