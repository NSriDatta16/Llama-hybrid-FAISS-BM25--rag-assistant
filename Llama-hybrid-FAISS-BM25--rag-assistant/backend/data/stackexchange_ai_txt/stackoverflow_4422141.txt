What structure should I use to store these objects?

I am trying to implement something similar to the flight control game. There will be a set of objects representing planes that get spawned and removed 'randomly'. Individual planes can then get touched and will respond. The model should take a plane index as a parameter when something get touched. My storage requirements are: Need fast iteration over all elements Need fast insertion / deletion Need to look up and item quickly by index What should I use? NSMutableArray , NSMutableSet ? Should I store each object in two places? (e.g. Set for fast iteration, Array for fast lookup)?
