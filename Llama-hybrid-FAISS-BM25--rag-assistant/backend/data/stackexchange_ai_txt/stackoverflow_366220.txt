I'm suprised no one has mentioned Design Patterns by the "Gang of Four" yet. It is the book that really cemented in my mind how OO should really be used. The first couple chapters are especially enlightening about how things should work in a good system. It's no the easiest read, but I think it's the best. If you want a lighter view of the same subject matter, check out Head First Design Patterns.
