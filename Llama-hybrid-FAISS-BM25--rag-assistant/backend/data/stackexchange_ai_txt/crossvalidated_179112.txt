Units of measure of the first principal component

I performed a PCA on credit default swaps spreads and I want to predict the first principal component scores. My two doubts are: If I use the covariance matrix in my PCA I'll have a predict first principal component that is measured in the units of the original variable. If I use the correlation matrix I'll have a predict first principal component score that is in the standardized form. Is this correct?
