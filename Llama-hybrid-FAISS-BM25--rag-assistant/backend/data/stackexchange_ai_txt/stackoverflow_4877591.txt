Share an instance between multiple projects

I am working in VS 2008 C# and need to share an instance of an object created in one project with another project. I tried creating a static class in project1 and adding it as a link to project2, but the information wasn't saved. The static class was written in project1. //object o = new object //project1.staticObject = o //project2.object = project1.staticObject When I tried something like above, project2.object would be null. By adding a class as a link, is it creating a new instance of the static class in project2 or is it referencing the same class? If it is referencing the same class, shouldn't any information saved into the static class from project1 be accessible by project2? I know this isn't the most elegant manner of sharing data, but if anyone would help with this problem or provide a better manner of doing it, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.
