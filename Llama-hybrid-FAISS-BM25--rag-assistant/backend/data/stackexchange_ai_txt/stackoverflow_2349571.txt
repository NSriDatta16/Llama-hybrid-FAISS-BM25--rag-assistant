remove everything in sidebar but one menu

I am integrating blog(wordpress) into our magento site. I am at the point to update handler in the blog.xml file. I want to display in sidebar only the blog menu but not other menus that are by default in the right sidebar. I know i can remove the right sidebar all together but then there is not sidebar to attach my blog menu. How to do this - add single menu and remove rest of the menues in the sidebar? Thank you, Margots
