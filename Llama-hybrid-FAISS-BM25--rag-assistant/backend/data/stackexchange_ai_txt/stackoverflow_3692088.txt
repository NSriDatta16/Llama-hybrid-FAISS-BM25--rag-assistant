Yes, API and XMLRPC/Web Services is the way to go. Another option is to look for pre-existing Magento Extensions that already do what you are looking for. The Bridge Connet is certainly an option and we considered it for our customers, however we ended up developing our own Magento POS Extension for RunIt POS. The Magento Extension is now for sale on our website at https://www.activo.com/runway-magento-integration-with-runit-pos/ Check this link if you need more info, we also included an overview video and we have setup a demo for you to try if needed. This is definitely a growing need as I see more and more web stores need to integrate with back end services due to the growing demand of online commerce. We will be rolling out new features and other extensions that enable online merchants do more with their existing Magento stores.
