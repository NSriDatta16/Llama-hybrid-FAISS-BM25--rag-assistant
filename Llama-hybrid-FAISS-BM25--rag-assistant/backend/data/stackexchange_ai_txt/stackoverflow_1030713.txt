I would think the other way. Web applications can be run in all operating systems with a web browser. Hence, they have much coverage, and you need not worry about deploying to various systems. Code it once (taking care of the myriads of browsers!) and you are done! Also, the best thing apart from everything is that, you can release a new version/fix bugs, without the user even knowing about it. Whereas, if it were to be a Windows (or any other, for that matter), you will have to let the users know about the update and let them manually download/get the files and patch.
