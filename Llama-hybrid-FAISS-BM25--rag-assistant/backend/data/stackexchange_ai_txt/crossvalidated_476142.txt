Basic question about measurement errors in Design of Experiments

After reading and applying many examples of DoE I have a question that has been bugging me and haven't found an answer so far. Usually what we see in an example or publication is the design table with one response value for each run. But I assume this response is actually an average measurement from the variable of interest, and there is therefore an associated error with the measurement. Is the measurement error completely irrelevant because of the replicate runs? It seems to me that this might provide valuable information, to take into account the error given by the measurement device itself, but I haven't been able to find any discussion about it. I hope my questio is clear. Any pointers on how this is handled would be greatly appreciated.
