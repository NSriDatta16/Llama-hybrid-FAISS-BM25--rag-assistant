The reason for defining the F-beta score with $\beta^{2}$ is exactly the quote you provide (i.e. wanting to attach $\beta$ times as much importance to recall as precision) given a particular definition for what it means to attach $\beta$ times as much importance to recall than precision. The particular way of defining the relative importance of the two metrics that leads to the $\beta^{2}$ formulation can be found in Information Retrieval (Van Rijsbergen, 1979): Definition: The relative importance a user attaches to precision and recall is the $P/R$ ratio at which $\partial{E}/ \partial{R} = \partial{E}/ \partial{P}$ , where $E = E(P, R)$ is the measure of effectiveness based on precision and recall. The motivation for this being: The simplest way I know of quantifying this is to specify the $P/R$ ratio at which the user is willing to trade an increment in precision for an equal loss in recall. To see that this leads to the $\beta^{2}$ formulation we can start with the general formula for the weighted harmonic mean of $P$ and $R$ and calculate their partial derivatives with respect to $P$ and $R$ . The source cited uses $E$ (for "effectiveness measure"), which is just $1-F$ and the explanation is equivalent whether we consider $E$ or $F$ . \begin{equation} F = \frac{1}{(\frac{\alpha}{P}+ \frac{1-\alpha}{R})} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \partial{F}/\partial{P} = \frac{\alpha}{(\frac{\alpha}{P}+ \frac{1-\alpha}{R})^{2}P^{2}} \end{equation} \begin{equation} \partial{F}/\partial{R} = \frac{1-\alpha}{(\frac{\alpha}{P}+ \frac{1-\alpha}{R})^{2}R^{2}} \end{equation} Now, setting the derivatives equal to one another places a restriction on the relationship between $\alpha$ and the ratio $P/R$ . Given that we wish to attach $\beta$ times as much importance to recall as precision we will consider the ratio $R/P$ 1 : \begin{equation} \partial{F}/\partial{P} = \partial{F}/\partial{R} \rightarrow \frac{\alpha}{P^{2}} = \frac{1-\alpha}{R^{2}} \rightarrow \frac{R}{P} = \sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}} \end{equation} Defining $\beta$ as this ratio and rearranging for $\alpha$ gives the weightings in terms of $\beta^{2}$ : \begin{equation} \beta = \sqrt{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}} \rightarrow \beta^{2} = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} \rightarrow \beta^{2} + 1 = \frac{1}{\alpha} \rightarrow \alpha = \frac{1}{\beta^{2} + 1} \end{equation} \begin{equation} 1 - \alpha = 1 - \frac{1}{\beta^{2} + 1} \rightarrow \frac{\beta^{2}}{\beta^{2} + 1} \end{equation} We obtain: \begin{equation} F = \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{\beta^{2} + 1}\frac{1}{P} + \frac{\beta^{2}}{\beta^{2} + 1}\frac{1}{R})} \end{equation} Which can be rearranged to give the form in your question. Thus, given the quoted definition, if you wish to attach $\beta$ times as much importance to recall as precision then the $\beta^{2}$ formulation should be used. This interpretation does not hold if one uses $\beta$ . You could define a score as you suggest. In this case, as Vic has shown, the definition for the relative importance you would be assuming is: Definition: The relative importance a user attaches to precision and recall is the $(\partial{E}/ \partial{R}) / (\partial{E}/ \partial{P})$ ratio at which $R = P$ . Footnotes: $P/R$ is used in Information Retrieval but this appears to be a typo, see The Truth of F-measure (Saski, 2007). References: C. J. Van Rijsbergen. 1979.
