How to handle an "OR" relationship in an ERD (table) design?

I'm designing a small database for a personal project, and one of the tables, call it table C , needs to have a foreign key to one of two tables, call them A and B , differing by entry. What's the best way to implement this? Ideas so far: Create the table with two nullable foreign key fields connecting to the two tables. Possibly with a trigger to reject inserts and updates that would result 0 or 2 of them being null. Two separate tables with identical data This breaks the rule about duplicating data. What's a more elegant way of solving this problem?
