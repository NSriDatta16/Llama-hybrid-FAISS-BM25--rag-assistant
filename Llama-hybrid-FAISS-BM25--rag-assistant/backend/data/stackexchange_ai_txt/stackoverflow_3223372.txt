If I understand your question correctly, nodes 7, 11 and 12 have no out links and therefore no valid paths to the other nodes. Does your algorithm force a path by inserting a link with a cost of Integer.MAX_VALUE in these cases? If so, that would explain why you have such a very high average cost. I also wondered whether it would be better to evaluate both forward and reverse paths. In a directed graph the cost of path AB is not necessarily the same as the cost of path BA. With your current algorithm, the cost of every path ending at node 12 is calculated, but no paths starting at node 12 are evaluated.
