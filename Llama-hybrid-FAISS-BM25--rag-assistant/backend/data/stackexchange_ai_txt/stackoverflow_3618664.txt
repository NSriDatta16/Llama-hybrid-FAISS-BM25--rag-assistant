If your file has fields with double quoted entries that contain separators and fields with line feeds, than I doubt that it is a real csv file... a proper csv file is something like this 1;John;Doe;engineer,manager 2;Bart;Foo;engineer,dilbert while this is "something else": 1;John;Doe;"engineer;manager" 2;Bart;Foo; "engineer,dilbert" And the first example is parseable with String.split on each line.
