Distribution of Penalized Regression Coefficients

For both linear and logistic regression we know that the coefficient vector $\hat\beta$ holds an asymptotic normal distribution, therefore the the distribution of the linear predictor $\hat\theta_i=x^T_i\hat\beta$ is also normal. Does the same applies for penalized regression models, such as ridge and LASSO? while I might see how $\hat\beta^{ridge}=(X^TX+\lambda I)^{-1}X^Ty$ might be proved to be normal, I'm super skeptical regarding the LASSO. I'll be really glad if any of your answers could cite a relevant book/paper.
