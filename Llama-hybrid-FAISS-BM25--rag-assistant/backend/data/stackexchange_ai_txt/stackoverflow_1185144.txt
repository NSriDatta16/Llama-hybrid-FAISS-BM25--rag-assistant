Here's a one-line shell command that does a privilege escalation for OS X: osascript -e 'tell app "ARDAgent" to do shell script "whoami"' It isn't as easy as it looks, since you need a separate attack vector to access a user's shell, but it's a really cool payload. I'm not sure this works any more, but I remember doing it on my mac at the time (with a simple copy, paste) and it happily reported 'root'.
