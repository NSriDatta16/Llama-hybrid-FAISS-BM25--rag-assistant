Can MySQL seamlessly be replaced with MariaDB or are there things to change in this case?

If I replace a MySQL 5.1 server with a MariaDB Server (Maria & XtraDB storages) instead of MySQL (MyISAM & InnoDB), will most of MySQL client software (incl. applications made with PHP 5.2 and Java SE 1.6) ... just remain working without any changes (with minor regressions maybe)? Or will I have to replace/reconfigure client drivers (like use another JDBC driver class and connection string)? Or will I have even to change application code?
