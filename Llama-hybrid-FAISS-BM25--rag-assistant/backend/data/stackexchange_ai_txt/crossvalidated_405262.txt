Trying a list of arima which assume that there are no deterministic structure is frequently inadequate as the correlogram should be calculated from residuals using a model that controls for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual autoregressive effect. See @AdamO's reflections here @ Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? . In a similar ( but different way ) trying to parse/match the original acf/ccf to a set of models (using mid 60's procedures) is also flawed for the same reason ( untreated deterministic structure) This explains why the following paradigm works well because it integrates both ARIMA (memory) and latent deterministic structure while validating homogeneity/constancy of model parameters and model error variance over time. https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf
