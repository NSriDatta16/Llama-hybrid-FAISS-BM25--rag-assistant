You're essentially asking if you can do Bayesian statistics without a likelihood function. The answer is no. The likelihood function is an essential ingredient in Bayesian statistics. Without a likelihood, you have no way to update your prior. If you can't specify a likelihood, or are unable to evaluate it, you can use approximate Bayesian computation to sample from the posterior. This still requires specifying a likelihood, but it's a working likelihood that you know isn't correct.
