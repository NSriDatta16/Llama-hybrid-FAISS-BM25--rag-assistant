Outputting a DOM to HTML with &'s

I am trying to output a DOM that contains elements such as &nbsp; to an html file, but it will show &amp;nbsp; in the output, which is obviously not desirable. My code is as follows Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, "html"); Result result = new StreamResult(output); transformer.transform(new DOMSource(document), result); is there anyway to get it to just output the &nbsp; (and no, replacing &nbsp; in the input is not an option )?
