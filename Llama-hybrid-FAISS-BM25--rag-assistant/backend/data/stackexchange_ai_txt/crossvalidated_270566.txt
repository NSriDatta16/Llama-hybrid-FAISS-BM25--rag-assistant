Neural network model having high validation loss shows higher accuracy in test data during cross validation process

I am training 3 different models, with varying parameters like learning_rate, regularization_strength. But number of epochs is same for all. For a fixed no. of epoch, model 2 has the highest validation loss value. But the accuracy of it is highest in test set. How can it be possible ? Or I have some bug ?
