In general, I strongly discourage using the MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized) attribute to do thread synchronization. If you are going to do multi-threaded programming you really should think very carefully about exactly where and how you should be locking. I may be exaggerating a bit but I find too many similarities between the MethodImpl synchronization method and others such as the use of the End statement in VB. It often signals to me that you don't really know what you are doing and hope that this statement/method/attribute will magically solve your problem.
