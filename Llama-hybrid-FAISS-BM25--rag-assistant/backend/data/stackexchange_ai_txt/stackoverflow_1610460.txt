Embedding commercial fonts into websites

Good evening ladies and gentlemen! Searching for a cross-browser solution to embed commercial fonts like HelveticaNeue or Univers etc. I found some promising approaches. First of all I will enlist all found, modern and easy to use approaches here: sIFR Cuf贸n typeface.js CSS3 font-face sIFR is well known and kinda easy to implement, but as I know, not as easy as it's Javascript-only siblings, Cuf贸n and typface.js. Cuf贸n has caught my attention, as it renders a little bit better than typeface.js, and creates smaller sized font-files. Apparently there is no legal way to use it with any commercial font out there, which is disallowed to be embedded into this kind of solution. For typeface.js the same situation applies, just differing in the fact, that it's not even able to convert fonts with a license, which forbids to embed it into websites. Last but not least there is this 'new' CSS property, called font-face, which is incredibly easy to use, but for our loved IE we need to convert the files into EOT (Embedable OpenType) files. Therefore special CSS declarations are needed for IE, to be able to use these fonts inside the browser. The question is now: What is the best approach to use such commercial fonts on websites? Use free fonts only from now on with Cuf贸n or convert all used fonts into EOT files, and use them together with font-face? Thanks for your well argumented answers, I appreciate it!
