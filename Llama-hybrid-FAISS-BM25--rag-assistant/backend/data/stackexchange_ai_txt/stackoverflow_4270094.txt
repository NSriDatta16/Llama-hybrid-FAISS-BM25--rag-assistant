It seems Ipads and iPhones have a special plugin that replace Youtube flash embeds with H264 video links. So, on the Youtube side doesn't happen nothing. Also, it only works with Youtube (it does not affect Vimeo flash embeds, for example). Ironically, at the time of writing, the new HTML5 iframe embedding from Youtube doesn't work with the iPhone, nor with the iPad, while the old flash embed still does. Yes, it's a strange world.
