We have been long-time devExpress WinForms developers. We are now doing more with WPF and will be using Silverlight 5. We went through the same analysis you are facing about three months ago, specific to our WPF/Silverlight shift. We downloaded Telerik's trial, anticipating that we would probably be a Premium subscription. I think Telerik's components are easier to implement with MVVM and they as a company are more seasoned in .NET matters; however, I will say DevExpress always has a solution (including code) and they are developing their new releases to a single code base for WPF/Silverlight (which is already true of Telerik as I recall). Both of these companies have a bit of a learning curve so be sure to check out the support! Browse the forums for company responses to user postings. DevExpress surfaces ALL support postings, including bugs and the organization of their website is much better than Telerik. Also, check the inventory (and date) of video/written tutorials. That is where, to my mind, DevExpress shines and that's what has kept us with them. Good luck!
