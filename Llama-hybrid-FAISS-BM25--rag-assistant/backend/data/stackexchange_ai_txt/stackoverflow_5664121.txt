I think there are three potential issues I think in porting your app to Table Storage. The lack of reporting - including aggregate functions - which you've already identified The limited availability of transaction support - with 100,000 orders per year I think you'll end up missing this support. Some problems with costs - $1 per million operations is only a small cost, but you can need to factor this in if you get a lot of page views. Honestly, I think a hybrid approach - perhaps EF or NH to SQL Azure for critical data, with large objects stored in Table/Blob? Enough of my opinion! For "in depth": try the storage team's blog http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/ - I've found this very good try the PDC sessions from Jai Haridas (couldn't spot a link - but I'm sure its there still) try articles inside Eric's book - http://geekswithblogs.net/iupdateable/archive/2010/06/23/free-96-page-book---windows-azure-platform-articles-from.aspx there's some very good best practice based advice on - http://azurescope.cloudapp.net/ - but this is somewhat performance orientated
