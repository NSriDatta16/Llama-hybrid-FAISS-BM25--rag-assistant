I agree with other answers/comments here that suggest that a Fourier transform is not very useful in this analysis. Remember that Fourier analysis is used to measure periodic signal with a fixed period . It is very poor at detecting signals in cases where the time of the oscillations varies. For a rat licking sugar-water, it may very well be the case that he tries to lick the water with some regularity, leading to a kind of periodic signal for the lick-times. However, even one badly timed lick will then throw out the periodic nature of the signal so that remaining licks no longer have the same phase-angle as previous licks, and this will not show up as a clear signal in the frequency domain. Rather than doing a Fourier analysis, you would be much better off in this case modelling the individual lick times as something like a Markov chain . Start by looking at the histogram of lick-times and then go deeper to analyse whether the lick-times are auto-correlated. You have identified the possibility that some of the lowest lick-timmes may be measurement error (i.e., not genuine values), and so it would also be useful to look at the behaviour of the times at the lower end, so see if you can make an inference about which values are erroneous. Looking at your histogram of lick-times, you can already see that there is massive variation, and so it is not likely to lead to distinct signals in the frequency domain (as confirmed by the plot in this domain). There is also a tall count bar at very low lick times, which may be due the measurement error. More interesting would be to make an auto-correlation plot showing whether lick-times are correlated with those that went before.
