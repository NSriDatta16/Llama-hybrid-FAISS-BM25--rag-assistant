If you're really going to go as far as to forbid retrieval of state, then you will be limited to behavioural testing, probably through a mocking framework such as TypeMock, which has the power to track the behaviour of your object. If you are able to do pure BDD, then theoretically you can assert the correctness of your entire system just by the way it's behaving. In practice, I've found BDD to be more brittle in a lot of cases than just stateful testing. While some people might call for a certain theory, it only works if it works for you. State-based testing still makes up 90% of all the unit tests we write, and we're well aware of BDD on our team. Do what works best for you.
