How to get rid of gap with position:relative banner

What's the recommended & most elegant way of getting rid of the gap caused by position:relative? I have a front page and want to put a banner that will be partially above the header and content section, but using position:relative produces an empty area... See example ( I want the text to be just below the red box ): http://jsfiddle.net/Ru2CT/ I know I could create another relative positioned div as a parent of my text, but then I'll still have the gap but between content section & footer... Any ideas? :)
