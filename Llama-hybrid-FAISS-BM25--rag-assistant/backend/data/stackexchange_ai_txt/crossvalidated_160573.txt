First of all it is important to notice that $L$ is an operator that works on the following random variable. Then a short answer is No you cannot. Let me give you an example, Assume you have a time series of the form of $y_t- y_{t-1}=e_t - e_{t-1}$. then using backward shift operator we have, $(1-L)y_t=(1-L)e_t$. Itis obvious that we cannot cancel $1-L$ from right and left side of the equation (and get $y_t=e_t$. No we consider the case where the left hand side is a stationary process. Let the process $(1-\phi L)y_t=(1-\phi L)e_t$ where $|\phi|>1$. Then using power series we have, $y_t=\sum_0^\infty \phi^i L^i (1-\phi L)e_t$ that is $y_t=\sum_0^\infty \phi^i e_{t-i}- \sum_0^\infty \phi^{i+1} e_{t-i-1}$.
