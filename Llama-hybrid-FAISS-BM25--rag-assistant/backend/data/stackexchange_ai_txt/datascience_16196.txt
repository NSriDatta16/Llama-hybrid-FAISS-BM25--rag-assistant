If you are trying out neural networks, I would recommend keras , it is a wrapper around TensorFlow. With just a few lines of code, you can build a neural net. Scikit learn is really good for ml algorithms like logistic or linear regression, naiveâ€‹ Bayes, svm and others. I am not sure if it is good enough for neural networks. I would still think, you would require some blas library.
