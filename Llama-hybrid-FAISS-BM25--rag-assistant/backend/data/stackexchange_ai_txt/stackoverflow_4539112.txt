touchesBegan not invoked on iPhone

I am developing a pie chart application using Core-Plot on iPhone. There are no issues in drawing the pie-chart. But I am unable to interact with its slices. I even tried interacting with them using touchesBegan event. But even this method is not getting invoked. Please help me in this regards. User interaction has been enabled.
