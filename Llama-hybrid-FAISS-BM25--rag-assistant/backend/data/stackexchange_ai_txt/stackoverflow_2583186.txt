authentication error while importing from netbeans to subversion

I just began looking into source control.... And installed subversion from collabnet... I also use netbeans(6.8) to work with PHP... I have done the following steps I have installed subversion is c:\program files\collabnet\ and the root for the repositories in e:\svn_repository I then created a repository as e:\svn_repository\lemon I then edited the passwd file and added the user and password I then tried importing an existing project into the repository with the address - svn://localhost/lemon with the new user and password. After all this, i get the error "authentication failed"... I am pretty sure the authentication is correct... I tried importing the project with the address file:///E:/sv_repository/lemon with no authentication and it connected... But i got other guys who got to connect to this server through lan and svn:// protocol is the only option.... What am i doing wrong here..? Also.. where can i find a proper tutorial to connect netbeans and collabnet subversion.....? Thanks for your suggestions and time...
