I've been struggling with Dialog animation today, finally got it working using styles, so here is an example. To start with, the most important thing — I probably had it working 5 different ways today but couldn't tell because... If your devices animation settings are set to "No Animations" (Settings → Display → Animation) then the dialogs won't be animated no matter what you do! The following is a stripped down version of my styles.xml. Hopefully it is self-explanatory. This should be located in res/values . @style/PauseDialogAnimation @anim/spin_in @android:anim/slide_out_right The windowEnterAnimation is one of my animations and is located in res\anim . The windowExitAnimation is one of the animations that is part of the Android SDK. Then when I create the Dialog in my activities onCreateDialog(int id) method I do the following. Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this, R.style.PauseDialog); // Setting the title and layout for the dialog dialog.setTitle(R.string.pause_menu_label); dialog.setContentView(R.layout.pause_menu); Alternatively you could set the animations the following way instead of using the Dialog constructor that takes a theme. Dialog dialog = new Dialog(this); dialog.getWindow().getAttributes().windowAnimations = R.style.PauseDialogAnimation;
