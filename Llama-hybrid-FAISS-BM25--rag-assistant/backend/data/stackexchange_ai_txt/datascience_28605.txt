It will probably work but less Efficiently (or lower Accuracy) if you train the Network one after the another (like trained for Dog's first , followed by Cats etc..) because It will Change The Weights of The Hidden Layers which in turn will destroy the same Recognition Capability of The Network ... Also Dogs and Cats differ in their natural looks a lot , So the Net Will Have a tough Time Doing So Simultaneously.. But What You Can Do is either of the followings - Train Two Neural Nets Simultaneously or Train them one after the another but saving the Weights of the Layers somewhere for all your Training.. And Then Predict What the Net thinks the input image to be.. Better Will Be To Train a CNN to do the same Task with Ease and will Achieve Better Accuracy. If you only have dogs and cats, then it will be sufficient to only train on one of them i.e if it isn't a dog, then its surely a cat.. Why we prefer mixing of similar Image Groups? It's more of Human Nature to do a task which can en-compass similar things at once, rather than doing the particular tasks repeatedly..
