Ok it turned out to be an idiotic mistake on my part. For some reason I had used that class as the implementation for two beans. The debugger was showing me the injector getting called, but on the creation of the bean I wasn't using. On the bean I was using, I hadn't added the second property. Gah... Just leaving this up here in case anyone else does something so foolish, and if nothing else then as a little self-humiliation to discourage me from doing this again.
