Image layers cufon jquery php saving the resulting composite?

This question is a bit open at the moment as I'm not sure the idea is even possible. So far I've loaded an image from a url, and then used jQuery UI draggable feature to allow the user to drag html text (which has been replaced using cufon font replacement) over the top of the image. The major step (which is what my question relates to) is being able to take the image and text layered over the top of the image, and save the result, either to the server, or potentially offer the option to save the altered image to the user's HD, or what would also be useful is to upload to facebook using the facebook API, but this is something I know is possible. It all hangs on whether it's even possible to achieve the first step, which is to save the image and layered text as a combined image? I wonder if there is a PHP/jQuery solution that would allow me to do this?
