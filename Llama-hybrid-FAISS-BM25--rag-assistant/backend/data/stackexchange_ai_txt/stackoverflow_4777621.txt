In my opinion, if you're using jQuery, the best solution is to divide your application into jQuery plugins and UI widgets. Plugins are great way to organize the code, you can reuse them in other applications and you can also release them separately. You can write your applications as a tree of plugins. You can think about plugins like classes in C++/Java with aggregation but not inheritance. Notes about code : in MAIN.bootstrapPlot function you use document.createElement, you should use jQuery like in the rest of the code, and check Canto library for Canvas.
