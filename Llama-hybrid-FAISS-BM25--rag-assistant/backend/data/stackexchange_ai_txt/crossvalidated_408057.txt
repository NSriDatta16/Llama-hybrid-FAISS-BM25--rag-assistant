Why can a Restricted Boltzmann Machine reconstruct using same weights?

Commonly NN (autoencoders) use a set of weights in the reduction process and another in the reconstruction process. But a RBM uses the same weights in construction and reconstruction process. I don't think that it can create inverse function of construction using the same weights. Why can Restricted Boltzmann Machines reconstruct using the same weights?
