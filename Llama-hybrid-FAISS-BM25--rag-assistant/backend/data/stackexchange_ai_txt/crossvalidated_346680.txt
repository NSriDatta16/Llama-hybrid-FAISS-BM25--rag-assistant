Why are batch-normalization techniques less popular in natural language applications than in computer vision?

I read in {1} section "5.2.5 SATURATION AND DEAD NEURONS" page 61: The batch-normalization techniques became a key component for effective training of deep networks in computer vision. As of this writing, it is less popular in natural language applications. Why are batch-normalization techniques less popular in natural language applications than in computer vision?
