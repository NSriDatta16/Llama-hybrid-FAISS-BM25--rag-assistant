Does recall has different interpretation when comes to classification and information retrieval

Recall Definition In terms of classification The recall is defined as no of positive instances that are correctly detected by the classifier. $$ TP = \frac{TP}{(TP+FN)} $$ In terms of Information retrieval Recall is defined as No of relevant documents that are retrieved. Let p = No of relevant documents that are retrieved and q = Total number of relevant documents Formula = p/q Do both the definition work on any common understanding?. I still can't get my head through this. If both are different, why are they using the same name recall ?
