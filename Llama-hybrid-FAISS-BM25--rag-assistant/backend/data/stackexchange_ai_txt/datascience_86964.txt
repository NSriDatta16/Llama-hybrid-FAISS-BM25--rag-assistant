Intuition behind One Class SVM (Scholkopf)

I am trying to understand the intuition behind the idea of finding a hyperplane that separates the training data from the origin in the feature space. Why separation from origin with a hyperplane helps with outlier detection? Is the origin the 0-vector in the feature space? Any hint/assistance is appreciated.
