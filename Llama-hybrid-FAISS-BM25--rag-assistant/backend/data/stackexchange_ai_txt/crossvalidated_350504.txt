This answer is based on the adonis function in the vegan package for R. Nesting can enter a permanova in two ways: your model and your permutation structure (the strata parameter). In your model formula, nesting is simply interaction as specified in R with the forward slash or colon ( A/B/C or A:B:C ); you are specifying that the effect of C should differ based on the value of B and A . This is like a fixed effect. Also note that forward slash differs from colon in that it includes terms for all layers in the nesting hierarchy: A+A:B+A:B:C . With strata=A:B , you limit your permutations to be between only those samples with the same levels of A and B . This implicitly treats data from each A:B interaction level as coming from the separate distributions/having disparate error structure. It is therefore somewhat similar to a random effect. Depending on what your question is, you might include your nesting in either place or in both (see link in this answer ).
