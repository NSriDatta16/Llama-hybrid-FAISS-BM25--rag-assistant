xUnit.net Test Stripper [to remove test code embedded in binaries prior to deployment/shipping]

Is there a Test Stripper (as defined in xUnit Test Patterns ) available that supports removing classes containing methods tagged as [Fact]s etc. plus the dependency on xunit.dll from binaries [as part of a build process] ? Further details of the full requirements and context are at this xUnit CodePlex post . Failing that (something that removes the tests and the reference to the DLL), does anyone have a utility/proven clean approach to removing the xunit.dll dependecy without too much monkeying around in .vcproj files etc. Open source preferred. A cleanly written one for NUnit might potentially serve as a base. NB: I'm aware of the negatives of embedding code into assemblies - this question isnt about that (unless you feel after reading the codeplex thread that some key points are being missed).
