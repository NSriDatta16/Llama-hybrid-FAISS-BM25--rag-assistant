Using averages of two different size groups

I'm not really "into" statistics, so I could use a hand on this one. I have two small groups, one has 12 students and the another one has 6. Both groups answered a questionnaire and I'm trying to find out which of the groups did better. I'm not sure if I should be using the average of correct answers to do this comparison. Can't this be unfair with the small group? Should I be using just 6 students of the larger group?
