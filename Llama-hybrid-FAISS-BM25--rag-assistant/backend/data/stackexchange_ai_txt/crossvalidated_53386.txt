In your notation, if you have a sample of, say, 1000 points from the posterior distribution of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (which you probably have, since you've MCMCed the model) stored in vectors alpha and beta , you can get a sample of 1000 points from the posterior predictive distribution $y_{11}\mid y_1,\dots,y_{10}$ doing rbinom(1000, n_11, rbeta(1000, alpha, beta)) . With this sample, you can compute any desired summaries, such as the posterior predictive mean, build histograms, etc. Take a careful look at these notes (especially page 7).
