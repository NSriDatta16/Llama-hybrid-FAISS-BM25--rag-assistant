How to find if there are words repeated twice in a row

For example i have the below paragraph in a MySQL database table field "The cutting off of the illumination of an astronomical object object, as in an eclipse of the Moon, when the Earth comes between" Here the word " object " appears twice in a row (next to each other). I want to check if this case appears in other records in same table. Is there an easy way to do this using PHP and MySQL
