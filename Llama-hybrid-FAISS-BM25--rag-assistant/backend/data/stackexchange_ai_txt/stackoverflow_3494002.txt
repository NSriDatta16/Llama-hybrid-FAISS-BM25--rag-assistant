Browsing all SVN repositories

We are moving from Visual Sourcesafe to Subversion within our organisation. I am running SVN via HTTP & Apache. We will be using a separate repository for each project. I am using TortoiseSVN and I would have thought by repo browsing to htp://server:12345/svn i would be able to see all the separate repositories. I get the following error: “Repository moved permanently to htp://server:12345/svn/; please relocate” I can browse to each of my repositories past the svn root so htp://server:12345/svn/Project1 etc My question is should I be able to do view all the repositories using Tortoise and if so what have I done wrong. If not then what tools do people use for browsing all there repositories? I have ViewVC installed and working but I was wondering if I could od this with any client desktop applications? Thanks
