Hypothesis Testing for the Time-Invariance of the Mean

I have a time series $X_t \in \{0, 1\} \forall t \in \mathbb{Z}$ . How do I investigate whether the mean of this time series belongs to the same distribution over time (weak stationarity!?)? Are there any standard statistical significance tests?
