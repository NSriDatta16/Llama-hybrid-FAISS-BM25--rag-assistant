hardware configuration for data science

I would like to know what type of computer configuration to use to perform datascience on medium to low quantity of data ( I have read some blog on people building their own system, but I am performing regressions essentially. Sklearn is quite well designed to me and 1 GPU with cuda would be enough for the rest. I am surprise to read no feedback about "standard" computer designed for gaming. They are maybe missing a bit of RAM, but after that they look not so bad. For example, a computer like an ASUS ROG HURACAN present interesting configuration for an accessible price. Am I missing a key point? any feedback to share? benchmark to share? thx for help!
