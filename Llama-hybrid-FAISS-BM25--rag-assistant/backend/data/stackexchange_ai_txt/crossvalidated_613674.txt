Would using a mahalanobis transformation be the same as standardize the variable?

I am trying to use mahalanobis transformation on a single variable that is autocorrelating with itself in a time series that goes from week to week over several years. The mahalanobis transformation is defined as this: "If S > 0 then S^(-1) has a unique symmetric positive definite square root S^(-1/2) The Mahalanobis transformation is defined by The Mahalanobis transformation is defined by z = S^(-1/2)(x - mean x) Then S = I, so that this transformation eliminates the correlation between the variables and standardizes the variance of each variable. Currently this is the steps I am doing: calculate the mean data calculate the covariance matrix calculate the inverse square root of the covariance matrix. Then calculate (x - mean x) * inverse square root of the covariance matrix. My results give me the exactly same as standardizing the variable (I have 600 values if it's important) so the data is not decorrelated. Am I doing something obviously wrong or is it that the mahalanobis transformation just isn't suited for a singular variable? I am using python for this calculation so if any of you that see this want to see the code to I can put it under: def mahalanobis_transform(data): # Calculate the mean of the data mean_data = np.mean(data, axis=0) # Calculate the covariance matrix cov_matrix = np.cov(data, rowvar=False) # Calculate the inverse square root of the covariance matrix inv_sqrt_cov = 1 / np.sqrt(cov_matrix) # Perform the Mahalanobis transformation for a scalar covariance matrix transformed_data = (data - mean_data) * inv_sqrt_cov return transformed_data All answers appreciated.
