nonvirtual interface idiom for more than two levels of inheritance?

The non-virtual interface idiom describes how the virtual methods are nonpublic customisation points, and public methods are nonvirtual to allow the base class to control at all times how the customisation points are called. This is an elegant idiom and I like to use it, but how does it work if the derived class is a base class in itself
