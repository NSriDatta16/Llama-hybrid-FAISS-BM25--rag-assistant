David, I recently took a look at the open source Part Cover . It too has issues with 64 bit, the work around also being corflag, provided by a Sharp Develop contributor, who package and integrate with Part Cover. The snk file is in in their SVN repo . Is NCover Enterprise worth it? I guess only you can really make that decision. There is a 21 day trial. If you can't justify the outlay Part Cover could help you. It appears that all .NET code coverage tools use c++ packaged as COM. Unless somebody can come up with a managed code implementation, I suspect a 64 bit build will always be required.
