To me it sounds like untestable code, which is a smell :-( I would recommend reading http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/ . The author is coach responsible for teaching google developers in the testing area. In the article he shows how you can write testable and untestable code. Further recommended reading: Clean Code (Robert C. Martin) - main focus on how to write clean (which corresponds to testable) code. Working effectively with legacy code (Michael Feather) - shows ways to get untested and untestable code under control.
