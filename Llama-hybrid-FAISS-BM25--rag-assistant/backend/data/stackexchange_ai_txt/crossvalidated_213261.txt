This is too broad question and must be answered carefully. What are your features? If you have categorical features, you are better to encode it in one-hot manner and then you may circumvent scaling problems. Also, it depends on a classifier you want to use downstream : SVM will not tolerate badly scaled and uncentered data, but XGBoost will do ( to some degree ) Without much details it is hard to know whether rescaling your data will improve the performance of your algorithms before you apply them. If often can, but not always. A good tip is to create rescaled copies of your dataset and race them against each other using your test harness and a handful of algorithms you want to spot check. This can quickly highlight the benefits (or lack there of) of rescaling your data with given models, and which rescaling method may be worthy of further investigation.
