Linking code coverage to version control

Before I commit a change, I'd like to be sure that all of it has been tested, either automatically or manually with a code coverage report, but there is lots of legacy code that doesn't have automated tests, and won't be affected by my changes. Is there a tool that can cross reference a diff from a version control tool with a code coverage report and make sure everything that has been changed has been run? I realise that with code coverage, this may give a false sense of security, and with something like this, even more so, but I think it would be worth trying. I use git and PHP - I've used XCache's code coverager interface to browse what I have run, and it's useful, but it would be great if something could run automatically at git commit or push time.
