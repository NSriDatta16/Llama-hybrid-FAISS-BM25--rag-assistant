What is the best method to reuse animations for cocos2d?

I would like to be able to allocate a few actions so that I can use and reuse them again and again on whatever target CCNode I want. I assumed I could just load them up with a generic NSObject class in an init then call them when nessicary from a method but was unable to. Was I just inept at my attempt or is there a more elegant solution? @implementation Animation @synthesize animation; -(id) init { if ( (self=[super init]) ) { animation = [CCScaleTo actionWithDuration: 0.15 scale: 2.0]; } return self; } - (id) myAnimation { return animation; } [targetCCNode runAction:[Animation myAnimation]];
