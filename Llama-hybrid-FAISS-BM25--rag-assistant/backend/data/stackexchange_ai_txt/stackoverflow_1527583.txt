The application had to register itself to accept Drag'n Drop of certain kind of Data. Before a view can receive a drag operation, you need to register the data types that it can accept by invoking its registerForDraggedTypes:, like this: [self registerForDraggedTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObjects: NSColorPboardType, NSFilenamesPboardType, nil]]; The full details are here: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DragandDrop/DragandDrop.pdf
