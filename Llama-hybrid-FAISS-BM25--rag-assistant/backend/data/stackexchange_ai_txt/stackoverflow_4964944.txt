What's a good Flask/Python/WSGI analog to the PHP Apache shared memory stores like apc_store/apc_fetch?

I've done a couple of years of large-scale game server development in PHP. A load balancer delegates incoming requests to one server in a cluster. In the name of better performance, we began caching all static data (essentially the game world's model objects) on each of the instances in that cluster, directly in Apache shared memory, using apc_store and apc_fetch . For a number of reasons, we're now beginning to develop a similar game framework in Python, using the Flask microframework. At first glance, this instance's memory store is the one piece that doesn't appear to translate directly to Python/Flask. We're presently considering running Memcached locally on each instance (to avoid streaming fairly large model objects over-the-wire from our main Memcached cluster.) What can we use instead?
