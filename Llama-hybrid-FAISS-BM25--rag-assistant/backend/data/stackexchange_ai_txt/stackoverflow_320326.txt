Is there a quick way to generate a line for a user control?

I make a user control and then want to include it on a page I have to always manually type the @Register line at the top of my .aspx file, e.g. Is there any way to automatically create these @Register lines? (I tried dragging in the .ascx file from the Solution Explorer, doesn't work.) Problem solved : I was dragging into my source view instead of design view. Thanks DilbertDave.
