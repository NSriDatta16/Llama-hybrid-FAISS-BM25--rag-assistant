First, get it out of native Word ( .doc ) format. Do a "Save As XML" and insist your users work with that file instead of the .doc file. They'll hardly notice the difference -- except that the file is bigger. Use lxml or element tree to parse the XML and find the headings, sections, paragraphs and lists. You can also do a "Save As HTML" before doing your analysis. This works just as well as the XML version. The HTML version isn't as easy for users, however, so do this prior to your analysis only. Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and find the headings, sections, paragraphs and lists. Once you have a parse structure (XML or HTML) you can analyze the document looking for specific tags.
