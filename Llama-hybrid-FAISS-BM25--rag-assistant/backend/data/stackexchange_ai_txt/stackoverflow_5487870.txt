VBA Word and using Excel columns as a lookup and replace

I have a MS Word Doc that has the wrong words in it when it comes to me. I have a list of these words in Excel column A of book1, sheet1. I also have what the words should be column B of book1, sheet1. The list is about 300 words but the doc is only 50 words. My thought is to copy and paste the text in the word doc with the VBA. Run a VBA to set Col A as a string and search the word doc. When found, replace it with Col B. At the end of the Doc set the next Col A as the string and do it again... until last line. I've work in Excel coding but I lost on this one. As always any help is great. Robert
