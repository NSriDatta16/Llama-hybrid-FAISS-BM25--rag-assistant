Can I make this two LINQ queries into one query only?

From a List of builtAgents I need all items with OptimPriority == 1 and only 5 items with OptimPriority == 0. I do this with two seperate queries but I wonder if I could make this with only one query. IEnumerable priorityAgents = from pri in builtAgents where pri.OptimPriority == 1 select pri; IEnumerable otherAgents = (from oth in builtAgents where oth.OptimPriority == 0 select oth).Take(5);
