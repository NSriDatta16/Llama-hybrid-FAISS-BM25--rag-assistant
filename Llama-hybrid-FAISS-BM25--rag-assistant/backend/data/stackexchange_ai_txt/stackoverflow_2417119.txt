Organising asp.net website development process

Is there a standard practice to organize the process of developing a simple website. there is no use implementing MVC as there is no data base involved. It will be very useful in organizing the project and separating the aspx files and master page content(this can be very useful in implementing simple cms techniques) user controls scripts styles images is there any industry standard or best practice for this.? thanks in advance :) Update: yes the way i have listed is convenient. but it would be great if i could separate server codes and files like master,aspx.. and the actual page content. One more reason for not using MVC: I usually outsource the SEO process. Now an MVC application can be greek/latin for my SEO expert. :) The final structure: Project Images Scripts Styles Images Weblets Pagelets aspx files.. the images, styles and scripts will contain only those that are common for the whole project. The weblets and pagelets are in the idea as follows... Weblets should contain a collection of weblets. A weblet is folder containing a user control,it's styles,scripts,images etc., Pagelets should contain a collection of pagelets. A pagelet is a folder containing the content for the aspx page. If there is an aspx file named "aboutUs.aspx" then there is a corresponding pagelet named "aboutUs" which contains aboutUs.html,it's styles,scripts and images. the aspx page should only include them here.This can be very useful in configuring CMS. If there can be betterments please do post..:)
