Should I store my images in the database or folders?

Possible Duplicate: Storing Images in DB - Yea or Nay? Hi At the moment each Company on my website have 1 picture they can add to their profile. I save that image into the database....its their Company Logo. Now i want to allow them to add more pictures. Now i donâ€™t know if i must save it all in the database or save it in folders???? Reason why i think folders will be better is because there are so much nice articles with fancy silver light kinda features that i can use but all of them only cater for images saved in folders. And since i am not THAT good its hard for me to change the code to look at the database instead of the examples that uses folders for image retrieval. I would like to add something like this to my website (browsing through the images). Any code examples for me on how to do this when images are saved in the database? I am using ASP.NET with VB.net.
