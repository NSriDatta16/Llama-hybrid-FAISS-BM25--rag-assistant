NHibernate Has Many Relationship with Grandchild Table Containing Multiple Many-to-One References

there are three existing tables defined like the following: create table business_units (id number(10,0) not null, ... , primary key (id)) create table categories (id number(10,0) not null, ... , primary key (id)) create table paragraphs ( id number(10,0) not null, business_unit_fk number(10,0), category_fk number(10,0), ..., primary key (id) ) the entities are defined like: public class BusinessUnit : Entity { public virtual IList Categories { get; protected set; } } public class Category : Entity { public virtual IList Paragraphs { get; protected set; } } public class Paragraph : Entity { public virtual BusinessUnit Category { get; set; } public virtual Category Category { get; set; } } i have tried the following overrides: BusinessUnit auto-mapping override: mapping.HasMany(x => x.Categories) .Table("pp_paragraphs") .KeyColumn("business_unit_fk") .Inverse(); Category auto-mapping override: mapping.HasMany(x => x.Categories) .Inverse(); i have has-many and many-to-one conventions that take care of the column names, so i don't think i need to specify here (or at least i don't think so). The auto-mapper takes care of the many-to-one reference for Paragraph . the has-many mapping for BusinessUnit does not work. how can i pull this off?
