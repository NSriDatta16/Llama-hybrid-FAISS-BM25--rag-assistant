This isn't possible with HTTPService. Its only events are result , fault , and invoke (other than the non-relevant inherited events of activate and deactivate ). To get progress information on an upload process, the server would have to provide the information, which would require a means of communication between the server and the client during the operation, which isn't there for a regular HTTP POST operation. One option might be to create an object on the server that would be instantiated whenever the server began receiving POST data from your client. It would then keep track of the progress and expose that data to the rest of your server-side application. Your client could then initiate a polling system that would request the value of that particular variable. Seems like kind of a far-fetched option, though...
