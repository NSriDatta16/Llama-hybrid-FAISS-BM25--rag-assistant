If a time series is observed to have values 1,9,1,9,1,9,1,5,1,9,1,9 â€¦.one can identify a pulse effect at period 8 where a "5" was observed AND a "9" was expected thus the "5" could be replaced by a "9" to reflect an exogenous deterministic effect such as you describe. This is solved using "Intervention Detection Procedures" which takes into account any arima structure that might be in play or operational due to systematic effects both stochastic and deterministic. If you post your data and a brief description (always useful ! ) , I might be able to help further.
