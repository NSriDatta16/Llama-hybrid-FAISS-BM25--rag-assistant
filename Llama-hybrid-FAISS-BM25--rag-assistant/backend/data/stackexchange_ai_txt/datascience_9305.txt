I am voting to close it as off-topic. (StudentT has already given a wonderful answer :) ) Firstly, it is up to you to take the decision. You have to have a passion for data, and willing to get your feet dirty at it. It is not the end, if your colleagues are not mentoring you. No one mentored me when I was preparing myself. I have written an answer on Quora about how I disturbed a lot of people till they mentored me. In fact, they were very happy to. Will it be a wise decision to leave a company where I've an opportunity to see product from end to end and go to a company where I'll not the same visibility of product ? The domain of data science is very difficult. Let me cite an example from my team. Me, being the lead, have an idea of the entire product end-to-end, however the ones in my team working on customer success analytics don't have the complete idea on the entire product(in fact, they don't need to), and vice versa. So, it is completely dependant on the role. Is my next opportunity a good one if I want to make my career in big data space ? Big data space? Yes In data science? Maybe, but you have a lot of ground to cover .
