How to estimate daily spam rate from random hourly sampling?

Problem at hand: I need to compute daily ratio of spam vs non spam emails by sampling N number of emails per unit of time. In other words, instead of collecting all emails and sorting them, I would like to employ random sampling and examine only a small batch of emails received for N minutes every hour. 1 How to estimate daily amount of email if I have an incomplete set of 24 batches of e-mail samples? 2 Would Markov chain Monte Carlo work in this case? Thank you
