Grails Domain Class Dynamic List As A property

Let's say I have a domain class called ShopCategoryPageTab. And I have a domain class called Product. I want ShopCategoryPageTab to have a list of Products. However, this list is not static, but determined by a formula. For example, I might want to have a "products" property which would list all products with criteria X, Y Z. So this property/list is not entered manually by someone, it is dynamically generated. (products can be removed/added by an external applications, product properties could be changing). Is there such a thing?
