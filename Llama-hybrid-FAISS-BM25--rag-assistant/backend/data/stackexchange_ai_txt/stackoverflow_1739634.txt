The typical route looks like this: http://www.domain.com/controller/action/id [domain/controller/action/id] In your case, it's short one part: http://server/us/beer [domain/controller/action?/?] As Robert Harvey said, you wouldn't want to have an action for every product. So how about something like: http://server/us/product/beer [domain/controller/action/id] domain = server controller = us (tho, this doesn't seem like it would be a good name for the controller) action = product id = beer Then you'd develop a product view that would show the beer data to your visitors. This isn't architect-ed very well, but without knowing your situation it would be difficult for anyone to answer this. I hope this helps though.
