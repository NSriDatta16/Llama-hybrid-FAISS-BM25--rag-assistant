Are javaws exit codes really broken?

I was working to automate same java code execution using JNLP and I was surprised to discover that jawaws did not gave me a valid return code. Original execution line was: javaws -wait http://example.com:666/missing.jnlp This did showed an ugly window with "Unable to launch application." message. As you can image I tried to make this not require a GUI and tried: javaws -wait -Xnosplash -import -silent http://example.com:666/missing.jnlp But even if this command fails, it will still return 0 , success. How to solve this?
