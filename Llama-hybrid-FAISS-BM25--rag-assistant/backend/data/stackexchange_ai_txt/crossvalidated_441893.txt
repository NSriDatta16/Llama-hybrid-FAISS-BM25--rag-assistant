Logistic regression can be tailored to the case with errors in labels. There is an example (with code) in the fourth edition of MASS-the book , chapter 16. Code can be found here . If you really know (approximately) the proportions of the true labels, a Bayesian version could be useful. But your case seems to be special, with a very high probability of wrong labels. Could it be feasible to do a study, by sampling randomly some (1000, 1000s) of your 40 million cases, verify the label manually, and so study if the probability of wrong labeling depends on covariates in some way? If so, you might get a much better model.
