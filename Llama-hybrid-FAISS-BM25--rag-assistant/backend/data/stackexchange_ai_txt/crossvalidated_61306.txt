Solution 1 has an issue with sequence length. For instance, if you are interested in the word A and all your sequences have length 10,000 it is extremely likely that they all contain the word of interest in which case the Fisher test will not report anything significant, even if the occurrence of the word varies a lot within the sequences. Solution 2 suffers some bias if the sequences from the set A do not have the same average length as the sequences of set B. Solution 3 looks best to me. But you should concatenate all the sequences of set A, compute the average coverage by the word of interest and do the same with the sequences of set B, so that you are down to the problem of comparing two proportions . To my knowledge, giving the correct answer to your problem is currently impossible because the occurrences of the words are not independent. If these are real genes there can be strong local dependencies between the words, and modeling those dependencies is technically challenging. However, if you are ready to accept the simplifying assumption that words are independent and identically distributed, you can use the Gaussian approximation and wrap it up with Student's t-test . You can find a full account of this approach on this page . Briefly, you compute the two proportions $p_1$ and $p_2$, use the pooled standard error estimate $\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)/n_1 + p_2(1-p_2)/n_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the total nucleotide lengths of sequences in set A and B and look up the value of the following statistic in the quantiles of the standard Gaussian distribution. $$ x = \frac{p_1-p_2}{\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)/n_1 + p_2(1-p_2)/n_2}} $$ If you use R, the p-value of the test will be 2*pnorm(abs(x), lower.tail=FALSE) .
