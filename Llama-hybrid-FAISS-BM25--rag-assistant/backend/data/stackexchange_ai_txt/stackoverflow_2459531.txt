SharePoint is Microsoft's fastest ever growing product, with many many companies using it worldwide. This growth has really begun to happen over the past couple of years, and with SharePoint 2010 due out in May, it is set to continue for a while. Given the growth rate, there is a huge demand for developers with SharePoint skills. It is a broad product which can be used to create business applications, content managed web sites, collaboration portals and much more. SharePoint can be used out-of-the-box, but one of it's strength's is in how customizable it is. A SharePoint developer can leverage a lot of this out of box functionality and combine it with .NET skills to create highly functional business solutions quickly, easily and at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions. What are the advantages for a programmer? I would say job prospects for the future, along with good salaries are good ones! In order to be a good SharePoint developer, you should probably have a solid foundation in ASP.NET, as well as other web development skills (eg CSS, XML/XSL, Javascript). Windows Workflow Foundation, Windows Communication Foundation and Silverlight wouldn't hurt either!
