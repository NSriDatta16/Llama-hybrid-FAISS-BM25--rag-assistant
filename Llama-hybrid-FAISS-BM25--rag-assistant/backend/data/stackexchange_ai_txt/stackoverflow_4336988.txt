The answer to question #2 depends on what technology you use and, more importantly, where the certificate is stored. In Java Key Storage (JKS) certificates are protected with passwords and those passwords are passed in code. In Windows Certificate Storage (location that .NET cryptography classes use) certificates are protected using PIN which can not be set by code for most cryptoproviders (there's extension command to set the PIN but most providers don't support it) and the user needs to confirm access to the private key by hand. If you use certificate stored in PKCS12 file, then the password for the file is also set in code. And, well, we offer components for signing office documents in .NET, if you are interested ( check here ). They are maintained and supported, unlike most sample code.
