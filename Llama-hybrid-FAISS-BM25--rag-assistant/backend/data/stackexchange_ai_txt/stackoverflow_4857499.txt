There's a handle (in the connections panel) on each text field called "nextfield" or something along those lines? (I can't remember off the top of my head) But if you drag that to the next box, that's how it knows (manually). I think generally it guesses using the X/Y location, but when you need to manually do it, just drag that handle.
