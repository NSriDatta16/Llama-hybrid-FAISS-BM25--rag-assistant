PHP embedding in HTML problem

I'm having problems embedding php inside an html file. I first ran in to this problem when I was trying to 'include' a php file inside tags, and thought it was related to css formatting, or something. But now I've broken this down into the simplest php and html possible, with an example from a book that should work, and I'm still getting this problem. Here's the html sample that doesn't work: PHP inside HTML tester I'm expecting 'Hello World' to show up in my browsers, but nothing is displayed. When I try to 'view source', I see exactly the text above. I figure that after all the examples of this I've tried, the code is ok, but something is keeping what's inside the from being recognized. Any suggestions? And thanks for helping me out with what's probably a dumb question.
