AdvancedDatagrid DataTipFunction

i have a grouped AdvancedDatagrid. It looks like... dataProvider - GroupingCollection2 - Grouping - GroupingField - summaries - summaryRow - fields. Sorry for the strage Codefragemt. I try everything to paste a litte bit mxml-Code. But i fail... And a AdvancedDataGrid Column with a long long description. I want to show a DataTip. In the grouped headline, the DataTip shows [Object][Object]. In the expanded lines, the DataTip works fine. I assume, what I need is a DataTipFunction to fix this. In this function, i will receive a object (AdvancedDataGridColumn). But how can i reference to the data of the highlighted line? And how can i find out, if this is a groupedLine or an expanded? Thank you for reading it Frank
