Dealing with missing observation is a never ending problem. There are a few approaches i will mention, but I am sure others will add more. Make sure there is no any problems in recording the data, such as systematic omitting certain values. Given you have no control for it, then other options need to be considered. Based on the proportion of missing values, you have different options. If there are less than 5% missing observations: 2.1 I would not care, and use either average or median based on the shape of the sample's distribution. Some use this approach even when there are more than 5% missing observations. It is a very quick solution when time pressed. If there are more than 5% missing observations, some advanced techniques can used: 2.2 Data imputation methods is a wide class of techniques to impute missing values based on the observed values of the variable/or other variables. For example, in time series framework, some values could be forecast based on the observed time series data. In regression framework, knowledge of other variables as well can be used to impute missing variables, i.e., build a regression model for the variable of interest (the one with missing values) as a function of other variables available (probably excluding the original dependent variable Y) and then predict the missing values using the model. A more advanced technique is Expectation Maximization method. Finally, a dummy variable can be used just to control for the missing values. M
