I'm skirting around the question on your simulation set up, and addressing the wider question of determining sample size in this scenario. You could turn the question on its head (as I understand your question -- a binomial outcome, one continuous predictor) and then determine the power to detect a difference in means of the continuous predictor between the two groups on your binary variable. This is very easy to calculate. From a hypothesis testing perspective, these two analyses should give identical p-values, and so power for the two scenarios should also be equivalent. see also some of the discussion on Choosing between logistic regression and Mann Whitney/t-tests for details on this. More detailed consideration is in the following article on sample size considerations for logistic regression by Hsieh et al. (pubmed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9699234 ; full paper available at http://personal.health.usf.edu/ywu/logistic.pdf )
