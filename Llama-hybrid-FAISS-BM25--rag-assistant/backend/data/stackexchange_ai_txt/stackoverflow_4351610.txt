The motivation to defer loading of data from isolated storage until the app is loaded, and to do it asycnrhonously is two-fold. There is a lot of work being done to load the app on these resource constrained devices. If it's practical for your app to do so, then defering any actions until after the app is responsive will improve the user experience. Noting also that you have a cert reqt of 5s to show something and 20s to be responsive - and some devices are slower/faster than others. Async is good for any non trivial operations so that you don't block the UI thread and interfere and cause the device to appear not fully responsive. It's worth keeping in mind that the phone may be doing things you haven't considered in the background in additional to your normal low load testing scenarios - such as syncing mail. I concur with Matt, that loading 2 strings, for the sake of login credentials, is probably not going to cause you a performance issue. If you wanted to be ultra diligent, you could load that data asynchronously after the login page is loaded and have the controls disabled until such time as that data is retrieved.
