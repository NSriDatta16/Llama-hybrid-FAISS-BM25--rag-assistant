In Bayesian Ridge Regression, is the ridge regression parameter $\lambda$ treated as random?

I am having a hard time understanding the Bayesian Ridge Regression. In Bayesian Ridge Regression, is the ridge regression parameter $\lambda$ treated as random? or do we treat the $\lambda$ as given? Thank you,
