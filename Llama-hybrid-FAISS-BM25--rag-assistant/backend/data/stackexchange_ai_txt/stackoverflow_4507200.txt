See Team Foundation Build Activities on MSDN for documentation on all the included build activities. The GetBuildAgent activity can only be used within an AgentScope activity. It returns the IBuildAgent object of the build agent that it is running on. William's book on Inside the Microsoft Build Engine: Using MSBuild and Team Foundation Build will also cover these build activities in more detail.
