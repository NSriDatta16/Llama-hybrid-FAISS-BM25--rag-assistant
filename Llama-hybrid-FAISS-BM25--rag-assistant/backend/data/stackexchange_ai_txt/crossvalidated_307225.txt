You took a wrong approach, nothing can be done with this approach to fix the issue. There are several different ways to address the problem. I'll suggest the most obvious one through feature engineering. Instead of plugging time as a linear feature, put it as remainder of modulus T=1. For instance, t=0.2, 1.2 and 2.2 will all become a feature t1 = 0.1 etc. As long as T is larger than the period of wave, this will work out. Plug this thing into your net and see how it works. Feature engineering is underrated. There's this trend in AI/ML where the sales men claim that you dump all your inputs into the net, and somehow it'll figure out what to do with them. Sure, it does, as you saw in your example, but then it breaks down as easily. This is a great example that show how important is to build good features even in some simplest cases. Also, I hope you realize that this is the crudest example of feature engineering. It's just to give you an idea of what you could do with it.
