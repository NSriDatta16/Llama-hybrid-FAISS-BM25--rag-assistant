To simplify development and leverage your experience in Swing consider using Vaadin for your frontend . It is a Java framework for building modern web applications that look great, and perform well. All the code is written in Java and looks very similar to Swing. As far as overall application architecture I would advise multi-tier, service oriented architecture. The best way to do it is by using Spring framework with Hibernate for database access .
