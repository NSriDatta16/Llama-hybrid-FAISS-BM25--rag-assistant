Although imitation is sincerest form of flattery, the world does not need another Git. I certainly don't mean to discourage you from pursuing something related, though. Could you get credit for adding features or using the Git back-end for a different purpose? A few things I've thought of doing with Git but haven't had the time are: Add tracking of special files. Add tracking of directory permissions. Use the Git back-end as an immutable data store for something other than version tracking (perhaps for storage of sensitive data or something). I hope you find something cool to work on!
