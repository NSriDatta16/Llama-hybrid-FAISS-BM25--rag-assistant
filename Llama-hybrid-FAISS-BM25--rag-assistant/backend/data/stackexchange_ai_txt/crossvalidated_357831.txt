Architecture to build model off of partners data while protecting each partners intellectual property

Are there any architectures that allow two partners to build a model while protecting each of their respective intellectual property (IP)? For example: Company A builds machine learning models Company B has a large data set Company A does not want to expose how it builds their models, and company B can not loose control of their (HIPPA/medical) data. Thank you in advance for any thoughts you might have on this.
