Factor analysis across different levels of data aggregation

I have survey data for thousands of individuals from hundreds of towns. I want to identify factors underlying certain characteristics at the town level and the individual level. The individual level is straightforward. But I'm less clear on how to proceed with the town-level data. I am considering two approaches. 1) We can calculate community-level averages for each covariate and then calculate loadings on those averages. (The downside is that averaging up front before calculating loadings would lose a lot of information.) 2) we can calculate loadings on the individual-level data and then calculate the factors using community-level averages of the covariates. (i.e., $\text{factors} = \text{loadings} * \text{comm_level_avgs}$.) I'm leaning toward this option, but I'm not sure if we can calculate loadings at one level of aggregation (individual data) and then use them to calculate factors at a different level of aggregation (town-level averages). Any thoughts are appreciated! Use option 1, 2, neither? Based on ttnphns comment, I've added an example on how I'm running the analysis here. I haven't uploaded simulation data because the data aren't really the point. I care about whether my suggestions are based on sound statistical reasoning. Below is the code I use to calculate individual-level loadings, with some code that demonstrates the two different options I'm considering for calculating town-level factors. ### What I've done so far require(psych) # Factor Analysis ### Define the correlation matrix of all X variables (all model inputs) corMat
