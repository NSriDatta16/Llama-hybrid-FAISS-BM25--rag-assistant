Issues in pattern recognition and plots

I am trying to compare the performance of a classification result with Bayes classifier, K-NN, principal component analysis (PCA). I have doubts regarding the following (please excuse my lack of programming skills since I am a biologist and not a programmer thus finding hard to follow the matlab documentation) In the Matlab code Class = knnclassify(Sample, Training, Group, k) Group = [1;2;3] //where 1,2,3 represents Class A,B,C respectively. What goes in the sample because my data is a 100 row 1 column for each of the classes? So Group 1 contains data like $[0.9;0.1;......n]$ where $n=100$. Would the sample be a vector containing random mixtures of the data points from the three classes? Same query/doubt for Training matrix. I cannot follow crossval() & cvpartition() function given in MATLAB documentation crossval() . Would be obliged if a simpler version of it is provided here. Is there a code for multi-class ROC since Internet resources provide information about binary class ROC. How to proceed for ROC plot when there are three or more classes like in my case? Is it possible to obtain a surface plot from the confusion mmatrix from the command confusemat() ?
