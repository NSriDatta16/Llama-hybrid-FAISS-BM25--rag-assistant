Testing 2 populations and how the effect of one variable impacts the score of a 2nd variable

Brief summary of my study: I am studying two types of organizations, A and B. For both organizations A and B, I measured how centralization affected innovation. There were significant differences between the results in organization A compared to Organization B. I have 303 total responses--212 from Organization A and 91 from Organization B. The Pearson correlations of centralization on innovation were -0.04 and 0.33, respectively. So I have two populations, the centralization score (independent variable), and innovation score (dependent variable). Here are my questions: It was suggested that I do a t-test. I was wondering if I should do the t-test on the independent variable, the dependent variable, or both? Also, if the independent t-test on the innovation score says there is no significant difference between populations, does that mean these Pearson correlations are bogus? Similarly, do I find the p-value from the all 303 responses, or for each of the two types of organizations? Finally, what other tests should I run?
