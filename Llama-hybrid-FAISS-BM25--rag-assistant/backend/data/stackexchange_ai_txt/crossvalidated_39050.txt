Correlation clustering algorithms such as 4C, ERiC or LMCLUS usually consider clusters to be linear manifolds. I.e. k-dimensional hyperplanes in a d-dimensional space. Well, for 4C and ERiC only locally linear, so they can in fact be non-convex. But they still try to detect clusters of a reduced local dimensionality. Finding arbitrary shaped clusters in high dimensional data is a quite tough problem. In particular, because of the curse of dimensionality which lets the search space explode and at the same time also requires that you have a much larger input data if you still want significant results. Way too many algorithms don't pay attention to whether what they find is still significant or could as well be random. So in fact I believe there are other problems to solve before thinking about the convexity of non-convexity of complex clusters in high-dimensional space. Also have a look at the complexity of computing the convex hull in higher dimensions... Also, do you have a true use case for that beyond curiosity?
