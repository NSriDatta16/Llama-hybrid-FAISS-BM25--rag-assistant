Which Deep Learning Method to use for the classification of precious stones (diamonds, sapphire, ruby etc) based on digital photo images and data set?

m trying to build Machine Learning Model for the classification of precious stones (like diamonds, sapphire, ruby) based on digital images. So with time the it was performed 150,000 gemstone certifications and the characteristics of each stone are recorded in a structured manner including its digital photo-image. I can use this data set to augment the human work, and with help of Deep Learning to do the stone classification So based on my experience and research CNN are most suitable for this work as they ar handling spatial data (images). But according to this paper "Bona Hiu Yan Chow, ‘Automatic Gemstone Classification Using Computer Vision’ Gemstone classification the Random Forest algorithm provides the best accuracy and outperformed the CNN ( ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 ) which I dont really understand. Any explanation why is the case? Is the state-of-the-art YOLO v8. or v7. more accurate as it works better for smaller objects such as stones? So for my case when have a bid data set (over 100 000 images) should I stick to CNN or still use Random Forest? Any help, as I have to choose the right model with best accuracy Thanks
