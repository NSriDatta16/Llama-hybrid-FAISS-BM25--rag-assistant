ASP.NET postback with JavaScript

I have several small div s which are utilizing jQuery draggable. These div s are placed in an UpdatePanel , and on dragstop I use the _doPostBack() JavaScript function, where I extract necessary information from the page's form. My problem is that when I call this function, the whole page is re-loaded, but I only want the update panel to be re-loaded.
