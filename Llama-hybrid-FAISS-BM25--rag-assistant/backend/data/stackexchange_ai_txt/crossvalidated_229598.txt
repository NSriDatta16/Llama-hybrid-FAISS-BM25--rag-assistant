Two models estimated using two different, but strongly related predictors (r > 0.99) yielding different results

This isn't a problem with correlation between predictors - I have two models, each considers only one of the variables. That is the only difference between the models. I'm estimating the probability of an diagnosis given some confounders and a measure of monthly temperature. I have two possible temperature definitions I'm considering: monthly average temperature and monthly average high temperature. I don't expect the response to temperature to be linear, so I broke average temperature into 5 degree bins with bottom and top coding at 90. I did the same with average high temperature but shifted the bins slightly with bottom and top coding 100. I estimate the first logistic model event ~ age + sex + ... + mean_temp_group and get the response I'd expect from my theorized process. However, I'd prefer to report the results using mean high temperature since average temperature is misleadingly low (average temp of 70, for instance, is pretty warm with highs in the 80s but people think "70 degrees? That's wonderful!"). So I estimate the same model but instead replace mean_temp_group with mean_high_group : event ~ age + sex + ... + mean_high_group and the results don't match either my theory or what I saw with mean_temp_group . That seems weird given how similar the two variables are. The average and average high variables have a correlation coefficient of 0.9939. In essence the average high is the average plus a constant (on average, 9.4 degrees with a standard deviation of 2.1). At first I assumed this was a problem with the code, so I re-pulled the data (still have the same problem and the data extraction seems to be accurate). I also took the model with mean_temp_group and edited the formula in place to read mean_high_group lest I omitted/included a different variable between the models (I didn't). I assume it has something to do with the binning or something along those lines - any ideas? I'm very confused by two variables that basically appear to be an additive shift of each other giving very different results.
