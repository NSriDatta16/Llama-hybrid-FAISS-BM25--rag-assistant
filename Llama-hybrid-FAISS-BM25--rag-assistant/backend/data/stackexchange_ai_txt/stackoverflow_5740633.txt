Watching new entries on Linux Syslog from a C program

I want to write a program that monitors syslog and performs an action when PPP authentication fails. I think "tail -f /var/log/syslog" could help, but I'm not sure how to use it... probably using pipes? I have found something similar written in bash, but I'm not sure how to implement it in C. This is the bash method: First create a named pipe using mkfifo: $ mkfifo -p /home/mezgani/syslog.pipe Make syslog.conf to points to this file: *.info |/home/mezgani/syslog.pipe Restart syslog: $ sudo pkill -HUP syslogd Create processing script that read the pipe $ cat > foo #!/bin/bash cat /home/mezgani/syslog.pipe | while read input do # some stuff echo ${input} # â€¦. done
