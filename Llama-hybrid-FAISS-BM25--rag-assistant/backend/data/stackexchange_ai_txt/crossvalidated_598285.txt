What is the structure of my Linear mixed effect model?

I'm planning to use a LMM for my analysis. This is new to me. I wonder what structure my LMM has? Is it a nested random factor LMM? As I tried to show in the graphic already, I took body length and isotopic values from organs of every individual in my sample collection. And how can I classify it according to the McGraw and Wong (1996) Convention? In order to choose the correct ICC?
