Is this a Markov Chain and/or Poisson thing?

I know how to predict the winner of a football match in Python with a simple / multiple regression model, or Bayes. But I have the intuition that the last matches played are more relevant for the outcome than the older ones. How can I give more weight to the last matches than the older ones in my statistical model?
