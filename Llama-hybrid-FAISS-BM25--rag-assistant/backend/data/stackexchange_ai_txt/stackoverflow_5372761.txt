how do I reference a separate project in xcode 4?

How do I reference another project which has code I wish to leverage in XCode 4. In particular I'm trying to make use of the NSDate extensions from here . Some notes: I was assuming I should probably reference rather than trying build a framework I tried copying the existing "Hello World" xcode project file across into my project, however this didn't seem to work Do I need to create a new "Target" based on "coco touch static library" option? Then would I need to Edit the current Product Scheme so that when I build the new target would build What do I need to do on my project side exactly - should going Add Files, and choosing the extensions Xcode Project File be enough? thanks
