Is it OK if I have some high leverage points in my experimental plots and they weren't outliers?

I've analyzed effects of temperature and sample thickness on drying process via response surface methodology. I've faced to four high leverage points (my four axial runs) that stick together on normal probability plot. these points aren't the outlier (on residual versus run plot).
