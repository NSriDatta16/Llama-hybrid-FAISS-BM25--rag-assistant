The decision boundary of SVM is $wx+b=0$ . When you shift this line to positive and negative sides by some amount, you'll get parallel lines of the form: $wx+b=\pm d$ . $wx+b=d$ will hit positive SVs and $wx+b=-d$ will hit negative SVs. Instead of using a third variable ( $d$ ) here, we could scale $w$ and $b$ such that our line does not change. For example, $2x+3y=0$ and $4x+6y=0$ are still the same. Similarly, one could search for $w$ and $b$ such that $wx+b=\pm1$ at SVs without loss of generality.
