Finding associated words to a named entity

Is there a way to find a list of associated words to a Named Entity? For instance : let the Named Entity be FIFA. Now FIFA is a Football Organization and hence related to the term football and all the terms related to football like jersey, footballers, goal, goalkeeper, halftime, penalty, freekick et cetera. Is there a way we could do that? I have tried Babelnet but didn't get the desired results or anything even close to what I want.
