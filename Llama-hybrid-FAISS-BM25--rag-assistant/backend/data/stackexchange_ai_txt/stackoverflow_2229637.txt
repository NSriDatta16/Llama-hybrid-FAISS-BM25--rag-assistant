The following way worked for me: Set XLHandle = CreateObject("Excel.Application") XLHandle.DisplayAlerts = False XLHandle.Visible = True Set XLBook = XLHandle.WorkBooks.Open("c:\temp\1.xls") 'This is where your user reviews the book and manually closes it. 'If you want to test out this code set a breakpoint at the next line, manually close Excel workbook then proceed with the execution. 'In your App you would need to implement certain synchronization with user actions instead of setting a breakpoint. XLHandle.Quit Set XLBook = Nothing Set XLHandle = Nothing This way you suppress all the pop-ups. You can access DisplayAlerts property any time, not only after creation of automation object.
