The shadow is easy: // Bold shows up better when over an image image1.Canvas.Font.Style := [fsBold]; // Write the shadow first image1.Canvas.Brush.Style:=bsClear; image1.Canvas.Font.Color := clGrayText; image1.Canvas.TextOut(1, 1, 'hi there'); // Then put the text on top (slightly offset) image1.Canvas.Brush.Style:=bsClear; image1.Canvas.Font.Color :=clBlack; image1.Canvas.TextOut(0, 0, 'hi there'); This is text with a transparent background. Or did you want the text itself to be simi-transparent? That is a little trickier. You would need to draw it manually. An easy way to do it instead would be to sample the average of the color of the area you are writing on the image. Then set your font color to be a little lighter and your shadow to be a little darker. Then it kind of blends in.
