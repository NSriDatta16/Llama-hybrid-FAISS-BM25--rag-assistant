Something like this definitely does the trick - I've verified that the output is correct using the 3.5 sp1 framework: var avg = DB .Where(a => a.Date.HasValue) .Select(a => a.Date.Value.Subtract(a.OtherDate).Days) .Average(); The Where() operator ensures that any elements with a.Date having a null value will be excluded from the average; this is the behavior you've indicated that you wanted, correct?
