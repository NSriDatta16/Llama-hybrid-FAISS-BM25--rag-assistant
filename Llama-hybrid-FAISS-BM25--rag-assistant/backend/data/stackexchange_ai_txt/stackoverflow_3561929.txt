There are two possibilities: you've got a memory leak, or your webapp is just generating lots of garbage. The brute-force way to tell if you've got a memory leak is to run it for a long time and see if it falls over with an OOME. Or turn on GC logging, and see if the average space left after garbage collection continually trends upwards over time. Whether or not you have a memory leak, you can probably improve performance (reduce the percentage GC time) by increasing the max heap size. The fact that your webapp is seeing lots of full GCs suggests to me that it needs more heap. (This is just a bandaid solution if you have a memory leak.) If it turns out that you are not suffering from a memory leak, then you should take a look at why your application is generating so much garbage. It could be down to the way that you are doing the XML and JSON serialization.
