Exactly 50, or on average 50? You might want to look into the Exponential distribution and find a library for your language that supports it. The Exponential distribution will give you the intervals between events that occur randomly at a specified average rate. You can "fake" it with a uniform RNG as follows: double u; do { // Get a uniformally-distributed random double between // zero (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) u = rng.nextDouble(); } while (u == 0d); // Reject zero, u must be +ve for this to work. return (-Math.log(u)) / rate;
