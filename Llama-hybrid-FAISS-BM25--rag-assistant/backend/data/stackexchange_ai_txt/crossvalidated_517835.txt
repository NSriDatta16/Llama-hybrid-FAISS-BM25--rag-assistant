Do XBGoost and LightGBM only use trees as base learners?

From my understanding of GBM is that it can take not only decision trees as base learners, but different weak learners as well (e.g., linear models), since it relies on sequential gradient descent. But what about XGBoost and LightGBM? All explanations of their methodology speak about trees form what I seen. Can't they use other weak learners as well? For context information, I need to intuitively describe their methodology in my work without getting deep into formulas and maths.
