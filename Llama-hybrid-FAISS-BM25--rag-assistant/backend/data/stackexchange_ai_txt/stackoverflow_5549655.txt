Work items! Especially the the Bug and Risk ones. Demo that you can have a task with an associated risk and that you can report on the progress / status of work items. Bug tracking is also a good thing to demo The project portal is also a good thing to demo, it shows outstanding work and burndown chats. You can also manage work items from your web browser so non devs can manage the work. If your company use MS project (or Excel, or both) you could demo the MS Project integration for managing work items. You could also try demoing some of the reporting, Build reports show nice graphs that get the non techies excited. (code quality, unit test coverage) Notice I haven't talked about Source Control. you probably want to show it, but from a non techie point of view, it's something they aren't going to get. Don't go in to too much detail. Just use it to show associating a work item with a checkin and then lead in to the Automated builds, which then lead in to the build reports.
