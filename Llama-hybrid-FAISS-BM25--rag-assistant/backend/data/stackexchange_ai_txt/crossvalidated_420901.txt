One variable "ruining" an otherwise interesting model

I'm running a logistic regression model with several variables. I'm picking variables with a p less or equal to 0.2 to include in the multivariate model, and a lot of variables have really low p values but there is one categorical variable in which a few of the levels have moderate correlations (p values around 0.1-0.2) so nothing exciting but when I include it in my model, which I have to because I specify the correlation as minimum 0.2, the entire thing breaks apart and nothing is interesting anymore. The p values all becomes mediocre and not significant for the other variables, which were very exciting both on their own and in a multivariate model without that one ruining variable. Why is this happening?
