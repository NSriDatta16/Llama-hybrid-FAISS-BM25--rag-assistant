Ruby PCAP Reading a complete capture file

I am using Ruby to process some PCAP files. I need to read a complete file and analyze each pcaket. require 'pcap' inFile = Pcap::Capture.open_offline("1.pcap") inFile.loop(-1) do |pkt| #Process packet. end Above code does not exit after reading all the packets. According to the Ruby pcap documentation 'A negative count processes packets forever or until EOF is reached'. What can be the problem here.
