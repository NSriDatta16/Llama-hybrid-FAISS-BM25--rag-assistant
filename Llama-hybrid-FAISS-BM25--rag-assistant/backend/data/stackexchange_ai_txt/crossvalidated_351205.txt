What exactly is the exponential smoothing model?

I see the term "exponential smoothing" model used a lot in different applications but I never understood what exactly it is. Is it just a MA(1) model? Or is it any moving average model, meaning it can be any MA model? For example, the Airline Model has a specific order, which is ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1). Does the exponential smoothing model have a specific order or characteristics that make it an exponential smoothing model? What makes an ARMA model an exponential smoothing model?
