You are right that the data are best combined into a single covariate, namely hours. There is no reason to believe that studying for 2 hours in January is any different than studying for 2 hours in February, provided the hours studied are for the same test. I'm assuming here that this is the only test the students are taking (e.g. no tests in other courses) which is obviously false, but without that data it is something we have to live with. Linear regression is not a good idea. Your model will tell you that studying sufficiently long will guarantee you a perfect score or higher, which is ridiculous. One method may be to transform the scores to be between 0 and 1 and then do a logistic or beta regression. That way, your predicted mean would be constrained to be within the unit interval and you will avoid problems like the one I have mentioned earlier. I would caution you from relying too heavily on the inferences made from whatever model you construct. There is a great deal of between subject variability in this data, so just because your model predicts that studying 4 hours will result in an A on average does not mean that you, or anyone else, are guaranteed an A because you sit starting at your books mindlessly for 4 hours.
