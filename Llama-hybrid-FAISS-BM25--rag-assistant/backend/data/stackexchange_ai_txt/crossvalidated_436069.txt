Lets assume you went ahead with training the 20 individual neural networks. The next problem you would face is how to combine the 20 outputs so that you can get a class probability output showing class with highest probability, next highest, and so on. If you do this after training the models, and you have a tie between 2 or more models, then you would need to find a way to give precedence to one over the other. All of this is easily avoided if you create a single network with 20 outputs, typically with a softmax activation function. This ensures that class conflicts are penalised during training and automatically taken care of. As for your concerns on the training accuracy, you could address these by experimenting with adding more layers or more neurons in the last but one layer, or increase regularisation.
