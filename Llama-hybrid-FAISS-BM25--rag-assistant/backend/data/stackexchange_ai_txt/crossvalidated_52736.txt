Removing data above the mean

I am working with a data set, for which to remove noisy data I take the average of the sample itself and cut anything above that average. What I'm trying to understand here is does this have a name like I don't think this is mean filtering - but it would be helpful to know what type of filtering process this is since I need to explain it in a paper as for why I did it. Or is this just outlier removal?
