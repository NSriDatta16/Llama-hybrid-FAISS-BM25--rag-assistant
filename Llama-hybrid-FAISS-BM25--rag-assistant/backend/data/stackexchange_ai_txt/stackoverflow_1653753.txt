How to code a compiler in C?

I am coding a compiler in C, and I have read all about compilers in the Dragon book . But I am finding it really hard to implement, and I have no clue as to where to start. Even when it comes to lexer part, so would love to know a step by step method on the basis of code writing to write a compiler in C!! What would you suggest I do next?
