How to statistically test if data belongs to one of two classes using logistic regression

I am working with a classification task in the field of biology. For this task, I am trying to assess whether or not newly observed data points fit into one of two classes using a logistic regression model trained on data with well-defined labels (i.e. the new data is not used to train the model at all, it is just used to derive a mapping onto one of two classes via the logistic model). I'd like to assess whether the new datapoints fit into these classes well or not (e.g. the mean logistic predictions of new datapoints is far enough from 0.5). (A) How would one do this in a statistically rigorous manner? I have several unlabelled datasets per subject that I'd like to run and produce these statistics for. (B) I am also curious as to how I would summarize such statistics across subjects (each subject has the same set of unlabelled datasets). Any pointers regarding A and B?
