Since MVC gives you full control over your HTML, it therefore follows that you can build any web site using MVC. Web sites, after all, are just HTML. Third-party controls are a slightly different story, though. Telerik supports MVC to some degree, and says they're working on fuller support, so you can probably make their controls work, although perhaps not quite so easily as in Web Forms. Many other third-party ASP.NET controls are so completely dependent upon view state and postbacks that they won't work at all. My own experience is that it's often more convenient to use non-ASP.NET controls, such as jQuery UI . On the other hand, even when a control is designed for ASP.NET non-MVC, it can sometimes be made to work in MVC . The question is, is it worth the effort? Usually, only if there is not a better, free, alternative, which there often is. I wouldn't worry too much about the lack of RAD-style tooling. When working in the MVC style, you will be far more concerned with the specific HTML you are admitting than the ability to drag a grid onto a page. It's a different way of working. To the extent that your question means, "Is ASP.NET MVC the best way to create any web site?" The answer is no. There is no single best way to create any web site. On the other hand, there are sites which you cannot create using non-MVC ASP.NET (just about anything where fine-grained control over the emitted HTML is a strict requirement), and MVC does not have that limitation.
