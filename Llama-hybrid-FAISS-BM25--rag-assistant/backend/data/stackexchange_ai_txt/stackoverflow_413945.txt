You should probably start with some simpler iphone apps/tutorials, just to get your footing on obj-c and xcode etc. For that, I recommend the pragmatic programmer's iphone book, which has enough information to get started (I started with no knowledge of xcode, obj-c, iphone or mac and got to a working app fairly fast, using mainly this). However I should add that I come from a fairly good background in C/C++ and Java. For your particular project, perhaps take a look at this answer which refers to an open source 3D app that you can look at and get tips from.
