The one thing that strikes me as odd is that you are setting the content type to application/zip, but you don't seem to be creating a ZIP encoded output stream. Is this an oversight ... or does PHP perform the encoding for you without you asking? EDIT According to RFC 2046, the recommended content type for a binary data format whose content type is not standardized is "application/octet-stream" . There is also a practice of defining custom content subtypes with a name starting with "x-" (for experimental), but RFC 2046 says that this practice is now strongly discouraged.
