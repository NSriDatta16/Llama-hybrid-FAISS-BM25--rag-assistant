Even the model code you gave does not do what you seem to say it does. It assumes $$\log \text{E} N_r = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t_r + \beta_2 \log t_r$$ and estimates $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, which I believe is not what you had in mind. You may need to use some software that lets you specify non-linear transformations of parameters or lets you specify a completely user defined likelihood. For the latter there are a lot of options: e.g. PROC NLMIXED in SAS, the rstan R package with it's maximum likelihood capabilities (or perhaps if your parameters are not that well identified you could go Bayesian) and probably a lot of other packages.
