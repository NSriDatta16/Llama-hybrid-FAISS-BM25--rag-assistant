My Rails Application doesn't update the localized strings in production mode

I have a standard Rails application running with the I18n support. I have extensive caching running for this app. I edited a few strings and confirmed it worked locally. I also confirmed I have the right strings on the file for the live site. Still for some weird reason I do not see these changes for my live site even though I have not fragment cached anything here. Any ideas what is going on?
