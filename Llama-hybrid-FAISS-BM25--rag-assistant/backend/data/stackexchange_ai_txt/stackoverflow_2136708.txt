I would use a timer to fire a method which checks them every .2-.5 seconds: [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:.2 target:self selector:@selector(checkPointInRects) userInfo:nil repeats:YES]; Use touchesBegan,moved,ended to cache the current touches and refer to them in the checkPointInRects method. You can use CGRectContainsPoint to determine if the point lies in any given rectangle.
