For interactive applications, you wont typically notice any performance difference between Mono and .NET on equivalent hardware. There are a few things that you will notice: Mono's current GC is conservative, not generational. Mono's codegen engine is not as advanced as .NET's. On computationally intensive tasks (for example, doing image processing or video processing), expect Mono to be 70% of the speed of .NET. Mono on OSX has a few known slow code paths for thread local storage and a handful of other small problems. All of these are focus areas for the team, so you will see changes in both cases soon enough. We are working on a new GC that is generational, like .NET, a preview will debut in 2.8. The codegen engine can now optionally use LLVM, in 2.6 it is ok, in 2.8 it will have 99.8% code coverage (from the current 60 or 70). Sadly LLVM makes for very slow JIT compile times, so we only use it for "ngen" like scenarios or for programs that want better performance at the cost of startup speed. With LLVM we are able to match .NET and Java on most tests, with a handful of exceptions. Finally, OSX-specific limitations are being worked on, and will also be in 2.8.
