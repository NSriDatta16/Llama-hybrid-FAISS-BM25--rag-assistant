I would suggest writing a very simple XSLT transform to strip out the empty content from those specific elements which are causing the problem (e.g. only the HashLine elements). Then put a processing step before you pass the data through JAXB, by using TransformerFactory, Transformer, and so on, which "cleans" the data using the XSLT transform. You could add sorts of cleaning logic in the XSLT for cases where you find other non-JAXB friendly structures in the source XML.
