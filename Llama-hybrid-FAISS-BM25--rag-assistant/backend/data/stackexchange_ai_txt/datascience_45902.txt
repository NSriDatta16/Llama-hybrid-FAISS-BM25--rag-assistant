Analysis of Time Series data

The below graph is a scatterplot of daily stock price. My aim is to predict future stock price of the company. From the scatterplot it seems that it is a multiplicative model, so I tried to "decompose" it in R. However it says that "time series has no or less than 2 periods". I also obtained a periodogram, which has only one peak at frequency close to 0. However, my teacher told me that this time series cannot have a trend therefore to eliminate the seasonality I have to consider its period as 7 and then eliminate it choosing an appropriate model. Can anyone tell me what could be an appropriate model along with a proper justification? Also is it true that the series cannot have a trend?
