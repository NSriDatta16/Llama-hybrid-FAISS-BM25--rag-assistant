mysql: proper way to handle relation between users and teams?

Newish to mysql DBs here. I have a table of USERS and a table of TEAMS. A user can be on more then one team. What's the best way to store the relationship between a user and what teams he's on? Lets say there are hundreds of teams, each team consists of about 20 users, and on average a user could be on about 10 teams, also note that users can change teams from time to time. I can think of possibly adding a column to my TEAMS table which holds a list of user ids, but then i'd have to add a column to my USERS table which holds a list of team ids. Although this might be a solution it seems messy for updating membership. It seems like there might be a smarter way to handle this information... Like another table perhaps? Thoughts? Thanks! ps, whats the best field type for storing a list, and whats the best way to delimit?
