How do you handle checks to see if a user changed something in a dialog

Talking .NET WinForms here: If you have an application where someone can change items using some properties dialog for example, how do you determine if a user has changed something when he clicks on cancel (to decide whether to display a cancel confirmation message box, or not). I can think of 2 methods: Defining a dirty bit and handling all "changed" events to set this bit to true. Clone the original object and write some comparison code to determine if the modified object really was modified compared with the original Is there any more elegant and/or more generic way to do that?
