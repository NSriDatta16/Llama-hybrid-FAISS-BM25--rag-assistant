Depends on what you're trying to model. In general you're losing information by binning a continuous predictor, but there are situations where it makes sense, e.g. as a proxy for 'minor' vs 'of legal age' or "of working age" vs "retired". It can sometimes also be a useful way to informally check the predictor's relation to the response in logistic regression. And if you have plenty of degrees of freedom to spare, & are lazy, it saves you checking the nature of the relation to the response.
