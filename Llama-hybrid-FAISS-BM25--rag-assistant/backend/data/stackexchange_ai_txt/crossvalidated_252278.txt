By Bayes theorem $$ \text{posterior} \propto \text{prior} \times \text{likelihood} $$ so posterior combines information that comes from your data (through likelihood ) and information that comes from your prior . So there is no posterior without prior . In case of the quote you provided, it provides a closed-form posterior distribution, because it uses the fact that Wishart distribution is a conjugate prior for precision parameter of multivariate normal distribution, so we have a "standalone" closed-form for it. This means that for such model you do not have to sample from the prior distribution to conduct a MCMC simulation, since the posterior is known. This does not mean that we do not use prior in here, we have already used it . On another hand, if you do not want to use prior , then you should rather use maximum likelihood estimation rather then Bayesian estimation.
