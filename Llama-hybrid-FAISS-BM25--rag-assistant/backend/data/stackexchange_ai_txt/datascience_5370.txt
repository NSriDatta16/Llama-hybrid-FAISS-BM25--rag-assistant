Or must I lose most of the efficiency gained by programming in C by calling on R scripts or other languages? Do the opposite: learn C/C++ to write R extensions. Use C/C++ only for the performance-critical sections of your new algorithms, use R to build your analysis, import data, make plots, etc. If you want to go beyond R, I'd recommend learning Python. There are many libraries available such as scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms or PyBrain for building Neural Networks etc. (and use pylab/ matplotlib for plotting and iPython notebooks to develop your analyses). Again, C/C++ is useful to implement time critical algorithms as Python extensions.
