Couple ways I have seen so far: Wiki is suitable for internal knowledge, for example environment, project specific topics. Open doors policy Encourage asking questions. Voluntary presentations. Find out who have special knowledge and make it easy and attractive to set up a short presentation about it. Project post mortem documents. A wrap up meeting moderated by someone outside project team held after project is finished or terminated. Compulsory presentations. Project presentation when they go live. Technologies used etc. In case someone is sent to conference, he should have a presentation about new technology he saw.
