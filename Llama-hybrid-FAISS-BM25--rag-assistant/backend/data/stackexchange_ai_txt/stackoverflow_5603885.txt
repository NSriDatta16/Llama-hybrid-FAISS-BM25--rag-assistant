It depends on what type of mobile app you're talking about. You can create either: A phone friendly version of your web app A native app on the platform of your choice (iphone, bberry, etc) If you go with #1 all you need to do is create phone friendly versions of your views. But your users will need to use the web browser on their phone to view your site. An example of this is www.engadget.com versus m.engadget.com . The latter is just the engadget website optimized for viewing on your phone. If you go with #2, at the very least you'll need to create a native client app on the platform you select. However, if you design things right you can leverage much of the functionality that's already in your website. Take twitter as an example. You can use the twitter website to use features of twitter or you can use a native iphone app like twitterific. The iphone app (probably) uses some twitter API to access functionality that's the same as when you use their website.
