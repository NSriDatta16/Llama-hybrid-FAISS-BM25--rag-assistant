I don't know any more than you about SPARC's future. I hope it has one; it's been tragic how many good architectures have died out while x86 has kept going. But i would suggest you look at ARM as a target. It isn't present in big server hardware, but it's huge in the mobile market, and powers all sorts of interesting little boxes, like my NAS, my ADSL router, and so on.
