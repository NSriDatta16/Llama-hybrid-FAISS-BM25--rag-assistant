Magento: How do I retrieve values from fields submitted with the payment method?

Ok. This is getting a little frustrating. I am trying to create a custom payment module for Magento. The purpose is to use Authorize.net's CIM so that we don't have to worry so much about PCI compliance. The issue I am having is that the users need to be able to access their previous credit cards and use those for purchasing. I have the previous cards being stored in the database. They are also being displayed in the form in the checkout process. My issue comes when I click continue after selecting the payment method. How do I get the values I submitted in the form? Specifically, the value of the radio button the saved code is attached to? I am not sure what if any code is needed for me to post, so let me know if you need anything in particular. Thanks.
