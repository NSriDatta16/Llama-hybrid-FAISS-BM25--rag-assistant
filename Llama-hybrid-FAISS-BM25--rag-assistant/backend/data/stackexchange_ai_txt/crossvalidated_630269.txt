Let $S = X + U, T = X + V$ for ind.normal r.v $X, U,V$. Is it possible to find $a, b$ real numbers such that $\mathbb{E}[X|S,T] = \mathbb{E}[X|aS+bT]$

Suppose we have random variables $$X \sim N(0, \sigma_X^2) \\ U \sim N(0, \sigma_U^2) \\ V \sim N(0, \sigma_V^2), $$ where $X$ , $U$ and $V$ are independent. And $$ S = X + U \\ T = X + V. $$ Is it possible to define a linear combination of $S$ and $T$ such that conditioning on $$R := aS + bT, \ \ \ a, b \in \mathbb{R}$$ is equivalent to conditioning on both $S$ and $T$ , i.e., $$ \mathbb{E}[X\mid S,T] = \mathbb{E}[X\mid R]. $$ I think knowing $S$ and $T$ is more than just knowing their sum or average.
