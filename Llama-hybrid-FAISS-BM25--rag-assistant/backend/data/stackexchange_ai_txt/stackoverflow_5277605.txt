Before I load the gun for you, it's generally discouraged to alter the function of the hardware keys. Users expect certain behaviors, and they shouldn't be messed with. That said, you can do it bay catching the onKeyDown event and testing to see if the Back key is the one that was pressed: public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) { if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK) { //do your thing return true; } return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event); }
