In my opinion, @Alex's questions are right (+1), the FK test originated for the cross-sectional data, not time series objects. Even in subsamples the data points will be dependent, thus the tests are probably not applicable. Since heteroscedasticity is a part of some model (you noted these are the residuals, probably from some linear model) you may consider many different alternatives from the lmtest package. One of the most common options is the Goldfeld-Quandt test gqtest() , however its ad hoc nature (how you choose to split the samples) makes it less attractive than Breusch-Pagan test bptest() the test performs additional regression of squared residuals on the explanatory variables, and in the presence of significant dependence rejects the homoscedastic null Another common alternative to the first two tests is a family of White test that are in general presented as LM type of tests comparing original and auxiliary regression models If some more complicated structures for the variance of residuals is considered, you may also look for very rich family of conditionally heteroscedastic models.
