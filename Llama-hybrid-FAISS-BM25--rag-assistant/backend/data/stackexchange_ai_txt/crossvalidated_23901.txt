Typically APCA gets used when there are lots of series but very few samples. I wouldn't describe APCA as better or worse than PCA, because of the equivalence you noted. They do, however, differ in when the tools are applicable. That is the insight of the paper: you can flip the dimension if it's more convenient! So in the application you mentioned, there are a lot of assets so you would need a long time series to compute a covariance matrix, but now you can use APCA. That said, I don't think APCA gets applied very often because you could try to reduce the dimensionality using other techniques (like factor analysis).
