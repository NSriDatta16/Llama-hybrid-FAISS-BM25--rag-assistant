To obtain useful results you can't use nonstationary data with OLS and time series. There are other more advanced methods where nonstationarity is a non issue. With OLS you have to difference real GDP and indices, and also apply log transform in many cases. when using non stationary variables in OLS you run into the potentially fatal issue of "spurious regression". example: 1983-2008 annual data to test if both Gini coefficients and gross national saving in China and the US can affect the US current account balance. The data seem to be non-stationary,may be chosen control variables are real GDP, interest rate, dollar index and maybe some other national income components.
