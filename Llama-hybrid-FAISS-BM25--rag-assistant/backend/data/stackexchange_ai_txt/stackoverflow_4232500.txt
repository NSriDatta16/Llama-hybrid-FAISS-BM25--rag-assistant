You've confused outlets and actions, I think. An outlet - as you've defined - gives one class an outward connection to another. An action is something a control can trigger. You should add buttonPressed to your .h as: - (IBAction)buttonPressed:(id)sender; To have Interface Builder recognise it as an action. You can then control-drag a link from a button to your class (which seems to be file owner) and connect the two up. Which, I guess, you'll want to do three times. This is the same as dragging a link from 'touch up inside' to your class, that being when buttons take effect on iOS.
