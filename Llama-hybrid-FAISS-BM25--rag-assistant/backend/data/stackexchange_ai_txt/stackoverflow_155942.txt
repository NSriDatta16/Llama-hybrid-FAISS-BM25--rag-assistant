I would leave your test cases in. In my experience, commenting out code with something like // TODO: fix test case is akin to doing: // HAHA: you'll never revisit me In all seriousness, as you get closer to shipping, the desire to revisit TODO's in code tends to fade, especially with things like unit tests because you are concentrating on fixing other parts of the code. Leave the tests in perhaps with your "tri-state" solution. Howeveer, I would strongly encourage fixing those cases ASAP. My problem with constant reminders is that after people see them, they tend to gloss over them and say "oh yeah, we get those errors all the time..." Case in point -- in some of our code, we have introduced the idea of "skippable asserts" -- asserts which are there to let you know there is a problem, but allow our testers to move past them on into the rest of the code. We've come to find out that QA started saying things like "oh yeah, we get that assert all the time and we were told it was skippable" and bugs didn't get reported. I guess what I'm suggesting is that there is another alternative, which is to fix the bugs that your test cases find immediately. There may be practical reasons not to do so, but getting in that habit now could be more beneficial in the long run.
