svn track brand new code base

I'm at a company, we keep recieviing new codebases from a third party vendor. we'd like to track the changes in subversion. is there a way to replace a branch with the new code and track the changes? currently we just delete all files in the branch, and then add the new files and commit. we'd like to track the files, but I havn't found a tool that will easily deal with all the .svn directories found in subfolders. does anyone know a tool that will replace an svn directory with a new branch and create the respective modify add and delete records as if the code base was organically modified?
