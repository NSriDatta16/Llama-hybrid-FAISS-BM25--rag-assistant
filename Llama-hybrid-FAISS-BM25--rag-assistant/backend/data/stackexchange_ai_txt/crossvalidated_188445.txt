LDA makes severe distributional assumptions (multivariate normality of all predictors) unlike logistic regression. Try getting posterior probabilities of class membership on the basis of subjects' sex and you'll see what I mean - the probabilities will not be accurate. The instability of logistic regression when a set of predictor values gives rise to a probability of 0 or 1 that $Y=1$ is more or less an illusion. Newton-Raphson iterations will converge to $\beta$s that are close enough to $\pm \infty$ (e.g., $\pm 30$) so that predicted probabilities are essentially 0 or 1 when they should be. The only problem this causes is the Hauck-Donner effect in the Wald statistics. The solution is simple: don't use Wald tests in this case; use likelihood ratio tests, which behave very well even with infinite estimates. For confidence intervals use profile likelihood confidence intervals if there is complete separation. See this for more information. Note that if multivariable normality holds, by Bayes' theorem the assumptions of logistic regression hold. The reverse is not true. Normality (or at the very least symmetry) must almost hold for variances and covariances to "do the job". Non-multivariate normally distributed predictors will even hurt the discriminant extraction phase.
