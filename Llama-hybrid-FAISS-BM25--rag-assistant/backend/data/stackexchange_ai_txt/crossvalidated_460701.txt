What does "The mean of the sum of N independent variables with the same distribution is N times the mean of a single variable" mean?

I have been reading a book about statistics for physicists and there was this line given: "The mean of the sum of N independent variables with the same distribution is N times the mean of a single variable". Also, the following equation was given: $$\mu_X\equiv\langle X\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^N\langle x_i\rangle=N\langle x_i\rangle = N\mu$$ So my question is, what does that actually mean? I mean, if $x_i$ can be any number, e.g. $2, 3, 5$ and $6$ , than the $N$ would be $4$ . The average would be $\frac{16}{4} = 4$ . So is that average $4$ actually $\langle x_i\rangle$ or $\langle X\rangle$ ? Also if $\mu$ is the avarage, than $N\mu$ would be $4 \cdot 4 = 16$ . So $\mu_X$ would be $16$ . But what does that mean?
