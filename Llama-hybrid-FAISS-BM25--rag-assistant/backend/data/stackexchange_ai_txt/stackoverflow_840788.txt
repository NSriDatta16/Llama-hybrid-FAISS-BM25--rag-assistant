It sounds like you need to expose a new request URL on your server, whose only job is to reply whether the web-service-retrieval has completed (or if not, how far it has got). Have AJAX poll that service every few seconds, and remove the "Loading..." message when it replied that the file is ready. The client should send the session ID (maybe also a file ID), so that the server knows which file is being asked about. The server side will need to be able to contact the running web-service-retrieval process/thread to ask it how far it got. (If it can't find the thread then presumably it has finished.)
