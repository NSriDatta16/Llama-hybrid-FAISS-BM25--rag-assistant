In order for RightScale to properly manage instances in ec2 they use a ruby based daemon called RightLink as a communication device between their core platform and each instance that is launched. The init scripts that you saw are required for the instance to self configure itself to the point where it can be managed by RightScale properly. /etc/init.d/rightimage is the first script that is run. Essentially it just determines the OS, arch version, and installs the correct RightLink package from the S3 bucket. Afterwards it kicks off the /opt/rightscale/bin/post_install.sh script which uses the OS init control tools to register the startup scripts to be invoked on future boots of the OS; this ensures that RightLink will always be started. /etc/init.d/rightscale is the next script that is run. It initializes RightScale-specific (but not RightLink-specific) system state. It is responsible for caching launch settings (aka userdata) and metadata in /var/spool and installing any available patches to the RightLink agent. /etc/init.d/rightlink is the final script that is run. It configures and enrolls the RightLink agent idempotently. If configuration and enrollment succeed, rightlink starts the sandboxed monit which starts the persistent agent process. If you're not launching the AMI using the RightScale platform this will never properly enroll because they aren't expecting it to, as such RightScale will have no communication with the instance at all. Removing all three of these from the image shouldn't in any way harm the overall stability of the image, but from a security standpoint they shouldn't cause any problems if they are present. If you have any further specific questions about it I'd suggest hopping on their forums at https://forums.rightscale.com/ You could also try #rightscale on freenode.
