HSL Image Adjustements on GPU

I have an application where the user should be able to modify an image with sliders for hue, saturation and lightness. All image processing is done on the GPU using GLSL fragment shaders. My problem is that RGB -> HSL -> RGB conversions are rather expensive on the gpu due to the extensive branching. My question is whether I can convert the users "color adjustments" to some other color space which can more efficiently compute the adjusted image on the GPU.
