“Propose a referendum”. Just to vote! ;-) I liked the CAIC (Bozdogan, 1987) and BIC purely from my personal practice, because these criteria gives a serious penalty for complexity, we got more parsimony, but I always displayed the list of good models - to delta 4-6-8 (instead of 2). In step of investigating parameters (because we have a “good stretching of candidate models”), the MM averaging (B&A) often almost nothing changes. I slightly skeptical both to the classical AIC and AICc (H&T, popularized by B&A), since they often give a very "thick layer of the cream". ;-)
