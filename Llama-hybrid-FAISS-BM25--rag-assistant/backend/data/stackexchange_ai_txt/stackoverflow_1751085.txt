You can use it in your master page javascript how ever the control name is not what you expect it to be you'd need to use ClientID to get that. If you do not apply runat=server you can only get a hold of the control as text by either traversing the .aspx file or as some one mentioned embedding it in a named tag and then doing string manipulation on the inner HTML. That is for setting it. If you need to get the value use Request[tagName] or similar
