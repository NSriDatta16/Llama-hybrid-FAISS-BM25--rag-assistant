A neural network is in principle a good choice when you have A LOT of similar data and classification tasks. Predicting the next character (or word... which is just multiple characters) is such a szenario. I don't think it really matters which kind of language you have, as long as you have enough training data of the same kind. See The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks for a nice article where a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used as a character predictor to write complete texts. They also have code on github.com/karpathy/char-rnn ready to train / go. You can feed it with a start string and ask for the next characters / words.
