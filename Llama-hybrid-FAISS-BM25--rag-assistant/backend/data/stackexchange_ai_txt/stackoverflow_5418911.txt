It's not about what the process does, it's about how it does it. It will load up products one by one and do processing. Try to run php indexer.php --reindex catalog_url in your magento/shell directory. With a max_execution time set to zero and enough memory, it will eventually finish. As long as the lock file is there, no other reindex process can start. The question about tables is a little more complex, try to turn mysql general log and watch for updates. The time spent in MySQL is not a big concern, instantiating product objects is both slow and leaky. Make sure you have this patch .
