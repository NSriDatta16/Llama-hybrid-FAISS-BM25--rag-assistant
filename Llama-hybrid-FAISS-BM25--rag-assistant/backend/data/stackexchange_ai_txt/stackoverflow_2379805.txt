Actually your proposed directory structure is more than appropriate for large and complex applications. Magento which is world's best Open Source e-commerce solution today has been coded in Zend framework and uses similar directory layout as you propose, this way its very easy to extend and add new modules and manage old ones. Again for simple apps and for learning Zend I would suggest everyone to stick to the default directory structure.
