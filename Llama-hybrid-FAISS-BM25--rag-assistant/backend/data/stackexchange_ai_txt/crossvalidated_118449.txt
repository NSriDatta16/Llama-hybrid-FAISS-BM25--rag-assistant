HMM: class residience time from time series

I'm a newbie of the statistica subject. I've seen that HMM could be used in order to model state and state transitions for time series and, since I only know that in Markov Models I could state the residence time of each given state, I was wondering if that is also possible inside a HMM model. I am also saying that because the only paper where I've met a formal definition of such HMMs was this one . Thanks in Advance!
