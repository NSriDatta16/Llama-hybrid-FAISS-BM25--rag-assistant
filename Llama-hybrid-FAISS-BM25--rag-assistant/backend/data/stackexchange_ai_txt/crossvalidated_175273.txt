Categorical Variables With Little Variation. Chi-Square Test Power

Suppose you are trying to determine whether there is an association between gender and a rare disease, I suppose using the Chi-Square test. My intuition tells me that you must observe so many men, women and at least some people have to have the disease. After all, if you don't observe anyone with the disease how can you claim there is an association between the disease and gender? But, how many? Can you express the power function of a Chi Square test in terms of these proportions? Can anyone provide a reference to the power function of a Chi Square test? Perhaps other tests such as Fisher's or the logistic regression model, may be better for this kind of situation where one variable is very rare. But, I would think that you should be able to express the power function in terms of these proportions, correct?
