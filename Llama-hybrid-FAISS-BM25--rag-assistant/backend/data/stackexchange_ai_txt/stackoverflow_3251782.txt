Decode G711(PCM u-law)

Please bear with me as my understanding of audio codec is limited. I have this audio source from a IPCAM (through a htto//... CGI interface). I am trying to write several client programs to play this audio source on Windows, MAC, as well as Android phone. The audio is encoded in G711 (PCM ulaw). Do I need to decode the PCM audio data to a raw audio data before I could pass it to the audio engine to play? If so, is there some sample code on how to decode it? I am confused as somehow I believe PCM is already RAW. Could I just feed it directly to the audio engine on Android for example? thanks much in advance
