Analyse categorial data where best outcome is middle level

I have a dataset where the outcome variable is the result of a blood test that ranges from 10 to 40. A person is healthy if the result is between 20 and 30. Under 20 and over 30 are equally bad results, one is not worse than the other. I want to run a regression (if is the best choice) to check the variables that affect these results. On my sample, 5% of people are under 20, 50% are between 20 and 30 and 45% are over 30. These results are aligned with expectation of the whole population. I've seen several studies excluding people that are under 20 (it's rarely more than 5%) and running multiple linear regression to check how the covariates affect the outcome. I suppose it is not correct to exclude part of the sample, even though it is "small" (5%). What are the implications of doing in this case? If I run linear regression to the entire sample, how can I interpret a covariate with positive and significant coefficient? E.g. physical activity hours per week =1.2. An extra hour of physical activity increase the value of the outcome. So this is good if you are under 20, but bad if you are close to 30. Does it make sense? The same applies to a logistic regression If not linear regression, which model should I use in this case?
