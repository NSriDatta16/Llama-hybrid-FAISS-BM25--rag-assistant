Is $R^2$ or RMSE more important for determining the success of a neural network regression?

I have designed a neural network with two different choices of features. Neither feature set stands out as one trains a neural network that scores higher $R^2$ coefficient on test data whereas the other feature set produces a neural network that scores the lower RMSE. Which of $R^2$ and RMSE should be the deciding factor for which feature set is better?
