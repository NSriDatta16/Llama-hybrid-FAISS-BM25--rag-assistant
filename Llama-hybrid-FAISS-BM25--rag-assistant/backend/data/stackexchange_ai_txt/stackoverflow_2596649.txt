ODBC is a C library and permits access to databases in a mode very reminiscent of JDBC. Microsoft has an ODBC driver for SQLServer that is included in Windows or, for non-Windows, you can leverage something like FreeTDS . Also SQLite provides a mechanism for more direct C access to the database, which permits embedding, etc. And, depending on your storage needs, BDB might be worth investigating.
