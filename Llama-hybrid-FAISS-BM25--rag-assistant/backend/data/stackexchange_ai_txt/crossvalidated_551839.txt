Finding a tag / multiple tags across multiple documents

Suppose we have text documents: doc1 = 'Legal research is the process of finding information that is needed to support legal decision-making. In practice, this generally means searching through both statute (as created by the legislature) and case law (as developed by the courts) to find what is relevant for some specific matter at hand.' doc2 = 'Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at finding an information without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.' I wish to define a tag in this case tag = 'finding information' , now I would like to make a model that can go through my documents and find the tag (or ideally tags). At first one might say, on each document I can perform a brute search. However, as you can see from above in doc2 I have: 'finding an information' so the brute search won't work due to having an in the middle. I also wonder how one split the data into train and test, this is because in the training part there is no label (for the tag). This problem looks like named entity recognition but my search shows that NER just returns bunch predefined entities such as person, location and etc. I wonder if there are models out there that can handle cases like mine? Maybe NER is not what I should look into. Any model implementation or source would be appreciated.
