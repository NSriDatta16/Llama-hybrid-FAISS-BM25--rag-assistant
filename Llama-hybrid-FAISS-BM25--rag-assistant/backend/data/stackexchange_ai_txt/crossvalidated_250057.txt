So, my question is, simply: is it possible to directly perform complex (eg multivariable) analyses of relational databases? And if yes, how? I have a problem with this question. First, the role of a database is mainly efficient storage and retrieval for ETL (extract, transform, load), not statistical analysis. To ask what statistical method can be applied on the format of a database (or format of data) ignores the statistical question (see @Glen_b's comments). If you received an Access file, or relational database extract, it's format was probably put in place by a software engineer who cared mostly about the efficiency storage and retrieval, not the analysis types of analysis. Now, depending on your statistical question/hypothesis this data will need to be transformed in one way or another. It should be noted that statistical models weren't constructed to be applied to data formats (e.g. text files, hdfs, relational databases, graph databases); that is not the concern of most statistical models. My fear is however that it might overlook one or more of the relational features of the data, and thus loosing precision or accuracy. Could it be done in a different fashion, directly analyzing the relational database as it stands? This is vague. What is meant by "relational features"? Are you referring to relational tables? Let's assume you have a demographics table with patient id and other stuff. Now, let's assume you have your repeated measures for your patients by patient id . Then if you know enough SQL, these "relation features" can be combined using a simple JOIN (left, right, inner, ). This is how you would combine your relational tables (which I assume is what you mean by "relational features"). Often, this can be challenging especially if you have a database with 100+ tables/views. But even then, you shouldn't need all those tables; if you have a well defined question, you should be able to narrow the problem down to 2-5 tables. Now after merging your data, it may occur that the nature of your data is clustered by, say, patient id . For a scenario like this, a hierarchical model or mixed effects would be appropriate. This approach will then capture more of that context that certain observations occur for specific individuals.

As an analyst, it is your responsibility to account that the format of the data is appropriate for the analysis. For this reason there are tools for transforming your data so that it can capture the necessary context for your statistical analysis. Reference: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf
