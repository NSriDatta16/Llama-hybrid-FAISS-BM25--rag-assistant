Try replacing the containing paragraph with a instead, as paragraphs have padding and margins by default. If this doesn't work, then it may be worth putting background-colors (as strong, violent and hideous as possible - to help you remember to change them back!) and try and work out where the padding or margin is coming from. You might stand more chance then of being able to determine where you need to be removing from.
