How to avoid declaring database fields twice, once in database, once in a repository/model?

I recently began reading Pro ASP.NET MVC Framework . The author talks about creating repositories, and using interfaces to set up quick automated tests, which sounds awesome. But it carries the problem of having to declare yourself all the fields for each table in the database twice: once in the actual database, and once in the C# code, instead of auto-generating the C# data access classes with an ORM. I do understand that this is a great practice, and enables TDD which also looks awesome. But my question is: Isn't there any workaround having to declare fields twice: both in the database and the C# code? Can't I use something that auto-generates the C# code but still allows me to do TDD without having to manually create all the business logic in C# and creating a repository (and a fake one too) for each table?
