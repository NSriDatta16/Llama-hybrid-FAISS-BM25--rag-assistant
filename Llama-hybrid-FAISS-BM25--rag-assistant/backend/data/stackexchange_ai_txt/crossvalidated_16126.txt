Here's an example using monthly data on log unemployment claims from a city in New Jersey (from Stata, only because that's what I analyzed these data in originally). The heights of the lines indicate the correlation between a variable and the sth lag of itself; the gray area gives you a sense of whether this correlation is significant (this range is a guide only and isn't the most reliable way to test the significance). If this correlation is high, there is evidence of serial correlation. Note the humps that occur around periods 12, 24, and 36. Since this is monthly data, this suggests that the correlation gets stronger when you look at periods exactly 1, 2, or 3 years previous. This is evidence of monthly seasonality. You can test these relationships statistically by regressing the variable on dummy variables indicating the seasonality component---here, month dummies. You can test the joint significance of those dummies to test for seasonality. This procedure isn't quite right, as the test requires that the error terms not be serially correlated. So, before testing these seasonality dummies, we need to remove the remaining serial correlation (typically by including lags of the variable). There may be pulses, breaks, and all the other time series problems that you need to correct as well to get the appropriate results from the test. You didn't ask about those, so I won't go into detail (plus, there are a lot of CV questions on those topics). (Just to feed your curiosity, this series requires the month dummies, a single lag of itself, and a shift component to get rid of the serial correlation.)
