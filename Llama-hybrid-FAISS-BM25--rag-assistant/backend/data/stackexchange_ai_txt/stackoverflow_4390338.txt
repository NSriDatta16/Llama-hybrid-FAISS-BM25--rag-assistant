SWT StyledText and Paragraph Spacing

StyledText.setLineSpacing() allows line spacing, where each line (whether wrapped or following a carriage return) is separated from its predecessor. Is there a way to set paragraph spacing, where wrapped lines sit together normally, but a carriage return inserts extra space? (I want the final result to look much like this question, but without pressing enter twice between paragraphs.) I am using both a StyledTextContent and a LineStyleListener. Ideally, I'd like to set paragraph spacing on each paragraph via the LineStyleListener, but I would settle for a document-wide solution...
