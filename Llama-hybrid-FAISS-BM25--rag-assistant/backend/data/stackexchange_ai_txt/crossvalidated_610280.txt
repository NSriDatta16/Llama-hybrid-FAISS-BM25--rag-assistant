$x$ and $c$ in Bayes theorem are random variables . Any random variables. Bayes's theorem is about being able to flip sides of the conditional distribution from $P(x|c)$ to $P(c|x)$ or the other way around. They could be events, e.g. “probability that it rains ( $x$ ) given that it’s cloudy ( $c$ ), $P(x|c)$ ”, in naive Bayes algorithm $x$ is a feature of the model and $c$ is the predicted class, in a classical Bayesian model $x$ would be your data and $c$ the parameter of the model.
