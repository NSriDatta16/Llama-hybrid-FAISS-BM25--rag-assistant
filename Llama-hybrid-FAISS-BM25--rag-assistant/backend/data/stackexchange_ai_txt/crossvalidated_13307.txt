How to turn a function into a probability density whilst maintaining the shape of the function?

I have a series of functions, each one supposedly representing the density of a random variable across agents. Each function also has a domain, which describes what values of the random variable are valid. Now, if I remember my stats classes correctly, if I take the integral of one of the functions across the values described by the function's domain, I should get a value of 1.0. This does not happen however. Is there a normalization technique that can turn a function into a true probability density, yet maintains the shape of the function? All the functions are of the form $\frac{a}{bx}+c$, where $x$ is the random variable, and $a,b,c$ are varying constants.
