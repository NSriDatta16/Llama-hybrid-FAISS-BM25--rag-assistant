What does representer theorem in machine learning tell us?

In reference to the Representer Theorem in machine learning, Why this is so important? Somehow, this theorem justifies the importance of Kernels in machine learning, i.e. the Kernel trick - a more computationally effective way to "shuttle" data between different dimensions. What does representer theorem in machine learning tell us?
