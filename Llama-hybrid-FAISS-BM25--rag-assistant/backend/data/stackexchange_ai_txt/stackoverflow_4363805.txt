There very well may be a way to accomplish this, but my guess would be it's not terribly elegant/straightforward. Instead of having two modal views fight for precedence, I'd suggest instead making a new custom UIView to serve as your input view (as opposed to overwriting UIActionSheet directly) and presenting the UIAlertView from there. It will take a little extra work to make your new input view look like a UIActionSheet , but here are two great articles which may help: How to make view appear like a UIActionSheet : http://www.nearinfinity.com/blogs/andrew_homeyer/display_a_custom_uiview_like_a.html Some nice looking gradient buttons you could use to match UIActionSheet 's: http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/05/gradient-buttons-yet-again.html
