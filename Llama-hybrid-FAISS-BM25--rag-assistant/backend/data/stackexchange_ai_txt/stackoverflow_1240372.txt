press button to open web page from app

I have an app that I want to interact with a web page. Basically I want to press a button and the web page will open in a new view... Sorry I wasn't clear, I am developing on a Mac for an iPhone. Currently I have a "locate me" app that displays your Latitude and Longitude. I want to use those variables to populate 2 of the blanks on a PHP web page/form I have developed. I have added a label and button to my current app, when the button is pressed the URL with the Lat and Long (as passed vars) are displayed in the label. I want those vars to appear on my web page. Hope this is clearer... Solved: I just added these lines of code I found here : NSURL *url = [ [ NSURL alloc ] initWithString: @"http://www.cnn.com" ]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url];
