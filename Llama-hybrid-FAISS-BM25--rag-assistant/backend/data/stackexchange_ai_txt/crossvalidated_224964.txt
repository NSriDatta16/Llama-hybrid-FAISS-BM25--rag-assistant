Specifying a good goal in Multi-agent RL

I am reading a survey paper on Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) by Busoniu, Babuska, De Schutter (IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics March 2008). Under 'Challenges in MARL', one of the things they put forward as a challenge/difficulty is how to 'specify a goal'. I am not sure what 'goal' in this case means. "Specifying a good MARL goal in the general stochastic game is a difficult challenge, as the agents' returns are correlated and cannot be maximized independently. Several types of MARL goals have been proposed in the literature, which consider stability of the agents' learning dynamics, adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents, or both." What then is a 'goal'?
