Embedding JW player

I used tutorial from here: http://developer.longtailvideo.com/contributors/nyboe/index.html To embed player to my page. I downloaded all that I needed. But it seems that embedding wasn't working. I tried another approach and it worked. But still I want to use list items and javascript on my page to seek through video. I don't get it, same code, same browser and theirs works fine, but mine don't. Also I'm curious why they can embed this player on few different ways, but I can manage only one to work since it's all the same. When I try this example I get error in javascript console: uncaught ReferenceError: swfobject is not defined I tried this way: var swfobject = new SWFObject(); swfobject.embedSWF("jwplayer/player.swf", "placeholder1", "300", "196", "9.0.115", false, flashvars, params, attributes); But that I got: Uncaught TypeError: Object # has no method 'embedSWF'
