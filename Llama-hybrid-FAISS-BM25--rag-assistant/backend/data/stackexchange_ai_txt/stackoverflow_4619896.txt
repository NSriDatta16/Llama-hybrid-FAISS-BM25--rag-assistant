Does your log have lines of similar length? If yes, then you can calculate average length of the line, then do the following: seek to end_of_file - lines_needed*avg_line_length (previous_point) read everything up to the end if you grabbed enough lines, that's fine. If no, seek to previous_point - lines_needed*avg_line_length read everything up to previous_point goto 3 memory-mapped file is also a good method -- map the tail of file, calculate lines, map the previous block, calculate lines etc. until you get the number of lines needed
