How to get the name of browser?

I have tried $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], but we didn't get the exact name. Then i have tried the following code $browser = get_browser(null, true); print_r($browser); Firstly it shows warning.then i have enable it in the .ini file. After that it dosen't display anything. Is there any other solution to know the name
