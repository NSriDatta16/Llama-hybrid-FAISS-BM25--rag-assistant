4store: Scalable RDF storage Quoting 4store Web ... 4store's main strengths are its performance, scalability and stability. It does not provide many features over and above RDF storage and SPARQL queries, but if your are looking for a scalable, secure, fast and efficient RDF store, then 4store should be on your shortlist. Personally I have tested 4store with very large databases (up to 2 billion triples) with very good results. 4store is written in C, runs on Linux/Unix 64 bit platforms and the current version 1.1.1 has partially implemented SPARQL 1.1 . 4store can be deployed on a cluster of commodity servers which may boost the performance of your queries and assertion throughput can get up to 100 KTriples/second. But even if you use it in a single server you will get quite a decent performance. Here at the University of Southampton is our choice for very big datasets in research projects and also for our Webmaster team, see Data Stores for Southampton and ECS Open Data . Here you have also a list of all the libraries that you can use to query and administrate 4store Client Libraries . Also, 4store's IRC channel has an active community of users that will help if you run into any issues. If you are a Linux/Unix user 4store is definitely a good choice.
