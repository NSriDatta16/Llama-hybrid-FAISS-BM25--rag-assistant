The term "data mart" has become somewhat ambiguous, but it is traditionally associated with a subject-oriented subset of an organization's information systems. Data mart does not explicitly imply the presence of a multi-dimensional technology such as OLAP and data mart does not explicitly imply the presence of summarized numerical data. A cube, on the other hand, tends to imply that data is presented using a multi-dimensional nomenclature (typically an OLAP technology) and that the data is generally summarized as intersections of multiple hierarchies. (i.e. the net worth of your family vs. your personal net worth and everything in between) Generally, “cube” implies something very specific whereas “data mart” tends to be a little more general. I suppose in OOP speak you could accurately say that a data mart “has-a” cube, “has-a” relational database, “has-a” nifty reporting interface, etc… but it would be less correct to say that any one of those individually “is-a” data mart. The term data mart is more inclusive.
