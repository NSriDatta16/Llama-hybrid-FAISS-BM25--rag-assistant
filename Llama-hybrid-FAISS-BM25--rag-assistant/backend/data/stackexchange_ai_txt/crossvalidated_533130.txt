Principal Components of PCA

I have a dataset combined with normals samples and fault samples. We use PCA on normal samples and faults samples separately. I observe that the last PCs help us to have better separation than for example the third PC. What could be the reasons as we say first PCs hold more data. Thanks in advance.
