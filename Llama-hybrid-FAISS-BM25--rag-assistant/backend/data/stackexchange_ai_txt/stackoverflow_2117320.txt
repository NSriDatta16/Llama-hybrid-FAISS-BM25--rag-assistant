Set maximum displayed rows count for HTML table

Have JSP page with dynamically generated HTML table with unknown number of rows. Have property on backend, that sets maximum number of rows, e.g: max_rows=15 . How to limit number of rows for HTML table to max_rows value? Other part of table should be accessible by vertical scroll,it means that user see 15 rows and if to scroll down, that it will be seen other rows of table. It can be done empirically by calculating average height of row and using max-height property for div-wrapper, but i think this approach is not very stable. So it's needed to rely on row count. Perhaps there is plugin for such case or it's standard CSS or HTML solution?
