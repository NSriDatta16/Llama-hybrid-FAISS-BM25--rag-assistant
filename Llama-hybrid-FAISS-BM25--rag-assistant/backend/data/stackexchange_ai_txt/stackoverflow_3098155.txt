You can develop for the WP7 (Windows Phone 7) using either Silverlight 3 or XNA. I am currently using both to write utility/productivity applications and a game. Silverlight is a subset of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and the knowledge and experience gained one is easily transferable to the other. More line-of-business (LOB) applications are starting to use WPF/Silverlight everyday. I can see Silverlight being utilised more in the coming years for a few reasons: it is easier to deploy than ActiveX, it has excellent tool support (VS2010, Expression Blend), and you can leverage your existing code base. The current install-base for Silverlight is sitting at 60% (sorry; no link to backup that claim, it was stated in a conference call last week with Microsoft). I receive calls/e-mails from recruitment agencies frequently asking if I would be interested in changing industries (from videos games to commercial/government) as there is a massive demand for candidates that have WPF/Silverlight experience.
