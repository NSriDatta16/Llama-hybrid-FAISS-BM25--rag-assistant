good bug tracking system for apt-get debian?

got a new lenny installation now, we are a small team of 3 devs working on a already old and getting bigger project. We deploy the program every now and then to new client (like once a month), with new features. So we need to get a little more organized, i had installed trac some time ago on my debian etch server, however it installed the 0.10.3, and a bunch of things never worked right. Now these days we realized we really need the system. So i tried to upgrade and well, everything went to hell cause i messed up here and there. thing is, i got a new lenny debian, but i wanted to ask you guys, if you recommend a different tracking system, or do you think trac would do the trick ? only requisite is that itÂ´s easy to install and uninstall with apt-get. i really liked that you could browse the svn, however, the console admin did not like that much. Thank you!
