The trie should look like this ROOT overflow/ \st O O \ack O \overflow O Normally you don't need to use hash tables as part of a trie; the trie itself is already an efficient index data structure. Of course you can do that. But anyway, your step (2) should actually descend the trie during the search and not just query the hash function. In this way you find the insertion point readily and don't need to search for it later as a separate step. I believe step (3) is wrong, you don't need to rearrange a trie and as a matter of fact you shouldn't be able to because it's only the additional string fragments that you store in the trie; see the picture above.
