Is WEKA's logistic regression tool slow? If yes, are there faster alternatives?

I have to run logistic regression several thousand times, within a Java/Scala program. A general spec for one of the problems is: ~300 continuous attributes ~ The attributes are the same for all problems, and the positives/negatives are always drawn from the same pool, of about 100,000. I'm finding that naively plugging this into WEKA takes a few minutes per problem, which is unsuitable given the number of tasks which need to be performed. Is there a faster library I can use, or is there a way to parallelize these problems, or something else?
