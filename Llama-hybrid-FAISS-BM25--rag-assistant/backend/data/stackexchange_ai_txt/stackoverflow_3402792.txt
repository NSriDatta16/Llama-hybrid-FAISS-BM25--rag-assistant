Right way to store/trac visits of an item - job board

im developing a job board site, where i have the following tables: Cv (Curriculum) Jobs Users I want to produce the follow information: How many users visit this Job How many users visit my CV How many cv i visited How many jobs i visited My obviously thinking is to created a table for example: log_jobs (id, job_id,user_id) and a log_cv (id,cv_id,user_id) With this i can produce the information i want. But the question is: We are expecting a lot of traffic, with this aproach i can have mysql performaces issues? A table with a real big size (imagine, each visit in a job two queries, each visit in a CV, two queries, this just to log the action) will be a problem? or mysql can handle with a real big table ?? Tkz in advice Roberto
