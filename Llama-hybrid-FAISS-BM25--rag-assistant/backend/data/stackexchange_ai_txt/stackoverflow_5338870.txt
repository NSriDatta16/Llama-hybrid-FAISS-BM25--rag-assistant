Worked on an annoyingly hard slingshot game some time ago(before Angry Birds) called StuntmanJoe and haven't used Box2D, just basic vector maths. Also, a couple of year ago, did a basic Box2D game called BlockStock . Used the pure as3 port (not the Alchemy one) and for the simple game it worked well. The World Construction Kit makes it a lot easier to get started with though. Lee Brimelow has a nice little started tutorial . What I would recommend though is understanding a few basic Box2D concepts like: Coordinate system (is different from flash) Box2D Body Definitions (b2BodyDef) and Polygon Definitions(b2PolygonDef) forces, impulses, joints With the world construction kit, you can still whip out a demo without knowing much about these, but it will be really useful to understand how Box2D runs a little bit. The Alchemy port should be slightly(~5/10 frames per second faster, depending on context), but I'm afraid I haven't tried it on mobile yet. At Flash Camp London I've seen a very basic angry birds like flash demo running on an Android phone and the framerate was above 20fps, which was encouraging. I imagine you should keep in mind the kind of content that runs well on mobiles and a few tricks that should improve the framerate a bit (like cacheAsBitmap and cacheAsMatrix, where possible). For Android, you can have a look at this LFPUG presentation and get some tips/advices/gotchas. For iPhone, I wouldn't consider Flash for a responsive Box2D game. I would rather recommend Cocos2D for iPhone than Flash. HTH
