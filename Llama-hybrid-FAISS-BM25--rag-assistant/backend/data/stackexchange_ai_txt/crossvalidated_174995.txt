What is the correct definition of the Likelihood function?

I am doing the CS229:Machine Learning of Stanford Engineering Everywhere. All trhough the first chapter he uses $$L(\theta) = P(Y | X; \theta)$$ i.e. the likelihood of the parameter $\theta$ is given by the cond. prob. of Y given X Now in the second chapter, when talking about Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, shuddenly without any explaination our likelihood looks like this: $$L(\theta) = P(Y \cap X; \theta)$$ What happened here? Which likelihood function is used when? I find the first likelihood a much more natural choice. I am talking about page 10 of this script
