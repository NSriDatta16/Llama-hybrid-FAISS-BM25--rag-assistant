Shared calendars on Thunderbird lightning

I would like to setup an open source solution for calendaring in a medium sized enterprise. We would be using this from Thunderbird (lightning add-on), Microsoft Outlook. I want to see others' free/busy schedule, invite them to meetings etc. It would be really nice if I could have a calendar for resources like conference room, projector etc. I have searched quite a lot on the net, but have not found a suitable solution nor any detailed instructions on how to set this up. Since this is very much needed in organizations, I am sure you might have set this up. I would be really grateful if you could provide me pointers to any detailed (step-by-step) documentation.
