Being a purist, I say no don't do it. For reasons mentioned earlier. Being a pragmatist, I just wanted to say that never have I seen website rework that involved pure html changes without css, or pure css without html, simply because both parts are being developed with the other in mind. So, in reality, if somebody else would EVER need to change the page, I bet my salary they will change both html and css. The above is something that collegue purists around often tend to ignore, even though it's reality. But bottom line; no, avoid using a className such as "right". :-)
