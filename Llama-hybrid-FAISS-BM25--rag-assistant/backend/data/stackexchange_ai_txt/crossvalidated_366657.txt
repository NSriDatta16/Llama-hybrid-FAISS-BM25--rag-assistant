There are several ways to interpret "be a better predictor" in this context. One possible way is to fit a model for "falling asleep at work" using "hours of sleep" (model 1), fit another one with the same outcome using "having breakfast" instead (model 2) and to compare whether model 1 or model 2 predicts better the variations of the outcome "falling asleep at work". As suggested by Edward in his comments, a solution is to fit a logistic regression for each predictor. One interesting output of each regression is a set of predicted values (a vector $\hat y_1$ for model 1 and $\hat y_2$ for model 2). One can then compare the values of the outcome $y$ to $\hat y_1$ and to $\hat y_2$, for instance computing the percentage of observations for which the prediction $\hat y$ is equal to the realised value of the outcome $y$. Hours of sleep will be a better predictor than having breakfast for the outcome falling asleep at work if the measure is higher for model 1 than for model 2.
