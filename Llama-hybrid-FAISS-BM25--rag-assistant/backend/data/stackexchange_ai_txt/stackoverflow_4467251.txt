Why is sort the only event firing for jQuery UI .sortable()?

I have a simple code example @ http://jsbin.com/ukiwo3/edit It has 2 connected lists and a load of bound events. I'm hopeful I've missed something simple as based on http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ Events I think I should see all these events fired when I drag and reorder a question li. At the moment only sort logs to the console. Can anyone tell me whats wrong and how to get the rest to fire? Thanks, Denis
