Now that I looked at the observed birth data, I see that there are 24 months of data. For each month you have a sample proportion of girl births. If we assume that births are independent of month then each estimate is approximately normal with mean the true p and variance p(1-p)/n$_i$ where n$_i$ is the actual number of girl births in month i. So you have 24 independent estimates of p. Each one normally distributed. The variances differ slightly becuase of the differences in the n$_i$s. But since the ns are all close to 3900 we can ignore that difference. Now 0.4857 is the overall average of these 24 estimates. Take the sample variance of these 24 estimates. If each estimate were exactly normal and independent the variance would be proportional to a chi square random variable with 23 degrees of freedom (1 less than the number of months). Since the normal approximations are all very good that chi square distribution can be used to get a confidence interval for the variance and then the square root of the end points can be used for the approximate 95% confidence interval for the standard deviation. I think that what is very interesting about this is the upper endpoint of 0.010. We see that if we add 0.01 to the estimate of 0.4857 for girls we still get 0.4957
