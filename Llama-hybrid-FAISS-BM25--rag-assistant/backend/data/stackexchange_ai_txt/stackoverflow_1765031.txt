I did not have to deal with the algorithm before, but what you have implemented does not match the algorithm as explained on Wikipedia . The algorithm there works as follows. But all vertices into the queue. O(V) While the queue is not empty... O(V) Take the edge with the minimum weight from the queue. O(log(V)) Update the weights of adjacent vertices. O(E / V), this is the average number of adjacent vertices. Reestablish the queue structure. O(log(V)) This gives O(V) + O(V) * (O(log(V)) + O(V/E)) = O(V) + O(V) * O(log(V)) + O(V) * O(E / V) = O(V) + O(V * log(V)) + O(E) = O(V * log(V)) + O(E) exactly what one expects.
