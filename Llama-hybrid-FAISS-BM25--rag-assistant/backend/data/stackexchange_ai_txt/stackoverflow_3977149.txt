I suggest offline banners as well. Just you should organize a smart mechanizm in order to have your banners in a safe place, because user can just find the banner folder, and delete all banners and put there just a blank image with a fixed color and your ads are done :). Also you should update the banner folder content whenewer the user has an internet connection and you should do that in background! This is the main idea. If there are improvements of this idea, I would like to discuss with great pleasure as this question interrests me too!
