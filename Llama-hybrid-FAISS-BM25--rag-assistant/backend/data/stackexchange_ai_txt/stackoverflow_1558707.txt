You can see how this can be done in the article Graphs in the database: SQL meets social networks by Lorenzo Alberton. The example code is written for PostgreSQL using CTEs. However, I doubt that using a RDBMS for this will perform well. I wrote up an article on how to do the same stuff as in the mentioned article using a native graph database, in this case Neo4j : Social networks in the database: using a graph database . Other than the differences in performance, a graph database also simplifies the task by providing a graph API that makes it easy to handle traversals that would be extremely complex to write in SQL (or by using stored procedures). I wrote a bit more on graph databases in this thread and see this one too.
