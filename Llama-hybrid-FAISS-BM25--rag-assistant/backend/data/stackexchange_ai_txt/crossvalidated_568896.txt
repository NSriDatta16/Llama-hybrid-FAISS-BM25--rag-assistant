I could not follow your R code. However, there is no single "correct" answer. Suppose you have $x = 37$ "Successes" in $n = 150$ trials. There are many styles of 95% confidence intervals in common use. I will give several examples. Opinions vary about which is best and in which applications. The Wald interval uses $\hat p = 37/150 = 0.2467$ and the corresponding 95% CI $(0.095,0.398)$ is of the form $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}.$ It is most useful for large $n.$ (I'd say $n > 500).$ p.hat = 37/150 CI.w = p.hat + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/n) CI.w [1] 0.09492108 0.39841225 The Agresti-Cooil 95% CI $( 0.185, 0.322)$ uses a slightly different estimate of the population proportion and has better properties for smaller $n.$ p.est = (37+2)/(150+4) CI.ac = p.est + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/154) CI.ac [1] 0.1845639 0.3219296 The Jeffreys 95% CI $(0.183, 0.320),$ based on a Bayesian argument with a non-informative prior uses a beta distribution. qbeta(c(.025, .975), 37.5, 150.5 - 37) [1] 0.1829657 0.3200351 The Clopper-Pearson 95% CI $(0.180, 0.324)$ is implemented in the binom.test procedure in R: binom.test(37, 150)$conf.int [1] 0.1800065 0.3236100 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 When the R procedure prop.test is used with a single group, it provides a confidence interval, here $(0.182, 0.325),$ for the group population proportion: prop.test(37, 150)$conf.int [1] 0.1816347 0.3249513 attr(,"conf.level") [1] 0.95 I include this interval on my list because I just discovered it today and I have not yet been able to decipher the documentation for prop.test to know the name of this interval---if there is one. I hope one of my colleagues on this site will know. (It seems close to Clopper-Pearson.) Notes: For more, see the links under 'Related' in the margin and this along with its links. Also, you can google 'binomial confidence interval' to see several other kinds of frequently used CI's that may be relevant for your purposes.
