Stop video at specific position using windows media player SDK

Is there a way to stop a video at a particular position using Windows Media Player SDK? I am using C# for embedding the player and trying to see if the IWMPControls3 Interface has any stopping capability at a particular point in terms of position or time. If it can be done, then how to do it?
