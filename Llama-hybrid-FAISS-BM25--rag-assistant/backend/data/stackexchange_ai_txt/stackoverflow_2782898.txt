Converting from subarray coordinates to array coordinates

I know the center (x,y) coordinates of a subarray in terms of the subarray space and general array. For other parts of the subarray I also know the coordinates in the subarray space - but I want to find the coordinates in the general array? Is there an elegant way to do it in MATLAB? In principle I think you should still be able to find where it would be in the array space. For example, let's say (32,18) are the (x,y) coordinates of an element. Then you have a small 8x8 subarray that includes the same element. Let's say the coordinates for the same element in the subarray space are (3,5). What would be the coordinates in the larger array for something that is, for example, (6.2,7.1) in the subarray?
