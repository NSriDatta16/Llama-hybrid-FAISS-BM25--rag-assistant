Hey, this is a great question, and quite complex. Because Flex is primarily developed by Adobe, they don't have the power/resources/money to cover edge/customization cases like this. If only they decentralized Flex's development! I've had to deal with this problem too. It boils down to the fact Flex has hard-coded specific data source 'types' into the ListBase source , so you can't change the types. That's good and bad... Check out all the drag[Type]Handler methods in that ListBase class and see what's going on. All we need to do is intercept the DragEvent.DRAG_START event and call event.stopImmediatePropagation() (luckily flex will listen to that!). Here's an example app: items This gives you the base for checking if dragSource.hasFormat returns true/false. If you want to change what the dragSource's format is , you're going to have to extend TileList and override all of the drag methods :/. The items and orderedItems are hard-coded into ListBase, so you can't change the format easily. The only way you can use your own formats is to not use any of the ListBase-extending classes, and implement your own drag/drop system. It's not that bad. The reason is because, if you look into all the drag event handlers in ListBase, they have things like this: var dragSource:DragSource = event.dragSource; if (!dragSource.hasFormat("items") && !dragSource.hasFormat("orderedItems")) return; So if they're not that format, it won't allow you to drag. Hope that helps, Lance
