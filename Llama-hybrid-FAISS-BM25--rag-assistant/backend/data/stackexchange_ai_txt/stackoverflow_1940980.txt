C# algorithm - find least number of objects necessary

Let's say I have the following code. var numberToGetTo = 60; var list = new[] {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; I want to be able to return 50 & 10 from list to = 60. If the numberToGetTo was 100 I would want to return 50, 50. If the numberToGetTo was 85 I would want to return 50, 40. I want to return the least amount of numbers from the list necessary to get to the "numberToGetTo", while staying closest (equal or greather) than to it. Is doing something like this with Linq possible?
