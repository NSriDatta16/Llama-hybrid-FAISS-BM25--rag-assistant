How does one use onmousedown/onmouseup correctly?

Whenever I write mouse handling code, the onmousedown/onmouseup/onmousemove model always seemed to force me to produce unnecessarily complex code that would still end up causing all sorts of UI bugs. The main problem which I see even in major pieces of software these days is the "ghost mouse" event where you drag to outside the window and then let go. Once you return back into the window, the application still thinks you have the mouse down even though the button is up. This is especially annoying when you're trying to highlight something that goes to the border of the screen. Is there a RIGHT way to write mouse code or is the entire model just flawed?
