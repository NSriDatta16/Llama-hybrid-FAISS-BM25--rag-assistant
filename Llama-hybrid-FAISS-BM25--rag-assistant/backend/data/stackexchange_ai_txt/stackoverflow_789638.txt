@ an0nym0usc0ward OOP is simply the method of consolidating like functions or properties into an object that can be imported and used. It is nothing more that a form of organization for your code, ALL code executes procedurally in the processor in the end, OOP is just organization of sources. What he is doing here may not be OOP as you learn from a book, but it does the exact same thing in the end, and should be treated with the same respect. Anyone that truly understands OOP wouldn't be naive enough to think that the approved and documented form of OOP is the only possible way to object orient your code. EDIT: This was supposed to be a comment response to an0nym0usc0ward's rude comment telling him to learn OOP. But I guess I typed it in the wrong box :)
