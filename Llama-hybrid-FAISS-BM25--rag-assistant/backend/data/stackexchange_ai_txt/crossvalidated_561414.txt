Put it this way.... You test #1 (Value - TrueValue) = -7.62, -9.33, -8.36, -9.79,-10.45, -9.51, -10.83, -10.64, -9.96, -10.30 And the averaged-error/adjustment is -9.679 . If you conduct 1000 tests, you will have 1000 different values of averaged-error/adjustment. Then you can plot the distribution and it would probably be a normal distribution. Then you can calculate the mean and the standard deviation of this distribution, and you can say that the averaged-error/adjustment is mean +/- 2*standard-deviation with 95% confidence.
