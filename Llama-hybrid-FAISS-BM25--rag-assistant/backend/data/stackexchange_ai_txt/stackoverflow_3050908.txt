PowerBuilder: Insert data using a datawindow

Suppose I have a table called 'test', into which there are three columns named test_id , test_name and test_age . I have used a retrieval argument called :al_test_id to prompt the user to insert an id and search the database for the corresponding id entries, and if found, display it to the user. Now if no entry is found, then I want the user to be able to insert a new row using the id that he/she entered as the retrieval argument. How can I do that?
