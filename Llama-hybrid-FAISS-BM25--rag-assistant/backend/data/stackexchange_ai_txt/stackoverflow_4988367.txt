anonymous read with amazon simpledb

I would like to query simpledb directly from the client using javascript. My application is read-heavy and I rather not route the request through my application server. Is it possible to perform a select request without authentication? I could set up an authentication server, but this is rather inelegant as it will just be saying yes to every read request and would introduce another bottleneck/speedbump/point of failure. Do the other cloud db solutions (microsoft, google) have this functionality?
