Impact of having negative Box-Cox lambdas on a Tau correlation matrix

I'm trying to make the marginal distributions of my data easier to fit by first applying a Box-Cox transformation and then standardizing the transformed data. My concern is, as this is a multivariate Monte Carlo simulation, that a negative Box-Cox lambda would throw off my Tau correlation matrix. For now, to not upset rankings, I've enforced a non-negativity constraint on Lambda -- which limits some of my time series. Is there a way around this? TL;DR: How can I allow for a negative Box-Cox lambda without disrupting my Tau correlation matrix? Thank you for your time and kind assistance!
