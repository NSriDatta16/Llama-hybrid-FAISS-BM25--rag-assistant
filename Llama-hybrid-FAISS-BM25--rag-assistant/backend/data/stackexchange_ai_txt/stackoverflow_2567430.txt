Mercurial setup: One central repo or several?

My company is switching from Subversion to Mercurial. We're using .NET for our product. We have a solution with about a dozen projects that are separate modules with no dependencies on each other. We're using a central repo on a server with push/pull for our integration build. I'm trying to figure out if I should create one central repo with all the projects in it, or if I should create a separate repo for each project. One argument for separate repos is that branching the individual modules would be easier, but an argument for a single repo is easier management and workflow. I'm very new to hg and DVCS, so some guidance is greatly appreciated. ETA: At hginit.com, Joel says: [I]f you’re used to having one big gigantic repository for the whole company, where some people only check out and work on subdirectories that they care about, this isn’t a very good way to work with Mercurial—you’re better off having lots of smaller repositories for each project. It'd be great if someone could expand on this or point me to more documentation.
