iPhone: Can I take samples from garage band and use them in my app?

Not quite a programming question, but here goes. Lets say, for example, I create a 'drums' iPhone app. (don't worry, I'm not making a drum app, way to many of these already!) For the drum sounds, would it be OK to directly record drum sounds from garage band and use them as the drum sounds in the app? Or - is there some legal agreement stopping this? It is perfectly ok to make songs with the garage band instruments, so is it ok to make instruments with the instruments?
