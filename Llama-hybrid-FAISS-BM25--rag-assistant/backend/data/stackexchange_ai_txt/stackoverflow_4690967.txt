ASP.Net MVC 3 JSON Model Binding and server side model validation mixed with client side validation

I've been playing with the new MVC3 Json Model Binding and it's quite nice. Currently, I can post JSON to controller and bind it. Model Validation occurs nicely too. But what happens if the model is invalid? I'd like to return JSON and have the client side notify the user (like how you'd perform normal client side validation in mvc) Does anyone know of some tutorials on how to perform this? Is this even possible? Or are there frameworks I can leverage to do this?
