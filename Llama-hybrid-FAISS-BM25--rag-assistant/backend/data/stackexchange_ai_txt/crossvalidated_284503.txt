Modeling failure "events" in time-series environmental data

I collect time series wind speed data. Occasionally, the anemometers that collect this data break. I have flag "events" in place to notify me when this occurs - they are very rudimentary, for example, when a sensor breaks, it will return flat line data. So I have code that checks for wind speed data The problem: Many false positives. Current solution is very rudimentary and rule based. Example pseudocode might be: if windspeed I have maybe 20 of these rules but I would like to develop a ML classifier that is more sophisticated. I thought about a decision tree where the features might be: Wind Speed Temperature Barometric Pressure Boolean: Is another sensor at the same height reading a similar value And I would be seeking to predict whether the failure event is either False Flag or Real Event However, this would model each time-stamp in the data as it's own separate row independent of each other, when in actuality my data is time series. My questions: Are there effective methods for modeling time series with decision trees? Would you recommend another model altogether? Should the data be modeling with booleans or actual values? For example, instead having temperature, I could just use boolean for freezing v. not freezing. Or does this matter? I have wind direction and standard deviation data as well, maybe that could help predict as well.
