The use of Fisher's Exact test for Cougar (Puma concolor) Injury in the United States

In 2019 a research paper was published measuring the association between cougar attacks on humans using the Fisher's Exact test between 1924 to 2018 [1]. There were a total of 74 attacks reported from 16 different states."The most common activities victims were doing at the time of attack were hiking (n=20, 35%), performing peridomestic activities (n=9, 16%), hunting (n=8, 16%), and jogging (n=5, 9%)." and "Half of all the victims were alone when they were attacked: 100% of joggers, 56% of persons engaged in peridomestic activities, and 38% of hikers were alone at the time of the attack, although these percentages were not statistically significant (P=0.3)" (pg 245 paragraph 1). The paper stated that those events were primarily due to predatory reasons and a main assumption for the Fisher's exact test requires that the margins are fixed. Wouldn't the research need to include other predatory animals as well in their sample to meet the main assumption? References Wang YY, Weiser TG, Forrester JD.
