Where should video be hosted to stream for an iphone app

Looking for a way to not have a publicly hosted video be used in an iphone application. Youttube or Vimeo seem like the obvious choices for free hosting of video, but the public nature is discouraging. Want to charge for video content, so making it free to all defeats the purpose. Any ideas?
