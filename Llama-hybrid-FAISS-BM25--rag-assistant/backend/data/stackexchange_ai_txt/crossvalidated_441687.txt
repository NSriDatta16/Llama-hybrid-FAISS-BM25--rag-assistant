What methods can be used for distribution generation other than GANs?

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used for creating distributions of data points, that follow source data set distributions (e.g. images, sound, text, etc). Are there any other methods or techniques, that can produce new data, that looks like source data?
