Regression Trees explanation

I am trying to implement a regression tree but I do not understand the maths completely. So given this answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-decision-trees-for-regression-work I do not understand this formula: So what is y1 bar and y2 bar ? As I build my tree while looping through splits I will have 2 parts each time. So y1-bar is the average of the y values of the left part? Same for y2-bar? If it is then is just a scalar? So I subtract a scalar from a vector and sum it's resulting elements ? So if yi = [1,9,8,9,9,1,4] then y1-bar (mean) is 5.857 ? So the sum will be sum[yi - mean(yi)] = 2.6645352591003757e-15 ?
