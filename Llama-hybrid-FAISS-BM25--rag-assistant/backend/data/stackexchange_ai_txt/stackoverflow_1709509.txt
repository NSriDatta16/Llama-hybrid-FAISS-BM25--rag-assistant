Getting "undefined method `include?'" for request.user_agent

I've got this line of code: if request.user_agent.include?("iPhone") then But I'm occasionally getting this error: "undefined method `include?' for nil:NilClass" When checking logs on the error, there isn't a " HTTP_USER_AGENT " for the user that is getting the error. So how can I fix that line so it doesn't throw an error if there isn't an HTTP_USER_AGENT ?
