OK, after thinking some more about it I've decided to go with one member variable per flag. I could've used the getter/setter method approach, but I don't use them anywhere else in my code so this would be out-of-style. Plus, this way I also abstract away from DB storage method and can later easily change that if needed. As for the DB - I'm going to stay with the bitwise integer for now - mainly because I'm almost done with the software and don't want to change that anymore. It doesn't change readability at all.
