Found this, re php (will also apply to .net)... iphone doesn't seem to cache any resource over 15k in size, and total cache size is 1.5MB. Note this is old information so may have changed. http://www.phpied.com/iphone-caching/ The solution for a file over 15k, is to use an offline application cache manifest file, as outlined here: http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/Client-SideStorage/Client-SideStorage.html PS I know your content length is below 15k - so something else must be amiss... but I'm still hopeful that the manifest file will work.
