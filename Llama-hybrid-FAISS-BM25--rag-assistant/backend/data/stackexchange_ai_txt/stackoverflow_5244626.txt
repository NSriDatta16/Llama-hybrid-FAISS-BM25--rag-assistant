disable dragging in ckeditor

I am facing an issue with my ckeditor. I am loading an entire page of HTML into the ckeditor. It's loading and showing fine. I want to let users edit only the data (texts), but not its alignment. But in editor each div is draggable (like the textbox in office word). How can I lock these areas.
