One possible approach: Ensure that the time series are stationary (detrend, denoise, remove outliers). Use a spectral decomposition method (such as FFT) to decompose each time series into the most important frequencies. Perform some discretisation of the observed signals (quarterly cycles with peak in January etc). Cluster time series based on presence of matching discretised signals.
