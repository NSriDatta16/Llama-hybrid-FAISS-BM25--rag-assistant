1.Does the Cauchy example contradicts the Bernstein von-Mises Theorem? No. Bernstein von-Mises Theorem is not applicable when the joint distribution does not have a differentiable second moment. And obviously joint i.i.d. Cauchy random variables does not even have a finite second moment. This condition requires a bounded energy assumption on the Riemannian manifold defined by the Rao-Fisher metric which is not satisfied by Cauchys. 2.Are there any (hopefully elementary) examples in which the Bayesian posterior is not asymptotically normal? In particular are there examples where $\pi,f$ are continuously differentiable with respect to $\theta$? $\pi(\theta)>0 $ for all $\theta$? Yes. Indeed, we can choose an (noninformative) improper prior $\pi\propto C_0$ making the posterior also improper. For example $f\propto C_1$ is a trivial example. An improper posterior cannot be normal. For example, [Rubio&Steel] (14) provided an example where Jeffereys prior leading to an improper posterior which cannot be normal no matter how large the sample size is.
