Simple posts / comments route in rails 3

I'm trying to write a route that captures the one-to-many relationship between posts and comments in your average blog What I have currently is a post.rb class Post followed by a comment.rb (among all the other db setups including post_id:integer for comment) class Comment In the routes I'm trying to use resources :posts do resources :comments end but I'm not having any luck - any help from a rails 3 expert? Edit When I hit the "show" action of my post controller via this url http://localhost:3000/posts/3 I get a routing error No route matches {:controller=>"comments", :action=>"create"} This is because of my comments form in the show template of my post Do I need to alter my form because before this alteration to the routes when I did a simple view source the action pointed to /comments/{id} Edit #2 I did notice that after I altered my routes to look like this resources :comments resources :posts resources :posts do resources :comments end I get everything working except that my created comment doesn't know the post_id (in MySQL the comment is persisted yet it doesn't know the post it belongs_to) Could this maybe be my form then?
