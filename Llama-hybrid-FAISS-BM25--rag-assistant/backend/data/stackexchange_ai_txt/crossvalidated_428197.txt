What statistical test should I perform for the data who comes from more than one population?

I want to check the chosen property (for example volume, density etc.) between data of experiment 1 and experiment 2, whether the difference of property between the experiment is significant or not? My experiment 1 consist of 4 samples and experiment 2 consist of 3 samples. My data in each sample comes from spatial region and have following sizes: Experiment 1 sample 1: (300x1) sample 2: (250x1) sample 3: (200x1) sample 4: (350x1) Experiment 2 sample 1: (800x1) sample 2: (750x1) sample 3: (650x1) What method will be good to perform statistical test. (1) Merging all the samples of experiment 1 and experiment 2 and then perform the statistics. (2) Merging all the samples of experiment 1 and experiment 2, plotting their histogram and perform the test on histogram value. (3) Making similar bin (binsize 10) for each sample, take averages over bin for the samples in each experiment and then perform the statistical test. I tried Kolmogorov-Smirnov for method 1; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Chi-square test for method 2 and 3 but none of p-values looks promising. I suspect that data in each samples comes from more than one population (meaning spatially different population) and these population may not be normally distributed. What will you suggest: (i) what is the good way to arrange the data; and (2) which statistical should be done for such data?
