Why is the mean of the means not equal to the grand mean (average)?

I'm using Microsoft® Excel® for Microsoft 365 MSO (Version 2302 Build 16.0.16130.20374) 32-bit I have 31 numbers from 6 different centers. I need an average for each center and an average for all. If all 31 numbers are averaged together in col A, using =AVERAGE(A1:A31) I get 104. Center 1 average was 156 Center 2 average was 194 Center 3 average was 100 Center 4 average was 59 Center 5 average was -70 Center 6 average was 125 The individual averages looked wonky, so to double check I tried averaging those 6 totals and got 94 instead of 104. I know there is some rounding but I didn't expect a difference of 10. I tried it with numbers from different departments within the same 6 centers and the averages equaled each other. These averages were fine Why are these averages different
