Normally you use passive federation for web application, because web clients are unable to emit proper SOAP hence got the label "Passive Requestor", while anything able to produce proper SOAP got the label "Active Requestor" and can use Active Federation without problems. There are luck of samples of this on internet, but check Vittorio Bertocci's blog , there you can find great articles about active and passive federation.
