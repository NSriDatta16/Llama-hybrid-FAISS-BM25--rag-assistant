How to implement Android Pull-to-Refresh

In Android applications such as Twitter (official app), when you encounter a ListView, you can pull it down (and it will bounce back when released) to refresh the content. I wonder what is the best way, in your opinion, to implement that? Some possibilities I could think of: An item on top of the ListView - however I don't think scrolling back to item position 1 (0-based) with animation on the ListView is an easy task. Another view outside the ListView - but I need to take care of moving the ListView position down when it is pulled, and I'm not sure if we can detect if the drag-touches to the ListView still really scroll the items on the ListView. Any recommendations? P.S. I wonder when the official Twitter app source code is released. It has been mentioned that it will be released, but 6 months has passed and we haven't heard about it since then.
