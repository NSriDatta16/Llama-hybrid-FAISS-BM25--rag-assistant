in need of a random "hot or not" algorithm/solutions

i'm working on a "hot or not" type of web application where user will be able to rate some random picture and we want to encourage user to rate by making they own picture submitted showing up more often. Below is the descritpion of what i'm looking for. 1- Need to show the user random picture 2- User with most activity will have a greater chance of there picture showing up 3- Assume a lot of picture, so i'm in need of a efficient solution What the most effective way of doing this? The only solutions i have at the moment is to keep a master list table with all the picture and when somebody rate i insert a records in that table to add up to they % of showing up and when a user load up the app i load a random 500 picture id in the session with a exclude list for already review/rate picture. Thanks
