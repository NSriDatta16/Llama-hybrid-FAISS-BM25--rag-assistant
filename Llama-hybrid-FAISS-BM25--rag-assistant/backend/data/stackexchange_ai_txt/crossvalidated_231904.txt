I am a researcher at A Place for Mom, the nation's largest senior living referral service. We've designed a survey aimed at understanding how moving into an assisted living community influences quality of life. Causal inference is central to this research, and the methods of causal analysis (e.g., matching, modeling selection processes, estimating average treatment effects) are essential.
