Cheat Sheet of UNIX commands for Data Science

I was looking for a cheat sheet of UNIX commands, which are specifically usable for data science. I mean an introduction to very basic commands (starting from cd , ls , pwd , to some still simple but usable for data - e.g. wc , a few simple things with pipes, ssh , maybe s3cmd , etc), with some minimalistic examples. I couldn't find one; or at least, nothing close to: Git Cheat Sheet Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet series of R Cheat Sheets I am pretty much aware of datascienceatthecommandline.com , but my goal would be to have a 1-2 A4 pages printout, with really simple stuff. If there is one (but I missed it), I would be grateful for posting it as an answer. If there isn't, then I am asking to post pieces of such list. (If Moderator permits, we may create one list with Community Wiki.) EDIT: The closest thing I've found is here: Useful Unix commands for data science (very nice, but missing the very introductory part).
