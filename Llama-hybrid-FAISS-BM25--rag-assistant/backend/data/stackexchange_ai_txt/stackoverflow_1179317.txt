Relational UML Diagram inspired by SO

My homework was to create a relational UML diagram about a discussion site. I used the SO schema , and I did some modifications: removed Age in the User Information added representatives, which allows users to categorise posts by their usernames (voluntary) Otherwise, the schema is rather similar, but rudimentary. How would you improve it? Clarification The main idea of representatives is to categorise posts. The list contains only a handful possible names. In contrast to badges, the idea is not to funny, but organised. If you ask questions about Mathematics, you could be Steve.math or just math . It helps other users to see directly what you are like, and space is not wasted to you Username . Perhaps, there is an easier way to organise things, so don't hesitate to comment.
