I guess I would like to read or at least browse in that too, but only a polymath or a committee could write it, and the polymath isn't evident and committee books often don't work well. Also, many of the general books on statistics that tend to pop up from (e.g.) searches on Amazon just leave out most of the interesting technical details and/or are written by people not close to any cutting edge. But I would recommend browsing in the Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences if a library near you holds a copy: http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471150444.html and also that you look through what appears in Statistical Science , which has a good track record of readable review and discussion papers. I would venture an assertion that most specialists in econometrics, psychometrics, machine learning, etc. would have little confidence that people outside their own field really understand what is currently central and most interesting in that field. (So, what else is new?)
