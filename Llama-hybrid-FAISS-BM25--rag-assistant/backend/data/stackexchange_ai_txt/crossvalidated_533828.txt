While I suppose you could impose a physical analogy, K-means doesn't have much of a physical interpretation. It does look for a partition of a collection of points such that the average distances are minimized, but these are not necessarily to be interpreted as physical distances. Informally speaking, things that are close together are grouped together. In mathematics a 'distance' is more formally called a " metric ", and it is just a type of function that holds certain abstract properties. Namely that a metric on a set $X$ is a function $d: X \times X \mapsto [0,\infty)$ (i.e. into the non-negative real numbers) such that for $\forall x,y,z \in X$ the following hold: $$d(x,y) = 0 \iff x = y$$ $$d(x,y) = d(y,x)$$ $$d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)$$
