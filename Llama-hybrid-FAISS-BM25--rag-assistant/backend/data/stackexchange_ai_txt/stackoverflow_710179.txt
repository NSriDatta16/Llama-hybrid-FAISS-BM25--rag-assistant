How can I select distinct rows when a text field is part of the returned fields in MS SQL Server 2000?

I have a database-driven FAQ that is organised into sections and I am trying to get the section data for only those sections who have a question/answer associated with them. Here is the schema: |---------------------| |----------------------| | Section | | Quest-Ans | |---------------------| |----------------------| | PK | id(int) | When I try this query: SELECT DISTINCT s.id, s.title, s.desc FROM Section as s INNER JOIN Quest-Ans as q ON s.id = q.Sec_id I get an error saying that DISCRETE cannot be applied to a text field. How can I get the data I want? If it matters, this is an SQL2000 database. EDIT: Ok, so it seems like there are two ways to go about this. Either with EXISTS and a subquery in the where clause, or with the subquery in the inner join. Which is faster?
