The shuffling should work in this manner: You take two random cards in the deck (the index of the card in the deck is the random numbers) And swap positions of the two cards. For instance take card at index 2 and card at index 9 and have them change place. And that can be repeated a certain number of times. The algorithm should look something like this: int firstNum = rnd.Next(52); int secondNum = rnd.Next(52); Card tempCard = MyCards[firstNum]; MyCards[firstNum] = MyCards[secondNum]; MyCards[secondNum] = tempCard;
