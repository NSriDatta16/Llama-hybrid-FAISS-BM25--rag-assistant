a small SQL query problem with SELECT

SQL queries are still my weakest point, so here I am with yet another SQL question. Imagine I have two tables: auctions and bids . Table auctions contains my auctions and table bids contains the list of bids for each auction. Now I'm selecting values like this: SELECT `auction_title`, `auction_seo_title`, `auction_description_1`, `auction_unixtime_expiration`, `auction_startPrice`, MAX(`bids`.`bid_price`) as `bid_price` FROM `auctions` LEFT JOIN `bids` ON `auctions`.`auction_id`=`bids`.`bid_belongs_to_auction` ORDER BY `auction_unixtime_expiration` ASC LIMIT 5 The query works, but it's got a little catch to it: It selects only those auctions, which have at least one corresponding value inside the bids table. That means that if I have a new auction, which has no bids yet, the query doesn't return this auction, but I want it too! I believe this is a very simple problem for anyone with at least above average SQL skills. I hope someone like that comes around :) Thanks in advance!
