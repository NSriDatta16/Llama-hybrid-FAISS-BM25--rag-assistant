I'm assuming that when you say embedding a module you mean the "Fly" module from your example is embedded in "Superpower". If that is the case, I would call it a nested module. The only time I would use a Nested Module is when the nested module deals specifically with the main module, such that the code in Fly is directly correlated to Superpower, but are separated for convenience and readability. You can use the nested module's methods simply by including superpower first, then fly second, like so: Class Superman include Superpower include Fly # ... end The details are described further on this blog .
