Yes, multivariate analysis is usually what the area is called in statistics. More specifically you are probably interested in multivariate (multiple) regression when you want to predict $E(\mathbf{Y}| \mathbf{X})$, for some vector $\mathbf{Y}$ given some data $\mathbf{X}$. Note that this problem of calculating the conditional expectation (i.e. prediction) is sometimes called regression in statistics even when $\mathbf{Y}$ is a categorical variable (and would usually be called classification in machine learning). In machine learning, this area problem is sometimes called multitask learning. Yes, you can transform categorical variables in this way, it's called one-hot encoding in machine learning, and it's standard preprocessing step in many ML libraries. Finally, I am not an expert about appropriate R packages but I found one party that implements CART-like tree with support for multivariate responses. You might find other useful answers on the CRAN task view , or discussed in this question here (although the answers are not super helpful). Otherwise I'd suggest maybe asking a more specific R related question here.
