Package/procedure for causal mediation analysis with two mediators in multilevel data

I have an epidemiological cohort with multiple survey waves. The independent variable and mediators of interest are numeric and normal enough while the dependent variable (self perceived general health) is a Likert 1 to 5 scale variable. My analysis thus far has been conducted in R and I have been using a random slope on participant ID to account for the repeated data ( 1|ID ). I started with ordinal and clmm() but have approached the mediation analysis treating the dependent as continuous to use mediation with lmer() from lme4 . This approach has worked for causal mediation analysis with one mediator: #Example data - very fake dat I cannot figure out how to extend to a parallel mediation model with two mediators whilst retaining the random slope on participant ID. I would like to calculate the indirect effect via mediator 1, the indirect effect via mediator 2 and the average direct effects with 95%CIs for all. Do you have a suggestion or recommendation of how to do so? I'd prefer to stay in R but have access and experience to use Stata (also SPSS but I doubt that is the solution).
