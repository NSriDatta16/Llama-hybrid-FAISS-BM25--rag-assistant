We just started using Hudson here at the office. Its free and open-source, it has a very user friendly UI. Plus there are tons of options and plugins available. I was up and running in a matter of minutes after installing it. All the other devs here are loving it. All in all, its a very elegant solution for Continuous Integration or Nightly Builds.
