Testing Trend Stationarity against Stationarity

I am trying to find a test where null hypothesis is that the series is trend stationary. I can assume that the trend is linear if that is going to help. So the series for null hypothesis is given by: $y_t = a + bt + x_t$ Where $x_t$ is a stationary time series which we take it to have zero mean without loss of generality.
