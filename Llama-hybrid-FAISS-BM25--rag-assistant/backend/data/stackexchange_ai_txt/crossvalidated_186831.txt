On the average 15 events per candidate variable is a good rough rule of thumb. This applies to both model building and to parameter estimation, hence the use of the word candidate . But you need 96 observations just to estimate the intercept in a binary logistic model such that the margin of error in the predicted risk with 0.95 confidence does not exceed $\pm 0.1$ . A more recent paper here suggests 20:1 events:candidate variable, and a much higher figure when machine learning is used.
