In neural network literature, which one is activation?

Consider an MLP with one hidden layer. Mathematically, denoting the input as $x$, the output, say, $y$ is calculated by $$ y = \sigma(W_2a_2 + b_2) $$ where $$ a_2 = \sigma(z_2), \qquad z_2 = W_1x+b_1. $$ What confuses me is which one is called activation, for example, in the second layer? Is the activated signal $a_2$ called the activation of 2-nd layer? Or is $z_2$, the signal before activated, called so?
