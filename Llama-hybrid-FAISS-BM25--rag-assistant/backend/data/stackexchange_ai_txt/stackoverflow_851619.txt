Page Load - Force Refresh in classic asp?

Topic says it. Short version: I need a way to force a refresh of the page on First page-load only. Would be easy in asp.net, but I've no idea how to go about this in classic asp. Longer version: I'm trying to update a rather large application, and one of its problems is that when you log in, it doesn't yet store the necessary information into sessions unless you click a few specific buttons OR refresh the page... which causes problems when the customer tries to navigate the pages. I COULD track the sessions and set them manually, but I've failed in that for several hours now, so a forced refresh would be a lot easier. If only there's a way to detect the initial page-load so I won't cause a loop. Redirecting is out of the question as well, since the application has way too much code (all of which is practically uncommented and disorganized) for me to see how it actually builds all the verification checksums etc. Edit: Thanks for replies and sorry for the late answer. Got some good ideas from you guys. :)
