Area under ROC curve for random forest

Does the area under ROC curve depends on which class is defined as default positive class by the random forest model? I am using caret package in R to train and validate a random forest model. library("ROCR") library(caret) rfmodel=train(x,y,method="rf",trainControl=ctrl, ntree=500,tuneGrid=data.frame(mtry=c(2,3,4))) print(rfmodel) predict.rf=predict(rfmodel,testdata,type="prob") Now predict.rf has two columns representing probability for class 0 and class 1 respectively, which of this column should be used to calculate area under ROC curve. In current case, By default the tpr is defined by taking class 0 as the positive class. As I understand The ROC curve is a plot between tpr and fpr . Does the ROC curve and AUC change if I define the positive class as 1 and accordingly tpr and fpr will be swapped?
