Retaining an NSWindow size and state - looking for an elegant way to do this

I have a controller class which spawns a window when a certain condition occurs. This window can be closed by the user, moved around or resized. Ideally, when this condition occurs, I'd like the window to re-open in the same spot the user closed it last time. Looking for an elegant way to do this. Pointers (or references) will be most welcome.
