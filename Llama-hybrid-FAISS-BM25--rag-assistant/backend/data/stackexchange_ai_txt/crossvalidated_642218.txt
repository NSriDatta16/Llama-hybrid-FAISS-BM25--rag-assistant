Cross correlation between time series

I have to measure the cross-correlation between different time series in my dataset. The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors, plus the temperature in Celsius and the relative humidity (%). I have several questions: should I leave the time series as they are, or is it more appropriate to aggregate the data, perhaps by taking a daily average? since the sensors have different units of measurement, is it necessary to normalize the data before performing the cross-correlation? are there other things I should consider before applying cross-correlation?
