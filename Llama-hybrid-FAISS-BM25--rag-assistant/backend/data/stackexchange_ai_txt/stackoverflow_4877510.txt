The controls on the page have no clue who the other "children" are, so you can't automagically have them say "look, there is another control on this page. How are you doing other control?" without doing some work, normally through the parent container. There are mechanisms you can use to kludge things, but you still have to get the events through a common "container" like the page or master page. I am curious why you are raising events in your master page that require such intricate control at the child level. I would imagine there is a more elegant architectural solution.
