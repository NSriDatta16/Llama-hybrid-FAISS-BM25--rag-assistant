Why not look at using an open source OCR engine such as Tesseract? http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/ C# Wrapper for Tesseract http://www.pixel-technology.com/freeware/tessnet2/ Java Wrapper for Tesseract http://sourceforge.net/projects/tessocrinjava/ While you might not consider using a third-party library as implementing it yourself, there's a tremendous amount of work that goes into just integrating the third-party tool. Keep in mind also that something that may seem simple (recognizing the number 5 versus the number 6) is often very complex; we're talking thousands and thousands of lines of code complex. In the least, look at the source code for tesseract and it'll give you a good reason to want to leverage a third-party library. Here's another SO question that'll give you some ideas about the algorithms involved: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/850717/what-are-some-popular-ocr-algorithms
