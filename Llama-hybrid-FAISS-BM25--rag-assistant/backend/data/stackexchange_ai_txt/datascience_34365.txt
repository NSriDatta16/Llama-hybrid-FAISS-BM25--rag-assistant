Low number of inputs compared to outputs (per row) in neural network

I have data that one row has input of size 1x2 (two values) and output is matrix of size 15x3 (fifteen rows with three values) like that |-----------------| |y01,2 y01,2 y01,3| |y02,1 y02,2 y02,3| |. | |. | |. | |. | |. | ------- |. | |x1,x2| |. | ------- |. | |. | |. | |. | |. | |y15,1 y15,2 y15,3| |-----------------| This is one row and I have around 3000 inputs like that. Most values are real numbers except one output column that is binary (So output y$_{n,3}$ values are 0 or 1). How should I preprocess this kind of data? Is it of any sense to train two models, one for real numbers only and the second one for binary output? What neural network architecture would work best for this task?
