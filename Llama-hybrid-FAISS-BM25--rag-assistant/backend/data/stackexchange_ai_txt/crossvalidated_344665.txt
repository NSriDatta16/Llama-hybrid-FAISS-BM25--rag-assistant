Rob Hyndman's presentation on "Visualization of big time series data" might give you some ideas for how to proceed: https://robjhyndman.com/seminars/big-time-series/ . In his proposed approach, Rob Hyndman constructs a vector of features for each time series, where the features measure characteristics of that series: lag correlation, strength of seasonality, spectral entropy, etc. Then he uses a principal component decomposition on the features, and plots the first few principal components so that he can explore a lower dimensional space and discover interesting structure and unusual observations.

Roger Peng's article on A Method for Visualizing Multivariate Time Series Data might be useful too: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v025c01/v25c01.pdf .
