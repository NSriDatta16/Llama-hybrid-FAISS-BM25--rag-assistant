z-score using arithmetical mean or annual compounded return

I want to predict the probability of a specific stock market index return based on a set of 90 yearly returns. For doing that, I thought about normalizing the data and then use the z-score to estimate the probability. Is this the best way to proceed? When I try to calculte the z-score, I need to choose the average return. Should I use the average of yearly returns (11.3%) or the annual compounded return (9.5%) I fell like 9.5% is a much more realistic return and closer to want an investor will get on average.
