Some parts of the magento data can be imported/exported via the backend (System->Import/Export), namely products and customers. If you want to deal with the complete DB - use your DB tool of choice (I prefer mysqldump). When dealing with exported CSV.. use OpenOffice, from my experience it deals better with the separation characters than Excel. As for your second question - as far as I understood, you will have to develop a module if you want to do something different than the existing functionality and keep the original mail functions. If you don't want to/have to keep the original functions, you can opt to overwrite the module, which is much easier as far as I can see. Google search for "overriding magento module" should turn up atleast one decent tutorial.
