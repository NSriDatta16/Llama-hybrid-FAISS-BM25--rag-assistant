I think the best solution is defining the profiles directly in your pom.xml file for both CI specifically and then generically for local builds. Then the devs can override any profile settings in their own personal settings.xml file for local builds. This has the added benefit of not having to check-in a profiles.xml file which will not work for devs, forcing them to modify this versioned file and remember to not check in their changes. This also has the added benefit on making your build not dependent on a deprecated feature of Maven. After all, I would not count on the behavior of a deprecated feature in the first place. Hopefully this is an elegant solution which uses ideas from what you know already works.
