Is post-stratification inherently non-Bayesian?

It is increasingly common to employ regression with post-stratification . Since probability-weighting is incoherent in Bayesian inference (thus why sampling/survey weights and weighted psuedo-likelihoods are not used), post-stratification is used to infer treatment effects for populations known to differ from one's sample from a model with the available data. The gist is that you specify a model where a parameter (e.g. a treatment indicator) varies across other parameters (e.g. a multiplicative interaction with demographic indicators), calculate the expectation for each combination of parameter values, then get a "population-level" expectation by taking a weighted average of combination expectations with weights proportional to the known prevalence of those combinations in some population. Since this method assumes a "population" distribution of parameter values, is this inherently non-Bayesian?
