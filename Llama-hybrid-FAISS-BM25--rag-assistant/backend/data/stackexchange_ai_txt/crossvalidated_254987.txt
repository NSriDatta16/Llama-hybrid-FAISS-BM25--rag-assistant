Supervised learning with uncertain data?

Is there an existing methodology for applying a supervised learning model to a uncertain dataset? For example, say we have a dataset with classes A and B: +----------+----------+-------+-----------+ | FeatureA | FeatureB | Label | Certainty | +----------+----------+-------+-----------+ | 2 | 3 | A | 50% | | 3 | 1 | B | 80% | | 1 | 1 | A | 100% | +----------+----------+-------+-----------+ How could we train a machine learning model on this? Thanks.
