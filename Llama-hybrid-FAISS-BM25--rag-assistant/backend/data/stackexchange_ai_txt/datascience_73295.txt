Sometimes the kernel function is very difficult to choose in a fixed form even if once found it would be easier. It can be learned to map the data in a features space (Hilbert space) through an Convex Optimisation method such as Semidefinite programming, using Hyperkernels, etc. Some very usefull papers for your question can be found here: Learning the Kernel via Convex Optimisation Learning the Kernel Matrix with Semidefinite Programming Learning the Kernel with Hyperkernels Learning the Kernel Function via Regularization I hope that answers your question
