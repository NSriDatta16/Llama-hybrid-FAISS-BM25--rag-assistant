.NET, Java to JavaScript compiler

I am interested to create a drag-and-drop layout designer using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The designer will allow the user to drag the page elements from one place to another (something like Blogger 's layout designer) to create a site layout. But I don't want to hand code everything in JavaScript, I would prefer to write my application in .NET (preferably) or Java and rely on a compiler to compile it to JavaScript and HTML. What are the .NET or Java to JavaScript compilers that you have used and can recommend ? For Java to JavaScript I know GWT is available. What about .NET to JavaScript? Microsoft did come out with Volta , but the project seems to be no longer available.
