I rerun your analysis in SPSS (I don't have Stata, and I didn't rerun it in Matlab this time). The sweet pulp of your mistaken analysis is that you somehow managed to rotate eigenvectors , whereas rotations are normaly done of loadings . Please read my recent answers about eigenvectors/loadings and about rotations . Your first analysis extracted all 5 components. I can confirm (in SPSS) the eigenvalues and the eivenvectors you displayed. Then one would expect that you request loadings (which are the eigenvectors scaled up to the respective eigenvalues) which are: Component 1 2 3 4 5 V1 .943 .050 -.114 -.170 -.258 V2 -.078 .975 -.205 .041 .014 V3 .920 -.007 -.151 -.289 .218 V4 .844 -.118 -.267 .449 .037 V5 .595 .226 .766 .085 .021 Then this matrix after varimax rotation will be: Component 1 2 3 4 5 V1 .831 .247 .371 .012 .334 V2 -.014 .014 -.044 .999 .002 V3 .924 .188 .300 -.032 -.142 V4 .442 .124 .886 -.063 .027 V5 .215 .970 .107 .015 .021 Rotation Method: Varimax without Kaiser Normalization. with the rotation transformation matrix: 1 2 3 4 5 1 .760 .387 .513 -.050 .078 2 .018 .225 -.105 .968 .021 3 -.251 .884 -.317 -.235 -.011 4 -.595 .132 .790 .066 -.005 5 .066 .025 .038 .019 -.997 You rotated the matrix of eigenvectors, not loadings. We know that the eigenvector matrix in PCA is itself a special case of orthogonal rotation matrix. Its column sums-of-squares are 1, row sums-of-squares are 1 and cross-products of the columns are 0. Such a matrix, when it is rotated orthogonally to a "simple structure" - such as by varimax method - will inevitably turn into a very simple view like the one you got in rotated components table, with 0 and 1 values only. Each column contains only one 1 and each row contains only one 1 , but you may shuffle the exact position of the 1 s, that simple structure equivalently persists. For example SPSS varimax rotation gave me this in your place: Component 1 2 3 4 5 V1 .000 .000 .000 1.000 .000 V2 .000 1.000 .000 .000 .000 V3 .000 .000 1.000 .000 .000 V4 1.000 .000 .000 .000 .000 V5 .000 .000 .000 .000 1.000 Rotation Method: Varimax without Kaiser Normalization. In your second analysis you retained and rotated 3 of the total 5 components. Since you discarded two last columns in eigenvector matrix, the row SS were no longer 1 and so varimax gave you simple structure which consists of values fractional, not 0 and 1 . But the sweet pulp remains: you again rotated the wrong matrix. You ought to have rotated loading matrix, not eigenvector matrix. Also, in most cases it is better not to switch off Kaiser normalization when doing loadings rotation. P.S. Stata documentation clearly states it that pca function computes and rotates only eigenvectors. It does, though, compute and rotate loadings in a special post-function: Remark: Literature and software that treat principal components in combination with factor analysis tend to display principal components normed to the associated eigenvalues rather than to 1. This normalization is available in the postestimation command estat loadings ; see [MV] pca postestimation .
