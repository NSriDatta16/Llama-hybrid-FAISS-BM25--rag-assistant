Automate download of BusinessObjecs Web Intelligence reports

I'm tasked with automating the retrieval of a couple of BusinessObjects Web Intelligence reports and further processing thereof. I have no other means of access to this data (this was the first avenue I followed), so I will have to do some screen scraping. Alas, the interface seems user-only . Grr! Has anyone done this before? Like to share? Also, does anyone know of a good library for automating the web browser? I know there is a python thingy out there that can be used for testing web applications - I need something in .NET though... What is your favorite? PS: I have also checked this thread (automate getting report from webpage) , but am hoping for a Web Intelligence specific sollution.
