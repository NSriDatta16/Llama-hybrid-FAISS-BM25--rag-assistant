The point of the validation set is to select the epoch/iteration where the neural network is most likely to perform the best on the test set. Subsequently, it is preferable that the distribution of classes in the validation set reflects the distribution of classes in the test set, so that performance metrics on the validation set are a good approximation of the performance metrics on the test set. In other words, the validation set should reflect the original data imbalance.
