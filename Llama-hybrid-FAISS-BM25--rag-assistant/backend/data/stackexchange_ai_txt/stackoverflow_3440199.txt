Where is the ROWID fetched from when queried?

For example, if I do SELECT ROWID, name from emp where age > 30; As ROWID does not take any storage space, is it calculated every time a query like this runs? From here , Each table in an Oracle database internally has a pseudocolumn named ROWID. This pseudocolumn is not evident when listing the structure of a table by executing a SELECT * FROM ... statement, or a DESCRIBE ... statement using SQL*Plus, nor does the pseudocolumn take up space in the table . Taking clue from the comments, ROWID is stored when you create an index. Suppose I have no other index than the implicit one for the primary key ( emp_id ). In this case, will the above query go to this implicit index? How will the ROWID calculation happen? Please note that name and age columns are not a part of the index.
