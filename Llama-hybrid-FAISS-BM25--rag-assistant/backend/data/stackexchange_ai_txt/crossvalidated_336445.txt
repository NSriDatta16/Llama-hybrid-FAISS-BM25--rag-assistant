Statistical modeling is different from machine learning. For example, a linear regression is both a statistical model and a machine learning model. So if you compare a linear regression to a random forest, you’re just comparing a simpler machine learning model to a more complicated one. You’re not comparing a statistical model to a machine learning model. Statistical modeling provides more than interpretation; it actually gives a model of some population parameter. It depends on a large framework of mathematics and theory, which allows for formulas for things like the variance of coefficients, variance of predictions, and hypothesis testing. The potential yield of statistical modeling is much greater than machine learning, because you can make strong statements about population parameters instead of just measuring error on holdout, but it’s considerably more difficult to approach a problem with a statistical model. Update (2023) : As I think about this more, over time, I would like to add to my answer. Statistics is really the study of estimators. Any data-derivable estimator is a statistic. So to compare statistics with ML is like comparing the field of chemistry with a new subfield--- neochemistry---that also synthesizes chemicals. Maybe both fields work to develop a chemical for some purpose, like cleaning. Neo-chemistry might develop a cool cleaning agent. However, chemistry is still the study of chemicals. Statistics is the study of estimators.
