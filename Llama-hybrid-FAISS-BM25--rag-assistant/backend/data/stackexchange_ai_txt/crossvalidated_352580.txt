You could write the equation in terms of indicator functions for a single decision tree. Consider the following simple example: $y = 1$ if $x $y = 2$ if $5 \leq x \leq 10$ $y = 3$ if $x > 10$ Then you could express the function as $$y = 1 \times I(x 10)$$ This wouldn't generalize to ensemble methods like Random Forest, though, as noted in the comments above. It also doesn't accomplish anything that is not already expressed in pretty much any decision tree implementation; it's just a different expression of the same information.
