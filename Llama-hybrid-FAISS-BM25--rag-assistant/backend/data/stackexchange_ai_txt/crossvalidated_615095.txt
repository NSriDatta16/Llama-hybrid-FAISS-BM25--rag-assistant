As other answers here correctly point out, it doesn't usually matter. If the parameter space is continuous, and the method of finding the CI is "continuous" (e.g. sample mean $\pm$ margin of error; what I have in mind are CI methods where the endpoints are not 2 of the sampled observations), then indeed it doesn't matter whether it's open or closed. However, I'd like to make a case for why the convention should be "closed." If the parameter space is discrete, it does matter. Consider an integer-valued parameter, such as the unknown size of a finite population in a capture-recapture problem [1] . In that case, it feels much more natural and less confusing to say "We are 95% confident that the population size is between 93 and 106, including the endpoints" rather than "...between 92 and 107, excluding the endpoints." In other words, the closed CI [93, 106] makes more sense than an open CI such as (92, 107) or (92.9, 106.1) or whatever. Even with a continuous parameter space, some CI calculation methods just choose two observations to be the CI endpoints. Consider a bootstrap percentile CI. Conventionally, we include those endpoints as part of the CI to ensure our estimated coverage is at least nominal: if we're trying to get a 95% CI, we include the endpoints so that at least 95% of the bootstrap statistics are in the CI. (I know bootstrap percentile CIs are not guaranteed to have the right coverage! But this is what we usually hope they will do, even if they don't necessarily succeed.) More generally, statisticians tend to conventionally prefer theoretical guarantees that are slightly conservative: most of us would rather have slight over-coverage than under-coverage in our CIs. In this spirit, closed intervals are slightly more appropriate. [1] Edited to replace initial example (Poisson median, which may be questionable as per @whuber's comment below) with finite population size. Another example could be the unknown count within a finite population. If there are $N$ students in my class and I want to know $\theta$ = the number who would say "Yes" to a sensitive question, I could use randomized response to ask it in a privacy-protecting way. Then I may want a confidence interval for $\theta$ which has the discrete parameter space $\{0,1,\ldots,N\}$ .
