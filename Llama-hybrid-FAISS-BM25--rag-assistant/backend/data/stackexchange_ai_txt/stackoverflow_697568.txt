Formatting an SSRS report to not look terrible in Firefox

I've got an SSRS report that I'm dynamically writing to an HTML page. The report looks great in IE, but it keeps none of its formatting in Firefox. I've done a bit of research on this, and found that I can insert rectangles inside of all of my matrix data fields, which will keep the formatting. This seems to me like a lot of work for something that I'm sure someone has solved more elegantly before. I've also tried messing with the CanGrow and CanShrink properties of the matrix. No help. Thanks in advance!
