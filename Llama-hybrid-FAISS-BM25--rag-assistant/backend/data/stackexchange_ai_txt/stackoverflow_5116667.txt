If you are passing those constants into routines as reference parameters or by pointer, then there may be a damn good reason for those warnings. How do you know that those routines won't modify your "constants"? What is that gonna screw up in the rest of your code, which you told that those variables won't ever change? If you really know for sure that what you are doing is safe, and there is no good way to recode things to get rid of the warning, you can turn some warnings off in gcc using pragmas . Do this for as small an area of code as possible, and comment why you are doing it. Do not abuse this privelege, or you are liable to arrested by the code police and sentenced to 9 months of community service coding in Ada. That'll cure you of ever complaining about C's warnings again.
