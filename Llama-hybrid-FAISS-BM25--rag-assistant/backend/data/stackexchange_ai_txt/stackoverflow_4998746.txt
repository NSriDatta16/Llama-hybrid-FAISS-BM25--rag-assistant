I know that Microsoft's ODBC Driver for Oracle didn't support any of the LOB types-- I would wager that its OLE DB Provider didn't either given the error. Can you upgrade to the Oracle OLE DB Provider? As an aside, since you are migrating from SQL Server to Oracle, do you really need to use the NCLOB data type? Since Oracle allows the database character set to be Unicode, you normally don't need (and don't want) to use the NVARCHAR2 or NCLOB data types unless you're stuck supporting an old database that requires a non-Unicode character set. For data that is English or Western Eurpoean in nature, storing data in a CLOB has substantial benefits in terms of storage space since the CLOB would store the data in UTF-8 rather than UTF-16 in an NCLOB (assuming that you picked a Unicode character set for the database). Eliminating the NVARCHAR2 and NCLOB columns also tends to make it much easier for front-end tools to handle the data.
