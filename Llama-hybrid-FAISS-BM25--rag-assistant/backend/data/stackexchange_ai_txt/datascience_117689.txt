error useing soft max gives outputs greater than 1

I am using Hugging Face AutoModelForSequenceClassification, model is roberta, using it for text classification. There are 3 classes. The output is: [-3.7550,-4.4172,7.8079] I need to convert this to probabilities should I apply soft max to this to get the probabilities , if i do that i am getting outputs greater than one [9.51,4.90,0.99]
