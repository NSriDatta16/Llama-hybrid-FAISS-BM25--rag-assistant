A feature is still right-skewed after log scaling. How should it be normalized for machine learning?

I've attached two images below of a heavily right-skewed feature - call it x . I log scaled x , but it is still right-skewed and still has several outliers. What does this suggest about the type of distribution of this variable? And what transformations should be done on this feature for effective modeling? (I tried two levels of log scaling - see below.)
