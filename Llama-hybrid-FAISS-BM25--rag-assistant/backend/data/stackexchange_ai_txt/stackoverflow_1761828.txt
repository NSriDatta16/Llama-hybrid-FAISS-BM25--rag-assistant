The mailx command can be used to send email non-interactively, but the classical implementation talks to a local mail transport agent. There are simple MTAs which will just send email through a remote SMTP server, and won't accept any local email. Another solution is to use heirloom-mailx , (formerly known as nail I think) which supports talking to an SMTP server directly instead of using a local MTA. For instance, you may invoke it as follows: heirloom-mailx -S smtp=smtp.your-isp.com \ -S from=you@your-isp.com \ -s "subject"
