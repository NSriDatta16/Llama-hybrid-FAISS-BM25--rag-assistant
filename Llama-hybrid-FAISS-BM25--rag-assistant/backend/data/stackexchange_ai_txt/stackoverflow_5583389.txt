Equations for outputs of nodes in hidden and output layers of a Neural Network

Hey guys, I'm new to neural networks.. I want to know how to come up with equations for outputs of nodes in the hidden and output layers of a neural network. I would like to know the answer to the below and how you did it. I haven't been able to find any approchable reading material on this either. Assume I have a binary classification problem. Assume that I have a multi-layer neural network with one hidden layer. Assume that I have a sigmoid activation function given by f(x)=1/(1+e^-z) . Does anyone know how I find the equation for the output of the nodes in the hidden layer and the output of the nodes in the output layer? Thanks guys, any help would be great.
