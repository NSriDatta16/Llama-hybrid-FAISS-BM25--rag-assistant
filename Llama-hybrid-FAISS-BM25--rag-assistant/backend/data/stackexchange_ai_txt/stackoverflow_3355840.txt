you could look into caching technologies like APC which lets you write stuff right into the RAM so that you can access it fast which of use if you dont want to do expensive tasks like mysql queries repeatedly. an example for caching i could think of would be that you could cache emails rather than retreiving them again and again from the email server. basicaly ram caching is a very useful technique if you have things in your script that you want to preserve for the next time of script execution but if your script does unique things every time it is executed it would be useless. also as for contoll you could call memory_get_usage() on each script execution and write that value into the apc cache so that every cron could retreive that value and look whether enough memory is free for it to complete. as for average usage you could write an array with the last lets say 100 function executions and when you call that function again it could apc_fetch that from the ram and calculate the average memory usage for that function then compare it to how much ram is being used right now and then decide wheter to start. furthermore it could write that estimate into the current memory usage variable to prevent other scripts from being run. at the end of that function you subtract that amount from the variable again. tl;dr: look into the apc_fetch, apc_store and memory_get_usage functions
