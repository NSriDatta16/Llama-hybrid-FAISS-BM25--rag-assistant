Why don't you just serve up the cached page directly instead of passing it through PHP? Save your cached file as [request_name]_cache.html then use mod_rewrite to serve the cached HTML directly if it exists: RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_URI}_cache.html -f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1_cache.html If you're already leveraging mod_rewrite directly you might need to adjust this. Also if you change the data in the db, don't forget to delete the cached page.
