Interpreting PCA scores

Can anyone help me in interpreting PCA scores? My data come from a questionnaire on attitudes toward bears. According to the loadings, I have interpreted one of my principal components as "fear of bears". Would the scores of that principal component be related to how each respondent measures up to that principal component (whether he/she scores positively/negatively on it)?
