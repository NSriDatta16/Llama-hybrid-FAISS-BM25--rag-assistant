Variances add, and therefore subtract?

Variances add, so va + vb = vc. If I know what va and vc are, can I estimate vb by vb = vc - va ? More specifically, I have a noisy statistical time series which consists of the pure signal plus noise. If I know the variance for the whole noisy signal, and for the pure signal, can I subtract to obtain the variance for the noise? Edit: I ask because textbooks say that the variance of difference between two variables is also their sum, ie vb = vc + va. This is incompatible with va + vb = vc. They cannot both be right. What is the solution to this paradox, assuming that they are independent?
