I am not sure if this is what you want, but you can add new wizards to Eclipse using the org.eclipse.ui.newWizards extension point. Here is the corresponding documentation in Eclipse help . Another (less elegant) way of doing this is to add your own templates (e.g. DAO) under the Java editor (Window->Preferences->Java->Editor->Templates) so when you type DAO and Ctrl + Enter it, it expands to the full template you want. This way creating a new empty file, typing DAO and autocompleting would transform into a full file snippet. Hope it helps!
