Predict using a saved regression model

I have trained an ANN model for a regression problem which takes 10 parameters as input and gives 1 output. After training, I saved the model as json and weights as a .h5 file using keras. Now I want to make predictions on the new data. I have loaded the model and my question here is how do I scale this single row of input values, before feeding it to the model? Some of the machine learning algorithms did not require scaling(Standardization/Normalization) So I could load those models and used for making predictions. How do I do in an ANN model, since we scale the data for training?
