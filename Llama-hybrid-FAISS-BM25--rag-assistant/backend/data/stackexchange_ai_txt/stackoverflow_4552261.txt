optimize does not get rid of excess baggage, it just act like window-defragmented to clean disk-space for bulky delete - details . If you update with a string with 30 length, mysql just store as what is it, nothing more and nothing less if you update a string with 51, the last character will be chopped/truncated that is no optimal string size for varchar , is much depended on your application usage, and how you work with mysql index. The maximum varchar(255) still stay at string at length of 255
