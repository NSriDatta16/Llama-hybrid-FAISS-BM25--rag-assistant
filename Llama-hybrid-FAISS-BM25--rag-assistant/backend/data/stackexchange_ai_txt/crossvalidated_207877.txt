What is Response Surface Methodology (RSM)?

Q1: In layman terms (hopefully still accurate/correct), and in the light of my attempt below, what is RSM? Q2: Same question as above, but without " in the light of my attempt below ". You are free to explain RSM in layman terms in the perspective that you think is most healthy. Q3: Can I say that Artificial Neural Networks (or its variants, like Recurrent Neural Networks [or its variants like LSTM]) are just special-case implementations of RSM? My attempt (includes more questions): I am reading this: http://www.stat.ufl.edu/personnel/usrpages/RSM-Wiley.pdf I found this equation: $$ y = f'(\mathbf{x})\beta + \epsilon $$ where: $y$ is target classification/regression label (they call it response of interest ; is there any difference in calling it my way or their way?). $\mathbf{x}$ is a $k$ dimensional vector (they say $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k)'$; I guess $'$ means transpose to say that it's a column matrix? and it's only a common notational convention that's all? Am I right?) $f(\mathbf{x})$ they say it's a vector function of $p$ elements -- what does this even mean?: Is this a notational abuse? Did they mean $f$ instead of $f(\mathbf{x})$? Because in my understanding $f$ is a function and $f(\mathbf{x})$ is the value of function $f$ when given input $\mathbf{x}$. Does vector function simply mean that it's a function that its co-domain is a $p$-dimensional vector? $\beta$ is a $p$-dimensional vector too (they say a vector of $p$ unknown constant coefficient referred to as parameters ). $\epsilon$ is some error term that is believed to have a mean of $0$ (do we need to believe that it's mean is $0$?) I guess $f'(\mathbf{x})$ means a transposed vector? Am I right? Therefore $f'(\mathbf{x})\beta$ is essentially a multiplication of a $p \times 1$ matrix against a $1 \times p$ matrix? So the output is a $p \times p$ matrix? If $f'(\mathbf{x})\beta$ is a $p \times p$ matrix, then $$f'(\mathbf{x})\beta + \epsilon = f'(\mathbf{x})\beta + \begin{bmatrix}\epsilon&0&0&\ldots\\0&\epsilon&0&\ldots\\\vdots\\0&0&0&\ldots&\epsilon\end{bmatrix} $$ Am I right? If all is good, then $y$ is a $p \times p$ matrix! I don't understand why this is helpful. Did I make an error somewhere? Or is it that $y$ is modeled as a $p \times p$ matrix?
