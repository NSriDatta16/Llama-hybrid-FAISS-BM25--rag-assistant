Multi-classifier algorithm for ranking classes

My model should take students' info and achievements from the preparatory group and with machine learning offer the faculties (there are 7 of them) in which the percent of his success are the highest. I'm new to ML but I understand that this is a multi-classification. Can Random Forest or SVM handle such a task? I don't need only one "the best" faculty but rather to rank them from best to worst for each student. My data consists of 3500 students, 25 variables (haven't feature-engineered them yet) and 7 classes (the faculties, which are the target value)
