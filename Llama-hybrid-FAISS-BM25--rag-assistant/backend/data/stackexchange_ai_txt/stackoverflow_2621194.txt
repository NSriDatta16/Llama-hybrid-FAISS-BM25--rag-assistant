Detecting when a handler couldn't be started when embedding Jetty

I'm embedding Jetty in a similar manner as described here . When the RequestLogHandler can't open the specified logfile, it throws an exception which is unfortunately caught by org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server and swallowed (but logged first, at least). This means that there's no obvious way for me to tell if the log handler was started correctly. Is there a way that I'm missing to detect when a handler couldn't start?
