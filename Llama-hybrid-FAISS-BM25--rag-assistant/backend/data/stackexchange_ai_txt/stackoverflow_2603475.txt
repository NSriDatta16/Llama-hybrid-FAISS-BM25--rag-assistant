In the ugly pure javascript code world, your solution is fine. But only because you said "elegant", my answer is use jQuery. I'll write it probably closer to what it really would be, using behaviour-based code rather than event-based, so this won't EXACTLY match your code.. but, it would look something like: $('#Quote_app ol').click(function() { if ($(this).is(':visible')) { $(this).fadeOut(); } else { $(this).fadeIn(); $('ol', $(this).parent()).not(this).fadeOut(); } }); That attaches a click event to every ol element underneath something with ID=Quote_app, and if it's currently visible, hides it, and otherwise, shows it, and hides all other ol elements.
