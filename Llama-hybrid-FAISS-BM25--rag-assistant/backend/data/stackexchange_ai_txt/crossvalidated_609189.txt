Time-series prediction of 15 min interval data

I have 5 years 15 min interval of electricity demand time series with a datetime index and a target variable. Don't have any other data to use. I'm curious about your experiences. In general how far is it possible to accurately predict the 15 min electricity demand? Our client wants 1 year prediction, but as far as I know it is quite impossible. What is your experience?
