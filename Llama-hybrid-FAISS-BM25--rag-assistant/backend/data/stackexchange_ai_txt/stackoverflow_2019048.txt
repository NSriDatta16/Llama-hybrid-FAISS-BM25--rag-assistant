Cocoa - Whats the best way for modifying NSOutlineView

Result should be an settings panel with an OutlineView and "add item", "add group" and "delete" buttons. The buttons add entries to an NSOutlineView . The data is stored in a NSMutableDictionar y (or whatever is suitable). Sorting/DragDrop enabled for the OutlineView . What is the best or most comfortable way for this (and write less code)? Modifying NSMutableDictionary , NSOutlineView refreshes from NSMutableDictionary ? Modifying NSOutlineView , Result is stored in NSMutableDictionary ? ... NSTreeController ? ... CoreData ? What's best practice for that? Thanks in advance!
