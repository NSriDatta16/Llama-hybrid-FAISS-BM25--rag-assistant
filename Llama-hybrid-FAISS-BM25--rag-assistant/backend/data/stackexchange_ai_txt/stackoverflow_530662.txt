In Dojo or Javascript how do I make my event handler fire before other event handlers?

In the Dojo Javascript library, I understand how to use dojo.connect or dojo.publish to wire up my event handler to an event. That functionality works great. But I want to do one additional thing. I want my event handler to fire first, before any other already defined event handlers. I suppose this could be called "event handler insertion" or something. Is there a way to do that in Dojo or a convenient and elegant way in plain Javascript?
