I don't think there is a single answer to this question. It seems to me like it would be application dependent. If the application is a relatively lightweight dragon simulation that will never deal with more than a few thousand dragons at any one time, then it probably isn't a big deal to use a vector. If, though, it is a game involving millions of dragons, then it might make sense to optimize it slightly differently and maybe save a bit of memory and possibly shorten access time. But even that probably depends on the underlying class implementation. It is quite possible that the vector class you use could be optimized to handle a single element without extra overhead.
