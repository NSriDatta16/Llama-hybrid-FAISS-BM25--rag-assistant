Well, yes. That's a difficult task. But here's a general advise anyway. It would be easiest to use FPDF as backend for generating the PDF. But if you want you can read up on the PDF specification http://www.quick-pdf.com/pdf-specification.htm - you should avoid the newer versions, use an older format (like PDF 1.2) that's easier to generate. The file format is quite diffuse but not complicated. The primary problem you will face with XHTML to PDF conversion is that PDF is Postscrips little stepsister and demands positioned output. PDF does not support flowtext as far as I remember. You have to break up HTML paragraphs and position words or sentences individually on each page. This requires knowledge of the used fonts to calculate widths and stuff.
