It is one of the properties of ARIMA models, that the AR (autoregressive) and the MA (moving average) terms tend to "eliminate each other out" or "they work in opposite direction" (if you want to think about this in this way). Therefore a model (4,0,4) might be actually very close to (0,0,0) as the 4 AR terms "eliminate" the effect of 4 MA terms (depends on the coefficients). Although I am not able to give theoretical foundation for this, it is for practical purposes recommended to fit (if possible) either AR models or MA models , because mixing both parts may lead to the above described behavior. It is also a practical rule to not go (if possible) above order of 2 for AR or MA terms . I have faced similar problems and I also witnessed that if you allow ARIMA models with higher orders (>2) and both (AR and MA) terms, it is often the case that models of higher and higher orders will be fitted with better AIC criterion. It seems here that the AIC is not fully able to penalize the kind of "overfitting" that emerges here.
