I would say the followings: according to how you framed your questions all the 10 rating questions are the dependent variables. The only independent variable(s) is (are) the airline company or any additional field regarding that domain. Things change if you want to model one or more items as a function of others. Likert scales are ordinal scales in nature. However in most analysis they are treated as metric variables, especially if the sample size is large. I would to the following: to assess whether any airline influences significantly any ratings I would use a Kruskal Wallis non parametric test. In case it is positive, I would plot the average rating along with confidence intervals (based on t-test) to get a ranking of the airlines. You could do this only if the sample size is quite big and I'm aware it is not fully statistically correct from a purist point of view. However it could give you a quite reasonable and robust answer.
