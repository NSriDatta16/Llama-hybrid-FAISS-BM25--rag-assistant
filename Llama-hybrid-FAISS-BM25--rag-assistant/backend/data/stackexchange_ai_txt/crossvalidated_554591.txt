Is Gaussian Process regression appropriate to model non-smooth/somewhat stochastic functions?

I wanted to test using GPR in my financial modelling to see if it would do a better job than what I'm currently using (Random Forest), but I read somewhere that it is not appropriate for non-smooth functions and also for ones that are strictly non-negative and between certain values as is the case with stocks and currencies. Others argue that they would always use GPR over RF. Any thoughts?
