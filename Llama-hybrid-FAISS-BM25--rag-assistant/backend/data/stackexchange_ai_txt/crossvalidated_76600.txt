Fortuitous timing, as Bayesian Data Analysis , 3rd ed was just released. It's a good general-purpose text, with an emphasis on hierarchical methods, a section on advanced computation (that is, Markov chain Monte Carlo), and an appendix on Gelman's Bayesian inference tool, rstan. The text focuses on statistics rather than programming, though, so perhaps this answer does not fit your R needs. That said, I've been able to recreate the text examples in R simply based on his clear prose descriptions.
