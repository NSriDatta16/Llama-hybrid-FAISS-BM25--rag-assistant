Spot word in spoken sentence : advice needed

I have to make a live speech recognition program that can spot specific words in a spoken sentence . For now I have to recognize the words "yes" and "no" . I already trained Google's model and it worked, but only if the words were spoken apart. (The dataset they provide contains wav files of 1 second each, recorded at 16kHz in a PCM 16bit format of words spoken separately ). Since I want to spot the words in a sentence, I'm not sure the model they provide (cnn) is suited for this use case (is it?). I'm thinking about something more like LSTMs. So I have few questions: Is there a way to do it "simply" using convnets or something similar? Is LSTM the best suited network for this task? If yes, is it possible to use Google's dataset of separately spoken words to train a LSTM network? If not, what kind of network should I use? Any answer, even if not complete, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! EDIT: I realized that my post could be confusing, but really what I want to know is if google's dataset of separately spoken words is enough to train a network to recognize spoken words within a sentence . And if yes, what kind of network should I use ?
