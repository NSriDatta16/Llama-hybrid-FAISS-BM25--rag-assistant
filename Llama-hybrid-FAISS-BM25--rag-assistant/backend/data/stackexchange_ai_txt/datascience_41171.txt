Does image resizing lower the prediction accuracy of MLP?

I am implementing a vanilla neural network (MLP) to do image classification in python using tensorflow on images of honey bees to detect their health status. The images in my dataset are of different shapes and sizes, so I decided to do image resize using cv2. All my images are now of the same size (64 by 64) but some of them have been stretched/shrieked due to resizing. Does this have an effect on the low prediction accuracy I am getting from my MLP?
