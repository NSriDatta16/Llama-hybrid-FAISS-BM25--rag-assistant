Prediction with continued and categorical variables

I have a relatively big (50000 rows) dataset with 165 columns. The response variable is integer varying in the interval (200-900). The predictors are mixed integers and categorical variables. I try to decide what is the best method to apply for prediction since I need very low absolute error. Also the method is necessary to finish in a reasonable time interval (random forest with method=anova took over 3 hours and I had to interrupt it). I use R
