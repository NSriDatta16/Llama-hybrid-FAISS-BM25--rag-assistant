When the menu is not yet displayed, you can't get its dimensions. to set its position. If you set CSS visibility: hidden and display: none , the menu will not be shown but it will have its dimensions defined. Then you can get it's position using jQuery.offset and its height/width with jQuery.outerWidth/outerHeight (pay attention to the margin options for the latter functions). Oh, and be careful if you are using any negative margins, this would require special handling. Get the window's dimensions with jQuery(window).height() and .width() and you should be able to figure out the math from there.
