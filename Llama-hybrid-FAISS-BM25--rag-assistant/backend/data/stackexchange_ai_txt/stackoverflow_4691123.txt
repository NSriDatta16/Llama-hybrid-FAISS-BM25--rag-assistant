Information on developing WPF touch-screen application for Windows XP

I am currently working on the WPF project which involves creating a touch-screen application for Windows XP embedded. And as Windows XP wasn't built for touch interaction, there are some problems and issues with developing those applications. An example would be a click: On windows XP click is mouse down and mouse up event, however if you use your finger instead of the mouse, you might get a drag motion instead of the click, as when you press mouse down you finger might slightly move to the side from the initial position and you will get a drag instead of click. This is just a single example of the problems you get when developing an touch-screen app for Windows XP. If someone has been working on the WPF touch-screen application for Windows XP, could you share some knowledge and point out the pitfalls you have encountered or if you know of any resources on this topic, could you please share it.
