Neural networks need targets for training. If you have data for handwashing events and for other faucet activities but you haven't labeled them as handwashing/other then there's no way of knowing which flow rates correspond to handwashing and which correspond to other things. The most you can do is to perform cluster analysis to group data into similar sets. However, from this there is no way of telling which group is handwashing or if a handwashing group was even identified. If you had two groups you might get a group of data where people washed their hands or their clothes at a high temperature, and people who washed their hands or clothes at a low temperature.
