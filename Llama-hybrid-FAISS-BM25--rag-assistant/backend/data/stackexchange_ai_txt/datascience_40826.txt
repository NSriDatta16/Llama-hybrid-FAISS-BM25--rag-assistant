Find correct forms of a word

I'm trying to find all grammatical forms for words from a dataset. I'm new to NLP. I'm using a combo: spaCy (to get a base form of a word), word_forms (to get all possible forms). Sadly, it seems that they are not able to get everything right. Examples like 'wildest' or 'scariest' seem to be out of reach. Maybe I'm expecting too much (in most of the cases the solution works really well). Is there a decent tool I could use? I'm aware of nltk lemmatizer, its performance is worse than word_forms and spaCy. I'd appreciate some kind of advice.
