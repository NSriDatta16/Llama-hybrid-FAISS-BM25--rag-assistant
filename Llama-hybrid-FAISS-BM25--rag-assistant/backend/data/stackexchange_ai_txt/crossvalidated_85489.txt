As I understand it, you have multiple individual fish within each species. Each individual caught a certain proportion of prey. You want to model the success rate as a function of species, accounting for the fact that there were multiple individuals in each species, and each individual varied in ability. If so, there are, I think, three main approaches: 1) A nonlinear multilevel model, with species at one level and individual fish at another. 2) GEE (generalized estimating equations). 3) Accounting for the clustering with a sandwich estimator. My own experience is mostly with 1) which replace the usual logistic regression equation: $\mathrm{logit}(Y) = BX$ with $\mathrm{logit}(Y) = BX + u_{ij}$ where $u_{ij}$ is the effect at level 2 The difference between (1) and (2) is that (1) is a conditional model and (2) is a marginal model. (3) is an attempt to deal with the clustering by making the variance estimation robust. More resources: Multilevel modeling for binary data on (1) GEE analysis of clustered binary data on (2) (looks good from the abstract, I haven't read it) This thread here on SE about the difference I did see a paper on (3) at a Northeast SAS Users Group; Google finds it, but the link seems to have deteriorated (or it might be my internet connection that has).
