At the moment I obtain them by digging into the var.coef method. This reports the variance-covariance matrix and I take the square root of the main diagonal to return standard errors. vcov However this does not add them as a column corresponding to their estimates. Given it is typical to report coefficient estimates and standard errors, I expect there is a more elegant way than mine to do this.
