You will very likely not be able to publish such a labeling as a standalone journal article - it is simply too routine and does not advance scientific knowledge as such. If this labeling is done as part of a larger machine learning project, the contribution would be the larger project. If, finally, there was one person in a team whose main contribution to a larger ML project was labeling unlabeled data, this may be sufficient for coauthorship; especially if the labeling took a significant amount of time and if this person also actively reviewed the manuscript etc. This would need to be clarified with the other authors. It seems to be on a par with the question when someone is a coauthor whose main contributions were writing software, or doing the statistics. You may get better answers at Academia.SE . Consider editing your question to clarify what exactly you are asking and then potentially flagging it for migration. ( Please do not simply cross-post. )
