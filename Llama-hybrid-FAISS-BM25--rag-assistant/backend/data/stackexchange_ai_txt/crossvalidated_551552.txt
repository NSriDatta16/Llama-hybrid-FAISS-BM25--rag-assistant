Confidence Interval of an Average

Consider I have 20 samples from each of 10 batches resulting in 200 samples total. If I take a parameter I'm trying to estimate and calculate the confidence interval using all 200 samples pooled together I get a wider range than if I calculate the parameter average from each batch and then form a confidence interval on each parameter average. I understand that these are two different things. One is a confidence interval on the parameter and one is a confidence interval on the parameter average, but I'm having trouble knowing when to use each or the differences in application of each method. My intuition is if the parameter average is actually the parameter I'm looking to describe then I'd use the means batching approach and if the parameter is truly the variable I'm looking to describe then I'd use the pooled samples approach. My grasp of this is very weak; so if there are other implications between these two methods that I am failing to ask, I'd like some explanation on this as well.
