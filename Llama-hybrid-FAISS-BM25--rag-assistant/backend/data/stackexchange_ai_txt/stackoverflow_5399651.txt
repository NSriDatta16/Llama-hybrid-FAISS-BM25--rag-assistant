This caused me all manner of problems! Open the app.xcodeproj package and drag & drop the project.pbxproj file into text-edit. Do a search for "PROVISIONING_PROFILE" and delete the profile ID. restart xcode and build, hopefully it should pick up the new provisioning profile and forget about the old one that was causing you issues. Note: Be sure to do a backup of the project.pbxproj file before editing it.
