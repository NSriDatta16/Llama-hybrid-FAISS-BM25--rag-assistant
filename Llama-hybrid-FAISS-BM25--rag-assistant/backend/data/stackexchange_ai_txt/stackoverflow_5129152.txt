How to accomplish it may depend on what DB access library you use (BDE? dbExpress? ADO? others), some may offer a "stored procedure" component that may work with functions as well. A general approach it to use an anonymous PL/SQL block to call the function (and a parameter to read the return value), PL/SQL resembles Pascal a lot...: Qry.SQL.Clear; Qry.SQL.Add('BEGIN'); Qry.SQL.Add(' :Rez := ins_rec;'); Qry.SQL.Add('END;'); // Set the parameter type here... ... Qry.ExecSQL; ... ReturnValue := Qry.ParamByName('Rez').Value; I would not have used a function, though, but a stored procedure with an OUT value. Moreover, Oracle offers packages that are a very nice way to organize procedure and functions, and they also offer useful features like session variables and initialization/finalization sections... very much alike a Delphi unit.
