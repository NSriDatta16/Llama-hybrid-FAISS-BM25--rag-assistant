MCMC standard error when there is no CLT?

Suppose we use MCMC to estimate: $$ \mathbf{E}_\pi (h) \approx \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} h(X_i) $$ If a Markov chain is geometrically ergodic and there is some $ \delta > 0 $ such that $ \mathbf{E}_\pi( |h|^{2+\delta}) , then the CLT applies and we can compute the standard error. What if the CLT does not apply? Is it still possible to compute the standard error of the MCMC estimate? And if so, how?
