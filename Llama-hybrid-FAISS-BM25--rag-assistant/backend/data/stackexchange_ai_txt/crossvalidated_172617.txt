Clustering a dense dataset

Problem: I am figuring out the best way to find clusters for a dataset with observations that are densely packed together. The dataset is retail stores with three numeric variables based on operations metrics. I do not know how to create a simulated dataset for an example like this. I have densely clustered data and outliers, but under 4k observations. Business objective: We need to separate the dataset into groups based on several variables. The goal is to narrow down the stores with greater priority. Later on, we will use inference statistics for determining the cause of the operation metrics stated. Segmenting the stores based on priority makes sense through the three operations variables included. I tried two different types of partitioning clustering methods, k-values, and different variables, but all yeilded poor validation results. Hereâ€™s the steps I took: Clustering with 2/3 variables: Standardize in daisy dissimilarity matrix with euclidean distance daisy() function from cluster package in CRAN. Chose k for k-means by looking at SSE chart kmeans() function. Chose k for k-medoid by pamk() function in fpc package in CRAN for highest average silhouette width among clusters - resulted in a 0.23 average silhouette width. K-medoid was used with the pam() function from cluster package in CRAN. Choose clustering algorithm by dunn-index - highest clustering result was k-medoids with 0.002. I used the cluster-stats() function in fpc . Clustering with all three variables: -same procedure as above. Result: K-medoids with 2 clusters using two variables represented the algorithm with the highest dunn-indes. Overview: After selecting the optimal number of clusters for each clustering method and comparing the best one using dunn-index, the results have overlap. What is the recommended method for performing cluster analysis on densely clustered datasets? Do I need to perform clustering multiple times in order to segment the data further? EDIT: Added scatterplot showing clustering with 3 variables
