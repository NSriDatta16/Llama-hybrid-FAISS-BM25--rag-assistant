I agree that of the three options you considered, ordinal regression is the most appropriate one, for the reasons you gave. In fact, if the distances between neighboring SI categories are all the same, an ordered logistic regression (proportional odds) model could be a very good choice. If the SI bins are unevenly spaced, the best approach may actually be to relabel the bins with their midpoint SI values and treat this as a continuous dependent variable, e.g. by performing a simple linear regression.
