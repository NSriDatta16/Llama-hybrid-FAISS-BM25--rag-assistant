There are times when awk is not the answer. There are also times when scripting languages are not the answer, when you are just plain better off biting the bullet and dragging down your copy of K&R and hacking some C code. If your operating system implements pipes using concurrent processes and interprocess communications, as opposed to big temp files, what you might be able to do is write an awk script that reformats the line, to put the selector field at the beginning of the line in a format easily readable with scanf(), write a C program that opens the 25 files and distributes lines among them, and the pipe the awk script output into the C program.
