classifier4J with compound words

I'm using the BayesianClassifier class to classify spam. The problem is that compound words aren't being recognized. For instance if I add led zeppelin as a match, a sentence containing it won't be recognized as a match even though it should. For adding a match I'm using addMatch() of SimpleWordsDataSource And for asking for a match I'm using isMatch() of BayesianClassifier Any ideas on how to fix this? Ok, thanks for the insight. I'm attaching more source code. SimpleWordsDataSource wds = new SimpleWordsDataSource(); BayesianClassifier classifier = new BayesianClassifier(wds); wds.addMatch("queen"); wds.addMatch("led zeppelin"); wds.addMatch("the beatles"); classifier.isMatch("i listen to queen");// it is recognized as a match classifier.isMatch("i listen to led zeppelin");// it is NOT recognized as a match classifier.isMatch("i listen to the beatles");// it is NOT recognized as a match Now I'm using the teachMatch method of BayesianClassifier and I've got different results. A sentence containing led zeppelin it is classified as a match, which is ok. But a sentence including led it is also classified as a match, which is wrong. Here's the relevant code: BayesianClassifier classifier = new BayesianClassifier(); classifier.teachMatch("led zeppelin"); classifier.isMatch("I listen to led zeppelin");//true classifier.isMatch("I listen to led");//true
