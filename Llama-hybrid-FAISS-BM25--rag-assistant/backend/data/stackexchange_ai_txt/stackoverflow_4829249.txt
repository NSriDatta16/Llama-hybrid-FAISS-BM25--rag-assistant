i think i read somewhere that it is more difficult to add table rows to an existing table. it had something to do with some browsers adding a tbody tag for you and other browsers not liking a tr tag that doesn't have a table tag wrapped around it (ie). if possible, you could convert your table to divs (or possibly lis) then i think you could get around this issue. i think jQueryUI's draggable has this limitation, not sure. if moving away from tables is not possible, you can probably hide the row, then instantaneously move the row to position, and create a div that looks just like it and move that around, then after the animation you kill the animation div and show the new row. hth
