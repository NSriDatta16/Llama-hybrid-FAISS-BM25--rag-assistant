Can arbitrary precision calculations be useful for machine learning?

Regarding machine learning methods but dealing with arbitrary floating-point precision. It sounds cool to me but I am unsure if this would be of any use... Did anyone ever encountered cases where, for example, a logistic regression task needs to be carried out with an extremely high precision? Can it make sense? I am looking for opinions from ML experts. Edit: If not arbitrary high , maybe quadruple precision could be useful?
