Find suitable locations using Machine Learning

Just for fun, I am currently trying to find suitable locations to deploy new stores. So what I did so far is to take the actual sites of current stores and to assign surrounding variables to it. These features include for example: point of interest density, population density, region popularity etc. In total I have 9000, 100 dimensional points. 1000 of these points contain stores already, the remaining 8000 do not. In the next step I want to perform dim reduction using PCA. However, I am not sure how to proceed afterwards. Should I try to cluster the points? Or how can I „predict“ which of the points are suitable candidates for new stores? Maybe using some kind of skip gram model? Hoping to get some advise:) Cheers, Tom
