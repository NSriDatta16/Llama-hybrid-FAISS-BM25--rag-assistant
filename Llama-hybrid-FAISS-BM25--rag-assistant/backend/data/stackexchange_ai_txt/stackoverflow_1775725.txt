your input coordinates seem to be in wrong notation. it should probably be 45°05.5' 6°01.4' ( degrees ° arcminutes '), or 45°05'5" 6°01'4" (degrees° arcminutes' arcseconds") once you figured out the correct input notation, you can use Parsing latitude and longitude with Ruby for converting them to decimal degrees. if your input notation is degrees° arcminutes', you have to modify it slightly. also pay attention to negative coordinates. if you only want to use it with google maps, you don't actually need to convert it, because google maps understands arcminutes/-seconds notation .
