Making cgi.FieldStorage Store User Inputs?

I wrote a simple Python CGI script but it has a bug : #!/usr/bin/python2.7 import cgi,sys,random sys.stderr = sys.stdout num1 = random.randrange(1,11) num2 = random.randrange(1,11) answer = num1 + num2 print("Content-type: text/html\n") print(" %d + %d : ") % (num1,num2) print(""" Answer: """) form = cgi.FieldStorage() try: if form["answer"].value == str(answer): print " Good " else: print " Wrong " except KeyError: pass The numbers regenerates each time this code executes and it can't compare the user input to the answer becouse cgi.FieldStorage does not store that input: PHP programmers use " session_start() " to do what I want to do : What about Python ? How can we do it? Edit : I'm really not sure if it is sessions or not .. what I just need is a way to keep what user has inputed so I can compare his answer with the correct answer
