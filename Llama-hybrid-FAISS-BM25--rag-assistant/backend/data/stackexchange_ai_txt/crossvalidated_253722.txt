Machine Learning Algorithm for Minimizing Simulation Error

I have a set of simulation output that has an error value associated with each trial, along with the parameters that were used. In practice, some of these parameters will be fixed by the environment while the rest can be chosen. These parameters are all continuous, and most have nonlinear relationships with the error. What techniques might be useful in selecting the values for the changeable parameters given the fixed parameters in order to minimize error? I am having trouble finding an approach that seems appropriate. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
