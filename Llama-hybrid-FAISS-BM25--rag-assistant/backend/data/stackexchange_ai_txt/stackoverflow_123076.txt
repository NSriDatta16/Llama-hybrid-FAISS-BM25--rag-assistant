I've had to do something similar before and what I did was use a double metaphone phonetic search on the names. Before I compared the names though, I tried to normalize away any name/nickname differences by looking up the name in a nick name table I created. (I populated the table with census data I found online) So people called Bob became Robert, Alex became Alexander, Bill became William, etc. Edit : Double Metaphone was specifically designed to be better than Soundex and work in languages other than English.
