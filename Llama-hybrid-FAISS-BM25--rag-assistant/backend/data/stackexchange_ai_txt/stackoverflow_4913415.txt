In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable statement declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value. In C# it is used to declare a variable of an implied type. Beginning in Visual C# 3.0 , variables that are declared at method scope can have an implicit type var. An implicitly typed local variable is strongly typed just as if you had declared the type yourself, but the compiler determines the type. The following two declarations of i are functionally equivalent: var i = 10; // implicitly typed int i = 10; //explicitly typed References: Variable (computer science) on Wikipedia var (C# Reference) var (JavaScript Reference on MDN) var (PHP Reference on Stackoverflow) What is the purpose of the var keyword and when to use it (ECMAScript version 3 or 5)?
