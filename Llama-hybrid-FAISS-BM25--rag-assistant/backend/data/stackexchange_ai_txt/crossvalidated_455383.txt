Can you help me derive PACF for moving average process MA(1)?

I am really lost with the task. Can someone provide literature or possibly the derivation for the following: Assuming that the best linear predictor of $X_{h+1}$ can be estimated as $\hat{X}_{h+1} = \sum^h_{i=1} \phi_{hi} X_{h+1-i}$ , compute the PACF $\alpha(2)$ of the moving average process MA(1) defined by $X_t = Q_t + \theta Q_{t-1}$ , where $\{Q_t\}$ is a White Noise with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$ .
