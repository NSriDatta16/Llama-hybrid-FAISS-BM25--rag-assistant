I am not clear on what qualifies as a single uniform report in your book but here is what I do. I use Maven2 for builds and with it you can configure a series of reporting plugins (including PMD, CPD, checkstyle, coberturba, etc). Maven will also auto-generate a website (site plugin) for your project which contains all the reports in a nice easy-to-navigate webpage format.
