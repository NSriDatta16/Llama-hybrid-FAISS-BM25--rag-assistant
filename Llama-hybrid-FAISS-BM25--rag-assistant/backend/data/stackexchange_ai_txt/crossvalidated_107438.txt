Since you were specifically asking for an interpretation on the probability scale: In a logistic regression, the estimated probability of success is given by $\hat{\pi}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{exp(\beta_0+ \mathbf{\beta x})}{1+exp(\beta_0+ \mathbf{\beta x})}$ With $\beta_0$ the intercept, $\mathbf{\beta}$ a coefficient vector and $\mathbf{x}$ your observed values. So if your coefficients are 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 and supposing no intercept (most likely incorrect, but for easiness), the probability of a purchase for a person who clicked ad 1 only is: $\frac{exp(0.1)}{1+exp(0.1)}=0.52$ A person who clicked ad 3 only: $\frac{exp(0.3)}{1+exp(0.3)}=0.57$ However, if the person clicked ad 1 or ad 3 but also ad 2 (if this is a plasubile scenario), the probabilities becomes $\frac{exp(0.1+0.2)}{1+exp(0.1+0.2)}=0.57$ $\frac{exp(0.3+0.2)}{1+exp(0.3+0.2)}=0.62$ In this case the change in probability is both 0.05, but usually this change is not the same for different combinations of levels. (You can see this easily if you e.g. use the same approach as above but with coefficients 0.1, 1.5, 0.3.) Thus, the importance of a variable on the probability scale is dependent on the observed levels of the other variables. This may make it hard (impossible?) to come up with an absolute, quantitative variable importance measure on the probability scale.
