Should I discard a feature whose max - min is smaller than 1e-5?

I'm training a neural network for regression. The input vector consists of $140$ entries. For each feature vector entry, I calculate both min and max over the training set. The difference max-min of some entries are smaller than 1e-5 . I understand I can normalize such feature entries by say MinMaxScalar . However, if the difference max-min is this small, can I discard such entries since they seem to be so insensitive?
