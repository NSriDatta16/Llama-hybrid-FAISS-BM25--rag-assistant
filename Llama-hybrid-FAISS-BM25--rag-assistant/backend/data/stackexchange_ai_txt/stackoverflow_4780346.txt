A lot of long time TextMate users are leaving TextMate land, actually. So, I'm not sure it's the right time to move to TextMate. Emacs and Vim both do what you want and more. If you can afford the learning curve it's definitely worth it. As for your question: View 2 text windows side by side You can have two or more windows for the same document. Assuming you are in a "project" right-click your file in the drawer and choose Open "foo.ext" in New Window . The two "views" contents are more or less in sync but doing cool things like columnar editing tends to break the syncing. Due to how Mac OS X manages windows, the new window will probably be too large/too small and/or placed in a less than useful place. I use ShiftIt system wide to manage my windows and in such a case have them the same size side by side. Double click on a variable and have all instances highlighted What do you use this for? Is this visual highlight or non-contiguous selection? Type ctrl w to select the word, then ⌘ e to make the word your search term, then ⇧ ⌘ f or Edit > Find > Find in Project… It will show all instances of the search term in another window. You can then "jump" to any occurence and do whatever you want. If you only want to jump from occurence to occurence, select the word then type ⌘ e then ⌘ g to jump to the next occurence. Another way is to type ctrl s , a little text field appears at the bottom of your window where you can type a word and see its first occurence selected in real time. Repeatly typing ctrl s will cycle through the occurences. Drag a file onto another opened Window You can drag & drop a file on TextMate's icon in the Dock. You can also right-click the file and choose Open with TextMate *or Open with…*. If you are in a "project" you can right-click and choose Add Existing Files… . Opening multiple files in TextMate will automatically create a "project" for you.
