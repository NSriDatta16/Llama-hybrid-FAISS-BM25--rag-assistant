Test that a sample is non-randomly drawn from a population with arbitrary distribution

I have a dataset in which there are about 500 measurements for a particular scoring metric. The data are normalized so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1, but the distribution is somewhat arbitrary. Here's a histogram: I have no a priori reason to expect a particular distribution either. And these data comprise the entirety of the population. Within this set, there are 11 data points of interest, as determined by a separate metric. These are indicated by the red lines on the histogram. It appears that the scores for these points in the first metric are not random, but are instead significantly higher than average (the mean score for these 11 points is ~1.43). How can I test that these 11 data points are not drawn randomly from the population?
