Find the optimal number of samples using sub-sampling

I want to run a simulation where I determine what the optimal number of samples are to derive a reliable estimate. Suppose I conducted a pilot experiment where I measured the average of user ratings for different products. For each product I collected data from 20 users. Now I want to run a simulation where I determine whether I can obtain similar ratings if I only were to obtain ratings from 5 or 10 or 15 people. I have thought of several approaches to run this simulation but was wondering if there was a standard approach.
