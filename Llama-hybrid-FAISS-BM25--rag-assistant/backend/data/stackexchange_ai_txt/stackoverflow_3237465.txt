I haven't done any Windows CE / Windows Mobile programming, but I have dealt with a similar problem ( CreateCompatibleBitmap failing with ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY ) in desktop Windows. Apparently, from what I've been able to tell from looking around online, Windows may enforce global limitations on the available memory for device dependent bitmaps. (For example, some video drivers may choose to store device dependent bitmaps in video RAM, in which case you're limited by how much RAM is on your video card.) See, for example, this thread . From what I can tell, these limits are determined by the individual video cards or drivers; some computers' storage may be effectively unlimited, others may have strict limits. One solution is to use device independent bitmaps instead, even though they have a slight performance penalty.
