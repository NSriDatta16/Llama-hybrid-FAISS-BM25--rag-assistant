Fitting a reduced-form MA(3) time series model in R

I am trying to fit an ARIMA model for a certain financial time series. I've used EViews for modeling, and have decided to fit a so-called reduced-form MA(3) model, where only the third lag is statistically significant. Unfortunately, I have not been a to figure out how to do this in R. All I can find is how to fit a regular MA(3) model, using either the 'stats' or 'forecast' packages. Can anyone please help me out? Thank you! NOTE: This is a cross-post from SO. The good folks there suggested that I use the argument 'fixed' for the arima{stats} and Arima{forecast} packages, but I can't figure out how to use it just from the documentation.
