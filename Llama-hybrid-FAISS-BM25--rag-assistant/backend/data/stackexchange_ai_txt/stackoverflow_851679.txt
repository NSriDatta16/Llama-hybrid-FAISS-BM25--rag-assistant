Saving an image in OpenCV

I am new to OpenCV, and trying to capture an image, and then save it to a file. I am posting the code for your reference, below. The jpg file is being saved, but it is black. // Capture the Image from the webcam CvCapture *pCapturedImage = cvCreateCameraCapture(0); // Get the frame IplImage *pSaveImg = cvQueryFrame(pCapturedImage); // Save the frame into a file cvSaveImage("test.jpg". ,pSaveImg); // A JPG FILE IS BEING SAVED // OF 6KB , BUT IT IS BLACK All of the functions are succesful. I have tried the above code in both XP and Vista - the result is a black image on both. Please let me know what I am missing out.
