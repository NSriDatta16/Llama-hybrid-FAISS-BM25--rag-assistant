What is the best way to pick the optimized configuration from this dataset?

I have about 8000 configurations in an excel sheet. each configuration has four scores as seen in the image below. I would like to choose the best solution that has the highest lighting level score, lowest energy consumption score, the highest visual comfort score, the highest thermal comfort score, and the lowest CO2 level score. I'm new to data science but familiar with Python. I'm hoping that someone who is kind enough to explain a possible solution to rank these configurations from best to worst. Also, I'm interested to know the mathematical algorithm behind of the possible ranking system.
