Where can I start looking to better understand how computers work?

I've been trying to figure out what computer field I want to go into later on in life. College is just around the corner for me and I've considered looking into Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, etc. Lately, I've been looking into computer security systems and exploitations of such (purely for educational purposes, on my own property). Unfortunately, it seems to me like 99% of the people out there have no idea what they're talking about. Oftentimes, it's just "run this" or "run that" or "you can find a program that will do all that for you" - no one knows how these programs work or what exactly they do. I find no fun or interest in using something that someone else created simply to call myself a "hacker" as most people do. In fact, I'm not even interested in hacking systems as much as HOW they do it. My question all comes down to this. I want to learn the ins, outs, ups, and downs of computers - everything from abstract concepts such as the internet and data transferral, to hardware. I want to know how computers store data (how the bites are organized, etc.) and what processors, etc. actually do. What is WIFI, really? Do computers communicate with light (something I picked up from a magazine that I read on a plane). I have multiple years of computer/programming experience, but so much of what I know about computers in general is very broad. Computers send packages of information back and forth between one another, each with a header and content. Computers are composed of multiple components, each with their own function (processor, video card, RAM, hard drive(s), etc.), which I have some basic understanding of already. etc. etc. etc. There is just so much to a computer and I don't know where to start. I'm sure some of my college classes will clear things up for me, but I'm so curious that I want to start learning as much as I can now. This question is probably all over the place, so please ask me to clarify when necessary. I'm a little jet lagged at the moment, but I tried to write my thoughts in the quickest, most coherent way possible (I could have completely failed in the process, though). Thanks in advance for any advice! Justian Meyer Please, feel free to edit the tags for this question. The current ones are terrible. EDIT: All these comments are making me excited :). So much to learn, so much to explore :).
