Specifically on the question of interpreting the result: you cannot generally pinpoint to individual variables contributing maximum variance. What the result of 3 components contributing maximum variance is this: there are 3 new variables derived by taking a linear combination of original variables which is found to represent maximum variance. This is a known problem with PCA: you loose interpretation power. The so called factors derived by combining different variables may not have any intuitive meaning. One recommendation now is to build your subsequent model (clustering) on the derived variables data. So rather than building clusters on 20 column data, you'll build it on 3 column data.
