Marginal effect in logistic regression greater than 1

I have a logistic regression and I calculated the marginal effects. Now I have a value for a numeric variable greater than 1, it's even greater than 2. I'm sorry that I can't give you a reproducable example because the data is private. I used the function margins of the package with the same name. I thought you can interpret the coefficient like this: If x increases by 1 then y increases by the marginal effect coefficient c.p.. y is a probability in the case of a logistic regression. Then I would argue that the coefficient has to be in [-1, 1]. Did I get anything wrong? If yes how do I interpret the coefficient? If no, what could have happened here?
