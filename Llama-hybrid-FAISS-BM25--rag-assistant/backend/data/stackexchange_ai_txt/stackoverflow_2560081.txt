If your SQL statement looks like this SELECT count(*) as count, a.name as name... you could use setResultTransformer(new AliasToBeanResultTransformer(YourSimpleBean.class)) on your Query . Where YourSimpleBean has the fields Integer count and String name respectively the setters setCount and setName . On execution of the query with query.list() hibernate will return a List of YourSimpleBeans.
