Java (Swing) - Drag two windows at once

How can I have one window move with another? i.e., I'd like a JDialog to follow a JFrame when the JFrame is being dragged. If the JFrame moves by (+5, +20), the JDialog needs to move the same. I've tried using ComponentListeners, but I only receive drag events in chunks which causes the JDialog window to be jumpy while dragging the main JFrame. I've tried using MouseListeners, but I can't figure out how to detect events on the actual frame of the JFrame.
