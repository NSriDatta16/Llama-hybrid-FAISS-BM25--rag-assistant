Difference between particle filter (PF) and recurrent neural network (RNN) for time series

Both method are used to estimate time series from data. The question is, when should I use one method or other? Is any advantage to use one instead of the other? I know that in a PF there is a hidden model with statistic significance, and for an RNN there is no need for a model (please tell me if I'm wrong), just training data. I've found some clues here
