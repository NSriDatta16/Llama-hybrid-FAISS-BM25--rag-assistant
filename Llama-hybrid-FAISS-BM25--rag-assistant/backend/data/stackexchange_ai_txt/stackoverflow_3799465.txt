Pass data to view controller from subview iPhone

Probably a simple question but I haven't found a solution. I have several view controllers with some sliders that when dragged, input numbers into a label. I also want to have a simple popup keypad enter numbers into this same label. I created a view controller called Keypad and when a button is tapped on the current view controller I do this: - (IBAction)callKeypad:(id)sender { Keypad *keypadController = [[Keypad alloc] initWithNibName:@"Keypad" bundle:nil]; self.keypadViewController = keypadController; [self.view addSubview:keypadController.view]; [keypadController release]; The keypad pops up with the current view controller still visible in the background. When I tap the numbers on the keypad I want the results to show instantly in the current view controller. I guess what I am trying to do is have one view controller send its output to another view controller. Thanks for any help.
