Elegantly replace iPhone keyboard with UIPickerView

I have a table view that has embedded UITextFields for entering some data. It also has two other fields that popup a UIPickerView and a UIDatePicker - as demonstrated in the DateCell example from Apple. Mostly it works but I can't figure out how to cleanly transition from the text field keyboard to the other pickers - one slides out, one slides in - it looks weird and the scroll position on the table view sometimes gets screwed up - with everything scrolled off the top. What I'd like to do is replace the text field keyboard without it animating away and without it growing the table view back to full size. Any clues?
