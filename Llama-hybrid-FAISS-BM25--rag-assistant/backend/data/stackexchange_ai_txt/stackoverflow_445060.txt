If you don't need specific invalidation features of ASP.NET caching, static fields are pretty good, lightweight and easy to use. However, as soon as you needed the advanced features, you can switch to ASP.NET's Cache object for storage. The approach I use is to create a property and a private field. If the field is null , the property will fill it and return it. I also provide an InvalidateCache method that manually sets the field to null . The advantage of this approach it that the caching mechanism is encapsulated in the property and you can switch to a different approach if you want.
