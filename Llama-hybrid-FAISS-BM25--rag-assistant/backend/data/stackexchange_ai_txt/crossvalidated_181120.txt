How many hidden layers should I use? How many neurons? In your scenario you have two inputs neurons and one output neuron. Hidden layers are a hyperparamether of the neural networks and the ultimate answer is by trial and error. I would start with 1 hidden layer with two neurons and grow from there by making the network deeper. What activation function? Start simple with a sigmoid function. I also suggest to normalise input and output in [-1, 1]. This is what Haykin, S. (2008). Neural Networks and Learning Machines suggests at page 146 of his book. Each time you iterate over your hyperparams check the performace of your prediction using some form of validation (Cross Validation over mean squared error) and iterate again
