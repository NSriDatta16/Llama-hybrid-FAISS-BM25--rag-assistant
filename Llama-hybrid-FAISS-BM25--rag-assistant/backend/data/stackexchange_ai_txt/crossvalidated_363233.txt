R - Trying to model cumulative probability over time with confidence interval

This is a combination of statistics and R newbie question. Right now I am working with a set of estimates of the probability of observing a certain event (with binary outcome: either it happens or it doesn't) on a given day. These estimates come with a standard deviation. For the sake of this example, let's say that's: p = 0.31 (probability of event) p_SD = 0.007 (standard deviation of that probability) When dealing with discrete days and a certain probability (i.e. without p_SD ), I know that if I ask the question "What's the probability of the event happening at least once over three days?", the answer is: 1 - (1 - p)^d where d = 3 (i.e. three days) However, the number of days is a continuous variable in my case, and my probability of event ( p ) is uncertain with p_SD . How do I model (in R) the curve that represents the increasing probability of the event happening as a function of time, while taking into account p_SD ? Ultimately, I hope to: (1) Plot that curve ("days" on x-axis, and "probability of the event occuring at least once" on y-axis) with shaded confidence interval derived from p_SD . (2) Be able to answer questions like "If I want to be 95% sure that the event will happen at least once, how many days do I have to wait?" Since the event is a binary variable, I am guessing some use of glm in R to do a logistic regression, but I can't quite put my finger on how. Is that the correct direction or is it something else? How do I implement (1) and (2)?
