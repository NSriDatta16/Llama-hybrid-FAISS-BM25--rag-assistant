Lock down placement of panes from Visual Studio

Ok, if you're like me, you've accidentally dragged one of the many, many panes in Visual Studio around and spent some tedious time getting things back in order again. Is there any way to lock down all the panes in Visual Studio so they cannot be dragged and placed elsewhere ?
