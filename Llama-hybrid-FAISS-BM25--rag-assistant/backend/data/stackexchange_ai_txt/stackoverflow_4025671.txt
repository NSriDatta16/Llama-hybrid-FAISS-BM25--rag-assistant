I worked on a JSFiddle for this, and what I found is that it can work as long as the target exists to drag to... http://jsfiddle.net/gfosco/fJVMk/ See how this works, you can move the links around and they won't get out of order with the windows... I added the UL and updated the class to have a min-height, otherwise there's nowhere to drop the links. JS: $('._lswindow').each( function() { $(this).sortable( { connectWith: '._lswindow', cancel: '._lslink' }).disableSelection(); }); $('._lslink').each( function() { $(this).sortable( { connectWith: '._lslink' }).disableSelection(); }); CSS addition: ._lslink { min-height:20px; } HTML snippet of one window with empty link container: window4
