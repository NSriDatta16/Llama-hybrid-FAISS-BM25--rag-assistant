I'm looking for answers to a similar problem (Handles Count increasing over time). I took a look at your application architecture and like to suggest you something that could help you out: Have you heard about IOCP (Input Output Completion Ports). I'm not sure of the dificulty to implement this using C# but in C/C++ it is a piece of cake. By using this you create a unique thread pool (The number of threads in that pool is in general defined as 2 x the number of processors or processors cores in the PC or server) You associate this pool to a IOCP Handle and the pool does the work. See the help for these functions: CreateIoCompletionPort(); PostQueuedCompletionStatus(); GetQueuedCompletionStatus(); In General creating and exiting threads on the fly could be time consuming and leads to performance penalties and memory fragmentation. There are thousands of literature about IOCP in MSDN and in google.
