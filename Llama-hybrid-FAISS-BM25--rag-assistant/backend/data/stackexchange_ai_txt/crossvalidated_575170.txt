When do ARMA models fail?

I have just started learning about Autoregressiveâ€“moving-average model (ARMA). On the Wiki page , it has been mentioned that: ARMA is appropriate when a system is a function of a series of unobserved shocks (the MA or moving average part) as well as its own behavior. For example, stock prices may be shocked by fundamental information as well as exhibiting technical trending and mean-reversion effects due to market participants. I would like to know what are the worst cases for ARMA models i.e. when one should definitely not use it. For example, if I want to use an ARMA model to forecast the value of sign wave, should it perform really bad since there are no shocks?
