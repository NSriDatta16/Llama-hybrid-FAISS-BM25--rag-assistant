So, instead of trying to explain every detail about the correct use of logistic regression, I'll provide some references that do a good job at explaining assumptions. Assumptions -- In order to build a good statistical model, you'll have to understand the underlying model assumptions, and ensure your data is appropriate. Given that your outcome variable is binary (survived: 0/1), logistic regression is appropriate. However, it seems you have repeated measures per customer, so each observation is not $i.i.d.$ (independent and identically distributed); this is assumption #3. You're probably fine if you address the potential assumption violation in a report. Otherwise, you'd have to use a different model or perform additional testing. See the following for details on assumptions: https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/binomial-logistic-regression-using-spss-statistics.php Interpretation: When you see your logistic regression output, your coefficients will be reported in the form of $\log \frac{p(y = 1 | x)}{1-p(y = 1 | x)} = \beta_0 + ... + \beta_p$ for the $p$ covariates you include in your model. If you are specifically interested in probably of outcome given your data, and do not want to deal with log-odds ratios or odds ratios, you'll have to do some transformation of coefficients. $p(y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-(\beta_0 + ... + \beta_p)}}$ Please see the following for further details: http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch12.pdf Finally, here is a worked out example in R: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm Other examples are available in other software if you do not use R. Autocorrelation My concern is that the yes/no survived in period X is dependent on the survival of the customer in period X-1. With that said, you want a logistic regression model with AR-1 covariance residual structure. If you are simply interested in population average effects (i.e. fixed effects), I would perform a Generalized Estimating Equation; these models are relatively straightforward and not too computationally intensive. Otherwise, if you're concerned with individual effects (i.e. random effects) you'll need to use a Logistic Mixed-Effects Model. These models carry more assumptions and computational convergence issues. Please see the next reference: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/glmm.htm Here is a worked out example with logistic linear mixed-effects: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/melogit.htm Hope this helps.
