AS3 Scrollbar content formula

I've created a horizontal scroller and now I'm stuck on how to calculate the position of the content when the scroller is at a position. private function checkDrag(event:Event):void { var procent:Number = (stage.stageWidth/(buttonLR.x+buttonLR.width))*(LISTmc.width) if (drag) { TweenLite.to(LISTmc,1,{x:-procent}); } //buttonLR width is also stretched according to how many data loads in, thats why I'm trying to target the center of buttonLR } A new content will be added from left to right everytime I click a button, so the scroller will be moving to the right end of the bar since its scrolling from left to right, and to show the latest content. So if I want to go back to the previous content I have to drag the scroller to the left. Currently my code after I load in a new content and I click on the scroller, the content will move till the end of the left side of the stage (right corner of content x=0), and dragging it will makes the content move left more.
