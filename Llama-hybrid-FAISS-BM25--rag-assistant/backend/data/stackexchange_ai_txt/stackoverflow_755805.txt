How can I set permissions on an RSS file?

I want to create an in-house RSS feed (I work for 3 Mobile, Australia) for consumption on an INQ1 mobile phone, or any other RSS reader for that matter. However, testing it out on the phone's built-in RSS reader, I realize that without the ability to password protect the feed, or otherwise restrict access to it, I stand little chance of being able to develop this idea further. One thing I thought of was to periodically change the Uri for the feed, so managers who had left the company couldn't continue to subscribe and see sensitive information, but the idea of making users do that would make it a harder sell, and furthermore is terribly inelegant. Does anybody know how to make it so that prior to downloading a feed, a reader would have to authenticate the user? Is it part of the metadata within the feed, or something you would set in the reader software? Update: I should have explained that I already have placed folder-level permissions on the parent folder, which brings up the normal authentication dialog when the feed is viewed in a browser, but which just results in a failed update with no explanation or warning in the phone's RSS reader, and is indistiguishable from the file being missing, when I next try and refresh the feed.
