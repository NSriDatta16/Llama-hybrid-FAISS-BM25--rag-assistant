On first impressions, I'm inclined to segregate data for locations which have significance (need not just be home, gym, office), from insignificant ones (travel, traffic) using continuous time spent within some radius buffer. Since you also have a lot of data, you could use neural network of your choice, from which you could get top 3 prediction. PS. Make sure that you don't encode locations as one hot vectors, location context would be lost if all vectors are equidistant from each other. I'd also consider clustering time chunks into labels, not as a continuous variable. Curious to know if this would follow Zipf's law as well.
