Are bayesian methods inherently sequential?

Ie, to do sequential analysis (you don't know ahead of time exactly how much data you will collect) with frequentist methods requires special care; you can't just collect data until the p-value gets sufficiently small or a confidence interval becomes sufficiently short. But when doing Bayesian analysis, is this a concern? Can we freely do things like collect data until a credible interval becomes sufficiently small?
