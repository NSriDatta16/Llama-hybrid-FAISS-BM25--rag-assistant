Since you can't wrap XAML in Try..Catch blocks , you will need to load the data source via code, wrap that in exception handling, and validate the data source is valid XML before binding it. You can catch unhandled exceptions too, I suppose, in App.Application_UnhandledException and it is not as elegant.
