Embed Excel Sheet into form

OK, I need to embed an Excel template document into a winform (retaining all the formatting), change some values, printpreview it, then print it to either PDF or a printer. And I need to do it without spending any of the boss's cash. I tried embedding the standard Excel COM stuff, but the IDE (C# Express 2010) didn't like it and crashed (the Office control didn't seem to do much and accessing an XLS in a webbrowser only worked occasionally) So I'm guessing that I'm looking at a third party open source Excel control? In fact theoretically it could be any grid-type format as long as I can do similar formatting to Excel and make it look all pretty for the client. Any ideas? Cheers
