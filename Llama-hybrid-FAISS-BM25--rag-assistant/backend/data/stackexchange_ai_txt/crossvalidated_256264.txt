Computing DIC and Bayes factor in R

How can I compute the DIC value and Bayesfactor value for a bayesian glm model? (for both models or even just 1 of the models) I have 2 models I would like to compare. 1. bayesglm model (using arm package) 2. logit model (bayesian logistic regression model using bayeslogit package) the explanatory variables are both continuous and categorical the response is binary (0/1) same dataset Both models give predictions of between 0 and 1.
