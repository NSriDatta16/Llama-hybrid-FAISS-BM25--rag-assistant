How do I indent elements? Example in details

http://htmlpocketreference.110mb.com/taggroups.html For the site above, how would I indent all the code. I don't want it aligned with the paragraph and headings. I want it to be one indent level in. You can check my source if you want and the css is embedded in the html already. Also, any suggestions on how to improve it? (Note: I'm not publishing the site, I'm just practicing on getting all the formatting right.
