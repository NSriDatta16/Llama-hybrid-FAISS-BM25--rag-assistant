Significant Mann-Kendall trend but Sen slope = 0?

I used the Mann Kendall trend test to determine the significance of the trends of the following time series data (sheet 1) and obtained a significant trend at 10% significance level for the month of April (autocorrelated) however, the Sen slope I obtained was zero. Similar results were obtained for other time series as well with a significance level set at 5%. I did the computations on R (modifiedmk package and trend package) as well as in XLSTAT (see sheet 2). XLSTAT was unable to compute the confidence intervals for the Sen slope for all the monthly data (Jan-Dec). I posted this question on various forums and the only seemingly logical explanation I received was on ResearchGate . But I am still unconvinced as I have not seen such a result in any of the papers that I have read on this topic. Can somebody please explain what's wrong here?
