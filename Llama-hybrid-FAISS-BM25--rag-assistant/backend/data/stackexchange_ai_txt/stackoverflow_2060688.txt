find a pattern on string

I am giving you an example for what I am exactly want. Example string: If you're on a work BES system (work issued BlackBerry most likely with a BlackBerry server) then the "www.blackberry.com" BlackBerry follows the Exchange servers rules (aka if outlook redirects your email to a folder, then so does BlackBerry). However, there is an email option that you tell your BlackBerry not to show messages in other folders other than Inbox. A web link is inside this paragraph. How can I find this Weblink (www.blackberry.com) from this paragraph in my C# application.and i want to find it any type of string
