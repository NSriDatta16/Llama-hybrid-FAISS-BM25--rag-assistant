A request with If-Modified-Since only makes sense if the client already has a resource which is obtained along with a response that has a Last-Modified header in combination with headers which allow browser caching like a Cache-Control and/or Pragma value containing public . Also, I've noticed that some browsers does not include If-Modified-Since when the original response also contained an ETag header. The browser will instead use If-None-Match to test it.
