I think because it then provides an input to logistic regression:so you get back p(good) as an output. Ie you use logistic regression to combine univariate odds estimates. If you have a single WOE input variable you get back the corresponding p(good) from logistic regression, but the aim is to create an combined estimate using all the factors (gender, age bucket etc). It's not how I would create a multivariate prediction (since you are averaging univariate estimates) but I guess the idea is to develop an understandable prediction.
