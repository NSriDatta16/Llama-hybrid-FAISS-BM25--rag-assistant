How to plot correlation coefficient vs distance between weather stations

I've looked but didn't find an answer. I need to make a Correlation Coefficient VS Distance (in Km) plot between 9 weather stations. Something that would look similar to the following figure: But because of the enormous distance between one station and the others, I need to make this plot with a logarithmic scale in the X axis, so as not to see the rest of the stations stuck together. To do this, I have a time series of daily minimum temperature on 9 weather stations between the period 1980-2016. The .csv file with the data looks like this: And the location of all the weather stations is in another .csv file that looks like this: I know some R, Python and Mathematica so if you can help me in any of these languages that would be nice.
