A framework is essentially a foundation for applications. Which means the following: If you build your application on a framework, it can't be separated from it: there is a dependency to that framework. The framework provides all that is necessary for your application to run. It handles about everything a typical application needs. (Think of: (internal) data storage, output and input) Zend for PHP is a framework for creating internet applications. It has a lot of modules, which will help you build your application more productive. The difference between a framework and a plain library is that a framework often consists of multiple libraries which need each other to function properly. An example of a framework you probably have used: Windows. The Windows platform provides a set of libraries for you to use, but those libraries need each other too to function properly, e.g. the library for letting applications play video-files needs the library for outputting pixels on your screen.
