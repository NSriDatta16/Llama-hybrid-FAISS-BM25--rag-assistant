Adding more things to what @Solomonoff'sSecret have mentioned: Instead of Dropout, try L2 regularization model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=64, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01), activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(0.01))) Remove dense layers from last and instead try global average pooling. keras.layers.GlobalMaxPooling2D(data_format=None) Try different optimizer like SGD Try removing the last dropout, which is just before the softmax. I think it's forcing your network to a very large extent to generalize. Wild guess, accuracy in validation of 50% suggest model is predicting almost everything as a single class. Check quality of the image in the validation set and try to compare it with the training one. Use Cross-validation here instead.
