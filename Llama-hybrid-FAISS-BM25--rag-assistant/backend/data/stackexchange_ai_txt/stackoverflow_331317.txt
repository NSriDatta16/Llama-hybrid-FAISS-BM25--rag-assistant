Anytime you're changing the headers of an HttpWebRequest , you need to use the appropriate properties on the object itself, if they exist. If you have a plain WebRequest , be sure to cast it to an HttpWebRequest first. Then Referrer in your case can be accessed via ((HttpWebRequest)request).Referrer , so you don't need to modify the header directly - just set the property to the right value. ContentLength , ContentType , UserAgent , etc, all need to be set this way. IMHO, this is a shortcoming on MS part...setting the headers via Headers.Add() should automatically call the appropriate property behind the scenes, if that's what they want to do.
