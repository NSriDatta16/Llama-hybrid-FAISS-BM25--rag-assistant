Games like CafeWorld, FarmVille, YoVille and others use a 3-tier architecture. The flash application being a fat(ish!) client with some logic built into it, using data stored on the server, a middle layer which sources the data interface and handles validation rules (such as not being able to use two stoves at once) and a persistence layer which handles the storage of data. A state is maintained by the client, but the important part is that the client can't write state to the server, only events on the client can trigger changes in the server (middle layer). In this way the middle layer and client both maintain separate timings which are synced at intervals. When these intervals do not line up you will notice in games like FarmVille that you get a message notifying you that the "Game is out of sync".
