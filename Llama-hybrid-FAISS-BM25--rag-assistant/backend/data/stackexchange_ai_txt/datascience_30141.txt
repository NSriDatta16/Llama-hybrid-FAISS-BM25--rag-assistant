Are all classifiers linear in some high dimensional space?

Of all possible classifiers (including SVMs, locally weighted regression, softmax regression, lots others I'm sure I don't know about, etc.), are they all linear in some high dimensional space? E.g. An SVM with a Gaussian kernel is linear in infinite-dimensional space.
