Incorporating seasonality into CART models

The problem I am trying to solve it predicting sales for an item for the next $n$ weeks. Obviously, seasonality is a major factor for such predictions. If we use a time series based model, then we generally produce a raw forecast and multiply the raw forecast by the seasonality indices. If we use CART to produce such forecasts, then how to we incorporate such seasonality factors into the model? Can they be new variables for the model?
