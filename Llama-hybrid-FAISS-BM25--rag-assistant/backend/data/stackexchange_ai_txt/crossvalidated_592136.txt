What do LLNs say? At the risk of getting too oversimplistic, for independent sequence $\langle X_i\rangle_{i\in\mathbb N},$ they say the partial sum (or average, precisely) $$\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+\ldots+ X_n) \tag 1$$ converges to common mean $\mu$ in certain sense provided second moment or forth moment be finite and uniformly bounded depending on what convergence one is bothered with. When $\rm i.i.d.$ is imposed, only the first moment needs to be finite. What is Wikipedia saying? It is only saying form like $$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i -n\times \bar X$$ doesn't make sense for not only does it not converge toward zero as $n$ increases, but it tends to increase in absolute value as $n$ increases. Finally as Xi'an noted in the comments , be careful with indexing set and limiting variable. Further Read: $\rm [I]$ A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory, Jeffrey S.
