How to do a logistic regression with the results of different factor analysis methods

I have a large amount of variables (24) to predict a Y/N value, and I would like help for writting a procedure that automatically tries the different results of the factor selection to see how good the regression turns out to be, and of course I want to save the best model for later use.
