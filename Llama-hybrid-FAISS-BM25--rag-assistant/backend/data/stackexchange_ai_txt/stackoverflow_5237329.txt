The simplest way would be to make your scripts stored procedures, and to call (via the EXECUTE command) each procedure in turn from a central procedure. This is ideal if you're going to run the exact same script(s) over and over again (or the same script with different parameters passed in). If your scripts are .sql (or any kind of text) file, as @Abe Miesller says (upvoted) you can run them from within SSMS via the :r command, when SQLCMD mode is enabled. You would have to know and script the exact file path and name. This cannot be done from within a stored procedure. A last alternative, usable with "known" file names and necessary for arbitrary file names (say, all files currently loaded in a subfolder) is to leverage the power of extended procedure XP_CMDSHELL . Such solutions can get compelx pretty fast (use it to retrieve list of files, build and execute via xp_cmdshell a string calling SQLCMD for each file in turn, manage results and errors via output files, it goes on and on) so I'd only do this as a last resort.
