This answer is partially wrong. You can indeed combine Monte Carlo methods with gradient descent. You can use Monte Carlo methods to estimate the gradient of a loss function, which is then used by gradient descent to update the parameters. A popular Monte Carlo method to estimate the gradient is the score gradient estimator , which can e.g. be used in reinforcement learning. See Monte Carlo Gradient Estimation in Machine Learning (2019) by Shakir Mohamed et al. for more info.
