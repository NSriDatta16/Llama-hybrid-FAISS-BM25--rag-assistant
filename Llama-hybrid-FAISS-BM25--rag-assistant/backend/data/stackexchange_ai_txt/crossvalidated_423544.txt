Interesting example. I think some key intuition is right there in your post: You get to measure each stick twice. The magic is not so much about statistics or probability but about how you cleverly arrange the measurements so that you get the nuisance terms to cancel: Let's simply say that the measured quantity will differ from the true one by some amount $\epsilon_t$ that differs for every measurement. Measuring $a$ twice and taking the average gives $\hat{a} = \frac{a + a + \epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2}{2}$ Measuring $a+b$ and $a-b$ adding and taking the average gives $\hat{a} = \frac{a + b + \epsilon_1 + a - b + \epsilon_2}{2} = \frac{a + a + \epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2}{2}$
