How do you use jQuery .data() to store html?

when I look up the syntax for .data(), it gives examples like this: $('body').data('foo', 52); I am doing AJAX loads and I was wondering if it is possible to store the incoming html using .data() so once the content is loaded, I would not need to do another AJAX load if the same link is clicked again - I would check to see if the .data key is empty. Would something like this work?: To load the contents of a #ajaxdiv into storage: $('body').data('storage', div#ajaxdiv.html()); To test if the data has already been loaded: if $('body').data('storage') != '' { div#ajaxdiv.html($('body').data('storage')); } Thanks in advance!!
