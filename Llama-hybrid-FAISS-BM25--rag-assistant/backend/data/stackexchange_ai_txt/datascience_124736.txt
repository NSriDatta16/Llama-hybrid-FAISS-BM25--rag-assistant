How to create a bot for a real-time PvP game using machine learning?

Unfortunately, I am not well-versed in machine learning. However, I'm trying to understand if it's possible to create a bot for a real-time PvP game like, for example, Clash Royale or Random Dice: Wars. Can you please advise if the current state of open-source technologies allows for this? What tools would you recommend?
