A tool like Matlab for NLP?

Matlab is a great tool for some mathematical experiments, Neural Networks, Image Processing ... I would like to know if there is such a comprehensive and strong tool for data manipulation and NLP tasks? such as tokenization, POS tagging, parsing, training, testing .... However I am new to NLP and I need a tool which let me experiment, get familiar and progress
