Ned, you can try one of these : #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wno-unitialized" #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wno-uninitialized" #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wno-uninialized" Or ignore -Wuninitialized ? According to the documentation, you have to do this before any data or functions are defined. Maybe it will let you disable the warning just for that file?
