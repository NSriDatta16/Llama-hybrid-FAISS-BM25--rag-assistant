The main difference would be in the assumptions about the error term. In a time series model, even a "static" one, one would have to consider autocorrelation in the error term. In a cross-sectional model, we usually consider the case of heteroskedasticity in the error term. So for example, if in both cases we assume white-noise errors, the two models are essentially identical as regards their mechanics.
