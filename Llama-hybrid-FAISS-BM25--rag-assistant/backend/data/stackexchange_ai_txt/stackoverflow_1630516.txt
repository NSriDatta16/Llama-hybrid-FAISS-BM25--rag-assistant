If I am reading the specification correctly, you should be able to do this with the HTML object element . tags can be nested and thereby provide a chain of resources that are tried each in turn to be rendered and upon failure the user agent continues with the next one. Note, though, that this behaviour is/was buggy for several browsers and versions.
