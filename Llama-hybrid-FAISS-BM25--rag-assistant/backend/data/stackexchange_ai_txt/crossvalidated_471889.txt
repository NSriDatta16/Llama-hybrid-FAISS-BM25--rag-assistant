A probability problem

When a bike is broken, it is brought to the warehouse. The average time spent at the warehouse for repair is 7 days. On average, a bike gets one fault every 100 rides. A fault costs 10 euros to repair. The total rides for a month are 10,000 and the total bicycles are 300. How many bikes will get fault in next month & what will be the cost to repair them? Background - I was asked this problem during an interview for a micromobility company where they gave me these numbers & also revenue (0.8 euros/ride =8000 euros) & cost numbers (2000 euros without repair costs). Finally i had to answer how will the faulty bikes impact the revenue and overall cost? I dont really know how to tackle this problem as i believe there may be some missing information or i am just too dumb. Would be great if someone can help.
