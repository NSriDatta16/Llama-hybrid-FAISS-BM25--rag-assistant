@user1800340 is right. These seem to be R time series objects. Look at the help page via ?ts : Class "ts" has a number of methods. In particular arithmetic will attempt to align time axes Example: A1 which is exactly what happened to you. Not only does it align the dates, but it deletes all the dates which aren't common to both series. Try converting your time series to vectors first. > as.vector(A1)-as.vector(A2) [1] -1 -1 -1
