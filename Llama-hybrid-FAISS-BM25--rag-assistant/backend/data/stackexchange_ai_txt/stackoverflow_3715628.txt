I believe the problem is MyClass.class which apparently is implemented using http://emma.sourceforge.net/faq.html#q.fractional.examples Implicit branches due to a hidden Class.forName(). This case is rather unfortunate because it is pretty common and yet the programmer has almost no control over it. Because Class.forName() can throw checked exceptions, the compiler emits a catch block that rethrows them as unchecked. This catch block hardly ever executes in practice, but it succeeds in marking the line as partially covered. I missed that on the first read-through. I will try to re-write my code to get full coverage. /Roger
