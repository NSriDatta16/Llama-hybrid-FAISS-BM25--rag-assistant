Standard practice for dealing with U flagged chemistry data

I have a large dataset of environmental chemistry data. Many results are U flagged by either the lab or validators. If I want to use these results to find average values over time I see there are several options for incorporating the U flagged results Substitute the limit of detection (LOD) Substitute the LOD/2 Substitute the LOD/sqrt(2) Substitute 0 Use the median value (provided fewer than half of the values in the data set are U flagged) Use a trimmed mean Some other methods I don't know about I feel like there are pros and cons to each of these methods (some bias low, high, skew the variability of the dataset). I do not know what standard practice is for dealing with results below detection limits. Which of these methods (or another) is typical when dealing with chemistry data with missing values? Edit: Just to clarify, these U flagged values are not literally missing because it's not like nothing is known about them. There is some information: they are greater than or equal to 0 but less than the limit of detection.
