This seems to be a perfect use case for Matrix Profile . With this approach you won't need to do any feature engineering at all, but just use the raw input power series and its related Matrix Profile to identify the "charging phase" motif. Edit in response to comments: it can be manually set up using your given, known patterns as a label - I would refer you to the paper "Using Weakly Labelled Time Series to Predict Outcomes" in the linked page. if you get this to work, it is a classification method in its own right so you will not need to extract features for another classification algorithm.
