Best way to stream mp3

I need to organize mp3-streaming from my machine to the rest of the world. People advised me to use MPD with Icecast2 as frontend. Everything is ok except one thing â€” music is being streamed as Ogg Vorbis , not what actually I need. There's a snippet of MPD's config file: audio_output { type "shout" name "Radio" host "localhost" port "8000" encoding "mp3" mount "/radio.ogg" password "mypass" bitrate "256" format "44100:16:2" protocol "icecast2" description "radio stream" } But, Icecast's status page says it's streaming ogg, not mp3. MPD's version is 0.13.2 running on Debian Lenny. What's wrong? Any help will be appreciated. P.S. I have LAME encoder compiled.
