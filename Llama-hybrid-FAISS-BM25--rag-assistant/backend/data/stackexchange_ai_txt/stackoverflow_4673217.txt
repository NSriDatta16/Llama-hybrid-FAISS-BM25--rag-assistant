Most of Apple's standard UI comes default with their UIKit controls. For example, grouped table views look exactly like the ones you see in the Settings app, toolbars and navigation bars look exactly like those in Mail, text views behave like those in Notes, you get access to modal views that look and work identically to Mail and Messages, and so on. When you open or create a nib file in Interface Builder, and drag UIKit elements to your interface, you'll see them just as Apple designed them. You'll get similar results even by creating them programmatically. The sample code that shows off some UIKit controls is UICatalog .
