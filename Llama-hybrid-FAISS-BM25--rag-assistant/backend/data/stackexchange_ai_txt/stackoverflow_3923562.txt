Create a library of AS3 components for Flash

I am looking to build a set of components for Flash that our developers can use throughout future projects. The components are not covered by the standard set of Flash UI components and I don;t think I need to really extend the UI Interface. Instead I would like to be able to distribute a library of FLA (non-compiled) components so that a developer/designer can simply drag a component out of the Library and then edit it however they wish. I am struggling to work out the best way to achieve this. What is a good way of achieving this? Maintaining the ability to edit components is import, and this would be too limited if it meant creating skins or only changing things programatically.
