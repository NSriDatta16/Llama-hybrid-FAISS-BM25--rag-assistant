Mike Dunlavey's suggestion reminds me about redbug that allow you to sample calls in production systems. Think of it as an easy-to-use erlang:trace that doesnt give you enough rope to hang your production system. Using something like this call should give you lots of stack traces to identify where your mnesia transactions are called from: redbug:start(10000,100,{mnesia,transaction,[stack]}). Its not possible to get call duration for these traces though. If you have organized all mnesia lookups into modules that export an api to perform them, you could also use redbug to get a call-frequency on specific queries only.
