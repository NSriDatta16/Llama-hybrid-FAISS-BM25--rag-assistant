Data visualization: comparing two segments of a bipartite time series

Hopefully, this question will make sense to someone. I have a multi-valued continuous time series: $(x, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4...y_n)$, where $x$ is the time axis. This time series can be divided into 2 contiguous segments of equal length: $(x, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4...y_n)$ for $0 $(x, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4...y_n)$ for $t_1 where $[0, t_1]$ is a period of same length as $[t_1, t_2]$ My question is: What would be the best way to visualize the differences between the 2 segments? To make things less cluttered and more feasible in some kind of 2D chart or graph, it is fine to assume the series are $(x, y_1, y_2, y_3)$ series.
