start-stop-daemon is a Linux thing, and not used that much on Solaris. I guess you can port the command though, if you want to reuse your init scripts. Otherwise it depends on what version of Solaris you are using. Starting with Solaris 10 and also OpenSolaris they use a new startup script framework "Solaris Service Management Facility", which you configure with the commands svcs , svccfg and svcadm . See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris/overview/servicemgmthowto-jsp-135655.html for more information. For older Solaris releases most init scripts are written in pure shell without any helper commands like start-stop-daemon.
