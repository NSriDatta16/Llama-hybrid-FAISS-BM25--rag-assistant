Multiple incarnations of one Rails app

What's the best way to organize multiple, slightly-varied incarnations of one Rails app? The incarnations vary on css, images, database and domain. The app/logic is otherwise exactly the same. There is a chance public-facing path names of some routes will need to vary, but still the same route structure. So I'm thinking of having one installation of the app and managing these changes in the environment. DB is obviously already set up nicely for this. CSS and image paths I imagine would be easy enough to make environment-aware. Routes shouldn't be too difficult either I guess, in theory anyway. The reason I'm writing this post is because I'm sure this problem must been solved. Is there an existing "skins" gem or something I can use for this? Otherwise, any comments on my planned approach would be greatly appreciated! I'm using Rails 3.
