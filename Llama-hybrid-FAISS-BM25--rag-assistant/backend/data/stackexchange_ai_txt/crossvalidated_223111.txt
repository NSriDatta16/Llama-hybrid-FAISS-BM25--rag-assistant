Crowdsourcing price computation for new task

I have historical data for crowdsourcing micro tasks(Task : jobtype (classification of jobs(String)), location of job , price of the job, completion time(start date - final date)). These tasks are Human intelligence tasks such as in Amazon mechanical turk. When a new micro crowdsourcing task comes up, I intend to compute optimum price for it. Is it possible to do through any machine learning algorithms, such as multiple regression model? If not any other suggestions are also appreciated. If anyone could guide me in a direction, it would be really helpful.
