Problem with Drag Drop in VC++

I am working for the first time on Drag-Drop in MFC and I am stuck very badly.. I see some format being used for intra-list drag-drop and its value is 49391 always. I have no idea where this number is coming from. I have registered only two formats viz CF_HDROP and another private format [ who value does not match with this ].. can someone please help with this ? And strange enough, when I checked on msdn, it doesn't give any format value this high: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff729168%28VS.85%29.aspx .. I am getting this value consistently; inspite of re-builds; restarts etc.. So, I am guessing it must be some kind of standard format.. Any kind of assistance would be greatly helpful.
