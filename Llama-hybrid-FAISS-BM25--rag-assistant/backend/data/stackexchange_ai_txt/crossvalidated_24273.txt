If you are doing this just once, I like @avb 's idea of a weighted average (or maybe two weighted averages, one for each of two dimensions). But if this is an ongoing project, where each person predicts the location many times, then things get more interesting - some people may be better or worse at predicting. However.... what do you mean by "travel is random"? Motions of cars aren't random. They have limits on turning radius and acceleration and deceleration. If the car is being driven with the wheel being turned at random (with what distribution? Normal? Uniform? Something else?) and the pedals being pushed at random (again, what distribution) then you might be able to solve this analytically. That sounds like a problem for a mathematician!
