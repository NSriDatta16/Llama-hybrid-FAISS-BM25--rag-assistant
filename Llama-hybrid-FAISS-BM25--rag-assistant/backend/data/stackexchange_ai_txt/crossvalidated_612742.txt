If you're talking about the value $\exp(\beta_0)$ from the logistic regression $$ Y_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}\left(P=(1+\exp(-\beta_0))^{-1}\right)) $$ then you are absolutely right: (in my opinion) it should be called "odds", not "odds ratio", and (again in my opinion) people who call it an "odds ratio" are just being sloppy * . (See also this answer , which points out that in a non-simple logistic regression (i.e., with additional parameters/covariates), $\exp(\beta_0)$ is the odds in the baseline condition , when all covariates are equal to zero. * although perhaps harmlessly so
