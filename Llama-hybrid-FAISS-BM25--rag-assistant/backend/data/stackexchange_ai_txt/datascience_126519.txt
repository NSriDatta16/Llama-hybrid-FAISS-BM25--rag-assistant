One possibility could be to use to use Prophet to detect changepoints in the time series. This works by detecting intervals in the time series where there is a substantial change in magnitude across the series. This would allow for identifying the specific points where there is a significant change in latitude value - hence identifying a change in location. Note that the trend flexibility can also be adjusted using changepoint_prior_scale in order to vary the sensitivity that is used to detect rate changes in the time series. TensorFlow Probability also has the capability to detect changepoints in a time series - this is done by using Bayesian modelling to detect changes in state across the series. You could experiment with both and see which one is more suited to working with your data.
