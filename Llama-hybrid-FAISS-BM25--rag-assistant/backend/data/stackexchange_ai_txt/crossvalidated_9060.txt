Some people have started to look at this issue in the chemometrics literature . For instance, about 20 years ago Robert Gibbons started to do statistical analyses suggesting instrument responses (for low-level measurement of chemicals) were nonlinear, heteroscedastic, and had non-normal (perhaps lognormal) error distributions. I found an abstract of one of those papers on Springer's site, Some statistical and conceptual issues in the detection of low-level environmental pollutants (JEES 1995).
