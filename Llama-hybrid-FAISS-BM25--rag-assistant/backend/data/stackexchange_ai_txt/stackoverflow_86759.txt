Reinventing the wheel here. Using squares. OK, you don't have exceptions in PHP 4. Welcome in the year 1982, take a look at C. You can have error codes. Consider negative values, they seem more intuitive, so you would just have to check if (createUser() > 0). You can have an error log if you want, with error messages (or just arbitrary error codes) pushed onto an array, dealt with elegance afterwards. But PHP is a loosely typed language for a reason, and throwing error codes that have different types but evaluate to the same "false" is something that shouldn't be done. What happens when you run out of built-in types? What happens when you get a new coder and have to explain how this thing works? Say, in 6 months, you won't remember. Is PHP === operator fast enough to get through it? Is it faster than error codes? or any other method? Just drop it.
