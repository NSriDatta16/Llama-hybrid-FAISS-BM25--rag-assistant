The vertical position returned by PdfWriter, is automatically handled by the writer class when you add paragraph, tables, etc to the document. If you want to add custom graphics, you have to manually handle the vertical position by saving the position of the last graphic you drawn. If you have to draw graphic at absolute position, without regard to the text added via Paragraph objects, this is simple. But if you want sinchronize the position of the graphic with high level objects (Paragraph, pdfTable and so on) you must handle iText events.
