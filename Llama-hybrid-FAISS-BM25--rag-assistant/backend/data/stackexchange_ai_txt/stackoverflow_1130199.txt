methods and constructors

I'm learning C# now and a beginner in the programming world. I have a book called The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt. So far its a good book and I'm in the middle of learning about methods and constructors. I'm quite confused what's the difference of methods and constructors. Because in the book it has almost the same example. I don't know how to differentiate them. I would appreciate your idea. By the way I have several definition here of both, I just would like to know how to differentiate them Thanks for your help Cheers
