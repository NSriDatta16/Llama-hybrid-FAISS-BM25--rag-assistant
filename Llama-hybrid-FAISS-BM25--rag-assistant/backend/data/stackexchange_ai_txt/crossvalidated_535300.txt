Bayesian optimization - One run with 100 iterations vs ten runs with ten iterations

I was wondering whether it makes more sense to run Bayesian Optimization let's say ones with 100 iterations or ten times with ten iterations each . Which one should I favor? I would assume that the first is better since the probabilistic model of the objective function gets better? I'm using Bayesian Optimization to tune multiple hyperparameters of a Random Forest model - max_depth , max_features , min_samples_leaf , and min_samples_split . Currently, I'm using the library pyGPGO with a Gaussian Process and expected improvement as an acquisition function.
