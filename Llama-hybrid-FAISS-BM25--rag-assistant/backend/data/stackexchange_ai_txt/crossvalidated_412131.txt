Generally what is done in these sorts of situations, when you want to generate different outputs of different "types" is that you generate all output types every timestep and just take the appropriate values, ignoring the rest. So to make this concrete, in your example you would have an RNN which outputs a 6-D vector, from which you take either the first 4 to predict the filters or the last 2 to take the filter size.
