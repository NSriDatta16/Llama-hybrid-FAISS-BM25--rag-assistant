Samuel, welcome to the website. There's been extensive literature on functional data analysis originating from statistics in the last 15 or so years -- see the classic monograph by Ramsey and Silverman (2005, 2nd ed) , and you can find a bunch of others. In this literature, one observation = one image, and this literature doesn't have any second thoughts treating measurements as continuous data (which you refer to as ratio data). The ways of properly aligning images and applying other transformations to ensure that the common statistical methods, from averaging to ANOVA or PCA, are meaningful. If you are stuck with looking at images as nominal data, there won't be much you'd be able to do with them.
