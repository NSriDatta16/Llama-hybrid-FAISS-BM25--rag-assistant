I have a somewhat contrarian opinion to Peter Flom. This is a site for statisticians to answer questions about statistics. To come and ask "this person who is intended to work with data doesn't know how to interpret a basic model" will undoubtedly receive answers claiming the company hiring said individual(s) "are headed for disaster". That answer accords with our own beliefs that "data work = statistics", and I don't think that is necessarily the case at every org. In my own experience, data science will mean 3 different things to 3 different companies, and that may mean that ability to do inference -- even basic inference -- is not the top skill to look for. When I was interviewing, I found data science roles were largely placed into 3 broad categories: Science Focused : These roles largely prioritized experimentation, hypothesis generation, and deep understanding of statistics and the scientific method Engineering Focused : These roles largely prioritized modelling for accuracy instead of inference, deployment, and engineering skills. Mixed Bag : These roles had a mix of each of the former to varying degrees. In my opinion, it is silly to expect an engineering focused position to also have deep knowledge in statistics, just as I think it is silly to have a stats focused position have deep knowledge of engineering. To highlight this fact, I will gladly provide anecdotes of me failing interviews because the interviewer failed to appreciate statistical nuance that we here on cross validated nearly take as law. Now, clearly the position you are hiring for is a science focused role, but your question was about mid level data science roles more generally. My answer is then that because data science still suffers from underdetermination, it may or may not be relevant to know linear regression beyond its predictive ability. It will depend on what kind of data scientist you are interviewing, their past experience, and their future plans to delineate their expertise. If you find your job description is very clear that you need inference skills and not just machine learning skills, I think that might require a conversation with your recruiting team.
