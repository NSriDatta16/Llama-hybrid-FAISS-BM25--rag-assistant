Not having worked with currency conversion much before, it seems like a lot over overhead to make exchange rates over time and perform all the calculations. It would seem to me that a better solution might be to store the money in a single currency, based upon the day that money is phsyically converted into your currency. So if Donor A sends a check in SEK, but your organization works in EUR, you take the check to the bank, they exchange it to EUR. I would enter the amount the bank gives me in EUR. I know this solution doesn't work well for commitments for future donations. Is it possible to ask everyone to donate in the same currency?
