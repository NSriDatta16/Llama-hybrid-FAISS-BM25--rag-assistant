As a common form for passing data. It was the 1990s and mark up tags were all the rage! There's a lot of flexibility and power, including the ability to validate an XML file; but I think it is interesting that a number of much more lightweight alternatives have popped up over recent years (eg. JSON). Ie. being able to easily read/write data in a human-readable form appears to be more important than all that validation stuff, for most applications.
