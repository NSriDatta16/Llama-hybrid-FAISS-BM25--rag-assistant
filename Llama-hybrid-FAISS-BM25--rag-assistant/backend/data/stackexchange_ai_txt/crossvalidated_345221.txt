Unit root tests and correlation coefficients

A linear regression is performed as part of some unit root tests such as ADF, ADF-GLS (ERS), and PP. Should I pay attention to the correlation coefficients (ordinary, adjusted) of the regression? For example, do poor correlations invalidate any results of these tests? Or, can I trust the test statistic to incorporate sufficient information, so I can safely ignore the correlation coefficients?
