Reinforcement learning with neural networks

I am working on a project with RL & NN I need to determine the action vector structure which will be fed to a neural network.. I have 3 different actions (A & B & Nothing) each with different powers (e.g A100 A50 B100 B50) I wonder what is the best way to feed these actions to a NN in order to yield best results? 1- feed A/B to input 1, while action power 100/50/Nothing to input 2 2- feed A100/A50/Nothing to input 1, while B100/B50/Nothing to input 2 3- feed A100/A50 to input 1, while B100/B50 to input 2, while Nothing flag to input 3 4- Also to feed 100 & 50 or normalize them to 2 & 1 ? I need reasons why to choose one method Any suggestions are recommended Thanks
