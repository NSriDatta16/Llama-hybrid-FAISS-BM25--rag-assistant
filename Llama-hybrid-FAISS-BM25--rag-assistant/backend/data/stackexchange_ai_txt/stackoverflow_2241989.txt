Host web application on a desktop

Just want to wrap a page inside a desktop window on Windows, Linux and Mac . The user see standard (for the given OS) look (window, close/minimise buttons etc). But it would basically just be a browser inside that window. Additional things I want to achieve (apart from the ones every browser has): Application should be able to require an attention 'unobtrusively' (maybe just flash some icon for a second), so user can choose some option and it would hide till next time. Possibly pop-up a small window . I would really like to keep the desktop part as small as possible , so it would be just a wrapper over the web site. Thus Flex probably is not the best choice (never tried though). What for: time-tracking site with easier, periodic time input. How would you go about that? Thanks, Dmitriy.
