Why does sign of coefficient of categorical variable changes in logistic regression when running a model on test sample

Hi this is my first post on this site, I am building a logistic regression model in SAS using proc logistic, my target is 0 and 1, I have 10-15 predictors 2 are continuous and rest are categorical, I divided total sample in two parts train(80%) test(20%), when I am checking the stability of coefficients on test sample I found that few categorical predictor changes their sign, also few turned insignificant on test data. I am using categorical variables as it is (not creating dummy) in class statement in proc logistics. so in short what would be reason for sign change on test data? Thanks, Abhishek
