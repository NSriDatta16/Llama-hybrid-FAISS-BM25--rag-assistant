I would suggest trying AJAX pagination. No user will be able to see and analyze 60k records at one time. You can have the php display the first x (however many fit on the average screen or two) records to fill 2-3 pages, and have JavaScript listen for a scroll change. If a user starts scrolling down, have it automatically query the next y records, and add them to the display list. Possibly also removing the records from the top of the list. Also, adding some quick-jump links or a search feature could help, as you wouldn't want to scroll down 60k records to make changes. This will significantly lighten the server and client load, as it would only have to serve up a couple hundred records at a time.
