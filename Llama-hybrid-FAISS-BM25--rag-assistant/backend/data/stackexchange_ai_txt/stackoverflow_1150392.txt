I would say it if definitly OK to use an SQL Database to store data for an Object-oriented program (I do this almost all the time -- and it works quite fine) Procedural vs Object-Oriented is quite a debate ; I don't think you should choose depending on the storage type you're using : the choice should be more about your code and your application. OOP comes with many advantages, one of which is (in my opinion) better maintenability ; better isolation, encapsulation, and all that is true too. Actually, after having programmed in OOP for a couple of years, I would find hard (and I actually do...) to do procedural programming ; the ability of having data and related-methods to manipulate them in a single class, used a an independant entity, is really great.
