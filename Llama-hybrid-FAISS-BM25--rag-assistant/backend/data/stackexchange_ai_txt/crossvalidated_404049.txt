Changing the regression problem to a classification problem

I'd like to do the classification on a crime data around the country. However, what I have for the label is the crime coefficient which is from 0 to 1. I'd like to make up some interval like 0~0.3 as low crime rate, 0.3~0.5 medium etc. And then use it in the xgboost or random forest model to do the classification. Is there anything I need to pay attention to before the classification? For example, do I have to check the label whether it is normally distributed? What if the data is skewed? What would you do if you are working on this project?
