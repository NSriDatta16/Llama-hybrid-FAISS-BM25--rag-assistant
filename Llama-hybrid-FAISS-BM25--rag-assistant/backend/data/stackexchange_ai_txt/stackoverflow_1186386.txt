Crystal Reports - Stored Procedure Syntax Question

When I drag a field from my stored procedure onto a formula (Crystal Reports 11), I get something like this: {sp_YES_AccountSnapshot;1.ST0405_Ext} What does the "1." represent? I hope it refers to the table number... because I'd like to return two tables from the stored procedure and be able to access both from a report. Thanks
