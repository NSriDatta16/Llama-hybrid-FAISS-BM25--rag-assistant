PCA regression worse than non-PCA under multicollinearity

I have two questions regarding multicollinearity. I'm trying to perform a multiple linear regression under a dataset where variables are high correlated and normally distributed. To get rid of the multicollinearity I first performed PCA on the dataset (explaining 95% of the variance) and after that I calculated the regression. I also calculated the regression without PCA in order to compare both. The RSME of the PCA regression is higher than de RSME of the non-PCA regression and I can't understand why it is happening. 1 - In my view, after performing PCA, the RSME should be smaller, right? Can anyone give some insights/explanations about that? 2 - As I said, the dataset is high correlated and it also has identical variables in it (yes, identical!). What should I do in this situation? Is it better to delete the identical variables or perform PCA? P.S.: it has identical variables because it comes from an assignment and probably the professor expects that we further investigate this and manage to solve this issue.
