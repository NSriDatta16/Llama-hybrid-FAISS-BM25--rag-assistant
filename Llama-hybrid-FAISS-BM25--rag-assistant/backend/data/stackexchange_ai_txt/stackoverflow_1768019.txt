How to start to implement a drag and drop between different processes?

The application that I am developing is a windows form application written in C#. It has a treeview on it. Each of the treeNode stores some data. What I want to do is to open two copies of the application, drag some of the treenodes from one application and drop to another. The data the treenodes store should be transferred to another application to build treenodes on another application. I wonder how to implement the drag and drop functionality like this? Thanks for your help.
