If by saying "save it in iPhone" you mean "save it in the iPod app" (i.e. Music Library), it is unfortunately not possible, as Apple does not allow external apps to add files to the system's Libraries on iPhone. (Video, Music, Podcast, etc) If by saying "save it in iPhone" you mean "put the app on iPhone", you will need the latest XCode and an iPhone Developer Account, which you can purchase at developer.apple.com If by saying "save it in iPhone" you mean "save the file inside the app", you will need to get a persistent storage within the app (Core Data or dictionary) to be able to access the files after you quit the app, and find your way to store the data on the device (you can compress them as zip files, save away in a directory, add to a dictionary, etc.)
