MQRC 2056 - MQRC_Q_SPACE_NOT_AVAILABLE

When a message fails to post to a WebSphere MQ queue with MQRC 2056 MQRC_Q_SPACE_NOT_AVAILABLE it goes to Dead Letter queue. It means the Original disk space we allotted for queues usage is 100%. Say file system /var/mqm has sufficient free queue storage. Even we have our dead letter queue storage also in same /var/mqm. If we already get MQRC 2056 - MQRC_Q_SPACE_NOT_AVAILABLE, then how is it possible that a message will go to the Dead Letter queue when its disk space is already full?
