Where to start? : Developing rich web applications for mobile platforms (against platform specific standalone apps)

I am new to mobile app development and I dont want restrict myself to one platform. Some days ago I read an article that stressed on the fact that soon web apps running on mobile browsers may replace dedicated apps (at least for non-game apps). I want to develop a social networking web app that any phone can run via the browser. These are the things I would like expert comments on: Resources/Guidelines for developing great UIs for rich mobile web apps (HTML5?, existing APIs/Frameworks I should know) The best ways to increase performance (a reusable native simple browser app per platform that caches, provides a uniform interface to the web apps, access to sensors, APIs, features like drag drop etc for that platform. is there already one?) How do I test the apps for various major platforms and across various devices (small/large screens, touch phones etc) Best ways to manage multiple device compatibility.. (how to best handle non-uniformity of functionality on various devices/browsers on the server side using ASP.NET)
