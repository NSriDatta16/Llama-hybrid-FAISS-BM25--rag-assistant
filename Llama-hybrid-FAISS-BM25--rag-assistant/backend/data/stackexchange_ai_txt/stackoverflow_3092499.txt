The "elegant way" would be to actually provide data binding, so that you can change your property also afterwards. Your initial idea looked good, working with the answer provided by Cornel. I just wanted to mention this as your actual question sounded more like that you know your data binding is not working and you just wanted to postpone the initial setting of the variable. Btw, should you plan to create custom components in Actionscript (instead of mxml) you'll face the opposite problem: properties are set before you had a chance to actually create your children, so you may need to buffer them if they actually should influence some childs properties.
