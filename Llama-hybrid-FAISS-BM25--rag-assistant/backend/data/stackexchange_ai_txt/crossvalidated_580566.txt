You could consider treating Plant species as a random effect in your model. That nicely handles a multi-level categorical predictor and effectively weights those levels in the analysis in terms of the total number of observations. With your data it also removes the perfect separation. I simplified the names a bit, with Species for Plant species and simply Presence and Absence for the Animal observations, in a data frame called spData : library(lme4) mod1 |z|) # (Intercept) -2.941 0.345 -8.524 That (Intercept) is the estimate of the overall log-odds of Animal Presence . The high Variance of the Species random intercept is consistent with the wide ratio of Presence to Absence seen in your data. The "random effects" for each Plant Species around that overall estimate are available from ranef(mod1) and their individual log-odds estimates from coef(mod1) . This type of model nicely extends to incorporation of how other variables might affect Presence . Approaches to perfect separation in general are discussed in detail on this page . In your situation I think that treating the plant Species as a random effect, with each Species effectively representing a choice from a large underlying set of possible species, makes the most sense. See this page for how the random-effect model provides shrinkage (in a different way from the suggestions for Firth or ridge penalization) to deal with perfect separation. See this page for how random-effect modeling (based on an underlying Gaussian distribution of random effects) is closely related to the Bayesian modeling suggested as an approach to handling perfect separation.
