If you set the probability $p$ of an email going out at any given hour to $\frac{3}{84}$, then on average each user will receive 3 messages weekly. To verify this, note that this problem is a binomial distribution with $n = 84$. Since the expected value of a binomial distribution is $np$ and you'd like the mean number of emails to be 3, $84p = 3$, and $p = 3 / 84$. As for the degree of confidence this will roughly equal 3, with this approach the distribution of emails users will receive will look like so: Note that, while 3 is the expected value, only about 22 percent of user-weeks will have three emails. If you find this distribution over number of emails is too dispersed—i.e. the range of potential values is too broad—or you're not willing to accept a 5 percent chance that a user receives 6 emails, then you may wish to consider another approach. For example, you could sample 3 values without replacement from the integers from 0 to 83, and then simply schedule the three weekly emails accordingly. You could also choose arbitrary probabilities for the number of emails to be sent to each user, and then randomly choose that many hours at which to send emails. E.g. a 0.5 probability of three emails, 0.25 of two, 0.25 of four, or whatever arbitrary distribution you'd like. From a development perspective this could prove useful down the road if you later create methods to learn how many emails is most likely to be successful for a given user, and when those messages are most likely to be successful. Meaning, if you already have a random scheduler in place, it'll be easier to swap out for a scheduler that uses the results of a learning algorithm. (Assuming you have some metric of success available for each message, which may be a faulty assumption on my part.)
