Conditional Regular Expressions

I'm using Python and I want to use regular expressions to check if something "is part of an include list" but "is not part of an exclude list". My include list is represented by a regex, for example: And.* Everything which starts with And . Also the exclude list is represented by a regex, for example: (?!Andrea) Everything, but not the string Andrea . The exclude list is obviously a negation. Using the two examples above, for example, I want to match everything which starts with And except for Andrea . In the general case I have an includeRegEx and an excludeRegEx . I want to match everything which matchs includeRegEx but not matchs excludeRegEx . Attention : excludeRegEx is still in the negative form (as you can see in the example above), so it should be better to say: if something matches includeRegEx , I check if it also matches excludeRegEx , if it does, the match is satisfied. Is it possible to represent this in a single regular expression? I think Conditional Regular Expressions could be the solution but I'm not really sure of that. I'd like to see a working example in Python. Thank you very much.
