Let me first place here your data: pop My first approach would be to use resampling. Let's select an appropriate statistic to check if its measured value for the real sample is significant or not. I choose the absolute value of the difference in the number of people with green and brown eyes (as a percentage of the sample size), that is, stat What we should do now is to sample from the population, selecting new samples of the same size and then computing the same statistic. We will get lots of sample statistics that can be used to compare with the observed effect. # brown=1, green=2, other=0 universe results If you plot the results against the observed effect, observed.effect The conclusion from this simulation is that there is strong evidence that the difference in your sample is significant. This is the vizualization code I used, compute.p.value = observed.effect) # compute Monte Carlo p-value with correction (Davison & Hinkley, 1997) list(mc.p.value=round((r+1)/(n+1), precision), r=r, n=n) } present_results $mc.p.value), xlim=c(0,max(c(results,observed.effect))), xlab=paste("found", lst$ r, "as extreme effects for", lst$n, "replications")) abline(v=observed.effect, lty=2, lwd=2, col="red") } present_results(results, observed.effect) If you like a Bayesian approach, one possibility I see is using a model for a Binomial Test with two rates, testing for one eye color at a time. Something like, $$k_i \sim \text{Binomial}(n_i, \theta_i) ~, ~ i=1\ldots m$$ $$\theta_i \sim \text{Beta}(1,1) ~, ~ i=1\ldots m$$ $$\delta_{ij} = \theta_i - \theta_j$$ herein, $m=2$ . Ie, we would like to compare if the difference of, say, brown eyes in the population and brown eyes in the sample, is significant. The null hypothesis is $H_0 : \delta_{1,2} = 0$ . If the credible interval for $\delta_{1,2}$ includes zero, we must retain the null, not reject it. If it does not include zero, we would reject it. Here is a possible Stan model, data { int m; // at least two groups int n[m]; int k[m]; } parameters { real theta[m]; } model { theta ~ beta(1, 1); k ~ binomial(n, theta); } generated quantities { real delta[m,m]; for ( i in 1:m ) { for ( j in 1:m ) { if (i==j) delta[i,j] = normal_lpdf(0|0,1); // dummy values else delta[i,j] = theta[i] - theta[j]; } } } After the fit of this model with the brown eyes data, we get a 99% credible interval of $[0.016,0.044]$ which, given the large numbers we are dealing with, would mean a rejection of the null hypothesis despite being close to zero. The code to perform the fit: library(rstan) library(rethinking) library(latex2exp) n Let's also plot the posterior of $\delta_{1,2}$ samples $theta samples_delta delta credible_interval $\\theta_',1,'-\\theta_',2,'$ ')), ylab="") y.seg
