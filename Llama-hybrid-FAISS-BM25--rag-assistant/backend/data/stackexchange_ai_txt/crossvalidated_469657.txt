Can someone explain the importance of mean stationarity in time series?

In regular regression, the expected value of Y | X is allowed to change. In fact we generally use regression when we want to model this change in conditional mean. I am not understanding why in time series, we want our series to be mean stationary. I get the stationary variance assumption as that's similar to the identically distributed assumption in regular regression. But why is mean stationarity so important?
