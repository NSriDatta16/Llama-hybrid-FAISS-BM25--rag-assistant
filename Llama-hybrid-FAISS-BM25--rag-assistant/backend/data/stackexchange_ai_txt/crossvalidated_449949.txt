Why AutoRegression(AR) model in python is giving inaccurate negative prediction

I have time series data with 8 points. I used AR model from statsmodels.tsa.ar_model library. I trained data using 8 points and predicted next 3 points. Though all values in the series are in increasing order, model predicts next values as negative. Why AutoRegression is giving that inaccurate result. Is it due to error in the code or insufficiency of the data(short series)? Code: rft=[1,7,8,20,59,133,223,247] from statsmodels.tsa.ar_model import AR model=AR(rft) model_fit = model.fit() y_predicted=model_fit.predict(start=len(rft), end=len(rft)+3) print(y_predicted) Output:- 8 -25.113460 9 -1054.913428 10 -3537.131054 11 -8056.000283 dtype: float64
