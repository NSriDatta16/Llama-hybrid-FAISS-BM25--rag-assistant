Multiple IVs and DVs with non-normally distributed data

I am performing a research study aiming at answering the research question: How does job design satisfaction differ between employees working in hybrid and remote work arrangements? For that I designed the following survey: What is your gender? R: Male, Female, Prefer not to answer What is your age group? R: 18-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-45, >45 For how long are you on your current job? R: 0-2 years, 3-5 years, >5 years Which work model are you currently working in? R: Hybrid, Remote Did you have a choice in deciding to work under the current work model? R: Yes, No 20, 7 point likert-scale questions from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree: I am given the opportunity to do what I do best every day. My job provides me with opportunities to use my skills and abilities. I have a say in the decisions that affect my job. The job itself is very significant and important in the broader scheme of things. The compensation I receive for the work that I do accurately reflects the value of my contribuitions. My personal values align with my role and responsibilities. My work environment supports open and honest communication. My job is interesting. I feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose from my job. My job provides me with opportunities to learn and grow. My job provides me with clear and specific feedback on how well I am doing. I have a high degree of control over my work. I have a positive working relationship between myself and those who oversee my work. I have an active role in shaping and redefining my job. My job provides with a good work-life balance. I feel a sense of camaraderie with the people I work with. I am not fairly rewarded for the work that I perform. My job gives me the opportunity to interact and build meaningful relationships with my colleagues. My work environment supports social interactions and relationships. The work I do is not important to the organization. I have got a total of 81 valid responses distributed unevenly across the different dependent variables (work model, tenure, age, gender, etc.). Work Model: Hybrid (38 responses) and remote (43 responses) Gender: Male (55 reponses) Female (26 responses) Age Group: 21-25 (17 reponses) 26-30 (18 reponses) 31-35 (23 reponses) 36-40 (10 reponses) 41-45 (6 reponses) >45 (7 reponses) Choice of work model: YES(60 reponses) NO(21 reponses) Tenure 0-2 years (39 reponses) 3-5 years (22 reponses) >5 years (20 reponses) Region Country A (71 responses) Country B (9 responses) Country C (0 responses) Country D (0 responses) Checked for normality with a Komolgorov-Smirnov test and all likert-scale survey questions return as non-normally distributed. As such I went down the route of testing work model (IV) and likert-scales (DVs) via non-parametric tests with a k-samples pairwise analysis. I believe the data that I have is representative of the real world and I would like to keep it (don't remove outliers and don't transform it). Although this only allowed me to go so far. I am not able to perform a test like a MANCOVA or a multivariate regression analysis where I would be able to have multiple IVs and multiple DVs at the same time due to the non-normal distribution of the data. Also, I didn't find a non-parametric test similar to the MANCOVA or similar analysis that I could apply given the survey I designed, and the data set it collected. Should I ignore the non-normal distribution of the data because of a large enough sample (81 valid responses) and apply a statistical analysis like the MANCOVA? or is there a non-parametric test that allows me to use multiple IVs and DVs?
