Force Postback from code behind? Or reload JavaScript from an Asynchronous Postback?

I've got a Jquery UI dialog that pops up to confirm the creation of an item after filling out a form. I have the form in an update panel due to various needs of the form, and especially because I want validation being done on the form without reloading the page. JavaScript appears to not reload on an asynchronoous postback. This means when the form is a success and I change the variable 'formSubmitPass' to true, it does not get passed to the Javascript via . If I add a trigger to the submit button to do a full postback, it works. However I don't want the submit button to do a full postback as I said so I can validate the form within the update panel. How can I have this so my form validates asynchronously, but my javaScript will properly reload when the form is completed successfully and the item is saved to the database? Javascript: var formSubmitPass = ' '; var redirectUrl = ' '; function pageLoad() { $('#formPassBox').dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 400, resizable: false, modal: true, draggable: false, buttons: { "Ok": function() { window.location.href = redirectUrl; } }, open: function(event, ui) { $(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").hide(); var t = window.setTimeout("goToUrl()", 5000); } }); if(formSubmitPass == 'True') { $('#formPassBox').dialog({ autoOpen: true }); } So how can I force a postback from the code behind, or reload the JavaScript on an Asynchronous Postback, or do this in a way that will work such that I can continue to do Async form validation? Edit: I change formSubmitPass at the very end of the code behind: If errorCount = 0 Then formSubmitPass = True upForm.Update() Else formSubmitPass = False End If So on a full postback, the value does change.
