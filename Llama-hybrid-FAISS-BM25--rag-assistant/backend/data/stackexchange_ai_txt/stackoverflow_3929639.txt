There may be a simpler way, but a method that I know would work is to use an AudioRecord object that is configured to watch the MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC audio source and record in 8-bit ( AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_8BIT ). You would need a thread to run in the background and constantly poll the object for audio with the read() call, which fills a given byte array with audio data from the mic. Because you are recording in 8-bit, the max range of each audio sample would be -128 to 127 (although I may have this wrong - it could be from 0 to 256). You would have to experiment with taking either the maximum magnitude byte from the returned byte array, or perhaps the RMS average depending on your application's needs. The size of the byte array would also play a part in determining how frequently your application is able to sample the input audio volume.
