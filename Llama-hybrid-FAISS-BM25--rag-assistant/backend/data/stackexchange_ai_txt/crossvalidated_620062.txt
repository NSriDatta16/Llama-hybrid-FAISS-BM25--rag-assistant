From my experience, trend variable is quite commonly used in time series regression. Especially in Demand Forecasting. I therefore can't see any problem using trend. Having an insignificant p-value for the trend coefficient does not imply your dataset doesn't have any trend. There could be other reasons for that, the most immediate I can think of - a large sd for the trend coefficient. To me, it might be that the trend and Age variables are correlated with each other, causing the trend p-value to shrink. I'd suggest measuring the VIF and correlation for your variables, focusing on examining the Age and trend relationship.
