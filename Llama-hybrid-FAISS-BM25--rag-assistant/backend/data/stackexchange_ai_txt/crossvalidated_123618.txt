Logistic regression with multiple outcomes

I have a study looking at the association between a novel diagnostic measure (continuous var) and a health outcome (measured at 4 different time periods; binary). In addition, data on traditional diagnostic measures will be collected to see if it could have predicted the same health outcome, independent of the novel diagnostic tool. My questions are: Since my outcome variable is collected at 4 different times, can I still run a logistic regression? To compare the predictive value of the traditional measure vs. the novel diagnostic measure, should I just compare their regression coefficients or do I need to create two separate regression models?
