The problem seems to be that sklearn pipelines are strictly linear in nature, so you can't fit the two models within the pipeline. You could try ensembling the GBM and RF into a new model object to use; for that, use FeatureUnion : https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/139042/ensemble-of-different-kinds-of-regressors-using-scikit-learn-or-any-other-pytho https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43010914/stack-ensemble-estimators-using-sklearn-pipeline-and-gridsearchcv I don't see immediately how to take the simple average of the scores rather than fitting a linear model, but it shouldn't be hard; maybe as a custom transformation? Then there's also a minor difference from what you're describing: the cross-validation for hyperparameters would happen for the ensemble, so would seek the best result of the ensemble rather than the two individual models.
