In a long ago day, I tried them all and found Anthemion DialogBlocks to be the most professional of the bunch. Along with that goes the fact that it is commercial software. It's by Julian Smart, the creator of wxWidgets, so I suppose it's not too surprising that it's a quality product. At $90, it's a bit expensive but not outrageous.
