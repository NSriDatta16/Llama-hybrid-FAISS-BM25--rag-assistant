Should I use weighted average to deal with category size problems in a logistic regression?

I am trying to see the effect of retirement benefits on the late-career intentions for business. The retired employees are categorized on the basis of retirement benefits. The first category is low, the second is medium, and the third is high benefits. The number of people under the 3rd category is a lot more than the first two categories as you can see in the table attached here. Should I use weighted values? If so, how should I use them? The crosstab with business intent is also shown: The correlation and significance are both okay in the present scenario but I don't know what will be the effect under weighted category, and how it would interact with other IV's on normal scale.
