What are the step to go through to set up a working development environement for Magento?

Magento is a e-commerce application based on Zend Framework, dive in Magento is sometimes not so easy due to the lack of documentation. When I take back a project, I've to go through several step to get it working : Check it out from any CVS Set up the database from the most recent dump of the production server (if any) Set up the app/etc/local.xml Replace web/secure/base_url and web/unsecure/base_url in database Adjust .htaccess setting according to my environment Set up errors/local.xml from config sample Allow display_errors Obviously, at the first step of my development work-flow, I want to display all errors, all exceptions, log every things, etc. I may have forgot a lot of thing, here is the reason of my question, I'm looking to write kind of cheat sheet from the answer to have the step when I want to set up my Magento Development Environment, and why not write a script.
