Good theoretical analysis done by the upvoted answers. However, here's my simple, empirical view on why the distribution is exponential. When you distribute the money randomly , let's consider you do it one-by-one. Let S be the original sum. For the first man, you must choose a random amount between 0 and S. Thus, on average, you will choose S/2 and remain with S/2. For the second man, you would choose randomly between 0 and, on average, S/2. Thus, on average, you'll choose S/4 and remain with S/4. So, you would basically be splitting the sum in half each time (statistically speaking). Although in a real-life example you will not have continuously halved values, this shows why one should expect the distribution to be exponential.
