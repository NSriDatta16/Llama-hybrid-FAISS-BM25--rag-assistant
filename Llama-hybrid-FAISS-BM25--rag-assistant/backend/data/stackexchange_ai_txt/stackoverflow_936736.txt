We can look at a color as a point in three-dimensional space. Now each image will be at a point in space defined by its average color. The user is choosing a point in 3-d space, and you want to find the image nearest that point. This is not simple, but a lot of work has been done on it by people smarter than you or I (Don Knuth calls it the 'post office problem'). A good place to start is at Wikipedia , as usual.
