Marketing Mix Model (MMM) using XGBoost?

Does anyone know of any literature on Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM) using XGBoost? Is this a viable techniques for MMM modelling? What would the advantages/disadvantages be? I think it would be a great option due to that interactions effects are dealt with in a good way, and the model also avoids inflated values. However, I am not sure of whether XGBoost is the best model for dealing with the multi colliearity often present in MMM data. I would be happy for any thoughts on this.
