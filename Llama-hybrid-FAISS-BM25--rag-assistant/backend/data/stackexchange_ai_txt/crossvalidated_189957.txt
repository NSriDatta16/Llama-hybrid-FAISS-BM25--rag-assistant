Is there an unambiguous stationarity test for time series?

It seems to me that the time series plot, the correlograms (ACS, PACS) and the "autocorrelation check for residuals test" can all be subject to interpretation. (I am using SAS 9.4) Is there an unambiguous way to determine whether a time series is stationary or not?
