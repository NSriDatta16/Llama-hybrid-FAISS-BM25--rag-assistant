How subjective are prior beliefs?

I find the term 'prior-beliefs' to be a little bit vague, what is acceptable to class as a prior belief in Bayesian analysis? For example, I could not look at any data and decide to myself "I believe the mean of the population is going to be about 60units", whether this is based on intuition or even lack of care. Are there any criteria for what counts as a 'solid' prior belief?
