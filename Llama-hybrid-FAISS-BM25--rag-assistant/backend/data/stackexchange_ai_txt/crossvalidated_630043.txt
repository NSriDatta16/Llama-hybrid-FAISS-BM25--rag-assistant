Interpreting Logistic Regression with categorical variable

Please help! I am using binary logistic regression to model the probability of nesting in 5 different habitat types, with 1 = nest presence and 0 = random point. I have 5 different habitat types and want to know which one is most important, or most selected for. However, I am having trouble interpreting which one is most significant. In the attached model summary it says that Herbaceous has a significant p-value but in this context i think that just means theres significantly more nests in Herbaceous than the reference category (dwarf shrubland habitat). But it doesn't tell me anything regarding whether herbaceous is more selected for than the other habitats listed right? Herbaceous has the most nest points in it out of any habitat (86/205) and is also the smallest habitat type so it would make sense if it was the most significant but I dont know if i can say that statistically. I am also attaching a screenshot of the odds-ratio interpretation (for some reason i am getting 40 warnings all saying the same thing). Any advice on how to interpret and/or modify the analysis is greatly appreciated; thanks in advance! summary(model3) Call: glm(formula = nest_pres ~ Hab_Class + dist_nest, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = nests) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.8165 -0.0567 0.1704 0.4337 3.6930 Estimate Std.
