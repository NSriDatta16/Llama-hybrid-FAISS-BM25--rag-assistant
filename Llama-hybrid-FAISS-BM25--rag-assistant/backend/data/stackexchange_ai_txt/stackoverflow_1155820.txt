Date/Time input for an HTML Form

I'm having trouble finding an elegant way to allow for date/time input in an html form. I am thinking of having drop down menus for year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond that are populated with valid entries only. I could do this by hard coding values for each drop down menu, but I'm thinking there must be a more elegant way to do this, perhaps with some already existing javascript library that I have not found yet. Any tips for getting this done? edit: Second, and if possible, millisecond precision is needed for what I'm working on. edit#2: After reading some of the comments, I have come to the realization that it is probably a bad idea to have drop down menus for the large range of values required by hours/minutes/seconds and especially milliseconds. I think will go with having the DatePicker prototype date chooser, along with a simple textfield for time input.
