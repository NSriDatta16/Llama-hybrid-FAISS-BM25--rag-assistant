Is it possible to create a Mini ERP solution (Organisation specific) in ASP.net MVC?

I am a ASP.net Web Form Developer , I simply want to know that is it possible to develop a mini ERP solution in ASP.net MVC ? I have already developed such in ASP.net Web Forms but our company wants to re-write to whole app from scratch for bigger scale with increased modules and functionalities. So can we go with ASP.net MVC this time rather than Web Forms? Thanks in advance.
