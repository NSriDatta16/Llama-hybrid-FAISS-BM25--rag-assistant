What is the meaning of using a compound variable in PCA

I am using PCA as a dimension reduction method before feeding the data into a classifier. I am typically selecting only the first two or three PCs. Typical data includes factors such as length, width, height, weight, energy output, and other key characteristics. Ultimately I am using only the first several PCA-scores instead of the original factors. My question is : If I were to include compound factors such as area = width*length , energy per unit volume or surface area = (length*width + length*height + width*length) in addition to the simple factors that go into the PCA algorithm would this be expected to add, subtract or be neutral in terms of the information expected to be contained in the first several principal components? What about including multiple variations of the same factor such as length^2 , length^3 ?
