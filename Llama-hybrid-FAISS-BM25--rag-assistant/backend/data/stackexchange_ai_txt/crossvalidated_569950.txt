Too many categorical predictors in multinomial logistic regression

I am not familiar with multi-class prediction so I apologize in advance if this questions seem very basic. Here is my dataset: So within the dataset, I am trying to predict which fare product is picked by the customer, in which choice is the dependent variable Columns 6:14 are prices of each option, and the last column shows which option the customer decides to take in the end. The dataset has about ~160000 rows, so I am not sure for days to departure, week (day of week), and group (week number in a year), if I should encode them as factors or numerical variables. My fear is that if I encode week and group as factors, this will result in me having too many predictors and an incredibly long run time if I try to use multinom regression in caret. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I should encode them? Thank you for the help in advance :(
