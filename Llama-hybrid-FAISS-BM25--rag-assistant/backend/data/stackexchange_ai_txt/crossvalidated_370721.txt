In case some one is working on a similar problem and lands up on this page, here is what worked for me. After trying several approaches, the method that worked best for me was to mine rules from the data set using apriori and use the 'Lift' parameter from rules as an input to a classification algorithm like random forest, that takes the attributes of two events along with the 'lift' and does a binary classification, '1' the events are correlated, '0' the events are not correlated. This system has been in production since a few months and is working really well!
