The dealer has enough power to make any strategy wortheless. I would argue that this falls under the no free lunch theorem. As a small reasoning by the absurd, let's suppose that you have a strategy X, that is supposed to be optimal, and I'm the dealer. Because I'm the dealer I've thought long and hard about the problem and found that same strategy X. I start by removing every marble from every bowl. Now, you follow your optimal strategy. But as I know that's the optimal one, I will do my utmost to fight it. Thus, if you do the moves that someone playing the optimal strategy does, I will keep you at 0 marbles all the time (or oscillate between 0 and 1 if I'm forced to add/remove). If you don't, then i'll choose to add a lot of marbles all the time, because I like people that disregard strategy and play less than perfect. Thus non-optimal strategies are better than the optimal strategy, which is a contradiction. Hence there is no optimal strategy. Edit : With the update to the question : the dealer now has a pre-determined f(number of marbles) strategy. Yes, there is an optimal strategy for the player : always take. If you don't take, the number of marbles stays the same, the dealer will do the exact same thing, and you've just done a 0-round, which is always worst case (you can't have negative rounds), so you lost on the average $/round.
