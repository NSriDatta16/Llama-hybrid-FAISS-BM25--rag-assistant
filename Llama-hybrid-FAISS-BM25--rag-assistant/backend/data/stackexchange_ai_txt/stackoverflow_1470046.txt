Best and easier way is to do it with .NET COM because COM has much stronger bridge compared to native dll access inside .NET because it may lead to lots of memory issues and lots of troubleshooting time. Its easier to test COM inside any MFC project and get the trace information for debugging and when the component is ready it can be easily used inside .NET. CLI will not let you use all features and unfortunately its fairly new so less documentation is available and you will not get good support for your questions. Win32 dll and DLLImport has problems mainly to troubleshoot, because the exception thrown inside Win32 dll will not travel further along the stack instead it will simply crash and you will not get the reason. Where else in COM you can catch exception internally and the COMException thrown inside .NET will not crash your entire application. COM will be little slower in performance, but it will be more organized and good design pattern to develop.
