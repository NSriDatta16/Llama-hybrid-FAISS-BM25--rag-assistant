Problems with drag'n'drop from IE

My question is really simple and I don't know whether I am missing something or it is simply not allowed. I am trying to accept any content that has been selected in IE and dragged onto my app. All events fire as they should, and I am starting to analyze the content that I have received and this is where the fun begins. When I ask for e.Data.GetFormats() in the string array, I can see clearly Text, HTML Format and Rich Text Format amongst other types. But when I try to e.Data.GetDataPresent("Text") it returns false. Funny enough, when I try e.Data.GetData("Text") I get null too. (Was expected though) My question is, should I be using something different to handle dragged content from IE? Or simply I can't access the data because it is from Internet Zone? I forgot to add so later edit: - this is a .NET 2.0 Windows app and not asp.net nor a website :) Thank you
