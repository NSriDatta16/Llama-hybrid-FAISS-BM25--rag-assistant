Data splitting often requires a sample size exceeding 20,000 to work properly, i.e., to be stable. Otherwise re-splitting the data will result in arbitrary changes of the model and also of the validation stats. And note that decision trees are not competitive with logistic regression. The bootstrap or repeated cross-validation are preferred. See my RMS book and course notes . In terms of what you can do before model validation, anything that is masked to Y is fair game. So you can do descriptive statistics that do not examine associations between X and Y.
