Measuring what's 'lost' in PCA dimensionality reduction?

I'm working with multiple time series signals ${\{X_i\}}$ and one method to remove suspected noise is with PCA. But unlike most methods which remove the components with least variance, we remove much more substantial components (often the second or third). This is often done because empirically it's been shown to improve results in certain analyses (like simple pairwise correlation) but has been detrimental to other analysis like clustering. So I was curious of general metrics to compare before and after dimensionality reduction. Would looking at things like entropy be useful?
