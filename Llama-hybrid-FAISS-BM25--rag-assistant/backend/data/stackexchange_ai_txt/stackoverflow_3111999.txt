Shared Access Signatures can be scoped at either a specific container or a specific blob. They can then specify what permissions they give (read, write, list blobs), and they can specify how long they're valid. The only way to create a SAS is to have the storage key, but anyone who has the SAS can use it to do what it allows them to. It sounds like you want to allow all your customers to write blobs but not read them? If so, a SAS that only specifies write permissions should do the trick. But I assume you also want to limit (or meter) usage by individually customers? If so, you'll probably need something active on the server (a web service?) that authorizes each use and generates a specific, short-expiry SAS to allow that operation. Then you can track and bill for each use.
