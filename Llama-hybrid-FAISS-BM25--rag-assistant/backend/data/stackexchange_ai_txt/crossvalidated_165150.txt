This seems like a challenging question to answer, but I think the current version of lme4 doesn't have MCMC anymore. A quick google search gave this blog post which seems relevant and contains some code which is likely similar to what you used. I would imagine your code looked something like this: lmer(response ~ fixed.effect + (1|Subject) + (1|Item)) When you say you can't reproduce your result - is it because an error message? Or you are getting a different result?
