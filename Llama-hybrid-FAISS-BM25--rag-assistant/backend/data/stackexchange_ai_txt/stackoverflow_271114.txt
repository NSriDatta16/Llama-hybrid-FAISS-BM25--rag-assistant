Edited to add: I should've added that I'm trying to avoid cookies/sessions because this prevents people having multiple brower windows/tabs open and manipulating different sets of search results at the same time. You can create a random token and assign it to the fragment identifier. on first page load create a token if no fragment identifier is set before navigating out, store all the temporary ajax data in a cookie with that token as index. when hitting back, if you have a fragment identifier set, load the data from the corresponding token in the cookie. you can even add a "time" field to expire tokens, etc... sample cookie (JSON): {"ajaxcache":[{"token": ,"time": ,"data": }, ... ]}
