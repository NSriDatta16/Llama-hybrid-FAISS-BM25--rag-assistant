How to edit the image correctly from sd card and save it back

My application accesses the camera and captures the picture then saves it back in sdcard . The problem is that image is quite big around 1500X2500 px and 500kb in size. I have to upload the image to server. So I thought of editing the image but I want to edit the image in correct composition i.e. correct height:width ratio so that image doesn't looks odd The code which I am using: FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("/mnt/sdcard/DCIM/1302779969138"); BufferedInputStream buf = new BufferedInputStream(in) Bitmap bm = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(buf); File isfile = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(),"/DCIM/1302779969138"); FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(isfile); Bitmap bitmap = null; bitmap = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(bm, 350, 350, true); bitmap.compress(CompressFormat.JPEG, 20, fout); With the above code I am able to resize the image to 350 X 350 but iI wish to scale it with only width as a parameter so that height adjusts accordingly and the image ratio remains the same Plus also mention if I should be flushing Fileoutputsteam and inputStream
