The semantic twin of is . ^_^ This is a bit facetious, but it's true. On the web, underlined text denotes a link by default; this pattern is so old and well-established that nearly every single (sighted) person on the web has automatically interned it as part of how they interact with a page. HTML5 defines slightly different meanings for and , specifically so you don't just have two tags that both do the same thing semantically. That just invites questions like yours, where you wonder why there isn't just a third way to emphasize something with an underlined presentation (or what-have-you) by default. In HTML5, still denotes emphasis. Using an changes the meaning of a sentence by putting a focus on particular words or phrases. , on the other hand, denotes importance . Marking a word or phrase as important does not change the meaning of the sentence, it merely directs your attention. As usual, the standard caveats about being rendered with italics by default and being rendered with bold text by default, but it being perfectly possible and appropriate to change the presentation of either, applies. For example, a screen reader may use different inflections for the two tags. This is the whole reason that semantics exist - so that we can allow the presenter to decide the best way to present the data; us mortal authors can't possibly get the presentation correct in every possible medium.
