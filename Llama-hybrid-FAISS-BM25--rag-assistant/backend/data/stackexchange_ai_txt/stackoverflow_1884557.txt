Did you restore this database using the Deployment Manager tool or simply by doing a SQL Restore? Doing this directly from SQL would cause issues. You'll need to delete the organization in the deployment manager and then delete the database in SQL. Then you should attach the database and recreate the organization from the deployment manager, pointing it to the existing database.
