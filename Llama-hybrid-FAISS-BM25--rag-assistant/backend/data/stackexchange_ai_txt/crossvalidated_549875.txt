There are many similar questions, although you do not seem to realize that, maybe because you insist on using random forest as a model. Maybe you should try some more standard regression model first? Then you can always, later, see if you can do better with a random forest, when you have a baseline model to compare with. At Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? , fused lasso is proposed as a solution. This is implicitly grouping together zip codes that are similar in its effect on the response variable , so you are making a hierarchy from the data, not superimposing a known hierarchy. I would start with something like that. Then, if you want to continue with random forests, you need to find an implementation that works well with categorical data with very many levels. See my answer at Random Forest Regression with sparse data in Python , where there is references to implementations which is said to work well in such a setting.
