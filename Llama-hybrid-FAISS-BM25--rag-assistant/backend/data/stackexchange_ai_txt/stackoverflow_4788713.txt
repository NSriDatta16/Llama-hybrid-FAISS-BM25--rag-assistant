Nested PreferenceScreens under a dynamic list of preferences on Android

I'm trying to create a preferences screen with a dynamic list of entries, and when clicking each of them, I have another screen of preferences. As an example, think of a list of mail accounts and each one having their account settings available. While I can create the nesting I want using just PreferenceScreens , this can't easily be scaled to multiple entries without creating the sub preferences structure in code for each one. I see several different variations throughout the Android UI. Is there a recomended way to create such a structure as this? Possibilites include: Separate, independant activities Works but is messy in my opinion Nested, code created PreferenceScreens Pain in the ass for maintainence and it means the preferences are no longer stored as XML fragments Nested, inflated PreferenceScreens I can't find a way to expand another XML file into a sub tree One "sub" PreferenceScreen that is shown using setPreferenceScreen() for each one I can't find a way to hide the "template" PreferenceScreen and it breaks the navigation. Sample XML: I want the entries under list to be dynamic and show the console preferences under each. All other ideas welcome. Thanks
