Regression Modeling Strategies and ISLR, which have already been mentioned by others, are two very good suggestions. I have a few others that you might want to consider. Applied Predictive Modeling by Kuhn and Johnson contains a number of good case studies and is pretty hands-on. Practical Data Science with R treats practical (regression) modeling in the context of its applications $-$ mostly as predictive models in a business situation. Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R by Simon Wood is a good treatment of generalized additive models and how you fit them using his mgcv package for R. It does contain some nontrivial practical examples. The use of GAM models is an alternative to figuring out the "correct" transformation as this is done in a data adaptive way via a spline expansion and penalized maximum-likelihood estimation. However, there are still other choices that need to be made, e.g. the choice of link function. The mboost package for R also fits GAM models but using a different approach via boosting. I recommend the tutorial for the package (one of the Vignettes). I will also mention Empirical Model Discovery and Theory Evaluation by Hendry and Doornik, though I have not yet read this book myself. It had been recommended to me.
