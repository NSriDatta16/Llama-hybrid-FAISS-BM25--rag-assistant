How would you explain Data Science to someone in simple layman terms?

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. But if I want to explain it to someone in simple layman terms, I can't explain the concept of Data Science to a layman or grandma . Inspired by this post & the below quote You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother. -- Albert Einstein How would you explain Data Science to a layman , probably with example?
