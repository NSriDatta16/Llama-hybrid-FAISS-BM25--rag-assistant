DataGridView Column drag and drop with Auto-horizontal scroll

Can anyone please suggest how should I implement column drag and drop (with auto scroll) feature in DataGridView. I know I can use the controll's AllowUserToDragDrop option. However, since my datagridview control has relatively large number of columns, I need an auto scroll feature which follows the current drag-drop position so that users can see the destination column(s) before dropping. I have implemented the custom drag and drop feature but still I am having problem to enable auto scroll option.
