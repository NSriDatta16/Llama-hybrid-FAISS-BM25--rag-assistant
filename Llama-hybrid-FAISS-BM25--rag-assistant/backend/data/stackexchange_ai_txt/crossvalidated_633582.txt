Actually, all this is much easier for time series than for non-time series data, because we have a very simple criterion on whether data is leaking, which is time . Simply assume you are today forecasting for the next days, weeks, months or years. You can use all information available to you today, including information about the future if it is available now, like promotional plans, or weather forecasts (not tomorrow's actual weather!). Anything that requires a working crystal ball leaks data. (Unless you do have such a working crystal ball, of course. In which case you presumably would not be hanging out on CV.) So: plotting the entire series would indeed leak data, because then you would already see tomorrow's values. It's much easier to predict tomorrow's stock market if you already see what is going to happen. Conversely, you can do anything on the training data. Test for stationarity (which I believe is overrated - modern automatic model selection methods deal with nonstationarity quite fine, Selecting ARIMA orders by ACF/PACF vs. by information criteria ), plot everything, change models, refit parameters, whatever. You may overfit. But you won't be leaking data that way. In a rolling origin exercise, your current forecasting origin defines what "today's history" is, so just walk forward and do whatever you want on the current training set. The important thing is not to look back.
