Loading resource items in iphone via itunes

I have an app that has about 60 png files and a couple of cfg files in the main bundle. Runs great in the simulator, and when I download from Xcode to iTouch. But I'm stumped on distributing to my testers. I have their provisioning profiles, etc. But when I created the app and sent it to them, it showed up as a folder (NR1.APP) with all the individual resource files under it. Do they drag this entire folder into iTunes/applications? Or is there something in xcode that creates a single binary app with all resources in it?
