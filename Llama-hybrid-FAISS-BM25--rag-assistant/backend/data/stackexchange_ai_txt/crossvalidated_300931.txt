ARMA: modelling a time series with a bimodal distribution

I have a de-trended and de-seasonalized time series, and it's distribution is not gaussian (see distribution in Figure 1). I tried modelling it with and ARMA model, but as we could expect, this model does not have good prediction capabilities (see Figure 2), especially for high values / maxima. My question is: is there a way to use auto-regresive models to model signals with bimodal distributions? If so, how can I do it in Python / R? Figure 1: Figure 2:
