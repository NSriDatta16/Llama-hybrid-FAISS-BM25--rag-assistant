These are standard requirements in Natural Language Processing so I would look in such toolkits. Since you require Java I'd start with OpenNLP: http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/ If you can look at other languages there is also NLTK (Python) Note that "your funniest guy i know" is not standard syntax and this makes it harder to process than "You're the funniest guy I know". Not impossible, but much harder. I don't know of any system that would equate "your" to "you are".
