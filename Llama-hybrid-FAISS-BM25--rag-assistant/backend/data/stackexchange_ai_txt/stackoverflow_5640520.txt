this question is about global style. So solution such as #some-id .score is NOT a solution [...] .score is NOT a solution So is there a better way? there is no answer, all the comments you got in the first answer are valid and polite, but I would tell you as a user, that you should not use !important unless in an emergency to override external code that is outwith your control, !important is for user styles CSS is a mindset, a suggestion, your request (with a please ;) to the browsers how you would like your styles displayed - at the minute you seem to be struggling between the mindsets The logical programmer side wants a "global" style, and I believe most programming languages have "globals" ? CSS is not a programming language it's a markup language. Anyway, the recent last 3-4 years CSS'ers have been encouraged to "class everything" YUI and Blueprint and other frameworks would have us do so.. but that means you should not use ID's because as you rightly point out they override.. they are the ultimate in the CSS Specificity Wars .. BUT as an efficient CSS coder you need to use ID's - that is best practice isn't it? - so if you do need to mix them then you should group your ID selectors and if necessary group the class selectors as was suggested to you there really is no answer here (except there no such thing as global styling unless you pass it down via ID's and inheritance, it's a coding preference rather than a right/wrong answer
