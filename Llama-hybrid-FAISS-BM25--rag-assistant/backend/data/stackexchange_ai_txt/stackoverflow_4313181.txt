Based on your other recent questions, I think you're trying to deal with a mixture of documents where some are in a particular namespace and some are not - so you're looking to be namespace-agnostic, right? There are a couple of things you could do. You could use a hack to strip out the namespace - but that has always struck me as a bit fragile. There are other ways to express what is semantically the same document - e.g. the whole thing could use a namespace prefix on every single element - and that trick won't work. Or you could write namespace-agnostic XPath queries. E.g. "/*[local-name()='video']/*[local-name()='subject']"
