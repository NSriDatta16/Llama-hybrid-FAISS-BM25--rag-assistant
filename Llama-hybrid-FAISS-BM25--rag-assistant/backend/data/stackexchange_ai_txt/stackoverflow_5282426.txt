Are all mouse draggable objects in HTML5 canvas based on setInterval?

I am making a geometrical optics demo in HTML5 canvas, the mouse points the light source, you can craft some barriers, javascript do the calculation work and display light and shadow on on a line behind those barriers. from those canvas drag'n'drop tutorials I found online, all of them are using setInterval() to make mouse interactions happen, which means the whole canvas is updated and re-painted all the time. This makes me feel the whole canvas business is an ugly hack. My question is: are there any other way to make mouse interactions in canvas without the setInterval() way? I want to paint the background once and only redraw the moving part while onmousemove when the mouse is actually moving. Any idea is appreciated. Thanks :)
