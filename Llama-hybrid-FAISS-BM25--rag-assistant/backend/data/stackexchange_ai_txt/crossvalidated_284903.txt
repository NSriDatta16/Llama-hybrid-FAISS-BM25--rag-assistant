How does a hidden unit in a Boltzmann Machine differ from a hidden unit in a Neural Network?

I was reading about Boltzmann Machines, and I found this: The state of a hidden unit in a Boltzmann Machine is a random variable, but in a Neural Net it is a deterministic function of the inputs. Why is the hidden unit a random variable?
