Try using the kernlab package, you can use ksvm(...,type='eps-svr') to get regression. It's smart enough to automatically select regression if given a continuous variable. A grid search for parameters usually works reasonably well. Choice of kernel can have a big impact on performance. One rules of thumb I've found is that linear kernels or lower order polynomials work ok with high dimension problems, but RBFs work better with low dimension problems. But you're still best trying everything.
