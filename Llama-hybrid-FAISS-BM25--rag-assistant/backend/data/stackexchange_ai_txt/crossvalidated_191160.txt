Interpretation of a negative price coefficient in a log model with gamma distribution

Usually demand models have negative price coefficients, which means that the higher the price, the lower the demand. Many researchers in business look at price coefficients for a "sanity check", i.e. if a price coefficient turns out to be positive, there is something fundamentally wrong with your data. I expect my demand model to follow the same logic and so far see nothing abnormal in my data to challenge that. I run a log-transformed model with gamma distribution in Stata and obtain the following coefficients: glm units price promotion ...., family(gamma) link(log) Iteration 0: log likelihood = -1968823.8 Iteration 1: log likelihood = -1940503.2 Iteration 2: log likelihood = -1940388.2 Iteration 3: log likelihood = -1940388.2 Generalized linear models No. of obs = 786339 Optimization : ML Residual df = 786305 Scale parameter = 1.465522 Deviance = 600271.2555 (1/df) Deviance = .7634077 Pearson = 1152347.561 (1/df) Pearson = 1.465522 Variance function: V(u) = u^2 [Gamma] Link function : g(u) = ln(u) [Log] AIC = 4.935332 Log likelihood = -1940388.178 BIC = -1.01e+07 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | OIM units | Coef. Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- price | -.8178826 .0084813 -96.43 0.000 -.8345057 -.8012595 promotion | .1422098 .0037951 37.47 0.000 .1347715 .1496481 ...the rest of the table not shown... The coefficients at their face value tell us that higher price leads to lower units sold, and promotion leads to higher units sold. However, since it's a log model, we must perform back-transformation of the coefficients to obtain their true value. Some people use e^beta-1 transformation. With e^(beta)âˆ’1, the price coefficient becomes gigantically negative (55% decrease in units sold for every 1 cent increase in price), which is nonsensical given my knowledge of the data. Any suggestion on the interpretation? What am I doing wrong? P.S. I use a gamma distribution model because my demand data is heavily skewed to the right. Out of Poisson, negative binomial, and gamma, the latter has the best fit.
