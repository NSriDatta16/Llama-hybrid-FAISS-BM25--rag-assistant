You can probably implement your idea by subclassing UIScrollView and then implement a different behaviour in touchedBegan/Moved/Ended , modifying the touches and passing them to the superclass if needed. Personally I think you should not introduce complex gestures. Most people already have problems with two finger gestures. It took me a year to find out that two finger tap in Maps.app also did zooming. (Maybe I'm dumb though)
