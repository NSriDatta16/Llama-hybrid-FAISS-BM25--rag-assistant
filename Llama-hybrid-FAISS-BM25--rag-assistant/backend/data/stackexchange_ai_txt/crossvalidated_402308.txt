First I would re-organise your data so that each row represents a test: SubjectID TestID IQ Social Age TestScore subject1 testA Smart Blah 71 65 subject1 testB Smart Blah 71 177 subject1 testC Smart Blah 71 49 ... subject20 testH Dumb Nice 50 50 So, we have repeated measures for SubjectID and TestID (each subject takes all tests). Thus this is a fully crossed design. One way to analyse these data would be with a mixed effects model, fitting random intercepts for Subject , but not for TestID since your research question is about the tests themselves. So TestID will be a fixed effect, and since you are interested in how the scores differ across different tests for the high/low IQ variable, you are also interested in the interaction between TestID and IQ . Age and social skills will enter the model as fixed effects too, to be treated a potential confounders (you might also want to consider treating the interaction between age and social skills as a potential confounder). So, a good starting point would be a model such as TestScore ~ TestID*IQ + Social + Age + (1|subjectID) In R, you could fit this model using the package lme4 , for example. As a further consideration you might consider using the raw IQ scores instead of categorizing them into high/low.
