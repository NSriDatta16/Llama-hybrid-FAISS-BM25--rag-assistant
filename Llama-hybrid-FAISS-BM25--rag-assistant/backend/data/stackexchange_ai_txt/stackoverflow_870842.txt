Incorrectly Embedding a Flash Movie - Guess I'm Guilty

I have tried through another user's suggestion, to use the swfobject methos of embedding Flash. I however, must not be as smart. Below is the monster I have come up with, but no movie plays, and I cannot even distinguish it as a Flash movie when I control+click (Mac)... as if it doesn't even exist. Any direction on how I could fix this would be greatly appreciated! var flashvars = { wimpyApp: "mp3s/wimpy.php", wimpySkin: "mp3s/skins/skin_transparent.xml", defaultVisualExt: "jpg" theVolume: "75" bufferAudio: "0" infoDisplayTime: "3" scrollInfoDisplay: "yes" startPlayingOnload: "yes" autoAdvance: "yes" popUpHelp: "yes" }; var params = { embed src="mp3s/wimpy_button.swf" quality="high" menu: "false" loop: "false" quality: "high" scale: "noscale" salign: "lt" bgcolor: "000000" wmode: "transparent" allowScriptAccess: "sameDomain" }; var attributes = { id: "myDynamicContent", name: "myDynamicContent" }; swfobject.embedSWF("mp3s/wimpy_button.swf", "movie", "250", "140", "9.0.0","Scripts/expressInstall.swf", flashvars, params, attributes);
