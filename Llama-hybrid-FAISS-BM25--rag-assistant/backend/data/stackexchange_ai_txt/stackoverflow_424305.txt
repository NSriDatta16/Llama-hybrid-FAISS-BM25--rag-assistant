If you goal is to share logic between controllers: add the logic to the AppController to share it with all the controllers in your app. make a component and add that to $this->components for the controllers you want to share it. Adding additional inheritance between controllers should only be concidered as a last resort, as you have to pay extra attention to how components and helpers are handled. E.g. you must manually merge $this->components & $this->helpers with the AppController and the controller you are inheriting from.
