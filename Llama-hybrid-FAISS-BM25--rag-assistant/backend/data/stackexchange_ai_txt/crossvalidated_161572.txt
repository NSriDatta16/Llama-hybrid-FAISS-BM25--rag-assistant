This is how I report output of dummy variables. Say you have following estimate and p value for a particular dummy variable. (location = California) Estimate = -0.643 p value = 8.9E-09 odds ratio = 0.53 Comment - if the record/observation has location as California, then odds of "whatever you have modeled" decrease to 0.53%. When I have to report output of more than one dummy variables, I create a table where first column is the "sensible" name of dummy variable (like location_California for this example), 2nd column is the estimate, 3rd column is the std. error, 4th column is the p value and 5th column is the comment. Hope this helps. Explanation for comment - So if you are modelling attrition, and average odds of attrition are 0.8, then if location is California for a particular record, then for that particular record, odds of attrition will become 0.8 * 0.53 = 0.424. (I do not write the "explanation part" while reporting.)
