Well, the only alternative I can think of is using the drawing API to draw a gradient stroke, calculating the offset in each frame. But it would definitely be more costly than just applying a positional transform on a display object. The tiny bit of arithmetic alone should be enough to make it slower. Your proposed solution may not seem much elegant , or efficient but as we are running in a VM highly optimized for drawing and transforming occluded vectors and bitmaps (and really undependable on every other optimization) I think the best bet would be to just trust the VM at this point. :)
