B.com is not going to be able to access cookies from A.com. I think you are confusing third-party cookies with cross-domain cookies. With a third-party cookie (which P3P is relevant to), B's content (e.g. http://b.com/foo.png ) is included on http://a.com and sets its own cookie. That doesn't allow A or B to read each other's cookies though. If you want A and B to communicate on the client side, you can use hacks like fragment id messaging , or developing functionality like postMessage
