To pile up on the other and perfectly adequate answers, examples of conditional probability models abound in linear and generalised linear models since the definition of such models is conditional on the regressors or covariates: $$Y|X \sim f(y;g(X^\text{T}\beta),\sigma)$$ And the notion of conditional probability distributions is defined in measure theory with no reference to statistics and even less to "Bayesianism". For instance, RÃ©nyi built a probability theory out of conditional versions. Note also that in formal measure theory, conditioning is with respect to a $\sigma$-field $\mathfrak{S}$ rather than to an event. The conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[X|\mathfrak{S}]$ is then a $\mathfrak{S}$-measurable function such that $$\mathbb{E}^{\mathfrak{S}}\{[X-\mathbb{E}[X|\mathfrak{S}]Z\}=0$$ for all $\mathfrak{S}$ measurable functions $Z$. (As illustrated by the concept of martingales .)
