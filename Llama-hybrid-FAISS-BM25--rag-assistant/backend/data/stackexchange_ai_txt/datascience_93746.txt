In Tableau, how can I create sub-category fields out of an overarching dimension?

I have a data set where it's more or less a star schema-like format, but in an Excel file. Don't worry about primary keys setup or any of that unless it significantly matters for answering this question. Here's a sample of the kind of issue I'm facing. How, from a table like this, would I use Tableau to search by "Cat" and "Dog" as their own fields? In the default Tableau view, they all just show up as "pet," and I can't find any way to seperate the two. I want to set up a chart with quantity of "Cat" on the X-Axis, quantity of "Dog" on the Y-Axis, and then each person graphed as a point relative to how many cats and dogs they have. No matter what I search, all I find is information about grouping sub-categories, and I can't find anything about how to create the sub-categories in the first place if they aren't given to you. Could anyone give me a hand? Name Pet Quantity Sam Cat 1 Sam Dog 2 Pat Bird 3 Bert Dog 1
