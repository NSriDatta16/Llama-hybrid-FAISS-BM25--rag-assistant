Dimensionality reduction (PCA) for plotting text documents on a graph

I have 50 text documents There are 500 possible words, after a stop list has been applied My term/document sparse matrix is therefore 50x500 I'd like to cluster these documents. One easy way to do this would be via k-means but that requires giving each document co-ordinates on a 2-d graph. I've heard that I can reduce the 500-word long vectors per document using dimensionality reduction, specifically PCA. Is it realistic that I could just reduce my 50x500 matrix to a 50x2 table and plot those values?
