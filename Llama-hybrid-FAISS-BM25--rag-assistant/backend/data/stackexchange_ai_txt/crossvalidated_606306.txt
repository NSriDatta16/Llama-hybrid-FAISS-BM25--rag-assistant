The posterior you get from the first regression fit will produce the prior for the next fit. Ridge is just a Bayes update, but of course you need to be mindful when choosing (or estimating) $\sigma $ and $\lambda.$ A normal-inverse gamma model can be used to update also the variance; but not sure how that works with $ \lambda. $ Look up Bayesian Lasso.... Likely you would need to use a Gibbs sampler for a full Bayes solution, but this should be fairly straight forward for the ridge case.
