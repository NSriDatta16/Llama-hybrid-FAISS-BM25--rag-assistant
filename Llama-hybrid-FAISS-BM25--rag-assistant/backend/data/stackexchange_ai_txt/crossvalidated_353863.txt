Random Forest does feature selection internally and is robust to redundant and irrelevant features. So while developing the model I would keep all feature. This might give a small increase in performance. Try a boosting algorithm, they often perform slightly better and probably closest one can get to the 'limit' of your features. For example Gradient Boosted Trees / xgboost.
