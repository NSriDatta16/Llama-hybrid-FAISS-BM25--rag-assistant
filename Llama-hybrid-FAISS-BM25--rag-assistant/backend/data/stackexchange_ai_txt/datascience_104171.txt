How to use pre-trained word2vec model generated by Gensim with Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

I have generated a pre-trained word2vec model using the Gensim framework ( https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/index.html#documentation ). The dataset has 507 sentiments(sentences) which are labeled as positive or negative. After performing all text processing, I used Gensim to generate the pre-trained word2Vec model. the model has 234 unique words with each vector having 300 dimension. However, I have a question. How can I use the generated word2vec embedding vectors as input to CNN?
