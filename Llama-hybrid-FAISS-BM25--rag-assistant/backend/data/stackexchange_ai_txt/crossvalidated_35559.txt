For a first book on machine learning, which does a good job of explaining the principles, I would strongly recommend Rogers and Girolami, A First Course in Machine Learning , (Chapman & Hall/CRC Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition), 2011. Chris Bishop's book, or David Barber's both make good choices for a book with greater breadth, once you have a good grasp of the principles.
