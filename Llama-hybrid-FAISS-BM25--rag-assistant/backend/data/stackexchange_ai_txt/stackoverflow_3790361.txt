Quoting from this thread Z-index is not an absolute measurement. It is possible for an element with z-index: 1000 to be behind an element with z-index: 1 - as long as the respective elements belong to different stacking contexts. When you specify z-index, you're specifying it relative to other elements in the same stacking context, and although the CSS spec's paragraph on Z-index says a new stacking context is only created for positioned content with a z-index other than auto (meaning your entire document should be a single stacking context), you did construct a positioned span: apparently IE interprets this as a new stacking context. UPDATE - Add the following css to you page #header { position:relative; z-index: 2; } #content-wrap { position:relative; }
