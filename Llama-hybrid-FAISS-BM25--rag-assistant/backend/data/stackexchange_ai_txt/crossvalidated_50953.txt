Should we always do interpolation polynomially or fill the gaps with the average value?

I have a series which takes values as 1 , 2 and 3 . It also has some NA values. The following is a sample from the series. series1 My question is how should I go about doing the interpolation for the NAs . I can just do a linear interpolation and get the result as: c(1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1) But what is the justification of doing that instead of filling the gap with the average of the extreme values of the NAs (2 and 3 in this case). c(1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1) I thought of fitting a time series but that does not seem okay to me since there is not considerable variance in data. EDIT The data were basically vehicle counts per minutes obtained from road sensors. It had few negative values because of error. We need to remove the negative values from the database. So, I converted the negative values to NA and wanted to replace them with non-negative values that make sense. At this point of time, we are not doing any further analysis on the data. We need to interpolate with reasonable values.
