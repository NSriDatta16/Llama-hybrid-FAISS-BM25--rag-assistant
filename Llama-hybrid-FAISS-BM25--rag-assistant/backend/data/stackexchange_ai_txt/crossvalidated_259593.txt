You would not want to run PCA separately on both datasets, since the resulting PCA dimensions would not be comparable. Since actually you want to know how to describe both datasets with least possible dimensions, you will combine both datasets and perform a single PCA on the combined dataset. Yet a single PCA dimension will be a linear combination of all input dimensions therefore you can not effectively exclude dimensions, but rather "summarize" your data.
