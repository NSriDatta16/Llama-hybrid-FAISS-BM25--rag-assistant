Row embedding as output of a transformer - how are they defined?

I am reading the paper Tabular transformers for modeling multivariate time series and am having issues understanding the structure in Fig. 2. In Sec. 2.2, the authors say that the field transformer processes rows individually, creating row embeddings. What exactly is a row embedding?
