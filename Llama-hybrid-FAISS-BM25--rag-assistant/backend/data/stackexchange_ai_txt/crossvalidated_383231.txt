I have recently implemented another approach inspired by this paper from Bergmeir, Hyndman and Benitez. The idea is to take a time series and first apply a transformation such as the Box Cox transformation or Yeo-johnson (which solves some problems with the Box Cox) to stabilise the variance of the series, then applying an STL decomposition on the transformed series for seasonal series or a loess decomposition to get the residuals of the series. Taking these residuals and bootstrapping them with a moving block bootstrap to generate $B$ additional series. These $B$ additional series then have the initial trend and seasonality of the starting series added back to the bootstrapped residuals before lastly inverting the power transform applied in the first step. In this way as many additional time series as needed can be generated that represent the initial time series quite well. Here is an example of the application on some real data to generate additional similar time series: Here the augmentation is shown using a Yeo-johnson transformation and not Box Cox as suggested in the original paper.
