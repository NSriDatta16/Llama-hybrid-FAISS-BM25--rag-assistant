Is it mandatory to do it that way? Hibernate is a persistence API which is intented not to care about how data is stored in no matter what DBMS engine or XML files. It is a framework to persist your objects. But it does not stop there, since you can run queries (pseudo SQL or through Criteria API), what results altogether in fact in an objet oriented data storage. JAXB is a different monster, since it is intended to persist the objects in XML format, defined by a XSD-Schema, so resulting data can be exchanging between systems sharing the same model. If storing your data in XML format is important for you, since you work with XML, maybe it has more sense to use a XML native database such as eXist , which lets you access and transform your XML data in a XML-friendly way (XSLT, XQuery, XPath).
