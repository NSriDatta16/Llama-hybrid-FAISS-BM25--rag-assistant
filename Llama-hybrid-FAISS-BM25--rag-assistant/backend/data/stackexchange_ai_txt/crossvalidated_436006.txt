Can increasing the amount of training data make overfitting worse?

Suppose I train a neural network on dataset A and evaluate on dataset B (that has a different feature distribution than dataset A). If I increase the amount of data in dataset A by a factor of 10, is it likely to decrease accuracy on dataset B?
