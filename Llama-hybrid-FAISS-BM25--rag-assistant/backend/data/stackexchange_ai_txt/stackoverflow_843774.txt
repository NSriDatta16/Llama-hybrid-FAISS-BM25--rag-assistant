debugging "register_activation_hook" in WordPress

I'm trying to learn to write a WordPress plugin by setting myself a goal of writing a user generated glossary plugin after I asked people on Twitter what would be useful (well I may as well use my learning experience to be useful for more than just me). Anyway, on installation the plugin sets up a database table, and adds some test data to it. Then when the content is displayed a foreach loop changes each phrase and replaces it with a DHTML floaty box. The problem is, however, I can't work out what's going on with the register_activation_hook ; it may be being called and the SQL is failing or it may not be being called (either way I don't have an extra table in the database after I activate the plugin). The hook looks like this: register_activation_hook(__FILE__, "bot_install"); And the bot_install code like this function bot_install() { global $wpdb; $table = $wpdb->prefix."sh_gloss"; $structure = "CREATE TABLE $table ( id INT(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, phrase VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL, desc VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, UNIQUE KEY id (id) );"; $wpdb->query($structure); // Populate table $wpdb->query("INSERT INTO $table(phrase, desc) VALUES('Scott Herbert', 'Rockstar Programmer')"); } OK so firstly please forgive the ego database entry, it's just for testing... Secondly is there something I should have seen that I've missed? And thirdly (and most importantly) how can I debug "bot_install"? Can I just add statements like: echo "in xxxx"; or will that mess up the headers (since I guess all this code is ran before the main output).
