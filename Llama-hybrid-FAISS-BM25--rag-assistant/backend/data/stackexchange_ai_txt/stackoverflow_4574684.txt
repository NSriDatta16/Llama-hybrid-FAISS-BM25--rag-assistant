Is it possible to drag a row from a JQGrid to a droppable area that isn't another JQGrid?

Hello In the JQGrid demos the drag and drop facilities show how a row can be dragged form one grid and dropped on another. I would like to be able to drag a row (or more specifically a cell) onto a droppable element that isn't a grid. Is that possible? Thanks
