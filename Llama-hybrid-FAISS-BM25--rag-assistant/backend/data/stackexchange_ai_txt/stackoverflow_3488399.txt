In HTML all line breaks are treated as white space: A line break is defined to be a carriage return ( &#x000D; ), a line feed ( &#x000A; ), or a carriage return/line feed pair. All line breaks constitute white space. And white space does only separate words and sequences of white space is collapsed: For all HTML elements except PRE , sequences of white space separate "words" (we use the term "word" here to mean "sequences of non-white space characters"). […] […] Note that a sequence of white spaces between words in the source document may result in an entirely different rendered inter-word spacing (except in the case of the PRE element). In particular, user agents should collapse input white space sequences when producing output inter-word space. […] This means that line breaks cannot be expressed by plain characters. And although there are certain special characters in Unicode to unambiguously separate lines and paragraphs, they are not specified to do this in HTML too: Note that although &#x2028; and &#x2029; are defined in [ISO10646] to unambiguously separate lines and paragraphs, respectively, these do not constitute line breaks in HTML […] That means there is no plain character or sequence of plain characters that is to mark a line break in HTML. And that’s why there is the BR element . Now if you want to use &br; instead of , you just need to declare the entity br to represent the value : "> Having this additional entity named br declared, a general-purpose XML or SGML processor will replace every occurrence of the entity reference &br; with the value it represents ( ). An example document: "> ]> My first HTML document Hello &br;world!
