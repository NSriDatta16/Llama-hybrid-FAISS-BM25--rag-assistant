How to connect a button to a method on Mac OS X

I am used to programming for the iPhone. There, I would connect a button to an action, and then a method by creating the method like so: -(IBAction) DoStuff{â€¦} . Then I would make an outlet for the button, and then the actual button in Interface Builder. I would then connect the button to the outlet, and then connect the button to the action by clicking on the circle next to Touch Up Inside and drag it over to File's Owner and select my action. I am new to programming for the Mac, so I tried to drag from performClick to the file I wanted, but it wouldn't let me make the connection. Do I have to do this programmatically or what? How do I get this button to trigger an action in my code?
