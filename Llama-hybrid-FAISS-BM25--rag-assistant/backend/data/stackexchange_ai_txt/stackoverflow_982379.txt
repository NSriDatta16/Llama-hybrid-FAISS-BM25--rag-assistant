From the point of view of the job of just 'including' some dynamic/static content on a web page, you're correct. However there are a number of conveniences implemented, such as support for personalisation of the portlet (at the portlet/'include' level) and storing this info, a more rigid workflow for configuring what is displayed in the portlet and so on. Plus obviously there's all the portlet arrangement code that you would have to write otherwise. Some portlet servers do a lot on the client side for arrangement (drag and drop of portlets etc).
