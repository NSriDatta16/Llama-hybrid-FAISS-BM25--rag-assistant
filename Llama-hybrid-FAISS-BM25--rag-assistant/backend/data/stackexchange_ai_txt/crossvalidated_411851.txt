How to determine $p$ and $q$ in my ARIMA model from these ACF and PACF plots?

I have converted stock price index time series data into stationary series by differencing once, so $d=1$ . I also have removed the seasonal component of the data. I want to develop a model for forecasting future values of SPX. These are PACF and ACF plots obtained. I am not able to determine the values of $p,q$ for ARIMA modeling. I have read a little about minimum AIC values as well; however, we need a rough estimate of $p,d,q$ to make guesses towards the correct model in that as well.
