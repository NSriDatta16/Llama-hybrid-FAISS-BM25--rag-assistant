There are two studies that seem to do exactly what you want to do, both published in top field journals: Avramov (2002): Stock return predictability and model uncertainty, Journal of Financial Economics, 64, pp. 423-458 Cremers (2002): Stock return predictability: A Bayesian model selection perspective, Review of Financial Studies, 15, pp. 1223-1249. Here, I only have a link to the working paper version. The problem you face is that the model space is too large to compute all models in reasonable time. This is a well-known problem in the Bayesian Model Averaging literature, but there are computational solutions for it, such as a MCMC algorithm. In R , there is for example the BMS package which implements such methods (see homepage ). I'm sure that the above references also provide helpful ideas on how you could solve your problem.
