I agree with bdumitriu's answer : a simple zip of a jre is enough, unless you want to link that jre to: default java (meaning you must add java.exe of the unzipped jre to the path, before any other java path references) default java for some script (you could define JAVA_HOME as referencing your new unzipped jre, but that may have side effects on other script also using JAVA_HOME before that new JRE) file associations like .jnlp or .jar files (this requires some registry modifications ) browser java plugin registration (which requires also registry modifications) If the last two points do not interest you on the desktop concerned by this deplyment, a simple zip is enough.
