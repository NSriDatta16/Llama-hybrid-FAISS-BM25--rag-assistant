Have you tried adding dropout regularization? This is essentially removing a certain percentage of the neurons on every training iteration, resulting in a network less sensitive to the activations of specific neurons, therefore less fragile and sensitive to details in images in the training set. It's perhaps explained better here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers . In the case of TensorFlow it's just a layer that you can stick between two arbitrary layers.
