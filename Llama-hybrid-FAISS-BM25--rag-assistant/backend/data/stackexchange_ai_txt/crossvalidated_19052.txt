Good resources about reversible-jump MCMC sampler in R

Please help me to find out simple (I mean useful with little knowledge on Bayesian statistics) resources: To learn MCMC and perform general linear or mixed models To learn different sampling techniques including reverse jump sampler. Also, I want implement these methods using R base or R packages. I can use SAS and any other specially designed software, however I have R as preference. Example codes to perform MCMC and reversible jump sampler.
