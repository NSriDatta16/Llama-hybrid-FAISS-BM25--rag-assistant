Optimal predictive factors

Assume I am interested in predicting a time series variable $y_t$ using a vector of possible predictors $X_t$ of dimension $N_x$ . I am interested in finding the optimal $N_z predictive factors stacked into a vector $Z_t$ . More formally the problem is $$Z_t=AX_t+\epsilon_t$$ $$y_{t+1}=BZ_t+e_{t+1}$$ Here the dimension of $A$ is $N_z\times N_x$ . For example $N_x$ could be 200 and $N_z$ 2 so the method would select two factors from $X_t$ that are optimal for predicting $y_t$ . Has this type of problem been considered in the literature? How would I go about solving such a problem?
