multiple uiimageview touch

I am just trying to plan a new app... I want to have a series of images which a user can drag around the screen and drop where they want. I'm thinking that I will have an array (NSMutableArray) of all the images. when the app loads, it will draw these out to a scrollable UIView... then the app will know which a user has pressed and dragged in to the main view. I can code it so one image can be dragged, but I'm not sure how to apply the same code to n number of images. For example, in my view controller, I set IBOutlet UIImage *image which in IB I can link and control.... but how do you change this to apply to any number of images? I've tried searching for this all morning but haven't had much luck. I am thinking I'd need to apply a class to each image as I draw it out of the array. I'm just after a little advice here really - maybe pointing me in the right direction? Thanks for any info!!
