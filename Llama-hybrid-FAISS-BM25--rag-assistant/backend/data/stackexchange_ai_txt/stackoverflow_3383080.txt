You can actually modify these, but only on a per-element basic as far as I know. But you could easily create your own $.fn.draggable wrapper, and just call the original wrapper and run this: draggableElement.data('draggable')._generatePosition = fn As JÃ¶rn Zaefferer pointed out, you could also modify the draggable prototype, by using $.ui.draggable.prototype._generatePosition = fn
