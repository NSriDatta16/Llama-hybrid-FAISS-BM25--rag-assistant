Multiple fragment identifiers correct in URL?

I stumbled across a site that uses multiple fragment identifiers in their URLs, like http://www.ejeby.se/#newprodukt#produkt#1075#1 (no, it is not my site, but I am linking to it, which brings problems for me). But is this really correct? It does seem to cause problems for Safari and possibly also Internet Explorer (hearsay, I have not tried IE myself). Isn't the fragment identifier supposed to uniquely identify one location in the document? Is this a bug in Safari or is it www.ejeby.se that uses fragment idenifiers in a wrong way? Edit: Seems that the problem for Safari is that it escapes all # but the first in the URL. The other browsers do not do this. Correct behaviour or not?
