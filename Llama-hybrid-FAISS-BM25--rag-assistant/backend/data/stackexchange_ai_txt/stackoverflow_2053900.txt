How to undo/redo a sortable action in jqueryui?

I have a sortable list(jquery ui), could you advise if it is possible to implement 'undo/redo' base on sortable? Imagine that, a item is dragged to a new placeholder, then I click "undo" button and the item will move to its original position. If I click "redo" button and the item will move to that new placeholder. Maybe someone knows how to do this or maybe something else. thanks in advance.
