Difference between heteroscedasticity and ARCH effects?

What is the difference between heteroscedasticity and ARCH effects? For example in R you can do a Breusch-Pagan Test to test for heteroscedasticity, and a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test for autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) effects. Do these tests not test for the exact same thing?
