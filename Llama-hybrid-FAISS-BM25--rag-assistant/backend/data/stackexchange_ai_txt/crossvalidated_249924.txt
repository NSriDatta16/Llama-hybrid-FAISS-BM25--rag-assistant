What's the target in sequence to sequence model

In neural language modeling, the target for each time step x(t) is the probability of x(t+1). But for sequence-to-sequence model, what's the target at each time step? Or, there is no target until the sentence end? If so, how to propagate error through time? It just propagate error once? I'm could't find the answer from papers since most of them don't introduce these details. Thanks a lot!
