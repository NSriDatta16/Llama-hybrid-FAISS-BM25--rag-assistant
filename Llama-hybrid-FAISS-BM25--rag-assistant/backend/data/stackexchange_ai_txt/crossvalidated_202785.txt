How to do postal addresses fuzzy matching?

I would like to know how to match postal addresses when their format differ or when one of them is mispelled. So far I've found different solutions but I think that they are quite old and not very efficient. I'm sure some better methods exist, so if you have references for me to read, I'm sure it is a subject that may interest several persons. The solution I found (examples are in R) : Levenshtein distance, which equals the number of characters you have to insert, delete or change to transform one word into another. agrep("acusait", c("accusait", "abusait"), max = 2, value = TRUE) ## [1] "accusait" "abusait" The comparison of phonemes library(RecordLinkage) soundex(x ## [1] "A223" "A223" "A123" The use of a spelling corrector (eventually a bayesian one like Peter Norvig's) , but not very efficient on address I guess. I thought about using the suggestions of Google suggest, but likewise, it is not very efficient on personal postal addresses. You can imagine using a machine learning supervised approach but you need to have stored the mispelled requests of users to do so which is not an option for me.
