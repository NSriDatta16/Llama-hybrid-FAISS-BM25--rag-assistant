HMC: How many dimensions is too many?

From what I have read Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is the "goto" MCMC method when your problem is high dimensional. Practically speaking, how many dimensions 10's, 100's, 1,000's, 10,000's, 100,000's, ..., is too many? Computational cost will no doubt become an issue and I suppose the model being used is important to consider but those things aside, is there a practical limit to the number of dimensions when it comes to getting good samples from the desired distribution using HMC ? Also, how can we monitor the convergence (or lack there of I guess) for problems where the number of parameters is far too many to check trace plots, running means, autocorrelations, etc. for individual parameters? Update: Found this post which mentions some non-visual diagnostics
