Detecting voice call support in mobile devices

When developing a mobile website, I want to display features based upon device capabilities. Specifically, I want to have a "Call us" button that uses the "tel:" protocol (e.g. tel:5551234) to initiate a phone call. However, not all mobile devices support phone calls, such as the iPad. How can I programmatically (either server or client side) determine whether a mobile user agent supports voice calling ? I'm trying to avoid blacklisting based on user agent for maintainability reasons.
