My advice to you is to find out exactly what Data Scientist do day to day and take courses on the fundamentals of those specified activities. Try and find articles and blog post like this one: What is hardcore data scienceâ€”in practice? . Additionally, you should strive to become an expert in a specific domain. In other words, focus on Data Science as applied to ???, some field of study for which you have a true passion for. I think the article referenced above and others like it will point you in the right direction for making solid choices for CS focus. Your minor should be something you are deeply interested in. It should be something you can apply your data science focus on. It should be something that produces data products. Products which you can use to form a portfolio. A portfolio which you can use to demonstrate to employers that you know what data science is and how it is practiced. This last point is paramount, as you will not have a vetted program, form your university, that you can point to, which indicates you have picked up the essentials.
