Decision rule as a hyper-parameter in LASSO

I have a question that is related to the following: Is decision threshold a hyperparameter in logistic regression? but would like some clarification. The general consensus is that the decision rule is not a hyper-parameter in the strictest sense that it won't affect the flexibility of the logistic regression. I have a related question in the context of LASSO logistic regression. In the LASSO we optimize lambda and create a model, then we optimize the decision rule. My question is: wouldn't this be similar to optimizing say: mtry in a random forest and then using that static value of mtry and optimizing the number of trees after (which is the incorrect method)? What if we were to optimize lambda and arrive at lambda=0.01 and then optimize our decision rule at 0.6, however if we optimized them at the same time we may have arrived at a lambda=0.05 and a decision rule of 0.65 given us better performance. I suppose the overall point and question is, in the face of optimizing hyper-parameters as well as the decision rule, is the decision rule a hyper-parameter in the strict sense?
