Bayesian optimization over binary vectors is still a problem of major research. One potential way was proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08838.pdf . The key idea here is to represent the surrogate model as a second order model $\sum_i \alpha_j x_j + \sum_i \sum_j \alpha_{ij} x_i x_j$ which allows the acquisition function optimization to be approximately solved by a semidefinite relaxation. Regarding your constraints $|True \in S| \geq threshold$ , local search allows you to search over vectors which satisfies the constraints but might be sub-optimal. The source code of above paper is available here https://github.com/baptistar/BOCS .
