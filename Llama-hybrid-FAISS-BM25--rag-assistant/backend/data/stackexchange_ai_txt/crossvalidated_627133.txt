Average Marginal Effect interpretation for probit Model

I'd like to have your feedback about the interpretation of the Average Marginal Effect (AME) for a probit model. Suppose we have the following model \begin{equation} P(y=1|x)= \Phi(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 \text{ln}(x_2)) \end{equation} where $\Phi$ is the cdf of the standard normal. To compute the marginal effect of $x_1$ on the probability that $y$ takes value one: \begin{equation} \frac{\partial P(y=1|x)}{\partial x_1} = \phi(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 \text{ln}(x_2)) \hat{\beta}_1 \end{equation} For a discrete change in $\Delta x_1=1$ , the marginal effect reads \begin{equation} \Delta P(y=1|x) = \phi(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 \text{ln}(x_2)) \hat{\beta}_1 \end{equation} The AME is obtained by computing the effect for each observation, using their specific x-values, and then reporting the sample mean of the effects. If the AME for $x_1$ is equal to 0.09, this means that, if $x_1$ increases by one unit, the probability that $y=1$ is 0.09 higher. Is that correct? If $x_1$ denotes a growth rate, say $x_1=g_x$ , and the AME for $x_1$ is now 3.5, this means that a for 1% increase in $x_1$ , the probability that $y=1$ takes on value 1 is 0.035 higher. Is that correct? Now, for $x_2$ , the marginal effect on the probability that $y$ takes value one is \begin{equation} \frac{\partial P(y=1|x)}{\partial x_2} = \phi(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 \text{ln}(x_2)) \frac{\hat{\beta}_2}{x_2} \end{equation} Replacing $\partial$ with $\Delta$ and multiplying the left and the right by $\Delta x_2 \times 100$ \begin{equation} \Delta P(y=1|x) = \frac{\phi(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 \text{ln}(x_2))}{100} \hat{\beta}_2 \% \Delta x_2 \end{equation} where $\% \Delta x_2 \equiv \frac{\Delta x_2}{x_2}100$ is the percentage increase in $x_2$ . If the AME for $x_2$ is equal to 0.4, this means that if $x_2$ doubles, the probability that $y=1$ is 0.4 higher, and if $x_2$ increases by $10\%$ , the probability that $y=1$ is 0.04 higher (I don't think so, it should correspond to the increase in probability if $x_2$ increases by 172%). What's the correct interpretation? I have doubts on this point because in the linear level-log model, that's would be an approximation working only for small $\% \Delta x_2$
