That help page looks like it is an asp reference page, not an asp.net reference page. The page you want is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpresponse.cachecontrol.aspx which suggests that the valid values are those that match the httpcacheability enum. See the following page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpcacheability.aspx In particular the value you want is, I would guess, NoCache. Though you'd have to read the help to make sure that is definitely the one you want.
