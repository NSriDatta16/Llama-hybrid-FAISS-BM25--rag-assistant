Yes- there are many versions of multi-participant rating systems, many of which are modified versions of the base Elo system (one of Elo's great strengths is that it can be readily modified). One very interesting multi-participant ranking system is Microsoft's TrueSkill Ranking system based on bayesian inference of player skill. The rating is used in matchmaking and ranking of many of their online offerings. Quite a lot of other research has been done on the system. (Full disclosure: no professional relationship with Microsoft) More theoretical underpinnings and consequences of bayesian approximations as applied to rating systems can be found here , here , and here .
