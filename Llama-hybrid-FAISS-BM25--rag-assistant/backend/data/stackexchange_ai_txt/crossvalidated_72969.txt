I'd suggest taking a look at http://www.amazon.com/Predictive-Analytics-Microsoft-Conrad-Carlberg/dp/0789749416 if you are restricted to Excel. There are also example R codes in the book to help transition from thinking in Excel to thinking in R. The spreadsheet examples from the book can be found here: http://www.quepublishing.com/store/predictive-analytics-microsoft-excel-9780789749413 . Chapter 5 is about time series.
