A persistent data struture preserves only the previous version of itself after a change. Depending on the type of persistent data structure...you may or may not be able to modify previous versions. An immutable type can not be changed at all. Functional Languages primarily rely on Immutable types (also called values) for their data storage (even though you can use Mutable types in some...but it has to be done explicitly).
