You can use malloc (not mxMalloc ) but the memory must be managed manually (e.g. You must call free ; it's not optional like mxFree is). You could also try compiling using c++ and boost's shared/scoped pointers. Your mexFunction signature will need extern "C" prepended to it. One reason you may be running out of memory is that your arrays are too long. mxArray must be contiguous data. So mxMalloc ing them and the mxFree ing them could fragment your memory space. While std::vector must be contiguous too, std::list doesn't have to be. Something like the original STL's rope class could be a good implementation too.
