Put Components which may be patched individually inside their own Fragments It goes for both making product installers and patches that if you include any component in a fragment, you must include all of the components in that fragment. In the case of building an installer, if you miss any component references, you'll get a linking error from light.exe. However, when you make a patch, if you include a single component reference in a fragment, then all changed components from that fragment will show up in your patch. like this: instead of this: Also, when patching using the "Using Purely WiX" topic from the WiX.chm help file, using this procedure to generate the patch: torch.exe -p -xi 1.0\product.wixpdb 1.1\product.wixpdb -out patch\diff.wixmst candle.exe patch.wxs light.exe patch.wixobj -out patch\patch.wixmsp pyro.exe patch\patch.wixmsp -out patch\patch.msp -t RTM patch\diff.wixmst it's not enough to just have the 1.1 version of the product.wixpdb built using the components in separate fragments. So be sure to correctly fragment your product before shipping.
