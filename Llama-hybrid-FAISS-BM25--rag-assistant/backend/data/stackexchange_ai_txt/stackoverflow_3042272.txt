It's probably easiest to set up a local mail system with a mail retrieval agent (MRA) and mail delivery agent (MDA). A common combination is fetchmail for an MRA and either procmail or maildrop for an MDA. The MRA downloads mail from your account (POP3, IMAP, etc.), and the MDA processes it to figure out what mailbox it belongs in. I know at least maildrop, but probably procmail as well, supports running arbitrary scripts on the messages, so you could use that to process each e-mail
