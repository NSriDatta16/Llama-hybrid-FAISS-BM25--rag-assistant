SRP: Why use instance field values instead of parameters?

I've just read SRP, as easy as 123â€¦ , and all of it resonates with me except one paragraph, in a section named "Cohesion" (I've claimed before to "get" Cohesion, but this talk of parameters vs instance fields gives me pause...): Take your class. Look at your methods. Do they have parameters or are they using instance fields? If they are using parameters, remove them. Make them instance fields. Do you end up with methods that only use one of the five instances? That most likely is a warning of the low cohesion that exists between that method and your class. Is this removal of parameters merely a temporary exercise to reveal methods which are approaching static-ability (low cohesion), with the idea being that you return to the use of parameters when you're finished? Or is the preference for instance fields over parameters an actual design technique to maintain high cohesion? Have I somehow taken the quote out of context?
