RBF network normalization, standardization in MATLAB

First of all, is it good to do normalization and standardization for Radial basis neural network? Does MATLAB do that automatically for RBF? I've read that MATLAB does normalization and standardization for Feedforward neural network, but I am not sure If it does for RBF too. I use nntool and I don't see if MATLAB does normalization or not.
