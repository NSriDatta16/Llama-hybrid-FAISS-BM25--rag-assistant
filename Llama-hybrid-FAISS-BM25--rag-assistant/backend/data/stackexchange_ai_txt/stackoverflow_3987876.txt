If you're using JSON already then it's plain old text and you don't need fancy inter-process mechanisms to serialise it. Personally I'd favour Parcelable over Serializable any day of the week - unless you're writing to permanent storage - but to be sure I'd need to know a little more about the problem you're trying to solve... What is activity 2 going to be doing with the data from activity 1? Will activity 2 be okay using it's own copy of the data, or would you expect changes it makes to be visible to activity 1?
