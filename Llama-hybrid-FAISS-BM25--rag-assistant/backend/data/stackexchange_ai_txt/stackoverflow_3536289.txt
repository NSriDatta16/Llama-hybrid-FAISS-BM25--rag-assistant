It probably relates to the later point: Do not explicitly send events up the responder (via nextResponder); instead, invoke the superclass implementation and let the UIKit handle responder-chain traversal. If you handle touchesBegan:withEvent: and touchesEnded:withEvent:, what does UIView do with touchesMoved:withEvent:? Is it supposed to forward it up the responder chain?
