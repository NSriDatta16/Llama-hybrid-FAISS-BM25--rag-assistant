Here's one solution I found: http://www.access-programmers.co.uk/forums/showpost.php?p=272455&postcount=2 It requires writing a VBA function. I don't know of a way to do it with straight SQL in Access. Public Function Conc(Fieldx, Identity, Value, Source) As Variant Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset Dim SQL As String Dim vFld As Variant Set cnn = CurrentProject.Connection Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset vFld = Null SQL = "SELECT [" & Fieldx & "] as Fld" & _ " FROM [" & Source & "]" & _ " WHERE [" & Identity & "]=" & Value ' open recordset. rs.Open SQL, cnn, adOpenForwardOnly, adLockReadOnly ' concatenate the field. Do While Not rs.EOF If Not IsNull(rs!Fld) Then vFld = vFld & ", " & rs!Fld End If rs.MoveNext Loop ' remove leading comma and space. vFld = Mid(vFld, 3) Set cnn = Nothing Set rs = Nothing ' return concatenated string. Conc = vFld End Function You can then use it in a query like this: SELECT [tblData].[ID], Conc("Field1","ID",[ID],"tblData") AS Field1, Conc("Field2","ID",[ID],"tblData") AS Field2 FROM tblData GROUP BY [tblData].[ID]; Edit So your first query would look something like this: SELECT [Lab Occurrence Form].[1 0 Preanalytical (Before Testing)] as Lom1, Conc("NameOfTheFieldToConcatenate", "[Lab Occurrence Form].[1 0 Preanalytical (Before Testing)]", [Lab Occurrence Form].[1 0 Preanalytical (Before Testing)], "[Lab Occurrence Form]"), Count([Lab Occurrence Form].[1 0 Preanalytical (Before Testing)]) AS [Count1] FROM [Lab Occurrence Form] WHERE ((([Lab Occurrence Form].[Occurrence Date]) Between [Forms]![Meeting_Reasons_Frequency]![Text4] And [Forms]![Meeting_Reasons_Frequency]![Text2])) GROUP BY [Lab Occurrence Form].[1 0 Preanalytical (Before Testing)] HAVING Count([Lab Occurrence Form].[1 0 Preanalytical (Before Testing)])<>0 Note that you may have to tweak the Conc() function a little to get the wildard compare you want instead of an exact match on the LOM field.
