Very Interesting problem. With my limited experience my first comment is that this problem would not be having many shortcuts. However I have done this kind of exercise. I would suggest the following points: 1) make a list of the variables that could be related-- this means that dont try to relate in your mind every x with y. Make a business case and ask yourself as to why could be there a pattern between x and y..example age could be shoowing pattern with salary( generally people who are more aged earn more) but lets say in insurance "my age may not be related with my agents age"( though actually it could be ) 2) make a cross tab of these x and y.all possible Xs and Ys 3) read carefully through these cross tabs if there is a trend coming out from population...example has mean of salary gone up with age 4) finally make a category of those X( though this step is not necessary) and compare it against the whole dataset..you might see a different trend of these few rows as compared to the whole dataset. Hope this helps.
