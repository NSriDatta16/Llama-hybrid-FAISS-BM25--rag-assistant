I'd look in my apache logs for the URL with the null characters as see what IP addresses they're coming from, and what the referrer is for each page. If I didn't have access to my apache logs I'd Create a Magento Module with an event handler that fires on every page requests (one of the controller page requests) In this even handler check to see if the URL has a null character on the end If it does, log the contents of $_SERVER somewhere This should give you enough information to diagnose the problem.
