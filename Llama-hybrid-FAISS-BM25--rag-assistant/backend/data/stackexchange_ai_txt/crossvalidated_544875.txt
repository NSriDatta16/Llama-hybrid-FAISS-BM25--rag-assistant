Properly set-up indepenent variables for polynomial logistic regression

I would like to conduct an analysis to identify factors that affect whether or not a first purchase was made. In this context, there are three outcomes I want to predict: Did not buy anything Did buy something within first week Did buy something between first week and first month The question I have arises from how to prepare some of the independent variables, in particular having received a particular marketing email. In this context, would it be correct (in light of the outcomes we want to predict) to label the marketing e-mail variable as such: Has received a marketing e-mail before the first purchase (this includes all those, who have received a marketing e-mail but either did not buy something, bought something within the first week or bought something within the first month) Has not received a marketing e-mail before the first purchase (this again includes all those who have not received a marketing e-mail but either did not buy something, bought something within the first week or bought something within the first month) or do I need to somehow differentiate this independent variable further given that it will be a mix of those who have made a purchase and those who have not made a purchase? Any input and suggestion is much appreciated!
