I can't speak to Mercurial, but Mylyn is the unchallenged king of integrating Eclipse and various bug trackers. Regardless of how good your issue tracker's web interface may be, Mylyn makes it a lot easier to create, organize and (most importantly) work on incoming issues. It has excellent support for both Bugzilla and Trac. Its Jira support is a bit behind, but it's not bad. Additionally, there are a small horde of third-party plugins which add Mylyn support for various issue trackers (such as Mingle).
