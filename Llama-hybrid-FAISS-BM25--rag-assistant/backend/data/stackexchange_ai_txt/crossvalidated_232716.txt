Identifying health profiles from a large datset

I have three concepts that I am trying to relate to each other. Health/Cognition/Lifestyle For each of the concepts I have over twenty variables from about 20,000 participants. Lets use memory as an example of cognition. In my data I am looking for the health profile that has the biggest negative effect on memory. As a hypothetical example, being overweight AND having poor diet AND being over 65 years old is a worse combination then any alone. Then I want to identify what lifestyle behavioral variables moderate these effects to protect memory. For instance, what combination of behaviors when added together form a factor that interacts with the health factor to decrease the negative effect of this health factor on memory? Someone may be overweight, eat poorly and be over 65 BUT they play bridge, go to the theater and visit friends every day. The combined effect of these lifestyle behaviors minimizes the negative effect of the health factor on memory. Can someone help me to identify the correct path for addressing these questions please? As far as I know SEM and PCA help identify reflective factors, the shared variance between variables. I am interested in effects(variables) that combine to create a formative factor. Thank you
