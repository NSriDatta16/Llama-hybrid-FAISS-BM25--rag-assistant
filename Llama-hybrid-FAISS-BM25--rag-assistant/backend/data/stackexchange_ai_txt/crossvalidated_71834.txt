Bayesian approach on games of chance with physical devices

Suppose we alter side 6 of a die to appear more than 1/6th of the time. We do not know the actual proportion of the time each side of the die will appear because all or some of the other 5 sides do not have the 1/6 proportion too. What do we need to be 99% confidence of each of the 6 sides of this altered die? How does the a priori knowledge help us to determine how biased it is? What are the benefits of using Bayes instead of classic study?
