You will want to use a Transfer Function model. Regression ignores the component of time (ie autoregression). You will want to include holiday variables. Chapter 10 of Box-Jenkins text book is called "Transfer Function" models. These are the guys that created the methodology called ARIMA(univariate) and the this methodology. The idea is to create a model for each of the causals (ie prewhitening) and then take those residuals to find correlations against the Y variable. You can read more about "time series" methods here http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/toolaids/pff/pmc.pdf
