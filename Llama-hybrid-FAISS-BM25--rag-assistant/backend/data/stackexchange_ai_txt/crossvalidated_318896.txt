No. The connection between ordinal logistic regression and heteroscedasticity is subtle. The rationale for using ordinal logistic regression is that the probability model for the outcome is a graded response realized by arbitrary ranked thresholds of a latent logistic distribution function. A consequence of this model is that in values predicted close to the referent response level or close to the maximal response level have very low variance. The purpose of testing in general is not to determine that two groups come from the same population. Statisticians all generally agree the p-value cannot be used as a measure of similarity.
