Feature selection for Logistic Regression

I am running a churn prediction model for an online ecommerce company. Since, volume of the data is high. I have historical data of around (~1M customers). On basis of market understanding I have selected 12 continuous variables as features. As a first step of logistic regression I have to do feature selection of which all features should be considered in logistic regression. I am doing so by running logistic regressions keeping only 1 feature (Hence, running 12 logistic regressions). With the objective that I will select features which has p-value My questions is this right approach to do feature selection when data volume is high?
