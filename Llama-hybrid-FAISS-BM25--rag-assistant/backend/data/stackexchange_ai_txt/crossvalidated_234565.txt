In general, when the respective null is false, expect decay of the p-values as in the figure below, where I report average p-values from little simulation study for multiples of samples of size n=25 ranging from bb*n=25 to bb*n=29*25 for a simple linear regression coefficient equal to 0.1 and error standard deviation of $\sigma_u=0.5$ . Since the p-values are bounded from below by zero, the decay must ultimately flatten out. The 90% confidence interval (shaded blue area) indicates that, moreover, the variability of the p-values also decreases with sample size. Evidently, when either $\sigma_u$ is smaller or $n$ larger, the p-values will be close to zero faster when increasing bb , so that the appearance of the plot will be flatter. Code: reps
