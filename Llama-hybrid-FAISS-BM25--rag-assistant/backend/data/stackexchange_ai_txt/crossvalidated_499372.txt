What is the difference between segmenting and clustering ? First, let us define the two terms: Segmentation partitioning of some whole, some object, into parts vased on similarity and contiguity. See Wikipedia which gives as an example Segmentation (biology), the division of body plans into a series of repetitive segments and also Oxford . Clustering Wikipedia says the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters) . This is, in some sense, closely associated. If we consider some whole ABC as consisting of many atoms , like a market consisting of customers, or a body consisting of body parts, we can say that we segment ABC but cluster the atoms. But it seems that segmentation is more used when there is some concept of (spatial) contiguity of the atoms within the whole. There seems to be confusion of this usage. On this site customer segmentation is often used, it should be market segmentation . The customers are not segmented (hopefully!), they are clustered. Wikipedia got it right . Use in connection with time series With multiple (parallel) time series, we can cluster the series into groups of similar series, while segmentation typically refers to partitioning a single series in similar, contiguous, parts. See the tag timeseries-segmentation and this list of posts about time series clustering . That points to a connection to change-point -detection. See Wikipedia . On this site there are many posts on image-segmentation .
