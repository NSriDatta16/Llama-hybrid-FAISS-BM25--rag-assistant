Interpreting coefficient of a logarithmic coefficient in a logistic regression

I have a regression with a log-transformed independent variable, and I would like to know the proper way to explain its effect on my binary dependent variable. For example, say the equation is: (binary_variable)i = b0 + -0.03(log_variable)i Does a 1% increase in log_variable mean a 0.03% (or 0.0003%?) reduction in binary_variable? Thanks
