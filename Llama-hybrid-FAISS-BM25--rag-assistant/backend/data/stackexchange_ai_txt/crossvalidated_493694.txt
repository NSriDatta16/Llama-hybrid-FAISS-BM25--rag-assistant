How to decide whether to use regression or classification model?

I just started machine learning , and I was confused about which model to use, regression or classification , when we have a target variable like age or a variable like movie rating , which may have any value between 1 and 10. In general , I am not able to decide whether to consider these variables as categorical or continuous, even when they are present as features.
