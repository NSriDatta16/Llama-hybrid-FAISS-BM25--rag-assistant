Question about performing k-fold CV with caret

I have read the help manual of caret carefully: see A Short Introduction to the caret Package. In its example, I found it split the data with createDataPartition before a model training. library(caret) library(mlbench) data(Sonar) set.seed(107) inTrain And does it make the repeated 10-fold CV with only the 75% data in the training set? ctrl So, I think a k-fold CV make the "k-1" data into the training set and "1" data into the testing set, and all sets of data should be put into the testing data set at least once? The code above uses only the 75% data in the whole model training process and the 10-fold CV process, and the rest (25%) only in the last prediction process. Do I understood these codes correctly? I think the process in the caret manuals is different from the principal idea of k-fold CV, which really confused me. And I want to perform 10-fold CV for model comparison, including rpart, adaboost, bagging, svm and kknn. Can the functions in caret make sense? How can I do it?
