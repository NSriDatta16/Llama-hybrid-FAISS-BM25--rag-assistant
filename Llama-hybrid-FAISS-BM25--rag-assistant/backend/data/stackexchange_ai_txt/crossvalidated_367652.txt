It's been a while but I try it anyway ... My notes say concerning 2 categorical variables: # Independence testing & comparison of samples (tab.dat $A, dat$ B)) assocplot(tab.dat) (prop.dat And for logistic regression I found this example with residual analysis ( http://stat.ethz.ch/Teaching/Datasets/WBL/kevlar49.dat ): head(dat $Spool Spool) dd = 24, ] # a) Adapt a linear model and do a residual analysis: # log(Failure) = ßo + ß_1Stress + ß_2Spool + E, E~N(0, sigma^2) # In the following subtasks we want to do the Weibull regression. require(regr0) (r.dat I don't remember exactly, how I got to the conclusion of violated independence by looking at the residual analysis plots ... maybe someone else can help out?
