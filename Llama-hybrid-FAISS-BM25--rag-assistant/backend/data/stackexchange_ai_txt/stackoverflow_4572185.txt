If you're just looking to get notified of tap gestures without affecting any of the other touch behavior of the map, you'll want to use a UITapGestureRecognizer . It's super simple, just put in some code like this. UITapGestureRecognizer* tapRec = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(didTapMap:)]; [theMKMapView addGestureRecognizer:tapRec]; [tapRec release]; That will call the didTapMap whenever theMKMapView receives a tap gesture and all the pinching, and dragging gestures will still work as they did before.
