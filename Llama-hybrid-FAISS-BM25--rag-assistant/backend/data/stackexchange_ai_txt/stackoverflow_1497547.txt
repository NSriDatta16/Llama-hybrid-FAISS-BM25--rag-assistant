how to create binary of iphone application

On reading the iTunesConnect_DeveloperGuide.pdf, i came across the term binary . This is the paragraph found in the pdf: To submit your application through iTunes Connect and get it posted on the App Store successfully, make sure you have the following: Application binary (includes 57px icon), large 512px icon for use on the App Store, primary screenshot, contract information, export compliance information and applica- tion metadata It is also mentioned that the binary should be a zipped file. Can anyone please explain what is a binary and how to create one? Thanks
