forecast results does not change as the covariate variables change

I am trying to forecast a time series using the bsts package. The data is as follows: The data is collected monthly and the goal is to forecast y by v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 , v6 and v7 . y is a count variable, so I use poisson family. library(bsts) library(dplyr) data_f % select(-y) ss=AddLocalLinearTrend(list(),y=log1p(data_f_train $y)) ss=AddSeasonal(ss,log1p(data_f_train$ y),nseasons = 12, season.duration = 1) model2=bsts(y~. ,state.specification =ss,niter=100,family="poisson",data=data_f_train) pred It seems my steps is wrong completely since the forecast does not change as I change the covariate variables. > head(model2$coefficients) (Intercept) v1 v2 v3 v4 v6 v7 [1,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [2,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [3,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [4,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [5,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [6,] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
