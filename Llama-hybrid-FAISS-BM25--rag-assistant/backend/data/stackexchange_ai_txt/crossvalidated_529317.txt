Intuition behind SEM latent variables not being actual variables

There are essentially two ways, to my knowledge, to put together a number of numerical items that are all meant to quantify one abstract notion. One can average the items and create a composite score . This can be done in a more or less sophisticated manner, e.g. using weights given by Principal Components Analysis. One can use Structural Equation Modeling and create a latent variable . I tend to think of a composite score and a latent variable in the same way, to me they achieve the same job. Yet the latter does not seem to give you an actual variable with an individual score for each subject in a study, a tangible variable for which you could provide descriptive statistics. $^{(*)}$ What is an intuitive explanation for that? $^{(*)}$ In fact, the only way to use a SEM latent variable, for instance as part of a statistical model, is within the scope of SEM itself. It is known, by the way, that composite scores should not be used in SEM analysis, and replaced by latent variables.
