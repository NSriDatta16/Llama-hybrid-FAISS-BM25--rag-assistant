It seems it is impossible to do it in an elegant way with Flex 3 because: Validators set UIComponent.errorString(...) property which in its turn calls ToolTipManager.registerErrorString(...) and this guy calls TooltipManagerImpl.positionTip(...) where tooltip localtion calculated regarding to component XY and screen dimensions. And this method doesn't take into account styles or hints, it just fits tooltip into the screen. So hammer, file and self-invented validators are best friends here.
