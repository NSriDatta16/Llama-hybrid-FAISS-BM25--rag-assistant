Full revision of my thoughts. Indeed dropping the intercept will cause a bias problem. Have you considered centering your data so an intercept would have some meaning and avoid explaining how some (unreasonable) values could give negative values? If you adjust all three explanatory variables by subtract the mean sqrft, mean lotsize and mean bath, then the intercept will now indicate the value (of a house?) with average sdrft, lotsize, and baths. This centering will not change the relative relationship of the independent variables. So, fitting the model on the centered data will still find baths as insignificant. Refit the model without the bath included. You may still get a large p-value for the intercept, but it should be included and you will have a model of the form y=a+b(sqrft)+c(lotsize).
