I don't understand how you're bootstrapping, but you're probably doing it wrong. Bootstrapping would entail simulating observations conditional on the outcome process, the censoring processes, and the distribution of covariates, of which joint estimation is impossible. Additionally, you have correlated data. Subjects which "weave" in and out of the study cannot be observed during their censored times. You may alternately be aggregating data and using a log linear model approach in which bootstrapping might be a sensible approach, but I still don't know how that would account for repeat observations. Let me suggest a completely different strategy-- Your inference sounds very much like a motivating description for a proportional hazards model. By adjusting for the gene expression you're interested in, you can compute and compare risk sets of individuals averaged over instantaneous time and estimate a hazard ratio, which is an approximation of the risk ratio between those with and without the gene. By looking at "risk sets" at failure times, you can eliminate censored individuals from the denominator and have true apples-to-apples comparisons of instantaneous "at-risk" populations. How many repeat illnesses does an average individual in this sample have as a proportion of the total illnesses? If there are only few, you may consider only the first such failure, or entering all failures as independent observations. If there are many such failures, you would want to use a frailty model.
