What test do I use when comparing multiple dependent groups that are non-parametric?

Basically, I am comparing outcomes in a variable that applies to everyone in a field to each subcategory of the group (e.g., average annual pay for all nurses versus annual pay for all of the different types of nurses), but I cannot find a test that would be appropriate. Since I was comparing continuous data for more than two groups, I thought an ANOVA would be appropriate, but the data is non-parametric, so I moved on to a Kruskal Wallis. That is when I realized that since I am comparing the big group to all its subcategories, I am basically comparing a population to a bunch of samples, which I believe would make the relationship dependent. So then I thought of RMANOVA and the Friedman test eventually, but I am unsure whether I can actually do Friedman as I am comparing a population to a sample rather than one group over several instances or several separate dependent groups. I apologize if this is confusing. I haven't written here before.
