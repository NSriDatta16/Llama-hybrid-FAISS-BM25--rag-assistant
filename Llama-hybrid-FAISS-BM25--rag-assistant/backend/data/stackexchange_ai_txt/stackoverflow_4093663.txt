You could temporarily store the old ID in the new table (in an extra column) and then do an UPDATE on the old table. That's two lines of 'pure SQL.' restaurant_id |restaurant_name | v_id venue_id | venue_name | rest_id INSERT INTO `venue` (SELECT null, `restaurant_nm`, `restaurant_id` FROM `restaurant`) and then UPDATE restaurant r INNER JOIN venue v ON r.restaurant_id = v.rest_id SET r.v_id = v.venue_id Interested to see what a more elegant solution might be.
