Okay, I have a couple of questions more than an answer because I have no experience with the technology to know if it could/would work or would help. With the following goals: 1. Sell the item to non-scripting humans. 2. Keep the site running at a speed not slowed by bots. 3. Don't hassle the 'normal' users with any tasks to complete to prove they're human. My questions are: -. Would a Flash application, or Java applet, or Silverlight or anything similar reduce the ease of screen scraping enough to decrease the impact of the bots? I'm curious if these are as wide open to external manipulation as typical javascript/html. While it is not standard for web development and may not be 'good' from an SEO point of view, it sounds like search visibility isn't your problem if you have millions of users. I believe that any of these could still offer a very good looking interface so your humans wouldn't be put off by the design. -. Could you put all of your information in an Image? I've never seen the part of woot you are referring too, but what I'm suggesting is to place any text that a human needs to know in a human friendly image instead of a bot-friendly textbox. Oh, and to second something alluded to in some of the other responses. Don't miss the big opportunity you have: You have LOTS of Demand from Bots, and those people with Bots really buy right? Do you still want their money? (Cause if not, I'll take it.) Do these people with the Bots have any alternative to buy from you? Separate out your bags of crap. Have a woot subsite built for bots, geared towards bots and let the scripters have lots of fun AND pay you money for it. Sell them crap and let them challenge themselves against other scripters. It's a whole separate market available to you. If they have an alternative where they can win something AND get bragging rights about it, they might be a little less inclined to beat up on the little old human.
