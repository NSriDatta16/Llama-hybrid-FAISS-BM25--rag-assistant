the idea from Bruce is very good. i think there is not another option while using GLUT. i think this scenario is something that GLUT was not developed for. GLUT is a toolkit for OpenGL, which wraps window- and input-management across platforms. it has a lot of uses, but why should it care, when its window is dragged? i think if you (or your program) care, then you should implement your own window- and input-management anyway. which leads me to your second question. you can use OpenGL with MFC (although my recommendation strongly depends on what you are planing). you should not use GLUT then, because MFC has its own way of handling input, windows, event management, rendering/drawing ... if you really want to do it: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/openGL/OpenGL_MFC_AppWizard.aspx
