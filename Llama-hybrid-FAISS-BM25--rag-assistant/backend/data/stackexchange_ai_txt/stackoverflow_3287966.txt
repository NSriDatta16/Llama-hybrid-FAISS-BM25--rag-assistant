Reasons for and against moving from SQL server to MongoDB

I know this is a big question and it's not a yes or no answer but we develop web apps and are looking into using MongoDB for our persistence solution. Combining MongoDB with NoRM for object storage. What I want to ask is what pitfalls have you experienced with switching from SQL to mongo? When is mongo simply not the right solution and is mongodb's advantages enough to move development from SQL?
