Survival analysis can't really work with negative time values, as its starts with 100% survival at time=0 . So either you need to define time=0 in some better way or, more likely, you need to adopt a different approach. My decades-ago experience in accounts receivable suggests that the problem with a single simple Cox model as you have tried so far is that it assumes fundamentally a single type of event process. There isn't. There are fundamentally different types of behaviors that evidently need to be modeled here. Those who are prompt-pay will typically time payments to be received just before the due date. Then there are the others. You need to analyze this in a way that handles those two behaviors separately in a 2-step or maybe a competing-event process. If you don't care how soon before the due date you receive a payment, you could break the problem down into a two-step combination of a logistic regression model for the probability of an on-time payment and a survival model for the late-payment (event) times. The due date would be considered time=0 for the survival model, with only those who made late payments included so that you don't have to deal with problems of less than 100% survival at that time. If you do care about how soon before the due date you receive a payment, things are more difficult. You must find some appropriate time=0 setting that represents some day before the earliest day that you could receive payment, and a way to incorporate things like the time between issue date and due date into the model. The question is then how you should model separately the payment times for on-time and late payments. You could think of this as a special type of competing-event type of analysis, with on-time and late payments as mutually exclusive events after time=0 . You could consult the vignette on competing risks from the R survival package for hints, but I think that the presence of a date beyond which on-time payment events can no longer occur poses a problem. If a payment following an invoice is not made by the due date then there can no longer be an on-time payment event. Although that poses problems for accounts receivable, from the survival perspective your late-pay cases don't ever have that type of on-time payment event and thus are "cured" of that event type after the due date. From the survival analysis perspective, your on-time payment types might need to be modeled by a "cure rate" analysis . So a combination of a cure-rate analysis for on-time events and some standard survival analysis thereafter might work if you need to model the times of on-time payments. With very little if any censoring of the on-time payment times, you might be able to use some simpler model than a survival model for the on-time payment part of the analysis. I have no experience with implementing these types of combined models, however. Two further thoughts. First, as you presumably have the same clients involved in multiple instances of billing/payments, the model needs to take that into account somehow, for example with an id variable specification in the survival model. Otherwise the standard errors of your model will not be calculated properly. Second, you might want to consider a parametric model rather than the semi-parametric Cox approach. The Cox model simply uses the data to describe an empirical baseline hazard or survival function. It's not always clear how well that will model new cases, and it is limited by the finite times at which that baseline is allowed to change and the inability to extend predictions even slightly beyond the last observation time. A parametric model with an exponential, Weibull, log-normal, or other defined form might be more useful.
