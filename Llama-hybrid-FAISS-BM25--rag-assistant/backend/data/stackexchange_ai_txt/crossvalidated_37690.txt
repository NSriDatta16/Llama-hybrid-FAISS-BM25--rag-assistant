Being sensed is a binary outcome. The sensors' distance from target is a covariate that determine the outcomes. Logistic regression is one way to model this. The model would look like a smooth 2-dimensional surface over the x-y plane where x and y represent the respective sensor's distance from the target, with the height being the logit of p where p is the probability that the target is sensed (I am assuming that the definition of target being detected is that at least one of the sensors detects it). There are other possibilities of modeling a binary outcome, probit analysis is one alternative for example. The choice will depend on what modeling assumptions you think are reasonable.
