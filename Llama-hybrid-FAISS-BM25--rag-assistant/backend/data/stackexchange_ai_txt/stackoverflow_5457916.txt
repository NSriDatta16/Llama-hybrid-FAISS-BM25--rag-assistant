In a post I made there is an example on watermarking a text on an image, using WPF instead of the old, deprecated GDI+. As you can see in the article, the text is added by using the DrawText method of the DrawingContext, is really easy to use DrawImage instead, wich accept a BitmapImage. With something like: BitmapImage logo = new BitmapImage(); logo.BeginInit(); logo.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; logo.UriSource = new Uri(your_physical_logopath); logo.EndInit(); Rect rect = new Rect(0, 0, (double)logo.PixelWidth, (double)logo.PixelHeight); dc.DrawImage(logo, rect); With rect.X and rect.Y, before you execute DrawImage(), you can modify the relative position of the logo image inside the DrawingContext.
