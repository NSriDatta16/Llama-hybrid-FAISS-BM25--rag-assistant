P values don't tell you whether the variable is reliable or not (if I understand what that means). It tells you if the null hypothesis that that variable does not have impact can be rejected or not. But not how strong that impact is. Regressions, statistics generally can not say anything about causal relationships. Your design can to some extent, for instance if using random assignment and reasonably generalizing to your population. But the statistics itself can never tell you that. It is best to have good statistical power, enough cases to reasonably generalize to your population and to measure with limited error :) These are design/measurement issues primarily. Making sure the regression assumptions are met is important, but can not insure you can generalize or measured without error. In my humble opinion much of the statistical literature tends to ignore these issues and focus on the internal statistics. More attention to design and data measurement ( before the statistics is run) is critical, but downplayed in the literature. Part of the reason is that a lot of researchers have limited say in these areas, they do not collect the data, but obtain it from other sources. Another part is fragmentation in academics, so that design of measurement is separate from statistical analysis, both are not taught together. The issue of whether one can generalize from the initial data is particularly questionable...
