Presumably he wants to how to load/save the data to the phone's SD card: Android how to use Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() With that you can read the text file that is placed on the SD card by the user. Python and MySQL don't run on android (not on a stock phone anywyay) so if you want to store the data from the text file into Android's built in database, you need to use SQLite - which is provided by the framework: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html (SQL info is at the bottom) A good example of how to use the DB is here: http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/7742 Your quesiton wasn't really that specific -- but if you need to send the data from the phone to an external database (ie on some server) then it's a whole different ball game. In that case, it is probably easiest to use some kind of URL based call on the server. (ie. REST) -- Dan
