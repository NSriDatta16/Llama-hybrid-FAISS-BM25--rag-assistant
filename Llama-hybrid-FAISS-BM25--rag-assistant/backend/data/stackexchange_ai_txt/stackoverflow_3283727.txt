The Opera Web Standards Curriculum is a great (re)start for writing correct HTML and CSS and JS. Read it at your own rythm (I mean pace, sorry for my english). IE6 : Just give up with IE6 if you can (if your clients don't ask specifically for its support). It'll give you plenty of time to learn better things. If you work for administrations or companies that work for them, that won't be the case; prepare for severe headaches. Position is everything is a great resource. Don't try to understand everything but at least learn to know and recognize those IE6 bugs. A doubled margin, 3px margin, content seen twice, disappearing content are very well known and documented bugs but if you don't know here they come from ... Conditional comments and hasLayout ( zoom: 1; in one instruction) have been better explained elsewhere I believe, because P.I.E. is really an old site (though still useful). Page layout : If you have used tables, spacer.gif and are new to web standards like CSS 2.1 used the right way , you'll have a hard time for layouts displaying correctly cross-browser even if you know hot to style entire blocks in the page. Don't bother to reinvent the wheel, use resources like HTML Gala . Pick up the layout you need depending on fluid/fixed width, number of columns and whether their width is fixed or not and whether there is a footer or not, then understand how/why they did it but don't try to do it from scratch: it's just too complicated when you start to use CSS. Tools : a good text editor Firefox and great extensions and you're done. Quite :) Chrome also has extensions, keep an eye on it in a few months. For now nearly everything needed by a webdesigner/webdeveloper exists on Firefox and some of them on other browsers too. Firebug that you already cited. Explore its tabs, its select boxes and breadcrumbs, where you can edit things live, etc. And I heard you like extensions so dev created extensions for this extension (meme Â©Xzibit :)), check for extensions to Firebug . I use Pixelperfect and CSS Usage mainly but others are useful too. Web Developer Toolbar is the other must have extension. Be sure to try every option at least once, there's even a gem in the last menu, first option that only a few know. QuickJava allows quick enable and disable of Java, Javascript, Flash, Silverlight and Images from the Statusbar without having to open any dialogs. MeasureIt to measure width and height of an element or margins. ColorZilla brings a color picker (Shift-Esc) Fireshot for snapshots and commenting them, useful if you want to communicate with a client or a designer, write documentation or for your portfolio. Others source control (let's avoid the pain of " It worked 3 days ago/I just deleted the wrong file aaargh ") two offline backups that won't get robbed/flooded/burnt with the rest of your house/office. The second one can be an USB key/HD with Truecrypt given to family or friends, along with a password only known from your wife/husband and your parents or children for example. You can keep the first one with you (encrypted is better if you get robbed). CMS: you can test Drupal, Joomla and Wordpress as a beginning. Magento for e-commerce. Numerous plugins for each one but their quality may vary!
