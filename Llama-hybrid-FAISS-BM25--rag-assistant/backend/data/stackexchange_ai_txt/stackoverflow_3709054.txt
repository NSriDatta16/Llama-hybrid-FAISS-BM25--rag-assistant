Implement lazy drag & drop

I am trying to implement a lazy drag and drop operation. I want to show a listview with files to my user, when the user drags a file and drops it into a folder the content should be downloaded and delivered. I am using the IDataObject interface, but my problem is that the GetData() method is queried way too early. For instance a drag over the desktop (without any drop involved) will query the GetData() method a couple of times. And each of these calls starts the download of the file :/ Now, my question is: What's wrong here - why is the GetData() method called without any drop? Is there another way to implement lazy drag & drop operations in .net?
