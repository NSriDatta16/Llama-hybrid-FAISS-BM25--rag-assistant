Here is a nice implementation with discussion and explanation of PCA in python. This implementation leads to the same result as the scikit PCA. This is another indicator that your PCA is wrong. import numpy as np from scipy import linalg as LA x = np.array([ [0.387,4878, 5.42], [0.723,12104,5.25], [1,12756,5.52], [1.524,6787,3.94], ]) #centering the data x -= np.mean(x, axis = 0) cov = np.cov(x, rowvar = False) evals , evecs = LA.eigh(cov) you need to sort the eigenvalues (and eigenvectors accordingly) descending idx = np.argsort(evals)[::-1] evecs = evecs[:,idx] evals = evals[idx] a = np.dot(x, evecs) Generally, I recommend you to you check your code by implementation a simple example (as simple as possible) and calculating by hand the correct resuls (and intermediate results). This helps you to identify the problem.
