Remark on PSAfrance's answer, there is no such thing as equal ranking for 2 collinear features for xgb as tested by @dalloliogm. In fact, the equal ranking might be a case for random forests as the informational value of two correlated features is split due to random bagging. From an understanding-feature-importance POV, XGB does it clearly and somewhat reliable interpretation (re-emphasizing the answer of Tianqi Chen) is possible. But it seems the feature importance from Random Forest can't be taken for granted for ranking as the value is split between the correlated features.
