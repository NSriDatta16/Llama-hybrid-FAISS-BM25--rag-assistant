Pretty approach: If you're up with using HTML5, you can set a variable in localStorage every time a textbox is checked... and then load from localStorage on page load... or i guess you can also save your state with the page unload event... Not-so-pretty approach: If you want to use PHP, you can use heartbeats to sync with the server every once in a while.
