It depends greatly upon the context, but in many statistical methods this means that a regression modeling approach was used to "average out" differences which are attributable to aspects of weather. That means the regression model is a multivariable regression model. In your example, satellite imaging is used to estimate based on some level of "blurriness" (aerial optical distortion) how much ambient air pollution (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 mm in diameter) there is. Pm2.5 has been associated with several negative health conditions. The problem is that benign contributors to AOD can be measured and "controlled for" by subtracting their contributions to AOD. This is achieved with multivariable modeling.
