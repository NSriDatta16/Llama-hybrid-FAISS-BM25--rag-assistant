non-linear regression: Residual Plots and RMSE on raw and log target variable

I have rental prices of the houses, the distribution is a bit skewed (1.84 by scipy.stats.skew). Fig. 1: I run XGBRegressor on non-transformed data (1.) and on log-transformed target variable (2.). In 2. I also exponentiate the target variable (bringing in to the raw scale) to compare the residuals plots. I run XGBRegressor on non-tranformed data and I get test RMSE: 177 and a following residual plot and predicted vs real prices. The plot exhibits that data suffer from heteroscedasticity. Fig. 2: If I run XGBRegressor on log tranformed data, I get test RMSE: 180.5 (if I exponentiate back) and a following residual plot and predicted vs real prices (on log data). Fig.3 If I exponetiate the log target variable and predictions from 2. I get following plots. They look almost as the plots from 1. and it shows the same problem with heteroscedasticity. So, I did not get any improvement. Fig.4: My questions are: From what I see, the log transformation did resolve the skewness but it did not improve the RMSE (I guess it is because I use a non-linear algorithm, so the algorithm is not affected by the skewness). That means, I should not log transform it and do not pay attention to the residual plots. Is it correct? Should I be bothered by the skewness when I use non-linear regressors and should I do log transformation? If not, but I still see the improvement in metrics (RMSE) on the log-data, am I allowed to say: 'I logged it because it gave me the improvement in my metrics' (that sound as a very weak argumentation)? What is the explanation for this behaviour? Is it because of convergence of the optimisation algorithm? Also, is a residual plot still a good diagnostics when I use a non-linear regressor? When I use a linear regressor and my data is skewed, but the RMSE of non-transformed data is lower than of log-transformed data, what should I do and what does it mean (or why does it happen)?
