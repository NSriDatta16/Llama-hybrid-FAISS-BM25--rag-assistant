Visual Studio 2010 - fix "using" feature?

Is there any way to fix "using" in my C# file? I looking for some sort of "fix (organize) imports" from NetBeans or Eclise for java. I looking for the easiest way to fix issue: "The type or namespace could not be found" when I miss some "using" directive. Actually, I do not remember all C# classes hierarchy.
