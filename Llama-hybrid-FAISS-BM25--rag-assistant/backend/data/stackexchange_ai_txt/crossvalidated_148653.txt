Measuring efficiency with an interaction in a Tobit model?

I am interested in how to interpret outputs generated with marginal effects after estimating a Tobit model. I am using Stata 13, so I figured I'd use the command margins - which I find very helpful. However, I am still a little bit lost when it comes to interpreting the results. I am researching firm level data in regards to innovation output and would like to understand wether certain companies use innovation input (for example Research and Development expenditures) more efficiently than others. I have two issues: Making sure that I actually estimate efficiency. I am just not sure if I am doing it correctly. Understanding why the marginal effects estimated differ so immensely. To make things a little more tangible, I figured a simulate some data and analyze them accordingly: ***Generate simulated Data set obs 10000 *Innovation input = x gen x=rnormal()^2 *Company type (coded as a byte) gen t=round(runiform()) *Market environment (coded as a byte) gen m=round(runiform()) ***Functional form where y is dependen on x, t, m and an interaction of x & t gen y=2*x-3*t+4*x*t+5*t*m+rnormal() ***Creating Tobit conditions (left censored at 0) replace y=0 if y The results are the following: Tobit regression Number of obs = 10000 LR chi2(5) = 34127.61 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -11931.847 Pseudo R2 = 0.5885 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ y | Coef.

In this example, companies of the type 2 (i.e. where t=1 ) are hence less innovative. The interaction term however shows companies of the type 2 generate greater returns of y per unit x invested. However, I have some issues interpreting the marginal effects. To beginn with, I postestimated the marginal effect on the observed endogenous variable y (censored or uncesnsored). Results marginal effects: . margins, dydx(x) predict(ystar(0,.)) atmeans over(t) Conditional marginal effects Number of obs = 10000 Model VCE : OIM Expression : E(y*|y>0), predict(ystar(0,.)) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | dy/dx Std.

Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf.

As such, company type 2 are on average more efficient. Moreover, this relationship increases as m increases. Ploting the results via marginsplot results in the following: The plot shows the respective marginal effects of x on the observed variable y at m equaling 0 and 1 for companies t=1 and t=0 . It goes to show that the marginal effects are higher for t=1 at m=1 . Again, I interpret the results as the efficiency increasing as m increases. However, the results go astray, when I am estiamting and plotting the marginal effects on the latend variable: margins, dydx(x) at(m=(0 1)) over(t) Average marginal effects Number of obs = 10000 Model VCE : OIM Expression : Linear prediction, predict() dy/dx w.r.t. : x over : t 1._at : 0.t m = 0 1.t m = 0 2._at : 0.t m = 1 1.t m = 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Delta-method | dy/dx Std. Err. z P>|z| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- x | _at#t | 1 0 | 2.012943 .010086 199.58 0.000 1.993175 2.032711 1 1 | 6.010168 .0109178 550.49 0.000 5.98877 6.031567 2 0 | 2.012943 .010086 199.58 0.000 1.993175 2.032711 2 1 | 6.010168 .0109178 550.49 0.000 5.98877 6.031567 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Now, as I see it, the marginal effects of x on y remain the same - regardless of the level of m. Why is that the case? This is further substantiated when plotting the result: I just do not get, how this comes about. To sum up: Do I actually measure "efficiency" via the way forward displayed above? And, can I show altering efficiency via the help of marginal effects the way I did in the first place? Why do the calculated marginal effects differ? Why are the marginal effects on the latent variable the same regardless of m ? I've been boxing around with this issue for quite a while now and I can't wrap my head around it.
