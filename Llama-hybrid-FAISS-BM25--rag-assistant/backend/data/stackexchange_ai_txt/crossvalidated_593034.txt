The zero hurdle model coefficients are interpreted exactly as you would interpret coefficients from a logistic regression predicting not 0s vs. 0s, where not 0s are the event and 0s are the reference category. So, the odds ratio of 0.91 for Depth means that for every one unit increase in depth, the odds of consuming bythotrephes change by .91, i.e., the odds decrease by 9%. That is, the greater the depth, the less likely they are to consume bythotrephes. (Note that because of the interaction, this relationship refers to in SeasonPre.) For the count part, the exponentiated coefficients refer to incidence (i.e., count) ratios among those that consume bythotrephes. So, the incidence ratio of .05 means that among those that consume any bythotrephes, fish consume 5% as many bythotrephes in SeasonPeak as they do in SeasonPre (at a depth of 0). The positive coefficient for the depth x SeasonPeak interaction means this number gets less extreme the deeper they are.
