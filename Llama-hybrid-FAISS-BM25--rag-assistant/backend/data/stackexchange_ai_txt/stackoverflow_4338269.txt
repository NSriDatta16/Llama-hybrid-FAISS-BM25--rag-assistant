First of all you could avoid manual ftp copies by using the Maven Deploy plugin. You can find an how-to to deploy projects over ftp at this URL: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/examples/deploy-ftp.html Second point is a question about your project: is your WAR size normal? I've heard of configurations that embedded superfluous jar in order to avoid the problem of META-INF/spring.handlers overwriting when building the final jar. If you're in this situation, you might be interested by this too: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/resource-transformers.html
