In your case, "typical" regression methods aren't appropriate since your dependent variable is bounded below at 0 and above at 1. You probably want to consider some type of truncated regression appropriate for limited dependent variables such as this. Here's a Wiki reference that has some use in explaining the motivations for using these functional forms: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_regression_model Broadly speaking, truncated regression is a subset of generalized linear modeling whose development spans separate disciplines such as biology, economics and statistics. Maddala's more than 30 year old book Limited-Dependent and Qualitative Variables in Econometrics is the canonical source for a discussion of these topics: http://www.amazon.com/Limited-Dependent-Qualitative-Econometrics-Econometric-Monographs-ebook/dp/B00IE6MRUI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1446038429&sr=1-1&keywords=qualitative+and+limited+dependent+variables However, it's a field that has exploded since his book was written and I would be hard-pressed to give you a single reference that summarizes all of the issues, particularly from a bio-statistics POV. One tip would be to look into beta-binomial models which are a form of probabilistic (i.e., bounded or truncated) modeling that may be appropriate for your percentages. This could leverage an R module designed to integrate the compound function, as opposed to two separate modules as developed here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bbmle/vignettes/mle2.pdf
