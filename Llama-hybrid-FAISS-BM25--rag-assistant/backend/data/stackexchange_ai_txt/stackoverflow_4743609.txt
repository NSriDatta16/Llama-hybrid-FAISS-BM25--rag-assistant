Is this an effective anonymous user voting system!

UPDATED overview of the problem I am developing a public idea sharing website, where any user(after creating an account) can submit ideas; they will then be reviewed & rated by our internal reviewers. And only the best submitted ideas will be published. These ideas can now be voted by anyone anonymously. And for each 1000 idea votes, we will reward idea authors with say $0.5. I'm using an anonymous voting system where each vote is identified by a combination of IP address and User-agent . But since we are rewarding users with cash , I fear this voting system could be manipulated! Measures I've thought of taking: Voting only with javascript enabled( using ajax) - to make sure votes come from browsers alone. Also considering to receive votes, only from the most commonly used browsers. Can this kind of voting work effectively without much loopholes? Any good solutions for anonymous voting systems? Wow! this link is helpful: What is a reliable method to record votes from anonymous users, without allowing duplicates
