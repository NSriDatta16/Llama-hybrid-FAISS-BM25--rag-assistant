Logistic regression in which a factor is not significant but levels of that factor are

My question pertains to logistic regression. The overall model was significant, but the main IV (study group), which has 4 levels, was not (p = 0.1098): Testing Global Null Hypothesis: BETA=0 Test Chi-Square DF Pr > ChiSq Likelihood Ratio 149.7148 9 ChiSq age 1 5.4728 0.0193 sex 1 0.1211 0.7279 studygrp 3 6.0372 0.1098 p1susrev 1 0.4059 0.5240 p1cons 1 78.6831 My issue concerns the Maximum Likelihood Estimates Table, which demonstrated that despite this variable being non-significant, 3 levels of that IV actually were significant (with the reference group not being displayed): Analysis of Maximum Likelihood Estimates Parameter DF Estimate Standard Error Wald Chi-Sq Pr > ChiSq Intercept 1 -2.9014 0.1387 437.6924 Previously I included two interaction terms (sex by study group & age by study group), but neither proved significant. Any suggestions as to how this could be interpreted?
