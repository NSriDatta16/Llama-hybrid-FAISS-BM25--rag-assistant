HTML5 Database administration / introspection?

I'm playing around with html client side storage and wanted to know if there are any facilities for introspection of the database - is there an equivalent of sqlite ".tables" or ".schema" ? Also, I'm not seeing my tables show up in AppData\Local\Apple Computer\Safari\LocalStorage . Is there another place tables are stored?
