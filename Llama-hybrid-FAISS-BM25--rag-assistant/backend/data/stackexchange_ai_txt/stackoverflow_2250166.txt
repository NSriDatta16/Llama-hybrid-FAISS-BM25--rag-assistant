Objective-C / Cocoa: Uploading Images, Working Memory, And Storage

I'm in the process of porting an application originally in java to cocoa, but I'm rewriting it to make it much better, since I prefer cocoa a lot anyway. One of the problems I had in the application, was that when you uploaded images to it, I had the images created, (as say an NSImage object) and then I just had them sitting in memory, the more I uploaded the more memory they took up, and I ended up running out of memory. My question is this: if I am going to have users upload images to this application in cocoa, how should I go about storing them? I don't just want to copy the file paths, because I want what is saved to contain the images, etc. Is there any way to upload an image and copy it into a different place only for my application? Then load that image with the new path name as needed? Only I would like it all to be consolidated. I'm going to implement saving by archiving one "master" object into an NSData*- so I'd like the images to be saved with that. Is there a temporary location maybe where I could write the images to disk for my application, and then when I saved, they would all be archived into a single file? Also, how do I do this? Thanks.
