Where is the h function of the exponential family gone?

The problem comes from equation (4.86) of text "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" written by Christopher M. Bishop $$a_k({\bf x})={\bf\lambda}_k^T{\bf x}+\ln g({\bf\lambda}_k)+\ln p(\mathcal C_k).$$ This equation is obtained by substituting the class-conditional density of the exponential family with scale invariance (4.84) $$p({\bf x}|{\bf\lambda}_k,s)=\frac{1}{s}h\left(\frac{1}{s}{\bf x}\right)g({\bf\lambda}_k)\exp\left\{\frac{1}{s}{\bf\lambda}_k^T{\bf x}\right\}$$ into (4.63) $$a_k=\ln p({\bf x}|\mathcal C_k)p(\mathcal C_k)$$ to show that it is a general linear model. But where is $h\left(\frac{1}{s}{\bf x}\right)$ gone after taking logarithm?
