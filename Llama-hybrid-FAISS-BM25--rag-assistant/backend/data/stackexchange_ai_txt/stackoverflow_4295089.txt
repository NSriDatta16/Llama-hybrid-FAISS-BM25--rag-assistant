MD5 is a 128-bit hash, so there are 2^128 possible hashes. If the hash were perfect, then it would in theory require around 2^64 different hash attempts to find a collision (and you would have to store all 2^64 because each new hash would require comparison to all previous values). There isn't 2^64 bits of storage on the planet, so you would be safe. The attacks on MD5 allow collisions to be found with significantly less than 2^64 hashes and significantly less than 128 x 2^64 bits of storage. That's why MD5 is considered broken. Currently there are no similar attacks that work on full-strength SHA-1, but it's expected that such attacks will be publicly known within a few years.
