As others have mentioned, there is no standard to specify in which order the memory blocks allocated by malloc() should be located in the memory. For example, freed blocks can be scattered all around the heap and they may be re-used in any order. But even if the blocks happen to be one after each other, they most likely do not form a contiguous block. In order to reduce fragmentation, the heap manager only allocates blocks of specific size, for example power of two (64, 128, 256, 512 etc. bytes). So, if you reserve 10 bytes for a string, there may be perhaps 22 or 54 un-used bytes after that. The memory overhead is another reason why it is not good idea to use dynamic memory allocation unless really necessary. It is much easier and safer just to use a static array.
