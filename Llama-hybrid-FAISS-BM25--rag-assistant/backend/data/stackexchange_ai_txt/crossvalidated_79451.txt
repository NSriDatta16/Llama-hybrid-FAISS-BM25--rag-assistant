The symptoms you are describing sound like a classic case of overfitting . As described in the link, over time, researchers have managed to come up with various strategies such as pruning or early stopping to try to avoid or reduce the effects of overfitting. Depending on which specific learning algorithm you are using, and the details of how it was implemented, it may be more or less sensitive to this problem. If you are using a machine learning package such as scikit-learn or Weka , I'd suggest swapping out whatever learning algorithm you were previously using, and try running the same experiment with a different algorithm; both packages make that extremely easy (almost trivial, in fact) to do.
