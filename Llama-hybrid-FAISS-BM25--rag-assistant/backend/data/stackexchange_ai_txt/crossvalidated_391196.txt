If you have a coordinate $x$ that separates the states of your system, and you can assign a probability $P(x)$ to finding your system at coordinate value $x$ , then you can define a kind of energy as follows. Define $E(x)$ such that $P(x) \sim \exp(-\beta E(x))$ or $E(x) = -\log(P(x)/\beta + E_0$ , where $\beta$ is a constant that can be ignored for now. That gets you an energy-like thing. But how would you use it? Would you try to define a force $F=-dE(x)/dx$ ? Would you like to say that the average energy $ $ is a constant of the system given the constancy of several intensive features, like $\beta$ ? Would you try to define dynamics in $x$ , or kinetics? or diffusion? I'm genuinely curious where you are going with this . . .
