How to align button centered below table?

I put form elements in a table so that column names and inputs are aligned to 2-columns. And I put submit button and cancel button below the table. The table width is not fixed. I want to put the buttons center-aligned of the table width. One simple way is to put the buttons in the table. But I want to separate them from the table. What's the most elegant way to do that?
