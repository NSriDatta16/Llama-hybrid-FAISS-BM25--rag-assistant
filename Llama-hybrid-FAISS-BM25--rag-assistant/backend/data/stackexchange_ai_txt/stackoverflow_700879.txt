As far as I can tell, you can't retrieve the path. In the Qt source, src/corelib/io/qsettings.cpp , there is a function to get the path: static QString getPath(QSettings::Format format, QSettings::Scope scope) { ... but it's not accessible from code using Qt. You can't copy it and use it either, because it uses internal Qt globals to store the path... EDIT: A solution was posted, using QDesktopServices.storageLocation(QDesktopServices.DataLocation) but it doesn't do exactly what the question was asking for, i.e. if I set a custom path using QSettings.setPath() it doesn't reflect the change.
