What kind of analysis to use to compare time series trade data

I have a time series data set that gives me the adjusted imports and exports for the period 2003-2016. Suppose a trade agreement was signed in 2009. I want to compare the bilateral trade before and after the agreement, and check whether it increased bilateral trade. How do I go about doing this?
