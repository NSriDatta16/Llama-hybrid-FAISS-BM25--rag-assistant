I had the same issue as the OP: Win 7 (x64), TortoiseSVN (x64), and DropBox (x86). The info from some of the other answers gave me all the info. I've only ever had the x64 version of TSVN installed on this machine. In my case TSVN and DropBox were installed the same day I did the OS install and the overlays worked fine until a couple of days ago. I did nothing involving changing settings for either app to cause them to stop working. Here is what I had in the icon overlay registry section after the problem started ( HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers ): DropboxExt1 DropboxExt2 DropboxExt3 EnhancedStorageShell Offline Files SharingPrivate TortoiseAdded TortoiseConflict TortoiseDeleted TortoiseIgnored TortoiseLocked TortoiseModified TortoiseNormal TortoiseReadOnly TortoiseUnversioned I verified that only the overlays corresponding to the first 11 entries display in Explorer. When I modified the order of above entries by adding 'z' to the start of some of them, again only the first 11 overlays (under the updated order) would display. With the above I had everything I needed to solve the problem (either rename or or delete entries so that the TSVN entries I want working are I know that based on the overlays that worked prior to a couple of days ago, keys 1-3, 7-9, 12-13 were all Is the list of 15 overlays determined at run-time? Seems like the overlay handlers might sometimes tell the windows shell that there are no icons to add to the list. Possibly some settings I messed with a couple of days ago related to file sharing and file encryption caused some of those items at the 4-6 spots to become "activated" and push the SVN ones down. In the end I deleted a couple of entries and moved some, so my final list looks like this: DropboxExt1 DropboxExt2 DropboxExt3 SharingPrivate (i want this to show up) TortoiseAdded TortoiseConflict TortoiseDeleted TortoiseModified TortoiseNormal TortoiseReadOnly TortoiseUnversioned zOffline Files (i don't use Sync Center, or "Offline Files" so I don't care about this) zEnhancedStorageShell (don't really know what Enhanced Storage is, don't think I need this)
