I suspect you're running into computational issues with Wolfram Alpha trying to do an exact calculation with $n = 10^6$ . I tried finding the complement of the probability you were looking for, figuring that would be simpler, and I got a notification saying the calculation timed out. Splitting up that calculation in to two parts (0-50 people need a doctor and 51-100 people need a doctor), I didn't get that error, and both probabilities were approximately 0, so combining them would also yield 0. This would then imply that the probability that more than 100 people need a doctor is essentially 1. As AdamO mentioned in the comments above, we should expect an average of 10,000 people per day to need a doctor if $p = 1%$ . If you compute $P(x>100)$ using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution, you should find this probability is basically 1.
