I train people to pass the SCJP (I'm SCJP 1.5 + SCBCD and preparing SCJP 1.6 + SCWCD). The Sun courses (and material) are very basic and don't focus on the exam objectives. So my plan & advice is: Save the objectives in Evernote , print them or make a tattoo. That's what matters to pass the exam. The best book to pass (as stated above) is Kathy and Bert's . Obviously, setup a Java SDK + IDE of your choice (I love Eclipse) and start programming examples aimed at the cert. The only two webs you'll need are StackOverflow and JavaRanch where you can meet Kathy and Bert Use a tool to simulate the examination. I use Enthuware Relax, plan for two months if you're studying after work and pass the exam!
