We have many huge customers running Nexus without load problems, including shops on the order of 10's of thousands of users. That's in addition to the large and public instances at: http://repository.apache.org http://nexus.codehaus.org http://maven.atlassian.com https://repository.jboss.org/nexus http://oss.sonatype.org and many others. Two Nexus instances can't effectively share the entire storage folder because Lucene is used for many things and those files aren't shareable. It might be possible to share just the repo folder, but the indexes and caches will be out of data on the standby. Redundancy is something we're working on in commercial Nexus versions.
