Benefits of switching from SQL Server to Versant OODB

What benefits (if any) to the company (not only to developers) I could gain by switching from SQL Server 2008 to Versant OODB? More info about the project and facts to help with an answer (let me know if you need more): Very small team, almost never used OODB. Project uses NHibernate 2. About 75% test coverage. ASP.NET MVC app. At this stage I could not justify the switch due to following points (most related to db4o, not Versant mainstream OODB): tooling is pretty bad comparing to RDBMSs world where there are bunch of "Managers", profilers, integration/migration tools and others; documentation is pretty basic from what I can observe and heavily mixed with Java; not so many resources on the net comparing to RDBMS; switching to other databases may be problematic (as opposed to RDBMS); learning curve for the developers and IT team; additional licensing cost; additional maintenance cost; no integration with MSDeployment (including automatic backups, MSBuild, Packaging etc);
