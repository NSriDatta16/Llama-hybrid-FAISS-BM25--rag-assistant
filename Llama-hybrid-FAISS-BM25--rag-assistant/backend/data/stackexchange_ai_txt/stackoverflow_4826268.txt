Tool for the cartography of a complex information system

I am looking for a Visio-like tool that would help me draw my information system at the component level. The design will not fit on a single piece of paper and I would like a web tool with a sort of 'infinite' sheet of paper, and a proper navigation system. An idea that crossed my mind for example is to use KML layers on Google Earth to draw the information system and navigate it. I don't know though how easy it would be to do a Visio-like drag and drop editor inside Google Earth. Have you ever found such a tool? How do you handle bird's eye views of your information system? Thanks for your help, Jérôme Wagner
