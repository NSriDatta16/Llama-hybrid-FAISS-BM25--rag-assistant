I think there are two questions here. Why study optimization Why convex optimization I think @Tim has a good answer on why optimization. I strongly agree and would recommend anyone interested in machine learning to master continuous optimization. Because the optimization process / finding the better solution over time, is the learning process for a computer. I want to talk more about why we are interested in convex functions. The reason is simple: convex optimizations are "easier to solve", and we have a lot of reliably algorithm to solve. But is the world convex? No. Why obsessed with convexity? Check this metaphor A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, "this is where the light is".
