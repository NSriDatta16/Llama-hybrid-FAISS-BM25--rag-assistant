Does BERT has any advantage over GPT3?

I have read a couple of documents that explain in detail about the greater edge that GPT-3(Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3) has over BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers). So am curious to know whether BERT scores better than GPT-3 in any particular area of NLP? It's quite interesting to note that OpenAI's GPT-3 is not open-sourced whereas tech behemoth Google's BERT is open-sourced. I felt OpenAI's stance and the hefty price tag for GPT-3 api is in stark contrast to its mission statement(OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity). https://analyticsindiamag.com/gpt-3-vs-bert-for-nlp-tasks/ https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/07/23/openais-new-gpt-3-language-explained-in-under-3-minutes-syndication/ https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/gpt-3-from-openai-is-here-and-its-a-monster-f0ab164ea2f8
