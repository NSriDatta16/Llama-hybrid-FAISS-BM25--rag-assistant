You need the coefficient from the logistic regression (in its logged version) with its standard error. You may have to back-calculate it from the confidence interval for the odds ratio which would involve taking logs first. One think to beware of is that if the other variables in the logistic regression are not the same then the coefficients are not estimating the same quantity.
