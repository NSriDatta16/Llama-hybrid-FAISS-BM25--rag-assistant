Algorithm or function or model that encourages clustered classfication?

I have a soft classfication problem, i.e., the correct label for a certain instance is not just one class with 100% probability, but rather bunch of classes with probabilities that sum up to one. What I know as apriori information (I know it because I understand the underlying physical phenomenon) that the classes are close together, like a cluster. E.g, class one and five and eight always come together cause they're adjacent (PS: I can create adjacency matrix if required). What do I want? I want some way to tell the NN about this fact. Currently it is vanilla classfication neural net. Any suggestions or readings or guidannce are appreciated.
