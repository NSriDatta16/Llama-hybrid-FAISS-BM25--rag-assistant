MAGENTO Force customer to fulfill the address form again

I created a new attribute to the address form and it is working fine, my problem is with older customers. How can I make force them to have to edit their address? WHen they go to the checkout page, they choose the old address without knowing about the new attribute, and it is really important for us that they fill it properly
