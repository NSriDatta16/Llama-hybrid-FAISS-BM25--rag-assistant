Predicting Binary Dependent variable with predictor variables (both categorical and numerical)

I have all the information I need from my logistic regression and know which variables are significant and by how much, but is there any way for me to write an equation that will give me the probability of a "yes" result based on new independent variable entries? I'm sure I could figure out individual cases by hand maybe, but does anyone have any methods for using logistic regression results in a formula (excel maybe?) to predict the DV based on IVs? I am using SPSS (sorry, not a true R statistician) and there doesn't seem to be a way to use the results of my regression to predict the DV of new samples I gather. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it as I am fairly new to the stats game. Thanks!
