This is not exactly an answer to your problem but have you considered using groups/permissions to differentiate between different types of users rather than creating subclasses of auth.User ? Django's auth feature comes with a reasonably useful groups/permissions mechanism which can be leveraged to make your life more easier. Using groups you can various create groups ("undergrad", "grad" etc.) and grant each group appropriate permissions to achieve the necessary effect.
