"sophisticated" is not really a wel-defined description, but machine learning models typically do not rely on statistical tests at all. Many, as in, winning Kaggle contests, being used in industry or being published about. Statistical feature selection prior to training your model is not really needed, instead, models such as random forests and neural networks select their own features. To validate and compare models, cross-validation or just a train- and testset (possibly a validation set) are used. Statistical tests are used in the field of A/B testing however.
