Alternative to GPT type transformers for non NL based input

Using a GPT or similar transformer I can feed it a string of text and essentially request a summary. From my experience this works pretty well. However I've not found any similar model or transformer that take a non natural language input and can output a summary. The closest thing I can think of is a algorithm that describes what is happening in an image - which doesn't quite seem like the right task (eg, if it's a massive image I won't want a description of everything that happening, just a summary). Is there a type of model that works like this? Eg. A model that takes any type of input (presented as a vector, matrix or tensor) and summarises the input into natural language? More detail: I realised as I wrote this that I would need to explain a little more. Obviously I would need to give the model a set of training data based on my specific inputs and expected outputs, however doing so from scratch would typically take an unreasonably large dataset for a NLP task. Are there pretrained models of this type?
