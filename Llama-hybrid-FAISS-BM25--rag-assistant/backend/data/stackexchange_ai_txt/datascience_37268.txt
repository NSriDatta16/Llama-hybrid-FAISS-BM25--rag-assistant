Estimation of Bayes Error / Human-level error

In one of course Andrew Ng mentioned that model (Machine learning) error can't outperform Bayes / human level performance and hence the bias can't avoided.. (Unavoidable bias) How do we determine / estimate Bayes error or human level error so that we could stop optimizing the model for reducing bias further? Examples / concepts for classification problem would be appreciated...
