Predicted Responses as Weighted Averages: Classical Regression Vs. Mixed Effect Models

Let's imagine that I have collected data in a longitudinal design that would lend itself to a mixed effects analysis. So suppose I perform a research study with human subjects and observe responses ($Y_{ij}$), where $i$ designates the subject and $j$ designates the trial, where the $j$th trial involves a possibly repeatable combination of covariates. In mixed effects models, the "predicted value" for the true response of the $i$th subject on the $j$th trial ($\widehat{Y_{ij}}$) is a weighted average of the response that was actually observed, $Y_{ij}$, and the population averaged mean-response profile, $X_i \widehat{\beta}$. How much each term is weighted depends, roughly speaking, upon the relatively "size" of the between-subject vs. within-subject variability. Is there an analogue for OLS linear regression? That is, is it similarly possible to express the "predicted value" for the response, $\widehat{Y_i}$ as a weighted average of the observed response, $Y_i$ and something else?
