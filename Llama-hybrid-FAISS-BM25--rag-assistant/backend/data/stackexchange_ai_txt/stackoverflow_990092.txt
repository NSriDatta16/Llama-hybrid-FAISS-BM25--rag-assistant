There are quite a few products available for agile/scrum teams... have a look at http://userstories.com/products for a decent list. We use versionOne where I work, and it does some things quite well, and other things... not so much. You'll need to use a product for a little while, at a low level and a high level to make sure it fits your needs. As part of a scrum team, I deal most with planning and writing sprints/stories, and tracking progress of my work. Thus for me, those are the two most important pieces to get right. That said, I don't know if this is addressing the "planning in pairs" question -- what exactly are you trying to achieve? Is there a reason you are trying to avoid your devs make that decision? Are you trying to rotate teams all the time? Does everyone always want to pair with one person? You could always just pair up people based on who wants to work a particular story... Without a better understanding of you constraints, I wouldn't know how to answer that part of the question. I also doubt that how to pair up is something you should be using a tool for. Make pairs based upon working style, or people who work well together and can communicate easily with each other, or have different strengths. Avoid vastly different experience levels, since that doesn't always encourage discussions, and is more apprpriate for mentoring than pairing.
