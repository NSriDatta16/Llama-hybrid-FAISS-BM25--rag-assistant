You are right that discriminative models have two sets of parameters. You are also right that in practice only one set of parameters is used. This is not a contradiction. The paper is about having the right point of view about what you are doing. When you are doing logistic regression, you should have (7) in your mind and realize that you are throwing away one set of parameters. This act of throwing away is built into the logistic regression algorithm and will always happen when using (7). You may try to fit $\theta'$ but it won't matter since it is independent from $\theta$ . You are right to ask whether it is a good idea to throw away that extra set of parameters. In many situations, $\theta'$ has useful information. To make any use of $\theta'$ , you must use a model different from (7). Some people think that (2) is the only alternative to (7), but the paper suggests a more general approach that includes (2) and (7) as special cases. This has proven successful in later work, such as: Principled Hybrids of Generative and Discriminative Models The linear "Bayes Point Machine" classifier built into the Azure Machine Learning toolkit, which uses $\theta$ and $\theta'$ under the hood. None of that work would have been possible without the point of view given by this paper.
