In Access 2003, how to link to a table in the current folder

I'm adding features to a multi-user Access db. Because it's multi-user, I've split it up into a Backend (with all the tables & queries) and a Frontend (which links to the Backend). And because it's still in development, both files are on my local machine. And currently, When I deploy it onto the shared drive, I have to rebuild all the links between these 2 files. Is there a more 'elegant' way to do this than rebuild the links every single time I copy these files over? i.e. in the Linked Table Manager, instead of the links looking like "C:\Reports\Backend.mdb" , can I change it to something like "%CurrentFolder%\Backend.mdb" ? At first glance, it sounds like an infrequent annoyance, but earlier today I copied the files from the shared drive to my local machine to do some new development. An hour later, I realized the Frontend on my local machine ( i.e. the Test environment ) was still linked to the Backend on the Shared drive ( i.e. Production ). So, in other words, I've been writing test data to the Production version of this report.
