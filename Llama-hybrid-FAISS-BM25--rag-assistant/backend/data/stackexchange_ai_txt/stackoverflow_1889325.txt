This seems like a reasonable approach (I'm not a Mule expert by any means), and I have read all of the Mule documentation and don't think there is something like this out there (the streaming support is limited to a few connectors and transformers - it's pretty simple in that it just passes around an InputStream). Only a few things in Mule stream, so you may need to have other modified transformers (if you use them) that stream. You would just implement the aggregator the provides an InputStream and starts streaming as soon as it got some consecutive sequence of messages. However one sentence in your description "... all of the messages had been received before forwarding the results to the endpoint" could be troubling. This by it's very nature defeats the purpose of streaming, unless you mean that you (in your service component presumably) will keep track that you got everything before forwarding the (presumably much smaller) processed result onwards.
