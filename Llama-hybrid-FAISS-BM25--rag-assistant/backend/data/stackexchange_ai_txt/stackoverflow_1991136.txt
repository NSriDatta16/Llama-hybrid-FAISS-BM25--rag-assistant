How to teach Object Oriented Programming - Any idea where to start?

I'm teaching C++ for about 2 years in high schools, computer training institutes and etc. After teaching basics about variables, arrays, structures, functions, I always start object oriented examples part with traditional examples, like this one: class Person { public: Person(); ~Person(); char* getFirstName(); //we can use std::string instead of char* in optimization part char* getLastName(); char* getFullName(); int getAge(); bool getGender(); void printFullProfile(); void setFirstName(char*); void setLastName(char*); void setAge(unsigned int); void setGender(bool); void setGender(char);//f for female, m for male. private: char* first_name; //or std::string but i prefer to use pointers in the beginning. char* last_name; unsigned int age; bool gender; //ladies 1(st) , male 0 } and then completing this Person class and teach new things like why getter and setters methods are evil and avoiding accessors, inheritance, polymorphism by creating other classes ( like Student, Employee, Moderator etc. ), necessary OOP skills and concepts. [EDIT]: And make these classes useful for solving programming problems. ( Like calculating salary for each Employee object, Students marks average, and many others ) another basic examples are Vehicle class, Shape class, etc. I wanna know your ideas about how to ( JUST ) start an OOP classroom. looking forward for great ideas.
