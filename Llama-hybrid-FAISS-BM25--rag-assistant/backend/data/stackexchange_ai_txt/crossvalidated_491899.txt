I would say that your customer is right. For my rationale, let's discuss why we do random assignment to groups in the first place. In an ideal world, each individual in the TG would correspond to exactly one individual in the CG, who are identical in all relevant attributes - both those we know about, and those we do not know about. If we have such a matching design, we know that differences in the outcome are due to the intervention. Unfortunately, there are two problems with such a perfect matching. The first is that even matching on the known attributes is usually not possible, simply because there are too many possible combinations of attribute values. The second is that we usually do not know every relevant attribute, or are unable to measure them. This is why we do random group assigment, hoping that groups then do not differ greatly on the known attributes, and that the unknown attributes are similarly averaged out. If we can assume that your customer's process does not induce systematic differences on the unknown attributes (and this assumption would IMO usually make sense), then we are left with the fact that it makes the groups more similar on the known attributes. Which is a step towards better matching, i.e., the ideal world. So there is no downside, but there is upside. So your customer is right in his process.
