That is a very basic (and essential !) question in statistics. The maths behind the answer to this is the central limit theorem. It tells you that no matter what the law of probability is, the averages of N samples behave like a gaussian (the bound is not explicit unless you know the variance of your law). In the problem you are mentionning you can do something more explicit since the law is rather simple (the law of one answer is called a Bernoulli, and the law of the sum is called a binomial. If p is the probability of "yes", then the variance for a N-sample is N p (1-p), and you can compute explicitly the N you need in order to make a mistake of less than say 5% with a 95% probability (you need both a margin of error and a trust interval for the questino to be well-posed).
