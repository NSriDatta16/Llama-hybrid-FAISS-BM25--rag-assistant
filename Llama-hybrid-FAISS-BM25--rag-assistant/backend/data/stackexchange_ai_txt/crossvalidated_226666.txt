$\mu$ parameter from truncated normal distribution describes it's mean before the truncation. The mean of the truncated normal distribution is $$ \operatorname{E}(X \mid a where $a$ and $b$ are lower and upper truncation points. This mean is always between $a$ and $b$. You are right that sampling from truncated normal distribution with parameters $\mu=-8$, $\sigma=0.2$, $a=0$, $b=\infty$ using non-specialized algorithm would be very inefficient (possibly you'd have problems with numbers falling below numerical precision), however since non-truncated normal distribution ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, you can pick any truncation points such that $a described by Christian Robert (mentioned in a comment below).
