Just to add another perspective on this. Out of memory (most times) does not mean you've used up all the memory. It means that your memory has been fragmented and the next time you want to allocate a chunk the system is unable to find a contiguous chunk of memory to fit your needs. Frequent allocations/deallocations will cause memory fragmentation. The GC may not be in a position to de-fragment in time sue to the kinds of operations you do. I know the Server GC in .NET is pretty good about de-fragmenting memory but you could always starve (preventing the GC from doing a collect) the system by writing bad code.
