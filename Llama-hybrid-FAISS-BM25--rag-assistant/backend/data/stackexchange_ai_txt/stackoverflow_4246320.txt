Two approaches: NSClipView Subclass Subclass NSClipView and swap it out at runtime (mind-blowingly easy). The subclass would respond to the drop validation method by drawing whatever effect you want just inside its bounds. Maybe an NSBezierPath with a rectangle made from the clip view's -bounds. Document View Your document view (the view inside the scroll view) asks its -enclosingScrollview for its -documentVisibleRect and draws a rectangle on itself just like the NSClipView subclass method above (ie, the same drawing approach in response to the drag and drop validation method being called).
