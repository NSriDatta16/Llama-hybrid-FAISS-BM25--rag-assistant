Facebook uses MySQL . That being said. Here's the long version: I always say that XML is a data transfer technology, not a data storage technology, but not everyone agrees. XML is not designed to be use a relational datastore. XML was first introduced in order to provide a standard way of transmitting data from system to system w/o giving access to the originating systems. Since you are talking about a large application, I would strongly urge you to use MySQL (or other RDBMS), as your dataset grows and grows the XML will be increasingly slower and slower unless you always keep a fresh copy in memory and only read the XML files upon service reboot. Using an XML database is reportedly more efficient in terms of conversion costs when you're constantly sending XML into and retrieving XML out of a database. The rationale is, when XML is the only transport syntax used to get things in and out of the DB, why squeeze everything through a layer of SQL abstraction and all those relational tables, foreign keys, and the like? It basically takes a parsing layer out of the application and brings it into the data engine - where it's probably going to work faster and more efficiently than the SQL alternative. Probably.
