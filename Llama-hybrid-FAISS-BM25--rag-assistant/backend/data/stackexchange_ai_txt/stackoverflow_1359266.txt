ASP.NET MVC: How do I send "text/xml" to all browsers but IE?

I need to be able to send the content type "text/xml" to Firefox and Safari, to allow them to render inline SVG in one of my pages. This works, as long as the content type is "text/xml". However, when IE hits the page, if the content type is not "text/html" it tries to render the XML document tree, rather than the XHTML content of the page. What is the "right way" in ASP.NET MVC to set the HTTP Content-Type of ALL of my views? Keep in mind that I am going to be rendering the views as ViewResults. Ok, to clear any confusion up: User Agent Content-Type Desired ----------------------------------- IE 5.5 text/html IE 6 text/html IE 7 text/html IE 8 text/html Firefox text/xml Safari text/xml Chrome text/xml And so on. All of the browsers listed support SVG inline in some way or another. I have a consistent delivery format, save the content type.
