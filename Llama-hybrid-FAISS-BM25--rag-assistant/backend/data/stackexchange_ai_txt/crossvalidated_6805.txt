One problem with the approach you outline is that the regressors $x_i$ will (on average) be uncorrelated , and one situation in which variable selection methods have difficulty is highly correlated regressors. I'm not sure the concept of a 'random' linear model is very useful here, as you have to decide on a probability distribution over your model space, which seems arbitrary. I'd rather think of it as an experiment, and apply the principles of good experimental design. Postscript : Here's one reference but i'm sure there are others: Andrea Burton, Douglas G. Altman, Patrick Royston, and Roger L. Holder. The design of simulation studies in medical statistics. Statistics in Medicine 25 (24):4279-4292, 2006.
