I am curious why NOT FSFS?? Important information - I am managing Windows systems. I have done many projects with SVN and almost all of them were running from FSFS. Biggest repository was around 70GB (extreme), biggest ammount of repositories was around 700. We never had any issues, even though we hosted it on Windows, NetApp and many other storage systems. Most of the time when I asked why NOT using FSFS only problem was that people simply didn't trust it. Advantages: No backend required (or dedicated server) Fast and reliable Hook scripts are supported NTFS permissions are used Easy to understand, easy to support, easy to manage Disadvantages: Not so easy access from outside your network (VPN) Permissions only on repository-level (Read, Read/Write) Hook scripts are running under current user credentials (which is sometimes advantage, sometimes disadvantage) Martin
