They are all pdfs, you are basically applying Bayes' Rule. Since the first line has an exact equality, if you integrate just over the full domain of $x_{t-1}$ for fixed $x_t$ and $x_0$ , you will get 1 as you said. But the integration is intractable in such a high dimensional space (i.e. even an image as small as $32\times 32$ ). The main assumption of Diffusion models is that the noise is Gaussian. So , yes, you can think that the distributions of $x_i$ are Gaussian. Those are random variables. Every $x_i$ is an image that is processed through the Markov chain. So, you are basically saying that the images are Gaussian, given the initial image and/or the previous image in the Markov chain. Hope this helps.
