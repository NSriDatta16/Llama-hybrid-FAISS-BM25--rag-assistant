Are two machine learning models preferable to one when predicting a time series with several zeros?

I have a data series of positive integers. The majority of values are zero, but occasionally the values can be quite high. The task is to predict the following value given a set of features. Let's say I have two approaches: A) I train a machine learning model, e.g. random forest, using all features and all output values (with a training and test set of course). I then run it to predict future values. B) I create two models. The first model is a classifier, determining if the following value is zero or non-zero. The second is a model similar to the one used in approach A, but trained with only non-zero output values. During prediction, I start by running the first model. Only if this model indicates that the output will be non-zero, I run the second model to predict the actual value. My questions are: Are any of the two approaches likely to be better than the other? If yes, which and why? Does it depend on which machine learning model I use? Can it for example be better with approach A using random forest, but B if using neural networks? I'd be very happy if you could help me with this. Thank you, /Anders
