Are XGBoost probability outputs based on the number of examples in a terminal leaf

I am trying to replace a c4.5 tree that someone else implemented with a boosted tree (XGBoost). The data is extremely skewed and the company wants the new model to output similar distributions. c4.5 trees determine probabilities based on the number of observations that end in a terminal leaf, and I was wondering if that is the case with XGBoost.
