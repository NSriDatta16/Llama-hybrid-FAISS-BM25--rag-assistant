What is the benefits of using jQuery UI over plugins?

jQuery 1.3.2 minified is 55.9K, and jQuery UI core itself has more than 110K and top of that each component adds more to this core. I am wondering good reasons to use jQuery UI over plugins. For example jQuery accordion plugin has only 3.8K, jQuery Tools which does accordion, tooltips, tabs, scrollable, overlay and expose has only 5.8K, jQuery drag and drop plugin has total 4.8K etc etc. What is the benefits of using UI instead of using these plugins? Is it worth to add more than 110k+ for what you are using for? If so, why do you use it? Can you post your reasons why you use jQuery UI and why you don't use it?
