Here's an implementation of RK in Common Lisp: http://github.com/bld/bld-ode/blob/master/rk.lisp The nice thing about Common Lisp is that you can start with simple and elegant code and then make the critical bits run fast (e.g. by switching from mostly functional to stateful computation, or by declaring types). SBCL has an excellent native-code compiler.
