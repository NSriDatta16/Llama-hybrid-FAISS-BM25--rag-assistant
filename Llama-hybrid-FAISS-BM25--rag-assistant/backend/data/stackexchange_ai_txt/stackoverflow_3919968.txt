Yes, it is possible, but PDF viewer itself cannot run arbitrary code for security reasons. If you organize things with certain conventions, then, after you make a change to PDF, you can save it, and then run another script which would then do what you want. I would recommend Python as the scripting language. Please tell us more about your compliance reports - are they currently open as you change stuff? Can they be re0built from scratch or only updated with relevant changes? http://www.google.com/#hl=en&expIds=17259,18168,26637,26792&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=python+read+pdf&cp=13&pf=p&sclient=psy&safe=off&aq=f&aqi=g4g-o1&aql=&oq=python+read+p&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=5a996d56de453056 http://win32com.goermezer.de/content/view/173/284/
