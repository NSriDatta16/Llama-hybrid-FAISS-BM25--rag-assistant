Is there a hardware-independent standard for comparing ML models complexity?

Let us say I have two machine learning models on different machines and one on the cloud. Comparing them using elapsed times of execution does not make sense since they are powered up by different hardware. Since all models are equations in the core, why is there no such method to calculate the complexity of these methods?
