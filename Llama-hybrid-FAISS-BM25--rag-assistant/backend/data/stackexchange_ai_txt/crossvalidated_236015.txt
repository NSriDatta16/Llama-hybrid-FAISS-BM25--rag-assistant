Weka documentation does not tell much, but it refers to following paper Leo Breiman (2001). Random Forests. Machine Learning. 45(1): 5-32. and for more details you could check it. Slides from Data mining with Weka MOOC by one of Weka authors says that it Uses voting (or, for regression, averaging) -- but weights models according to their performance So basically: in classification case it uses voting weighted by performance and in regression case averages models weighting on their performance. However this does not seem to be well documented so if you want to be 100% sure you'd have to check the source code, or e-mail it's developers.
