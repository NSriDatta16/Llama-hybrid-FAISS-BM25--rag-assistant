Predict song genre using LSTM

I have a dataset of songs based on genres. For example, a song may hold {5, 2, 3} as scores set for Sentimental, Rock and Jazz. In total there are 800 songs sequentially arranged. I want to predict the next possible scores of the 801st song. I googled and got that RNNs and LSTMs are pretty good in predicting in terms of time. But all those examples are based on single values like (10,20,30,40,50) and the next predicted value will be 60. But in my problem, each item has three real values. So how to write code I do not understand. Any help or link to an article/paper is appreciated.
