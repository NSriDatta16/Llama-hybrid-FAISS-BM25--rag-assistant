How to determine feature effect size distributions in logistic regression across many models?

I have a dataset of 100 measurements each with 20 features. I am randomly pulling 90% of the data, training a l1 penalized logistic regression model and then testing on the remaining 10%. I repeat this 10x. I want to identify those features that have the largest effect size (model coefficient) but I cannot use effect size alone as this doesn't contain significance. I could have a large effect but pval of 0.5 for example. I could use the z-statistic which is effect size normalized by standard error but this really only gives you significance AND direction of effect. The only thing that sounds reasonable is setting a significance level and only considering the effects of features whose pval meats the threshold.
