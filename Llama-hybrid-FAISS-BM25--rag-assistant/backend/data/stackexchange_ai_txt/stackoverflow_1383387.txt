Data Storage Options

I've built a dedicated server applications that ships with the application. As of now it is storing data in a mix of binary- and XML files, but I've found that this gets way too messy and slow now that the amount of data required to store grows continuously. So what are my options for storing data in a format that is easier search/editable. Being able to do SQL queries on the data would be preferable, but I don't want to force the users into installing a database system.
