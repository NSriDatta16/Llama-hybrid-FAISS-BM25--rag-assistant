@slaks , before the vbsript ever gets called i have already determined the user agent. so yes it would never work in firefox , but it should never even be attempted if the end user has anything other than ie. @sean , thats interesting , im gonna make reference of that. my solution was : include this in the header of the index.html then , still in the index.html header , write a small inline javascript support function , --> function jsCallToVB(i) { var val = VBGetSwfVer(i); return val; } then in my external , main.js file , i call jsCallToVB(i);
