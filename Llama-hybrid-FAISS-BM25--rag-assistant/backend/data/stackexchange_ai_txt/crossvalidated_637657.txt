Using XGB or a Random Forest Model for Interaction Minion to later include in Logistic Regression Model

I am currently developing a logistic regression model, I already have some expert based interactuion terms I will implement but I want to further figure out possible interactions I can implement in the Logistic Regression. Now I was thinking if it would make sense to fit a XGBoost/Random Forest model to my data with the restriction of a maximum depth of 2, and then I would go over all of my trees in the forest and look which variables are interacting. Do you have any idea if there are already some packages in Python which can deal with this kind of stuff? Thanks a lot in advance and BR Paul
