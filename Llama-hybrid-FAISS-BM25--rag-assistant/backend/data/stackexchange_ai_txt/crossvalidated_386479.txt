AIC values for auto.arima

I have a problem with identifying why auto.arima suggest specific coefficients. I have time series with multiple seasonalities and I am trying to forecast future values using STL+ARIMA. I have been following Hyndman's book ( https://otexts.org/fpp2/complexseasonality.html ). However, in all examples I've come across I see auto.arima function being used instead of specifying Arima parameters. I've basically used mstl() function to get the remainders from Loess and then tried to estimate ARIMA parameters for these remainders. I am not sure if what I am doing is correct. I just wanted to check what auto.arima was suggesting. auto.arima was suggesting (0,1,2) parameters:AIC= 6759.638 SSE= 4774186 p-VALUE= 0.616866 . However, majority of other models had smaller AIC values, like arima(8,0,7):AIC= 6691.219 SSE= 3820932 p-VALUE= 0.9947854. or arima(3,1,7):AIC= 6709.794 SSE= 4177168 p-VALUE= 0.9993566 . I don't understand if what I am doing is correct and why this happens. I have checked residuals as well (Residuals from STL + ARIMA(0,1,2) Q* = 39.068, df = 18, p-value = 0.00279 Model df: 2. Total lags used: 20). ( Residuals from STL + ARIMA(3,1,7 Q* = 5.5735, df = 10, p-value = 0.8497 Model df: 10.Total lags used: 20)Any suggestions how to approach this situation ? code is below data.hourly.msts=msts(ts.data,seasonal.periods = c(24,168),start=c(1,1)) fixed.nValid=48 fixed.nTrain=length(ts.data)-fixed.nValid datatrain.msts=window(data.hourly.msts,start=c(1,1),end=c(1,fixed.nTrain)) a $residuals, lag=log(length(model$ residuals))) sse $residuals^2) cat(p-1,d-1,q-1, 'AIC=', model$ aic, ' SSE=',sse,' p-VALUE=', pval$p.value,'\n') } } } } data.hourly.stlm=stlm(data.hourly.msts,s.window="periodic", modelfunction=Arima,order=c(8,0,7)) data.hourly.stlm.pred=forecast(data.hourly.stlm,h=48)
