Estimating the common underlying process of a sample of time series

Often, time series analysis is based on a single series. However, this is not always the case. Let's assume that we have a sample of time series related to the same phenomenon, with equal frequency. I am wondering if it could be statistically meaningful: to calculate the sample distribution of the mean; recompose a time series where each point is the sample average of that point; in order to build the "average" series, considering it as the “general model” of the series. Then, based on that, to calculate which realization of the series (the concrete series in the dataset) are closer or significantly different from that average. Since I am not a statistician, I'd like to hear from someone more expert than me if this line of reasoning is wrong, or reasonable, or can be somehow improved? Any hints are very appreciated
