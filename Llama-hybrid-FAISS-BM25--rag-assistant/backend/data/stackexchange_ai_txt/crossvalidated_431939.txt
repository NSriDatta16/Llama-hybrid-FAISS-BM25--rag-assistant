Matching vs simple regression for causal inference?

This is a really simple, newbie question. I am really confused about the notion of matching and when it can be used instead of a multiple regression? Assume I have listed all the confounding variables (X), and my outcome (Y) and treatment assignment (A) are binary. Can I reach causal inference only by running the following logistic regression: Y ~ A + X and focus on "A" coefficients, SE, p-value? Doesn't it provide a better power than "matching" that'd result in losing a bunch of data? Any clarification would be really helpful? EDIT: assume A is not randomly assigned (analysis is observational)
