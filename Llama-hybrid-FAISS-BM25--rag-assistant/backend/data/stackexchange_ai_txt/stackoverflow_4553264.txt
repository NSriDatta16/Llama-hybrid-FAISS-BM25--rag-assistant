CSS Text Columns

I'm currently learning HTML/CSS and have come across a challenge around text columns. I'm trying to recreate www.campaignmonitor.com as a practice exercise. Here's the challenge: I have a text area using a two column layout, featuring 4 paragraphs of text. I'd like to keep the top two paragraphs aligned on the top edge, and the lower two paragraphs also aligned on their top edges. In other words, if either of the top paragraphs increase in height, the lower two paragraphs will both move down together. I appreciate this may be a basic question for you CSS pro's, but I'm stumpted with this one and online resources, tutorials and other sites have given me no success. All help is appreciated! Tom Here's the code I'm using: Create & send beautiful emails Design great looking emails using your own tools, or create templates and let your clients send their own.

Powerful Analytics Actionable reports that go beyond opens and clicks. Track your email related conversions and sales. Mark-up, Resell and Profit White-label and rebrandable, you set the price your clients pay and weâ€™ll send through your profit each month. And the CSS: .content { width: 1024px; margin: auto; position: relative; margin-top: 20px; color: #333; background-color: #666; } .col1a { width: 225px; margin-right: 20px; display: block; float: left; } .col2a { width: 225px; margin-right: 20px; display: block; float: left; } .col1b { width: 225px; margin-right: 20px; display: block; float: left; } .col2b { width: 225px; margin-right: 20px; display: block; float: left; } .row1 { position: relative; width: 490px; background-color: orange; } .row2 { position: relative; width: 490px; background-color: green; } .content h4 { margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 7px; line-height: 22px; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 17px; } .content p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; }
