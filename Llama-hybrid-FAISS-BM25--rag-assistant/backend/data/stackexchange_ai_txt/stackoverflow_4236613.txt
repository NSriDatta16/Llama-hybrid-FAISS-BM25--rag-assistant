Do django ORM (or Databases or Web Browsers) normalize string encodings for storage/submission?

Since there are multiple ways to encode non-ascii strings - does Django ORM make any effort to normalize the encoding, or I have to do it myself? Or will database do that? How about web browsers? I'd like to make sure that strings are findable regardless of normalization form of the original input, and allow matching string entered by different methods - e.g. web, command line, etc. Thanks.
