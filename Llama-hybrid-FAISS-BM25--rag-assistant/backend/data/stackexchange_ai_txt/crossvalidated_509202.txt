Define " obvious "! What's obvious to you doesn't need be obvious to someone else. So I can only offer my perspective. First, I hope it's obvious that the slope $\beta$ of the line doesn't change if we shift the data around; only the intercept changes. So, to simplify the formulas, we can, without loss of generality, assume that our data are centred around the origin: $\bar x = \bar y = 0$ . In that case the covariance-based formula simplifies to \begin{align} \beta &= \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{Var(X)} \\ &= \frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar x) (y_i - \bar y)}{\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2} \\ &= \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i}{\sum_i x_i^2} \\ \end{align} This is, incidentally, the same formula we obtain by minimising least squares. From the above assumption of the centred data it follows that the intercept is zero, so it suffices to solve: $$ \min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2} \sum_i (y_i - \beta x_i)^2 $$ We find the minimum by setting the first derivative to zero: $$ \sum_i (y_i - \beta x_i)x_i = 0 $$ Solving for $\beta$ produces again: $$ \beta = \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i}{\sum_i x_i^2} $$ Now, agreed, this is again mathematical formalism. Another, more "intuitive" way of looking at it is to observe that each $x_i y_i$ is the area of a rectangle with sides $x_i$ and $y_i$ . Equally, each $x_i^2$ is the area of a square with sides $x_i$ . So the sum in the numerator above can be interpreted as the average rectangle area, and in the denominator as the average square (both scaled by the number of points, $N$ , but these cancel out, so we can ignore them). The slope $\beta$ is then the ratio of these two areas. Now, if we construct the rectangle and the square to have the same base, $\tilde x$ : $$ \tilde x = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2} $$ then the other side of the " average rectangle " is given by $$ \tilde y = \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i}{\tilde x} $$ It is then straightforward to see that $$ \beta = \frac{\tilde y}{\tilde x} $$ or, graphically,
