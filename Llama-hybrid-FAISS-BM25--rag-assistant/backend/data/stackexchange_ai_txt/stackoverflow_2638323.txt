What's the current (as of April 2010) state of affairs regarding vs in HTML?

The age old question. vs . From what I gather, is the XHTML-compliant way of doing things, while is for legacy support. I'm currently building a Flash application that will contain a pre-made embedding code for users to copy and paste, and I'm wondering if it's feasible to simply dump the tag altogether. Which browsers would be unable to load my application if I gave my users an -only embed code? Thanks :)
