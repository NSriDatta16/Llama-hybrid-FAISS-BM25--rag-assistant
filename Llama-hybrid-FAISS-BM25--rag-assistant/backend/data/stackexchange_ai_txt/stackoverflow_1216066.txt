Break the problem up into sub-problems. What's the value of a cupcake? A basic approach is "the average of the scores." A slightly more robust approach may be "the weighted average of the scores." But there may be complications beyond that... a cupcake with 3 goodness and 3 flavor may be 'better' than one with 5 flavor and 1 goodness, even if flavor and goodness have equal weight (IOW, a low score may have a disproportionate effect). Make up some sample cupcake scores (specifics! Cover the normal scenarios and a couple weird ones), and estimate what you think a reasonable "overall" score would be if you had an ideal algorithm. Then, use that data to reverse engineer the algorithm. For example, a cupcake with goodness 4, flavor 3, presentation 1 and moistness 4 might deserve a 4 overall, while one with goodness 4, flavor 2, presentation 5, and moistness 4 might only rate a 3. Next, do the same thing for the bakery. Given a set of cupcakes with a range of scores, what would an appropriate rating be? Then, figure out the function that will give you that data. The "goodness" ranking seems a bit odd, as it seems like it's a general rating, and so having it in there is already the overall score, so why calculate an overall score? If you had time to work with this, I'd always suggest capturing the raw data, and using that as a basis to do more detailed analysis, but I don't think that's really relevant here.
