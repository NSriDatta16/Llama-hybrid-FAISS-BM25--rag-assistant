Expected value of a Gaussian random variable transformed with a logistic function

Both the logistic function and standard deviation are usually denoted $\sigma$. I'll use $\sigma(x) = 1/(1+\exp(-x))$ and $s$ for standard deviation. I have a logistic neuron with a random input whose mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $s$ I know. I hope the difference from the mean can be approximated well by some Gaussian noise. So, with a slight abuse of notation, assume it produces $\sigma(\mu + N(0,s^2))=\sigma(N(\mu,s^2))$. What is the expected value of $\sigma(N(\mu,s^2))$? The standard deviation $s$ might be large or small compared with $\mu$ or $1$. A good closed form approximation for the expected value would be almost as good as a closed form solution. I don't think a closed form solution exists. This can be viewed as a convolution, and the characteristic function for the logistic density is known ($\pi t ~\text{csch} ~\pi t$), but I'm not sure how much that helps. The inverse symbolic calculator was unable to recognize the density at $0$ of the convolution of the logistic distribution's density and a standard normal distribution, which suggests but does not prove that there is no simple elementary integral. More circumstantial evidence: In some papers on adding Gaussian input noise to neural networks with logistic neurons, the papers didn't give closed form expressions either. This question arose in trying to understand the error in the mean field approximation in Boltzman machines.
