Switching between alpha, half-life and span in exponential moving average

I have been reviewing documentation here on exponential moving averages. I am having a hard time being able to analytically move between the definition of an exponential moving average specified in terms of its alpha decay factor and specifying decay in terms of half-life and span. Is someone able to provide a derivation for the formulas of half-life and span SPECIFICALLY relating to the definition of the exponential moving average provided at the link?
