Predicting from individual and group data

Suppose that I have a classroom of students who each have taken two tests (A and B). I have the scores for test A and only know the average score for test B. Since students tend to perform similarly on both tests, I want to predict their scores for test B. In practice I would not expect this to be incredibly accurate -- but am interested in trying to find out if student 1 is generally a 'B' student and the class overall does better/worse on a test, what kind of score should we expect of student 1 on this test.
