In truth Design Patterns and OOP don't really have anything to do with one another. They are, as they're name suggests, patterns (or "recipes") for implementing a design. There are "design patterns" for virtually any language you'd work in but it happens that the Gang of Four book focuses on OO design patterns. A knowledge of OO design patterns can be a positive indicator, but when interviewing someone (or trying to gauge their level of expertise), I would look at the complexity of the patterns they are familiar with, as well as a good knowledge of when/where to use a pattern. I've seen developers latch on to a pattern like a "golden hammer" and use it in places where it's not necessarily applicable. So just like a recipe book doesn't make one a master chef, knowledge of OO Design Patterns, does not necessarily make one an OO expert.
