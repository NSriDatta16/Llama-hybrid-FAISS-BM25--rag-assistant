Bayesian interpretation of FDR

Suppose we want to apply a rejection rule on N tests. We may write the following table: Decision Actual | Accept H0 | Reject H0 | Total ------------------------------- H0 | N0 - a | a | N0 Non H0 | N1 - b | b | N1 Total | N - R | R | N The false discovery proportion (Fdp) is defined as $a/R$. In a Bayesian setting, we can define a threshold $z_0$ such that we reject $H_{0,i}$ if $|z_i|>z_0$. Then the Fdp will be: $$ Fdp = P(H_{0,i} | |z_i|>z_0) = \frac{P(|z_i|>z_0 | H_{0,i}) \pi_0}{P(|z_i|>z_0)}, $$ where $\pi_0$ is the prior of $H_{0,i}$. My problem is that I do not understand why we want to compute $P(H_{0,i} | |z_i|>z_0)$ in the first instance. Shouldn't we compute: $$ Fdp = P(\text{reject} \quad H_{0,i} | |z_i| or by taking the complement of both we get the first formula?
