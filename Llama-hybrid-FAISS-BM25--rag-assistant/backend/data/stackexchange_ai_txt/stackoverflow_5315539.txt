Iterate in reverse through an array with PHP - SPL solution?

Is there an SPL Reverse array iterator in PHP? And if not, what would be the best way to achieve it? I could simply do $array = array_reverse($array); foreach($array as $currentElement) {} or for($i = count($array) - 1; $i >= 0; $i--) { } But is there a more elegant way?
