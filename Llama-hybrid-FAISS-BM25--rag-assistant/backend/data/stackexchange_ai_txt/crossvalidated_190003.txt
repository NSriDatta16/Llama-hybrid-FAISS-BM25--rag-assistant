I appreciate articles in which as well the limited set of clean data as the broader set of available data are analysed. Those conclusions that emerge from both sets are extremely valid, of cource. The reason to do the research (the reason why someone pays you) determines the required external validity. If you work for a local hospital, for instance, then there is no problem limiting to the most frequent etnico group. If you work fo an international organisation and only studie one ethnique groep, you MUST try to be compatinle with other studies in other regions, so that your results can be includerd in a revieuw article.
