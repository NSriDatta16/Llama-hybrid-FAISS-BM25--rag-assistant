It's not wrong to have your media files into your SVN repository, as your medias' version is linked to the rest of your software's. Besides, if you want to have backups of your svn repository, you can use the svnsync command to have some other box mirror you "main" subversion repository. About structure, the best practice mainly depends on the use case you are facing. You most likely want to organize your files by modules and content-type (so having media separated from code, ...).
