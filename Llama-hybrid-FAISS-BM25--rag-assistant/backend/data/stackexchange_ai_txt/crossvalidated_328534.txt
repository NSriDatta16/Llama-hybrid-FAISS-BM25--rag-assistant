This is the partial derivative of the softmax function $y_{k'}$ with respect to its activation $a_k$. Someone on this site has already written an excellent answer that explains the full evaluation of this derivative, just with slightly different notation: Derivative of Softmax with respect to weights I'm confused by the delta kk' and i have never seen anything like it. As others have mentioned, the Kronecker delta function $\delta_{kk'}=1$ when the indices match (i.e. $k=k'$) and is $0$ elsewhere. It's a handy way to "select" only part of the multivariate input when performing derivatives over multiply-connected paths like a neural network. Think of it almost like an if-else statement for a particular link. Also, it's not the only way you can represent this mathematically - some texts use an indicator function like $I[k=k']$ to represent the same logic. In our case, the partial derivative of the specific activation $y_{k'}$ (indexed by $k'$) is not just with respect to any activation, but to the specific activation $a_k$ indexed by $k$. That's why a lot of the terms in the partial derivative are set to $0$ when $k \ne k'$, using the Kronecker delta. Another question is do we consider the summation while taking the derivative, why or why not? If I understand your question correctly - we do consider the summation in the denominator, $\sum_{k'=1}^K e^{a_k{k'}}$. The derivation I linked to above shows how that is done. https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/945871/derivative-of-softmax-loss-function is a bit relevant, but the result of differentiation is different. It is indeed related, but focusses on a different partial derivative. If you had a Loss function $L$ that is a function of your softmax output $y_{k'}$, then you could go one step further and evaluate this using the chain rule $$\frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{k'}} \frac{\partial y_{k'}}{\partial a_k}$$ The last term in the above, $\frac{\partial y_{k'}}{\partial a_k}$, is what you are focussing on in your question, while the question you linked to is trying to evaluate $\frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k}$. So they are related but focussed on different terms.
