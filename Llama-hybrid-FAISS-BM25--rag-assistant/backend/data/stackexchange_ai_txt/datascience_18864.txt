Convolutional Neural Networks for Sensor Data

I am reading this paper regarding action recognition based on sensor data. And this paper first transforms the input to spectrogram (time vs frequency, it's like the Fourier Transform of each segment of the input time series but square it). So instead of the time series you are given a matrix of st x sf (st is number of time windows, sf is number of frequency components considered) as input to you CNN. There is this algorithm: Can someone explain this? Especially the formula for CNN, I don't get why you have to convolve the (t-1) and dw.
