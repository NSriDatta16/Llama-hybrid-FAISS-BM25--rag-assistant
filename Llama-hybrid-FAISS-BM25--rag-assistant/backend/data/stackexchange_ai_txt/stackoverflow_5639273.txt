SQLiteDatabase vs File storage

I want to store structure type data (i.e. information of call logs like name, number, type of number, date, time, duration). Which is the best way and which is faster? SQLiteDatabase (make table and insert, delete logs in it) or use file storage (means make one class for all parameters and write their objects in file using input/output Stream and serializable) or the another way i heard about it is XML parser but i don't know this. Please help me. Thanks in advance.
