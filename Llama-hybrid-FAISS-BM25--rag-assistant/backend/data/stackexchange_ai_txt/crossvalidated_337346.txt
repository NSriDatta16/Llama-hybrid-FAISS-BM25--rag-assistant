Use a framework like Kaldi and attempt to do 'domain adaptation' by adding vocabulary and audio training (I'm not familiar with Kaldi so I don't know what it involves) There is vocabulary adaptation and language model adaptation. The result should be good. Audio adaptation is not required. You will have to learn a bit of Kaldi though, more or less close description is here: https://chrisearch.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/speech-recognition-using-kaldi-extending-and-using-the-aspire-model/
