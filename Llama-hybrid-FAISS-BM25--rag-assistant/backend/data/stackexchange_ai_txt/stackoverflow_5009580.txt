You should be able to modify Determine if two rectangles overlap each other? to your purpose fairly easily. Suppose that you have CubeA and CubeB . Any one of 6 conditions guarantees that no overlap can exist: Cond1. If A's left face is to the right of the B's right face, - then A is Totally to right Of B CubeA.X2 So the condition for no overlap is: Cond1 or Cond2 or Cond3 or Cond4 or Cond5 or Cond6 Therefore, a sufficient condition for Overlap is the opposite (De Morgan) Not Cond1 AND Not Cond2 And Not Cond3 And Not Cond4 And Not Cond5 And Not Cond6
