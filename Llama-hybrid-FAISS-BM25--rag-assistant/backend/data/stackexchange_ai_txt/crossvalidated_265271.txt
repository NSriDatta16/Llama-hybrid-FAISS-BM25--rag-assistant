Approximate Bayesian computation: where to start from?

I am about to start a project in ABC methods and I need to first of all study ABC since I know nothing about it. I spent quite a bit looking for on-line tutorials and notes but I found nothing apart for some videos. Can you please suggest me some notes or even a textbook? Not to difficult since I do not really need to understand all the math behind it. I am looking for some material that could allow me to understand the reasons behind the use of ABC methods.
