How to make my Pocket PC stay on till my application has finished?

I've got an application that presents the user with ongoing status for roughly 15 minutes. What I want to do is make it so the unit will not power off during this time (because the wifi goes down and the status stops :( ) I'd assume the system is capable of doing this gracefully because I can watch a whole episode of Dilbert (22min) without having to touch my screen. At the same time, when the its over, the system goes to "sleep" (at least after a few min). Keep alive if you please.
