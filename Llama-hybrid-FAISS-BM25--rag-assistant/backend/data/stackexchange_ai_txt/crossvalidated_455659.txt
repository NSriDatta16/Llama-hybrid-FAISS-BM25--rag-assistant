Filter consists of kernels. This means, in 2D convolutional neural network, filter is 3D. Check this gif from CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition : Those three 3x3 kernels in second column of this gif form a filter . So as in the third column. The number of filters always equal to the number of feature maps in next layer. While the number of kernels in each filter will always equal to the number of feature maps in this layer.
