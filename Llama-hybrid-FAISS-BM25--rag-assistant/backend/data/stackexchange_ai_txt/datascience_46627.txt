Need equations for some of weight initializers in tensorflow?

For my CNN model I tried some of the weight initializers such as "truncated normal initializer","random normal initializer","glorot normal initializer","glorot uniform initializer", my questions are: 1- I need the equations for each of them, for the two Xavier initializers I found more than one type of equation for that I confused which one is true but for other two I didn't found any equation? 2- Is the range of values are between 0 and 1 for all of them? are they considered a gaussian?
