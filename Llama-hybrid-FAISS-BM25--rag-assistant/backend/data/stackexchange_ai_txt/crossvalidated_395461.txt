How is Student's t-distribution related with this similarity/probability equation between data points?

In the t-SNE paper " Visualizing Data using t-SNE " and a Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) approach " Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis ", they both use the Student t-distribution to quantify the probability/similarity/distance between two data points: But how is this q related to the Student's t-distribution shown below? I'm not quite familiar with the t distribution. When I check the PDF of the t distribution from Wikipedia (in the following), I could not see the link between them.
