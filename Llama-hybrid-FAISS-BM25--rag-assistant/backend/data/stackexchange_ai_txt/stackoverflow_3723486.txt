Adding resource folder to classpath: When you Clean-&-Build a NetBeans Ant Based Project it creates a manifest.mf file in the root directory of the project. This file gets included in the JAR file also. Modify this file and add entry like follows: Manifest-Version: 1.0 X-COMMENT: Main-Class will be added automatically by build Class-Path: arts/ slash is important after arts in the class path. Including the arts resource folder in the distribution Either copy this folder in the dist folder after the build or add a ANT target to copy the required resources in the dist folder. Add the target like as follows in the build.xml file: Code to access such resources: The code needed to access such resource files shall be as follows: (This will not work in design time but surely from the JAR file) // pay attention to relative path URL resource = ClassLoader.getSystemResource("gui/refresh.png"); ImageIcon tmp = new ImageIcon(resource); NOTE: The files manifest.mf and build.xml located in the root directory of the project are accessible from the Files Panel in NetBeans IDE
