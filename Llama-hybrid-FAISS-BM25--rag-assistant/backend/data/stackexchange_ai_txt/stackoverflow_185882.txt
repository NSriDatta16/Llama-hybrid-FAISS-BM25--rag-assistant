Go with C++. Timers, threading, audio, SDL, wxwidgets, these are all things that Perl can do, but doesn't really excel at. Also, PAR or perl2exe are clunky mechanisms for distribution. They work, but they're not ideal. Meanwhile, C++ (and I highly encourage you to look at using Boost ) would fit nicely into this role.
