This is very common and is easy. From the training data set, let's suppose you have seasonal factors of 1.1, .95, .95 and 1.0 (e.g. quarterly data, multiplicative seasonality so factors average 1.0). Then divide your new data set by these seasonal factors to deseasonalize the new set. Make sure you start the sequence in the right spot! e.g. training will start in period 1, but your new set may naturally start in some other period.
