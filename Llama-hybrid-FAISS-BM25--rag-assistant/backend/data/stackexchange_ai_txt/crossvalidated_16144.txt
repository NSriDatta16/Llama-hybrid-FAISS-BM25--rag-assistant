Your charts will depend on what story you are interested in. Are you interested in amounts spent (on average the rich usually spend more on most items than the poor do)? Or are you interested in the shares of expenditure (or income) going on different items? Can you avoid your charts getting too cluttered? Do you intend to adjust your numbers for household size? Or household type, especially whether there are children? You might get some ideas from the UK publication Living Costs and Food Survey . You will find that linear regression of expenditure on income is often not particularly appropriate.
