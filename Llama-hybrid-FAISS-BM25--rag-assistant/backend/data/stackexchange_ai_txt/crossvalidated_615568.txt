If you have all the data and are analyzing it retrospectively, you could calculate all of the individual measures' interval rates of change, and then express them relative to the average rate of change for that measure. To do this, calculate $m_i=(x_i-x_{i-1})/(t_i-t_{i-1})$ for one measure for every interval, find the average rate of change over all intervals ( $\bar m$ ), and then express interval rates of change as $m_i/ \bar m$ . This gives you measure-specific values as to whether the measure is changing more or less than average, which could be a reasonable way to express "changing a lot" or "changing a little". You may have to weight the formula if your intervals are not of equal length. There may also be numerical issues if most of your intervals exhibit no change, as even small fluctuations will look relatively huge compared to no change at all. This also requires retrospective analysis of the data, as you need the full history to compute the average. You could alter this for prospective analysis if you have domain knowledge about roughly what's an "average" rate of change - simply replace $\bar m$ with whatever value you choose, and this becomes your new setpoint for comparison for what constitutes a big or little change.
