This is a simple question asking for a simple answer. Here is a list of statements, starting with the most basic, and proceeding with more precise qualifications. The IQR is the spread of the middle half of the data. Without making assumptions about how the data are distributed , the IQR quantifies the amount by which individual values typically vary. The IQR is related to the well-known "standard deviation" (SD): when the data follow a "bell curve," the IQR is about 35% greater than the SD. (Equivalently, the SD is about three-quarters of the IQR.) As a rule of thumb, data values that deviate from the middle value by more than twice the IQR deserve individual attention. They are called "outliers." Data values that deviate from the middle value by more than 3.5 times the IQR are usually scrutinized closely. They are sometimes called "far outliers."
