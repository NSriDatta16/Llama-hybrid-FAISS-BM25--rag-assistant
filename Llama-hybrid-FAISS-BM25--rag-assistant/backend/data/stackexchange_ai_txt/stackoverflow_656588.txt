If you don't need to display the results to the user instantly, you could add the file to a Database table for scanning later. Then, you could fork a new process to scan and update the results in the table. You have a good example here: http://robert.accettura.com/blog/2006/09/14/asynchronous-processing-with-php/ . If you absolutely need to display the results within the same request, then you could do it exactly as I said before but outputting a temp page requesting the results via AJAX; once the scan is over, redirect the user to the results page. If you don't want to use JavaScript, then a simple meta refresh tag would do the trick.
