I have just used code like the following: mTempFilePath = File.createTempFile("myappprefix_", ""); i.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(mTempFilePath)); Is there some reason it has to be in internal storage? I'd expect that only phones like the HTC Incredible (which has internal photo storage) would be able to explicitly store photos on internal.
