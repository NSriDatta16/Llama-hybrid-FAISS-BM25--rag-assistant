Many to many relationship

I have the following table - Actor, Actresses, Director & Movie. First 2 tables have many to many relationship with movie table. So i have created Celebrity_Movie table which has primary key of all these tables as foreign key. So my question is how can I insert records in Celebrity_Movie table. Because there can be multiple actors, actresses in a movie. e.g. Movie 'Race' has multiple actors & multiple actresses. So how to fill data in Celebrity_Movie table for 'Race' movie? Actor table Actor_id Actor_name 1 Amitabh 2 Akshay kumar 3 Hritik roshan 4 Amir khan 5 R. Madhavan 6 Sharman joshi 7 Ajay devgan 8 Tushar 9 Arshad varsi Actress Actress_id Actress_name 1 Aishwairya 2 Katrina 3 Bipasha 4 Sameera reddy 5 Kareena 6 Amrita rao Director Direct_id Direct_name 1 Abbas_Mustan 2 Priyadarshan Movie Movie_id Movie_name M1 Race M2 Golmal2 M3 3 Idiots
