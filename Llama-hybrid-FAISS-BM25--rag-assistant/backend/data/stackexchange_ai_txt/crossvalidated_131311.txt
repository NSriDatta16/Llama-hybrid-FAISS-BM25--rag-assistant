Since in this kind of problems you lack of data, you have to include external knowledge in statistical model. Including prior information in a model is a key feature of Bayesian model . Numerous sources (e.g. here or here ) quote that some kind of Bayesian analysis was employed during World War II for different aims such as cracking Enigma, hunting U-boats etc. Actually, Bayesian estimation is used for similar purposes like this even today (e.g. for search and rescue, see here or here ). Note that for cracking Enigma computers were used for the first time and also nowadays computers are a key part of simulation-based Bayesian estimation methods.
