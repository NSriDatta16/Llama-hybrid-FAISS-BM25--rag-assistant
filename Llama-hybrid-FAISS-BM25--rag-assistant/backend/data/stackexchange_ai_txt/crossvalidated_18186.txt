I think your calculated standard deviation for the proportions is $0.0064$ (note extra 0). Yes, to calculate the expected standard deviation, you are probably expected to use a binomial model and the formula $\sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}.$ You can take the mean of your sample data to give you an estimate of $p$, though taking $0.5$ will give much the same result in practice. $n$ comes from "out of an average of 3900 births per month".
