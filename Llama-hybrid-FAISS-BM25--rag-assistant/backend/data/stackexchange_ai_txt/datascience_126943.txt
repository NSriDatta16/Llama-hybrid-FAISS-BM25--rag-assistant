periods where it is high and periods where it is low Some latent variable that slowly varies with time is affecting the base rate of your response variable. It would be best to directly observe that variable and add it to the dataset. Second best approach would be to pick some appropriate window size (a kernel bandwidth), compute a moving average, and add that rate feature to the dataset where your model can observe it and learn the patterns. Also supply the rate feature at test + inference time, through imputation if necessary.
