There are a few good answers here already but I thought it worth noting that the answer to this question can change drastically depending on how the iid assumption is violated. For example, if a univariate dataset is not iid, but is stationary, then many very simple estimation procedures, such as the sample mean, still converge to the appropriate limit. However, if the iid assumption is violated because the data is non-stationary, then life is much more difficult. Note that the very common Machine Learning tradition of splitting the dataset into a training, test, and sometimes validation set, is invalid in the presence of non-stationarity. If this is the difficulty you face then your best bet is usually to try and find a transformation of the data that is close to stationary (or ergodicity) and work with that instead.
