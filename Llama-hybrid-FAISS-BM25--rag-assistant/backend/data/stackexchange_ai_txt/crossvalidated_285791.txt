What's your methodology of tuning neural network hyperparameters?

I'm curious to see what methods all of you use to tune your neural network hyperparameters. Specifically, How do you choose the number of layers, and how many hidden units are in each layer? Do you use manual parameter tuning, or random search, grid search, or Bayesian methods? How do you tune the optimizer, learning rate, regularization methods, etc? Any wisdom would be greatly appreciated.
