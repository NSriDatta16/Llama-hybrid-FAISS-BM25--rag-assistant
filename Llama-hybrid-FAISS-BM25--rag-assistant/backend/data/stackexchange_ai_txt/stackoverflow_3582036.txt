I can reproduce this problem by putting a target outside the project element that is required in ant build files. The error indicates that there is a fault in your build file - something (a target element) in the wrong place. This build throws that error: Whereas this does not: In the full error message you should get a line number to guide you to the point in the file needing attention: # line number here # v build.xml:2: Unexpected element "{}target" {antlib:org.apache.tools.ant}target
