Should we modify the features in such a way that we would use the difference between the two teams, instead of two values? Yes, you should definitely design your features "to help" the ML algorithm, this is called feature engineering . Be careful though that there can be many different options for representing the contrast in "average possession": you can think of the difference indeed, but also a ratio or many other arithmetic combinations. On the other hand some algorithms might be good at finding this interactions? Most ML handle take into account interactions between features to some extent , but it depends what kind of interaction and which ML algorithm.
