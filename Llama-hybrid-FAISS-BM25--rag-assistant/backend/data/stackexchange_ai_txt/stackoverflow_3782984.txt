Select Multiple Items in CustomPivotViewer of Silverlight

I'm thinking of CTR-Clicking each item to build up an array to add.... or even more fancy, drag select an area of items (don't think this is possible tho). I'm aware of the custom events such as ItemDoubleClicked, but is there something like ItemSingleClick, where I can check if the CTR/SHIFT key is being pressed before executing an action.
