If you want to store some kind of Preferences you should use SharedPreferences. If you want to include some file to read from you should put it in your assets folder and you can read it like this. InputStream input = context.getAssets().open("some.properties"); To save data to a file you open it like this. OutputStream outputStream = openFileOutput("some.properties", Context.MODE_PRIVATE); and to read the same file you do this. InputStream inputStream = openFileInput("some.properties"); This is all covered very well in the Data Storage topic on the Android Dev Site.
