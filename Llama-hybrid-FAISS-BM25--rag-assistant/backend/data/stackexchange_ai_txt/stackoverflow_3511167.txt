how to drag & drop buttons on Iphone

I am developing for Iphone by using Netbiscuits tool. I need to use drag & drop functionality on IPhone. I have found a javascript code which locates at Drag Drop Javascript Library for iPad & iPhone. However I am not able to use drag & drop functionality by usng javascript code which was given at the website. Have you ever added drag & drop functionlity to IPhone? I would be glad if you have a sample which was written on Javascript. Thank you from now for your helps. Regards Altaico
