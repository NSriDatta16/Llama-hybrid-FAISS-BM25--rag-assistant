Comparing a model's forecasts to observations

I have done an experiment where I have made forecasts and I want to measure how well I did in comparison to observations. My first approach was a goodness of fit using Excel and the R squared value, however I have been asked to take the standard deviation, or 68% confidence interval of each to determine how well you reproduce the original values. Could someone tell me how to do this? This is just as a small snapshot of the data. I have hundreds of values over several categories. I could take the Model - Observed and divide by Observed and then average it but then what about the variation? My variance, if that is the right term is higher. I need some method of quantitatively assessing how well my model reproduces actual measurements. Would be grateful for any advice. Thank you
