I agree with everyone else that both your source table and your desired output are poor design. While you probably can't do anything about your source table, I recommend the following code and output: Select id, name, date, school from MyTable; union Select id, name, date, school1 from MyTable; (repeat as necessary) This will give you results in the format: id name date school 1 john 11/11/2001 nyu 1 john 11/11/2001 ucla 2 paul 11/11/2011 mit 2 paul 11/11/2011 uft (Note: in my version of SQL, union queries automatically select distinct records so the distinct flag isn't needed) With this format, you could easily count the number of schools per student, number of students per school, etc. If processing time and/or storage space is a factor here, you could then split this into 2 tables, 1 with the id,name & date, the other with the id & school (basically what JonH just said). But if you're just working up some simple statistics, this should suffice.
