IF the browser can access the page, and your code cannot, then there's something different between the browser request and your request. You can look at the browser request, using, say, Firebug, to see what the differences are. Some things I can think of are: The site sets a cookie (maybe during login). You may be able to handle this in code, you will have to explicitly add support for passing the cookie. This is most likely. The site filters based on user agents. You can set the user agent. This is not as likely.
