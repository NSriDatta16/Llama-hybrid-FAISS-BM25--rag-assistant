This is a really interesting question. So, you are asking for features that you could look at to classify whether Twitter users are gamers, based on the number of followers they have. That is awesome that you identified variation in number of followers. I would try and plot the variation in number of followers between Twitter users who are known to be gamers and those who are not. If the distribution of number of followers vary significantly (in a broad sense, if their means and standard deviations differ greatly from each other) between gamers and non-gamers, then this would be a great feature to add as part of your data for classification (using a neural network). 1 Another avenue you could explore are the Twitter users' posts themselves. One approach, for example, could be looking at frequency of "gaming-related" words and whether these occur more often among gamers than non-gamers.
