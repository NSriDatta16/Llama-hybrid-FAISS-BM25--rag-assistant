How to convert C++ Code to C

I have some C++ code. In the code there are many classes defined, their member functions, constructors, destructors for those classes, few template classes and lots of C++ stuff. Now I need to convert the source to plain C code. I the have following questions: Is there any tool to convert C++ code and header files to C code? Will I have to do total rewrite of the code (I will have to remove the constructors,destructors and move that code into some init() , deinit() functions; change classes to structures, make existing member functions as function pointers in those newly defined structures and then invoke those functions using function pointers etc..)? If I have to convert it manually myself, what C++ specific code-data constructs/semantics do I need to pay attention to while doing the conversion from C++ to C?
