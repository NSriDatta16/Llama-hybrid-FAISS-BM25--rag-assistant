It's a bit of a kludge (as is the entire concept so... eh...) but if you're going to do this multiple times, and you want to be able to deal with the possibility of non-contiguous enums, you can create a (global constant) array, and have (to use ennukiller's example) Directions directions[4] = {East, West, North, South}; and then in your loop you can talk about directions[i] rather than iterating directly over the directions themselves... As I said, it's ugly, but it's slightly less fragile I think...
