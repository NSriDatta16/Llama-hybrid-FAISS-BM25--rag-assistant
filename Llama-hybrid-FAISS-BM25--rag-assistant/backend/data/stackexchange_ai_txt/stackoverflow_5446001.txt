Funny enough the original 1.0 releases of Symfony had a more extendable email validator. You may read the code at http://trac.symfony-project.org/browser/branches/1.0/lib/validator/sfEmailValidator.class.php?rev=6991 There were two options for the built in regex pattern, the one you mentioned above and then Cal Henderson's. I believe Cal's might fit your needs better and you may easily use it with Symfony's Regex Validator. I pasted the regex pattern and the explaining comments below. /* Cal Henderson: http://iamcal.com/publish/articles/php/parsing_email/pdf/ * The long regular expression below is made by the following code * fragment: * * $qtext = '[^\\x0d\\x22\\x5c\\x80-\\xff]'; * $dtext = '[^\\x0d\\x5b-\\x5d\\x80-\\xff]'; * $atom = '[^\\x00-\\x20\\x22\\x28\\x29\\x2c\\x2e\\x3a-\\x3c' * . '\\x3e\\x40\\x5b-\\x5d\\x7f-\\xff]+'; * $quoted_pair = '\\x5c\\x00-\\x7f'; * $domain_literal = "\\x5b($dtext|$quoted_pair)*\\x5d"; * $quoted_string = "\\x22($qtext|$quoted_pair)*\\x22"; * $domain_ref = $atom; * $sub_domain = "($domain_ref|$domain_literal)"; * $word = "($atom|$quoted_string)"; * $domain = "$sub_domain(\\x2e$sub_domain)*"; * $local_part = "$word(\\x2e$word)*"; * $addr_spec = "$local_part\\x40$domain"; */ $re = '/^([^\\x00-\\x20\\x22\\x28\\x29\\x2c\\x2e\\x3a-\\x3c\\x3e\\x40\\x5b-' .'\\x5d\\x7f-\\xff]+|\\x22([^\\x0d\\x22\\x5c\\x80-\\xff]|\\x5c\\x00-' .'\\x7f)*\\x22)(\\x2e([^\\x00-\\x20\\x22\\x28\\x29\\x2c\\x2e\\x3a-' .'\\x3c\\x3e\\x40\\x5b-\\x5d\\x7f-\\xff]+|\\x22([^\\x0d\\x22\\x5c\\x80' .'-\\xff]|\\x5c\\x00-\\x7f)*\\x22))*\\x40([^\\x00-\\x20\\x22\\x28\\x29' .'\\x2c\\x2e\\x3a-\\x3c\\x3e\\x40\\x5b-\\x5d\\x7f-\\xff]+|\\x5b([^' .'\\x0d\\x5b-\\x5d\\x80-\\xff]|\\x5c\\x00-\\x7f)*\\x5d)(\\x2e([^\\x00-' .'\\x20\\x22\\x28\\x29\\x2c\\x2e\\x3a-\\x3c\\x3e\\x40\\x5b-\\x5d\\x7f-' .'\\xff]+|\\x5b([^\\x0d\\x5b-\\x5d\\x80-\\xff]|\\x5c\\x00-\\x7f)*' .'\\x5d))*$/' ; I think it is also import to keep in mind that there are rare instances were a email address may not be RFC compliant, such as local intranet email addresses. Just a thought.
