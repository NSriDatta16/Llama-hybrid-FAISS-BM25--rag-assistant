Qt Tabs for Files

Well, i'm working on an IDE System, which can open multiple files at same time. I'm somewhat noob with Tabs. What i'm trying to do is a TabSystem, you click a file on the File Tree and it opens a new tab for it and show it's content. You can switch to other tag then switch to that one, drag tabs, etc. Any idea?
