Why is that data structures usually have a size of 2^n?

Is there a historical reason or something ? I've seen quite a few times something like char foo[256]; or #define BUF_SIZE 1024 . Even I do mostly only use 2 n sized buffers, mostly because I think it looks more elegant and that way I don't have to think of a specific number. But I'm not quite sure if that's the reason most people use them, more information would be appreciated.
