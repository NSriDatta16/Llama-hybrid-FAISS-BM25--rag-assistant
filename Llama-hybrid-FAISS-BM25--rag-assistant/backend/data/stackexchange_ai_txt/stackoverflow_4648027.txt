One methodology could be to replace variables with markers and use the String.Format method ( http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object ...) ) or another kind of Formatter to replace accordingly. Whilst I'm just getting into Spring myself and suspect that it could provide a more elegant solution, currently I would use string formatters to replace placeholders with variable values at runtime.
