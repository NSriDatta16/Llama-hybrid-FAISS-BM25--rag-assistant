How to find out whether an affine transformed rectangle contains a certain point, in Java?

I'm trying to make an interactive GUI but I need to move a certain object whenever that rectangle is clicked + dragged. Basically I wanna know whether a rectangle, that has been affine transformed, contains a specific point (x, y). Is there a way to do this? I have tried using contains() method but it doesn't work for a rectangle that has been affine transformed. I checked the Java tutorials but the user interactive GUIs don't use affine transformation. Can someone point me to a tutorial that allows the user to affine transform a certain shape as well as move the shape ONLY when the shape itself is clicked + dragged. If not, how can I approach this? Thanks.
