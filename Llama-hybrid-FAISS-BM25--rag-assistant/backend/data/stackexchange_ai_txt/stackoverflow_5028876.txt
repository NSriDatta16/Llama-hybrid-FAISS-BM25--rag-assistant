Any logic running locally will always be prone to circumvention. With regard to the actual storage of a license depending on your application I would write a web service and run your own server. Get the app to check with your service each time it starts that the license is still valid. This also gives you much more flexibility for example you could revoke a licence if payment doesn't clear.
