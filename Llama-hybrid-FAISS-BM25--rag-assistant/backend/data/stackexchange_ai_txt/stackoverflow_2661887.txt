I've had the same issue, but finally managed to get it working. Not really sure how but here's a list of things I did between it not working to when it started working again. Converted the project being tested to .NET 4 Turned off CodeCoverage Turned CodeCoverage back on again Did a RebuildAll on the test project Not sure which bit fixed it though. Anyway, hope this helps!
