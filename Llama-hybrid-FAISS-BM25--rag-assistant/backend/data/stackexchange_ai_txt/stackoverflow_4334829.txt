Secure password storage

I'm developing a web service where users must login. I will store user data in an SQL database and input/output via PHP . But I don't want to store it openly. How do I encrypt the passwords in PHP so only those who knows the password can unlock it? I know services like phpBB uses some sort of hiding/encryption on stored passwords.
