Which test can I use to test a difference in increase?

Let's say that medication A significantly increased the patients' health on average, but so did medication B (for independent sets of patients). Obviously both medications increased the health of the patients on average, but is there a statistical test that could test whether the increase of one of the medications was significantly higher than the increase of the other medication? For example, if medication A increased health by 7.3 (imagine a health score) and medication B increased health by 8.8. Both significant, but can we test whether 8.8 is significantly higher increase than 7.3. My idea is create a column of increases for each medication and then run a t-test on these two columns. Is that feasible? Are there other techniques that have a more sound foundation? I have found a statistical concept (and I tagged it) called "difference in differences"; Is that relevant here?
