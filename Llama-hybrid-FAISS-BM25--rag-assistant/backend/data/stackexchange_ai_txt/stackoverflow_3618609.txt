You're reading too much in to it. A character is a small integral type that can hold a character. End of story. Unsigned char was never introduced or intended, it's just how it is, because char is an integral type identical to int or long or short, it's just the size that's different. The fact is that there's little reason to use unsigned char, but people do if they want one-byte unsigned integral storage.
