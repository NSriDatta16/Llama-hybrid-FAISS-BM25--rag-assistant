Turns out I needed to use "With" to do what I was trying to do. This ultimately is a two step process, but accomplishes what I wanted. var greenFromContainer = ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance ("Green"); var actual = ObjectFactory.With(greenFromContainer).GetInstance (); More complicated scenarios would seem to be best handled with separate containers/registries or leveraging the extended constructor rules.
