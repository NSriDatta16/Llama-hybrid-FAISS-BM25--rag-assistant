Perhaps the most ancient observed growth (decline) regularity is Seneca's Effect, "It would be some consolation for the feebleness of our selves and our works if all things should perish as slowly as they come into being; but as it is, increases are of sluggish growth, but the way to ruin is rapid." Lucius Anneaus Seneca, Letters to Lucilius, n. 91 which follows an inverted s-shape and linearizes if visualized as a log-log graph. See Ugo Bardi's book The Seneca Effect https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Seneca_Effect/F14yDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 Gibbon popularized Seneca's Effect with his famous The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire beginning in 1776. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_the_Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Roman_Empire The earliest known nonlinear (s-shaped) parametric power law was developed by Benjamin Gompertz in 1825. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function Efforts before Gompertz were either linear (de Moivre) or quadratic (nonparametric polynomials) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_growth The logistic growth curve is owed to Verhulst in 1838 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function It's of interest to note that Gompertz and logistic functions differ in the length or duration of the growth stage, Gompertz' being significantly slower. It's regrettable that statistical software developers have settled on the ubiquitous use of the logistic growth curve without exploring or offering alternatives such as Gompertz'. Later, Rubner (1883) and Kleiber (1932) derived metabolic scaling laws relating mass (by species) and metabolism. https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01540 Von Bertalanffny's growth model came much later in 1959. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756614/ These models tie together in papers such as Biological and statistical interpretation of size-at-age, mixed-effects models of growth https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192146 And books such as Statistical Methods for Trend Detection and Analysis in the Environmental Sciences or Age-Period-Cohort Analysis: New Models, Methods, and Empirical Applications https://www.google.com/books/edition/Statistical_Methods_for_Trend_Detection/zLh3OkKWJ7QC?hl=en&gbpv=0 https://www.google.com/books/edition/Age_Period_Cohort_Analysis/9udMBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0 A good overview of all of this is Banks, Growth and Diffusion Phenomena https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-03052-3 Of course, these citations are just the tip of the iceberg wrt growth curves. Many more have been proposed, typically as they apply to disciplines other than biology. Logistic substitution model and technological forecasting using the Fisher-Pry transform https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811001469 Note, however, that the F-P transform is deterministic, ie, it lacks an error term. Derek J. de Solla Price's book Little Science, Big Science he applies sigmoid growth curves to scientific citations and publications. Price's Law is a mathematical principle that states that a small number of individuals in any organization or group are responsible for a large portion of the total output or results. Building on Price's Law in the sociology of science, "Matthew effect" was a term coined by Robert K. Merton to describe how, among other things, eminent scientists will often get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar; it also means that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect The Matthew Effect comes from the Biblical Parable of the Talents wrt how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Merton generalized this effect to all social institutions and human relationships. Later, Albert-László Barabási appropriated Price's model without proper attribution or mention of Price, renaming it preferential attachment . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model
