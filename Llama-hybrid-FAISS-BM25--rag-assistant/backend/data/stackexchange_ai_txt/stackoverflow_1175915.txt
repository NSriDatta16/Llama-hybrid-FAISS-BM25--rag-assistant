Protecting an ASX file in PHP

I have a members only area on my site where users can login and view Windows Media streaming content. I have created a PHP script to serve the ASX file however I cannot validate this with session information. I think this is because the WMP is making the request and not a php page. Can anyone suggest an elegant way to protect ASX files?
