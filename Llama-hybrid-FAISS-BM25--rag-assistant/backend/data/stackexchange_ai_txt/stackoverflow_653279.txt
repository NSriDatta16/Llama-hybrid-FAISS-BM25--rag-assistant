Totally random/vauge ideas off the top of my head: -You could try to classify words into categories (noun, verb, etc.) and then form potentially correct forms for whole statements/sentences based on the classes of words. You could then try to fit new test data to a previously defined model based on the words and the order in which their used. -I'd also be curious about using some sort of machine learning algorithm to learn proper use of words based off of some sort of training data or literature. Once you've trained your algorithm some you could try to classify new incoming data based off of previous results.
