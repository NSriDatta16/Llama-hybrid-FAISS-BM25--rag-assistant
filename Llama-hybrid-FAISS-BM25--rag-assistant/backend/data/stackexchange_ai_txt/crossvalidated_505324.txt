arima concept clarification on differencing term d

I have a simple question regarding the d term in the arima(p,d,q). I understand when d = 1, we are essentially differencing the time series by X(t)-X(t-1). however I am confused when d=2 please help understand which of the following operation is done here: X(t)-X(t-2) or (X(t)-X(t-1))-(X(t-1)-X(t-2)) aka X(t)-2*X(t-1)+X(t-2)
