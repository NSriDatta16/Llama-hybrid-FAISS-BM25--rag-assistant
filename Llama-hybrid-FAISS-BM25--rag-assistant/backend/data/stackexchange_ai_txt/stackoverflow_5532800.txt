If you're after pure speed and efficient memory use I'd use... sb.Append(str1); sb.Append(" "); sb.Append(str2); For ease of reading, the example you give is clearer. sb.Apend(str1+" "+str2); The gain, however, will be negligable unless you're running this 1000s of times in a tight loop, so I'd go for the elegant, easy to read version (i.e. yours)
