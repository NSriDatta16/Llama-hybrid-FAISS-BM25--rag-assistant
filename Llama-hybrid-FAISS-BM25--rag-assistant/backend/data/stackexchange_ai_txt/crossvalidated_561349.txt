Linear regression cost function

I'm looking at plain linear regression was wondering about the specifics of the cost function. The cost function associated with simple linear regression is given by: $$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{1=1}^n(y_i - \theta^tx_i)^2$$ Where does the ( $\tfrac{1}{2n}$ ) term come from? Why not just $\tfrac{1}{n}$ so we achieve the average?
