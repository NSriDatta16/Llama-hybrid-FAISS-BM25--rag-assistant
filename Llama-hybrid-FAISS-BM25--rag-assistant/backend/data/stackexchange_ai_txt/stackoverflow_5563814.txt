This question is difficult to generalize, and I have not done the tedious full analysis needed to, so I'm answering my own question and hoping it helps others who search for the same error. The error I get, when exporting a plug-in, is "A cycle was detected when generating the classpath", but I don't see the cycle by examining the dependencies of each plug-in. The problem comes from the fact that there is a fragment involved. One of the plug-ins in the chain, let's say it's plugin.x, above, is a fragment host for another plug-in that is not listed in the dependency chain, and that that second plug-in has a dependency that introduces the cycle. Let's call the plug-in that is not listed in the dependency chain, "plugin.x1". In the MANIFEST.MF file for plugin.x1, I see the attribute "Fragment-Host: a.b.c.plugin-x". This attribute makes plugin-x dependent on plugin-x1. But another attribute in the MANIFEST.MF file for plugin.x1 reads: "Import-Package: a.b.c.plugin-w". So the dependency is: w depends on x; x is a fragment host for x1; and x1 depends on w. Thus the cycle. The clean solution is: redesign my code to avoid circular dependencies by avoiding the fragment host configuration. The quick and dirty solution, which works for me is: close the project plugin.x1 whenever I want to export my plugin.u.
