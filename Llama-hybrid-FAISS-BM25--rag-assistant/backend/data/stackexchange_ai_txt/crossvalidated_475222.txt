Interpretation of Model with Continuous Interaction Term

Imagine a variable $y$ across $i$ sections, i.e. $y_i$ . For every $y_i$ there exist a $x_{1,i}$ , a $x_{2,i}$ and a $x_{3,i}$ . However, the following relation exists: $x_{1,i} *x_{2,i} = x_{3,i}$ . For example, $x_1$ is some number (e.g. number of accidents in the year under observation), $x_2$ is the average volume associated with the number (e.g. average costs resulting from the accidents in the year under observation) and $x_3$ is the resulting total volume (e.g. total cost volume resulting from accidents in the year under observation). Now someone estimates the following: $y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2x_{2,i} + \beta_3x_{3,i}$ . I am aware of how to usually interpret interaction terms of two continuous variables. But in this case, the interaction term itself is a standalone variable. I am confused - can I just interpret $\beta_3$ as being a normal coefficient of some variable, i.e. $y$ changes by $\beta_3$ if $x_3$ changes by 1? Or is that not possible due to the relation between the variable and the two variables before? Since a change of $x_3$ by 1 would necessarily imply a change of the two variables before aswell.
