I don't know if it's possible, since I've never used it. But as far as I can tell the API doesn't support the documentation element. However, you could use the @XMLElement annotation to give your member a more descriptive name. //Example: Code fragment public class USPrice { @XmlElement(name="itemprice") public java.math.BigDecimal price; }
