Embedding YouTube video with new iframe embed code in TinyMCE

I tried the old embed code for adding YouTube videos into TinyMCE and it works fine. Some of the users may not realise they have to click on the old embed code option in YouTube embed code link to add it in. I want to make it easy for users and allow them to just copy the new embed code directly and paste it on TinyMCE and away they go. The new embed code looks like the following example: How do I get TinyMCE to accept the new version of the YouTube embed code with iframe? I'm working on a CakePHP site build.
