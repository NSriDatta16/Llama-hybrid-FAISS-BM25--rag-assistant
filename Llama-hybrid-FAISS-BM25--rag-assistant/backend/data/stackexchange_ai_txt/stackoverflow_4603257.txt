Encoding query string variables within Uri class

I have a Uri stored in a System.Uri class which contains a query string. If I use Uri.Query the result is ?workarea=Airconaire+Ltd What I need is to be able to extract the Uri variables so that I can Urlencode Airconaire+Ltd to get Airconaire%2bLtd ? I realise that I could use regular expressions to parse this out - but is there not a more elegant way? Using System.Uri possibly? Edit: I've checked out the HttpUtility.ParseQuery class but it seems to decode Url encoded characters. How can I preserve all characters ( theres meant to be a + in there ) How can I prevent this?
