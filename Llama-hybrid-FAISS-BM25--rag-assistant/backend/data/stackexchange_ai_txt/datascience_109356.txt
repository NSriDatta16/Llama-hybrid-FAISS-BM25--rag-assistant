Dicussion for X-vectors

I am posting this question to ask some questions regarding the X-vector embedding proposed by Synder et al. The paper is X-VECTORS: ROBUST DNN EMBEDDINGS FOR SPEAKER RECOGNITION With reference to the following table, the network was built using Time Delay Neural Network for the frame level. It is suggested that the input acoustic features (feature dimension is 24) are frame splices. So for frame1 layer , the input features are actually t-2, t-1, t, t+1, t+2 spliced (mentioned in his another paper "Deep Neural Network Embeddings for Text-Independent Speaker Verification"). This can be understood so it shows 5 in the total context and the input is 120x512 . 5 * 24 = 120 . Here is my quotation from the paper "The DNN configuration is outlined in Table 1. Suppose an input segment has T frames. The first five layers operate on speech frames, with a small temporal context centered at the current frame t. For example, the input to layer frame3 is the spliced output of frame2, at frames t - 3, t and t + 3. This builds on the temporal context of the earlier layers so that frame3 sees a total context of 15 frames." Here comes my questions, what is the 512 ? is it the hidden unit for the TDNN? What are the 9 and 15 context in frame 2 and frame 3 level ? It is confusing And how do we get the 1536 dimension
