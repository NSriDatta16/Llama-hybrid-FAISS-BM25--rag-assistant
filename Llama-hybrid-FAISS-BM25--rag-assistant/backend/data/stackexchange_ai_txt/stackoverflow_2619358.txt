Sorry, this was a case of RTFM. The attribute returned by GetCustomAttributeProps is not a typedef token, but a mdMethodDef or mdMemberRef token. For mdMethodDef tokens, you use IMetaDataImport.GetMethodProps to find the typeDef token and for mdMemberRefs, it is a slightly longer path, but you start with IMetaDataImport.GetMemberRefProps . The moral of the story is to pay attention to what sort of tokens these functions are returning!
