Dirichlet for panel data: correlated random effects?

I was wondering whether I can apply a Dirichlet regression model to panel data (using either dirifit in Stata or DirichReg in R)? I would do this by adding time averages of the time-invariant variables (Mundlak device) to obtain a Correlated Random Effects model. I have done this before for tobit and probit models, but I am not certain whether the same procedure applies to Dirichlet models. If not, are there any other compositional data models applicable to panel data? Thank you.
