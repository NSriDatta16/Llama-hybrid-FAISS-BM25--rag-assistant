Normalising/Standardising Data for Machine Learning

If we have a system in which we normalise and standardise the data, I'm interested into how to most effectively do this. For a test system we can apply normalisation and standardisation techniques to all data samples. E.g.: via a method that uses the maximum and minimum to normalise in-between 0 and 1. However, in practice we won't know the maximum and minimum for a feature because a new unseen sample may be obtained that has a greater value than the previous maximum value we used to normalise. Is there a solution to this problem that I see?
