Picking up Silverlight

I absolutely have no idea about Silverlight except that it is a Microsoft technology. Having nearly completed a Computer Science degree, having programmed in C# for a few years in a work environment - have a good knowledge of Java and OO techniques - how hard is the road of average Silverlight programming? I've been offered some work DAMN IT! I've mucked around with PHP, HTML and nearly no CSS.. Would I need a strong web programming background in order to pick it up?
