Maybe you could register for a local notification that informs the user they should open the app to stop location tracking? It's not very elegant of course, it seems Apple should allow the developer to register for location updates for a specified length of time, maybe you could submit a feature request for that. I think Loopt monitors for 24 hours and then quits, maybe you could research into how they made it stop after 24 hours. I wish I could help more but I haven't messed with the location framework at all.
