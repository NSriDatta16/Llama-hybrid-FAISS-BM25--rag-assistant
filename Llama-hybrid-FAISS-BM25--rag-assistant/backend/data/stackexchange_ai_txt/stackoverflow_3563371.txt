You can organize stuff in public folder any way you want. Only difference is that when you use some of the Rails helpers working with paths to files in public folder you have to specify where those files are (if you moved them out of their default location). For example, in case of stylesheet_link_tag you'd have to do something like: stylesheet_link_tag '/calendar/stylesheets/main.css'
