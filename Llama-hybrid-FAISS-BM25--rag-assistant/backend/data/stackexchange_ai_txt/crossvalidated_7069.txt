Is it possible to correct for violating the assumption of independence for nonparametric tests?

Is it possible to correct for violating the assumption of independence for nonparametric tests? I have a categorical independent variable and a categorical and binary dependent variable, and each subject was exposed to multiple levels of treatment. I have done some preliminary analysis with binary logistic regression and post-hoc chi-square tests, but I think these are inappropriate unless I can correct for my non-independent data. Info on this has been surprisingly difficult to find, and help is much appreciated.
