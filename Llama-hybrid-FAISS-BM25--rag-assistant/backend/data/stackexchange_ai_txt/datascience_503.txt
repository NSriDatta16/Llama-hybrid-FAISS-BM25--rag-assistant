Edit: Warning, i leave my message but my answer seems wrong, please check out the comment below! I'm not an expert but I guess the main problem is to answer this question: Has an/any event affected the number of hits on a certain day? But I don't know how to treat multiple events, so I would try to answer this question: Does event X affected the number of hits on a certain day? Which can be answered using hypothesis testing with p-values (what scientist do to evaluate for instance if a medicine affects a disease or not). By using p-values, you could determinate if the number of hits in a certain day were mere random and acceptable under normal circumstances or that they must correspond to a change in your model. You can read more about p-values in Open Intro to Statistics Book , I've actually learn about them from there. Then, the other parts of the problem are how to identify your events and calculate the necessary parameters to answer your question (average/median, variance, etc.) and also how to keep that up-to-date and working.
