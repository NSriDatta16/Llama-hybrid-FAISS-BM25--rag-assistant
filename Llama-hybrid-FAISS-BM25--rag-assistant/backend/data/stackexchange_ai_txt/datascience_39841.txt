I think more information on the project can help. For instance in your example, you just need to detect the flower frame in the whole image and crop it. Then you simply resize your images to be the same size before feeding your NN. In this case, detecting the target frame and scaling it is a part of pre-processing and the learning phase stays the same. Another approach is to learn this scaling. It means that the learning algorithm needs scale-invariant features but NNs are supposed to actually create features in their hidden layers through learning. So if you have sufficiently big dataset in which all variants are presented enough, your NN will learn it (most probably with poor results). The process is intuitive ML-wise: NN extract features from input images i.e. when the label of same object with different sizes are the same, it captures those features which discriminate these objects in a scale-invariant manner. This was simplified! The trick is that CNN can learn resizing using a technique called Pooling. But you are the one who plays with parameters to make your NN working! Probably the best is the situation in which your dataset is not that huge and rich or you do not want to play with many parameters or you want to increase the quality of results. Then focus on finding scale-invariant features. Either you extract them from your images and feed it to the NN, or you design NN in a way that it finds them itself . A more intuitive way is to train different models on different scales and ensemble them . Hope it helps :) Good Luck! PS: SIFT is patented. Be careful not to use it for commercial purposes.
