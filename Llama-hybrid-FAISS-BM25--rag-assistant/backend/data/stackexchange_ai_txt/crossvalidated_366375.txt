Why do you need to multiply the between groups sum of squares by the number of observations in each group? One often reads that the $F$ -test compares the variance of the group means to the average variance of the groups. But in the actual equation, each group mean's variance is multiplied by the number of observations in that group: $$ F(n_j-1, N-n_j)=\frac{\frac{1}{n_j -1}\sum_i n_i (\bar{Y}_{i\cdot} - \bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot})^2}{\frac{1}{N -n_j}\sum_i\sum_j(Y_{ij} - \bar{Y}_{i\cdot})^2} $$ with $N=$ number of total observations. As the $F$ -distribution actually arises from the ratio of $\chi^2$ distributions (again divided by their respective degrees of freedom), the above equation seems even more questionable. The qualitative answer is that, following the central limit theorem, $$ (\bar{Y}_{i\cdot} - \bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot})^2 \approx \frac{1}{n_i} (Y_{ij}-\bar{Y}_{\cdot\cdot})^2$$ for most $j$ . That means, if we want to compare the variance of groups means to the groups' variance, we first need to take into account that the group means variance can already be expected to be smaller by a factor of $n_i$ . For this reason we need to multiply the between groups sum of squares by the number of obversations $n_i$ in each group. We, so to say, normalize the $\chi^2$ variate in the denominator to then compare it to the variate in the nominator.
