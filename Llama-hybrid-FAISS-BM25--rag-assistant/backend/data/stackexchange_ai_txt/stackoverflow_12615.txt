I would say start with the ical standard. If you use it as your model, then you'll be able to do everything that google calendar, outlook, mac ical (the program), and get virtually instant integration with them. From there, time to bone up on your ajax and javascript cuz you can't have a flashy web ui with drag drop and multiple calendars without a ton of ajax and javascript.
