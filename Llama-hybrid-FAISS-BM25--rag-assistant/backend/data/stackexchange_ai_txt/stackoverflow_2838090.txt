No. You can store only one value in a localStorage entry. There are two ways to store more values behind one keyword: Use localStorage['justified_0'] , localStorage['justified_1'] etcetera. Store multiple values in an array and convert it to JSON before storing in localStorage['justified'] and convert it back to an array after reading. Clearing the cache does not clear local storage.
