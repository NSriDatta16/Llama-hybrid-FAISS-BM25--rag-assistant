Check out the jnlp syntax reference here: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html The important bit for you is the "Resources" tag: In the above example, SwingSet2.jar is added to the classpath. Need more jars on the classpath? Add another jar resource I had exactly the same trouble with codebase. I ended up using a JnlpServlet (You'll have to google it.. I can only post one hyperlink :( ) to automatically include the correct codebase when it serves up the jnlp file, then add to the resources section.
