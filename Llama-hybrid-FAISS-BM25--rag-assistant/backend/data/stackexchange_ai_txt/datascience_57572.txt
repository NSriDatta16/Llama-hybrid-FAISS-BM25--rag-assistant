Neighbors-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods, since they simply “remember” all of its training data (possibly transformed into a fast indexing structure such as a Ball Tree or KD Tree) . (emphasis mine. Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#nearest-neighbors ) You are using algorithm='ball_tree' , which roughly speaking uses Euclidean balls to cluster the points, making use of the ball distances for bounds on the distances between actual datapoints ( wiki ). So, I suspect the "a" value you're seeing is actually one of the balls' centers. For the Levenshtein distance, you probably should use the 'brute' algorithm.
