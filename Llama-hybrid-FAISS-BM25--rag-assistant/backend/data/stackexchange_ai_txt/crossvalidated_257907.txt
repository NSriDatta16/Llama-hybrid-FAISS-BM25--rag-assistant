Alternative Hypothesis for ADF Test

I'd like to conduct an augmented dickey fuller test to test my time series for unit root (against the alternative hypothesis of stationarity). Until now I did the following test: summary(ur.df(na.omit(ApplStock),type = c("drift"), selectlags = c("AIC"))) and get this result: ############################################### # Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Unit Root Test # ############################################### Test regression drift Call: lm(formula = z.diff ~ z.lag.1 + 1 + z.diff.lag) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.068892 -0.003080 -0.000101 0.003238 0.036876 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -2.409e-05 4.143e-04 -0.058 0.953659 z.lag.1 -8.140e-01 5.643e-02 -14.424 As far as I know, I can reject the null of unit root for all significance levels. But for which alternative hypothesis? Can someone help me with the interpretation? Any help is highly appreciated. Thank you very much.
