Logistic regression estimator always outputs the same class in scikit-learn

I am using a logistic regression estimator with scikit-learn. The estimator I had trained predicts the same class all the time. (This is a 2 class identification problem.) The data set is built of 2 classes which are a bit skewed (70% output 1 and 30 output 0). It has about 2000 samples and is built of 8 features for each sample. when I am fitting for logistic regression I get only 1's on the output so the confusion matrix looks like that: Confusion Matrix: [[ 0 53] [ 0 155]] I tried to play with the the regularization parameter (from 1e-6 to 1e8) and nothing changes. The data base do not look linearly separable. I would expect that the worst logistic regression estimator would at least yield P(y=1)=0.7 P(y=0)=0.3. Let me note that when using SVM with rbf kernel I get much better results. Below is the confusion matrix of the SVM: Confusion Matrix: [[ 48 5] [ 15 140]] Any idea why my logistic regression estimator is always predicting the same result?
