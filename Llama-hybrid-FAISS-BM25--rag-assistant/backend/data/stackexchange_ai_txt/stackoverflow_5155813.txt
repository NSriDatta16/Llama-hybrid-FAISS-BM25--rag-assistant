I dont know about exporting it.I only know how to import it. To importing category: 1. Create Advanced Profile and paste the code written by santosh kumar from this forum http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/26022/ and save it. I get blank admin page while running it,so need to modify dataflow.xml from adminhtml/default/default/layout/ prototype/prototype.js prototype/validation.js varien/js.js mage/translate.js mage/adminhtml/tools.js and flush magento cash, Now you can see profile executes. One more thing you need to create categories.csv in var/import folder and in which you have to write store,categories default,Sports default,Sports/Cricket default,Sports/Tenis .
