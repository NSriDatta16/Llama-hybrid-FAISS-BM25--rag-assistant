I'm working for a company which is doing Agile (not strictly XP, but still applicable), and our client base is exclusively government organizations. Once they saw the results of the agile process at work, even those who had requirements to provide documentation in a Waterfall like manner were more than happy to continue to reap the benefits of the agile process. And, yes, I agree with vfilby. Your customers should care about the results, not how you achieve them.
