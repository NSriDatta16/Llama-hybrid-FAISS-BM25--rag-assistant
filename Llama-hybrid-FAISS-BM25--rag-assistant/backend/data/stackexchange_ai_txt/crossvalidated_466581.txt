How can the nicest men in the conditioned subset be as nice as the average person in the whole population? That was not the situation sketched in the text. The handsomest men in your triangle.... on average, they are about as nice as the average person in the whole population, which, letâ€™s face it, is not that nice. So you mean: How can the most handsome men in the conditioned subset be as nice as the average person in the whole population? That altered version is answered by Adam L. Taylor (for a particular triangle it is true) But aside from that, the article actually tries to explain something different and did, I believe, not phrase it well. The paradox is that in the selected population you observe a correlation between handsomeness and niceness. (at least that is what I believe it was supposed to explain because the title reads "Berkson's fallacy: Why Are Handsome Men Such Jerks?") The most/more handsome men inside the triangle are on average less nice than the average of all men in the triangle. The Berkson's fallacy relates to the point that this correlation is due to the selection (the triangle, the selection based on a collider variable) and that the correlation is not true for the entire population (square), or not (necessarily) a causal relation (and it is fallacious to consider it like that). See in the example below where a linear model is fitted to the data. You can see on the right that the selection (triangle) makes the relationship negative. The more handsome the men are, the less nice they are. links to the original images that did not render The great square of men: https://slate.com/_components/image/instances/cq-article-87d2464659bfec0587c3608d700371ec-component-7@published https://compote.slate.com/images/e7b77786-4cd3-499e-ac97-6fdd73939ab3.jpg Triangle of acceptable: https://slate.com/_components/image/instances/cq-article-87d2464659bfec0587c3608d700371ec-component-10@published https://compote.slate.com/images/689ce72d-44f5-4e1d-9c36-6132e8d153b1.jpg
