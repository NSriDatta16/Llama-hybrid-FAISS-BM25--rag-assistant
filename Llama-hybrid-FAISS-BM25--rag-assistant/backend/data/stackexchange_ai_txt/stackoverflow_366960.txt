The best code has a certain elegance that you recognise as soon as you see it. It looks crafted, with care and attention to detail. It's obviously produced with someone with skill and has an art about it - you could say it looks sculpted and polished, rather than rough and ready. It's consistent and reads easily. It's split into small, highly cohesive functions each of which do one thing and do it well. It's minimally coupled, meaning that dependencies are few and strictly controlled, usually by... Functions and classes have dependencies on abstractions rather than implementations.
