Tip of the day can be good if it's non-modal, and never in the way has a "history" I can access is context sensitive to what I do Unfortunately, the crappy initial Office implementation Clippy of has completely killed the last idea. So IMO a good implementation would: Show up at startup Make "don't show at startup" the obvious choice Indicate (with an animation?) that TOTD is accessible from e.g. the toolbar MouseOver the toolbar icon would give the title/abstract of the "current tip" clicking on it would give me the tip, give forward/backward navigation through tips, link to "show all tips" in the manual. For a large tip database, a "related tips" link might encourage me to explore the manual Context-sensitive Later incarnations of Clippy were almost helpful actually: it was nonmodal and stayed out of the way not requiring interaction (the jumping around was attention-grabbing, though), and I remember a few instances where the suggestion was good - e.g. a keyboard shortcut for a command I had accessed repeatedly through the menu. A simpler method could still be effective: "Did you know... you can customize the print templates to look like a pie chart on LSD - the manual shows you how! [clickety]" on a print dialog Did you know... I can remember your custom searches. Just click 'Goof/Barf/Hidden/Create Index for last Query' - and they'll show up in the 'Search' menu. They'll run much faster, too! whe working with a search/query form
