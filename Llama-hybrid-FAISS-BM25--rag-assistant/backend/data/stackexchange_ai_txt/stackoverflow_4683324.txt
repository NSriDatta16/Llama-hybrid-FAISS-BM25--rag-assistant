I used to be in favor of generating HTML on the server so that the client can be dumb and simply inject dynamic content. The pragmatic real world advantages for our small team was that we needed to be experts at fewer different technologies. We focused on the middle tier and back end and spent less time on the front end. Lately, with tools like jQuery, it is easier and easier to do more robust client stuff without having to increase the dev bandwidth much. From a client side, I can say building dynamic HTML from JSON using jQuery isn't that hard. From the server side, I'm sure there are tools to serialize to JSON. I wouldn't roll your own with StringBuilder. Sorry, I'm not a Java guy so don't have a recommendation.
