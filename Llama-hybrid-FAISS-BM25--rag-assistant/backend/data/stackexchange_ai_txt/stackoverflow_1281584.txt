Intercepting combobox dropdown

Urgh, I have spent the last couple of hours on this now. I normally end up finding the answer from a bit of Googling, but not with this one. Bit of a headache. My questions: How can I catch when a user clicks the dropdown arrow on a combobox and prevent the dropdown list from being displayed. How can I then clear and populate the dropdown list and display it programmatically? I have one agent program remotely connected to a server over the internet. When you click the dropdown arrow on the agent, it queries the server to determine what needs to be in the dropdown list. It then displays the dropdown list. The comboboxes act as filters for the subsequent comboboxes on the GUI. A delay in displaying the dropdown list is perfectly acceptable while retrieving the data. Initially querying all the possibly entries in the dropdown list is not an option because there are so many! Needs to be comboboxes compared to listboxes as the user may also type an entry that is not in the list. Hopefully this will clarify what I am doing: GUI on the agent: ComboBox1 - displays the countries ComboBox2 - displays the cities - dropdown list determined by ComboBox1 selected item ComboBox3 - displays the towns - dropdown list determined by ComboBox2 selected item ComboBox4 - displays the streets - dropdown list determined by ComboBox3 selected item
