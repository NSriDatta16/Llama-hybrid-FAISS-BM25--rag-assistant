I solved this but by using a different method. Instead of using a broadcast receiver I set up a fileobserver on separate folders that the camera saved to. It's not as practical as the other way, but it still works fine. Here's how I set it up: FileObserver observer = new FileObserver(android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString() + "/DCIM/100MEDIA") { // set up a file observer to watch this directory on sd card @Override public void onEvent(int event, String file) { if(event == FileObserver.CREATE && !file.equals(".probe")){ // check if its a "create" and not equal to .probe because thats created every time camera is launched Log.d(TAG, "File created [" + android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString() + "/DCIM/100MEDIA/" + file + "]"); fileSaved = "New photo Saved: " + file; } } }; observer.startWatching(); // start the observer
