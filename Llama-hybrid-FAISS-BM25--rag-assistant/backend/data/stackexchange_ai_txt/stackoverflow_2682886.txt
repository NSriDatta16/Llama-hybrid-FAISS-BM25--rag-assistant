The webserver doesn't run as your user, so its environment isn't your user environment. You can set that up in a variety of ways depending on your webserver. In Apache, you can use the SetEnv directive: SetEnv PERL5LIB /path/to/your/libs That then applies to everything under it. If you have it in a .htaccess file, for instance, it applies to everything under that directory. If you can't do something like that, you're stuck setting the value of @INC in each script yourself with the lib pragma.
