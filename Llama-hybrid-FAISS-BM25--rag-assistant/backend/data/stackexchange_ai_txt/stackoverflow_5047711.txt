According to the license , you are able to modify it as you wish and distribute it freely, as long as the copyright notice is maintained. As far as a more elegant solution, extend the Zend Framework instead of modifying it. This will allow you to upgrade the framework much more easily. I would have My_Config extend Zend_Config and then change the things that needed to be changed. Same with the bootstrap, etc.
