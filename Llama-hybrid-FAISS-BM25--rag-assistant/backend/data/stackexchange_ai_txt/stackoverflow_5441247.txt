First of all, these things are hard to debug. I think the problem lays in serialization. Before an object is stored in the session, it will be serialized so it can be stored. In an other project I've had this problem and got the same error messag as you have. Magento has a couple of classes which can't be serialized. One of those classes is Mage_Core_Config_Element. Perhaps you make use of that class? I'm not sure but perhaps if you create a custom serialize() function you can find the problem.
