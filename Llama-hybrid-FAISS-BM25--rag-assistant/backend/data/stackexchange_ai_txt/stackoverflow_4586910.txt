Thanks for the advice guys. This is what I independently came up with. private static String Increment(String s) { String chars = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; char lastChar = s[s.Length - 1]; string fragment = s.Substring(0, s.Length - 1); if (chars.IndexOf(lastChar) I don't know if it is better/worse but seems to work. If anyone can suggest improvements then that is great.
