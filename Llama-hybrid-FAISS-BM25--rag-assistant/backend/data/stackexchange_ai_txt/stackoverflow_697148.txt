Though Code Complete is an excellent book (it is absolutely a must-have in my opinion), it is not the best of books to learn about patterns. If you want to learn about patterns, a good book would be the Design Patterns book by the Gang of Four. It is a reference to some of the commonly used design patterns. As for the patterns you mention: I see the MVC pattern more as an architectural pattern then a design pattern, since it effects the structure of the entire system (the architecture) rather than a more isolated piece of code. Singleton (not singletone) is an easy to grasp pattern, though it is overused and the downsides of it are often overlooked, so I wouldn't recommend to start with it (or at least, read it, learn the idea behind it, but don't just start applying it everywhere for the sake of using it - you usually don't really need it). It's hard to recommend a pattern to start with, but I think Factory Method, Command, and Strategy are not too hard to learn, but I'm sure others could disagree.
