You can have server-side code render static javascript yes, but you can't change the javascript when on the client due to a change in requirements; you have to render JS code that's dynamic enough to handle all the interactions you may need to do. By server-side code, that means any code as well as any external resources (ie. database). Though, I'm not sure storing static JS code in the DB is buying you anything more than you could already have by storing the JS in a file, and having JS components smart enough to have these different interactions within that file... So yes server-side storage can render out static JavaScript, but JS can't change from server-side code dynamically, unless your JS code call a web service on the server side. Make sense?
