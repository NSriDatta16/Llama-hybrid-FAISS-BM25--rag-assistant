SELECT SUM(beer_amount) as monthly_beer_amount FROM [DATABASE].[TABLE] WHERE beer_sold_date BETWEEN '20110201' AND '20110228' [EXTRA INFO] Also I believe that the best way to organize this table is to separate out this table into a few other tables. Store customer info in the first table such as [customer_id, customer_name, date_in, date_out, room_type, room_number]. 1, Bob, 20110101, 20110110, big, 200 2, Joe, 20110101, 20110110, small, 202 .... And have another table named something like room_items which would have the following, [id, item_name] 1, BEER 2, BED 3, SNACK ... And then another table named room_purchases which will have the following, [customer_id, purchase_id, amount, date....] 1, 1, 10, 20110101 2, 3, 5, 20110101 3, 1, 9, 20110101 .... This would help you to do a join on all three tables and they would be more normalized in this way. SELECT SUM(t2.amount) as beer_amount FROM customers as t1 LEFT JOIN room_purchases as t2 ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id WHERE t2.purchase_id = 1 AND t2.date BETWEEN 20110101 AND 20110131
