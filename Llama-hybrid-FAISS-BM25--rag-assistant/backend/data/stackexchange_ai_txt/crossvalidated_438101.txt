Why we do acf on residuals?

In the book "Time series analysis" by Shumway. He is doing fit = lm(chicken~time(chicken), na.action=NULL) acf(resid(fit), 48, main="detrended") What is the point of doing acf on residuals? I do see the point in acf for the data itself... But what's the use doing it for the residuals?
