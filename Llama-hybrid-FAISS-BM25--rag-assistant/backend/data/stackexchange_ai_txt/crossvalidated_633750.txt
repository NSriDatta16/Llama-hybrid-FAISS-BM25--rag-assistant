Interpretation of fixed effects in a mixed model

I have read many times that the interpretation of fixed effects estimates differs in a mixed model, compared to a model without random effects. For example this answer from Dimitris Rizopoulos: Interpretation of fixed effect coefficients from GLMs and GLMMs However, in GLMMs and because there you do have random effects, the inverse-link transformed regression coefficients have an interpretation for the for the mean of the outcome conditional on the random effects. Most often you are interested in the marginal mean of the outcome averaged over the random effects distribution, but the coefficients you obtained from the GLMMs do not have this interpretation. I have couple questions about this. I assume that this apply to generalised mixed models only, and not to linear models. Is that correct ? What exacting is meant by " conditional on the random effects", and why is this important ? An example of this would be teriffic.
