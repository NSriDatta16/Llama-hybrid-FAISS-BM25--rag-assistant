A choice between two books

Can anyone please advise which of the following books I should read: Statistics and Data Analysis by Rupert Analysis of financial time series by Tsay. I am interested in applying the theory and mathematics to stock and commodity data. Which one the above books is better given my purpose? My degree is in mathematics but I have knowledge of basic statistics, time series and R.
