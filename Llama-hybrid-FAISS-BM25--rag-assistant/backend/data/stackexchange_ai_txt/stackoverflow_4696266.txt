Amongst all the storage locations/methods of retrieval, CD-ROM/El-Torito is the oddball (and don't get me started on Mac CDROM filesystem hybrids) With Floppy, Harddisk/USB or PXE-TFTP, it suffices to write the object code to the first sector, or in case of tftp, just download-and-execute. It can't get any easier with these.
