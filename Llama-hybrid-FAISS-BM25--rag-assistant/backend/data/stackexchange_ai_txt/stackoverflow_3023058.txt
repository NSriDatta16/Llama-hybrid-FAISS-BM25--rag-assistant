Yes, your drag+drop will not be permitted if your program runs with elevated permissions. It is called User Interface Privilege Isolation, Vista UIPI for short. It is complementary to UAC and controlled by the uiAccess attribute in the manifest entry that you'd use to elevate your process. As well as a certificate and a proper install location. Realistically: don't elevate your program. It is a security hole when restricted programs can get their objects dropped in your privileged program. UIPI tries to prevent that. But debug your program first.
