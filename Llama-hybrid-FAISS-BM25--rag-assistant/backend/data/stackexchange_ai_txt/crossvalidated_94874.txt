Poisson process and uniform distribution

Question: A single-pump petrol station is running low on petrol. The total volume of petrol remaining for sale is $100$ litres. Suppose cars arrive to the station according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, and that each car fills independently of all other cars and of the arrival process, an amount of petrol that is distributed as a uniform random variable over $(0, 50)$ - assume for example that all car tanks have a capacity of $50$ litres and drivers decide "at random" when to refill. We assume that service is instantaneous so that there are no queues at the station. (a) On average, how many cars will the petrol station fully service (sell the full amount requested) before it runs out of petrol (and before any refilling occurs)? (b) How much time will it take on average before the station runs out of petrol (and before any refilling occurs)? Attempt at part (a) : I don't think I need to use the assumption that cars arrive according to a Poisson process in this part. So, define $U_k$ as the random variable that denotes the amount of petrol that car $k$ fills, $k = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$. Thus, $U_k, k = 1, 2, 3, \cdots$ are independently and identically distributed as a uniform random variable over $(0,50)$. Let $N$ be the random variable that denotes the number of cars that the petrol station can fully service. Now I don't quite get the question. Say we have the following scenario: Car 1 comes with 10L remaining in its tank, so it will fill up 40L, hence the amount of petrol left in the station is now 100-40 = 60L. Car 2 comes with 10L remaining in its tank, so it will fill up 40L, hence the amount of petrol left in the station is now 60-40 = 20L. Car 3 comes with 20L remaining in its tank, so it will fill up 30L, but the petrol station only has 20L left, so does this mean Car 3 just leaves the petrol station filling 0L? My gut feeling is that this cannot happen because each car can only fill an amount BETWEEN 0 and 50, ie, (0,50) [note that the end points are not included]. Hence in this scenario, the petrol station runs "out" of petrol at N=3 because it does not have enough to FULLY service Car 3, even though it still has 20L left in the pump. Thus, the petrol station can only service N=2 cars. Is this interpretation correct? If so, how do I find $E[N]$? EDIT: working on further... Define $G_N = \sum_{k=1}^N U_k$, then $E[N] = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n P(N=n) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n P(G_n \le 100)$ This equivalence comes from the fact that the event $\{N=n\}$ will only happen if $100 - G_n \ge 0$. However, two questions remain, what is the distribution of $G_n$? (How do I derive the distribution of the sum of $n$ iid uniform random variables and second, how do I compute the infinite sum?
