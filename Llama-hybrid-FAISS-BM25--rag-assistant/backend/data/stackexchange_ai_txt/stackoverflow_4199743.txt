What are the gigantic *.CFS files all about in Eclipse workspace plugin folder?

I started to notice my WD drive getting full and ran a size:gigantic file search on it. It has turned up several files here: F:\SCOTT-SHARED-DESKTOP\My Documents\JPA_SPRING_STRUTS\.metadata\.plugins\org.maven.ide.eclipse\nexus\d9d714e11cb097b3ffcec91cccc65d3e_58.cfs that exceed 189,992 KB (189 MB)! Anyone know about these rascals?
