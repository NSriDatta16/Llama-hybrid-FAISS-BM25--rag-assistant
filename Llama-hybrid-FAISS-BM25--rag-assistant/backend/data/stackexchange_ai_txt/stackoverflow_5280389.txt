There are various problems with your code. Let's see if we can break it down one piece at a time. using (StreamWriter w = File.AppendText("Users.txt")) This code would be useful if you wanted to open "Users.txt" and append text to it. Since you want to open a file and read from it, you need to use a different object, the StreamReader object: using (StreamReader r = File.Open("Users.txt")) Next, you want to check if the given Username is in the file. You're doing: if (w.Equals(user)) { Out.WriteLine("Username is taken"); } This isn't going to work. You are comparing a StreamWriter object with a String object. They will never be equal. What you need to do instead is change the order of your program like this: First, read the entire contents of the file into memory. Then, outside of the Using statement, process your user input and your username/password checking. Let's assume the file is organized like this: username,password username2,password2 johnsmith,mysecretcode janedoe,blahblah You could, for example, read each line into a Dictionary object, where the Key is the username and the Value is the password. Dictionary myDictionary = new Dictionary // Example of adding ONE username/password to the dictionary myDictionary.Add("username", "password"); Then, checking for the username would be as simple as bool containsUsername = myDictionary.ContainsKey(username); And checking the password would be: bool doesPasswordMatch = myDictionary[username] == givenPassword; Give it a shot! C# is a great language to learn.
