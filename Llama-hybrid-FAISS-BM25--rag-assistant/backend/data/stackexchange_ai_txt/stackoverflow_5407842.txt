I had to drag an actual TileList component from the Component Menu onto the Stage using the Flash CS4 GUI to make this error go away. The weird part is the component that I dragged onto the Stage isn't the component I use in the code. The component I created dynamically in the code now works though. I even deleted the TileList component that I added to the Stage and it still works. This sounds like a bug to me.
