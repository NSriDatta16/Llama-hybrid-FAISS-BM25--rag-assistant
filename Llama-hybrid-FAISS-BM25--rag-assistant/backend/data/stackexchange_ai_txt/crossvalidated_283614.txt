I calculate a 58.5 % chance that the car is green. See that attached image Note that this is the same result that you got, except you didn't normalize your .009876 and .0069958. I normalized every step, but you don't have to every step. You do need to normalize at the end though I like to think of Bayes theorem as a "Normalized Weighted Average", I have a blog post about that here http://www.fairlynerdy.com/an-intuitive-guide-to-bayes-theorem/ Edit to describe normalizing a bit here is the bayes theorem equation with some labels. You did the prior and the likelihood, but not the normalizing constant. That makes the total probability of all the outcomes sum to 1.0 at the end In this case the normalizing constant is the sum of all the probabilities given your results, which were 4 green witnesses, 1 yellow. That sum is (.009876 + .006995) so the probability the car is green is .009876 / (.009876 + .006995) = 58.5%
