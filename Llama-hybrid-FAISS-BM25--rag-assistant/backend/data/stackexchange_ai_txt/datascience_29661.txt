Because there is very little data HMM will probably overfit (depends on the number of states and letters). I would go with a simple markov chain as it has less parameters and you dont need to tune things like hidden states. If you are going with HMM I would recommend a package called Pomegranate. I would also recommend try and using Multinomial model, which can be viewed as 0-memory markov model, maybe your data doesnt have past dependencies.
