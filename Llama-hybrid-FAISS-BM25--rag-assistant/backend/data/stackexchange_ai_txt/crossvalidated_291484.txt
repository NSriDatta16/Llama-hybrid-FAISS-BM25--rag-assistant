The answer by Glen_b does a good job highlighting the possible dangers of combining the two data sets to test coin fairness (i.e. if performing the second experiment was contingent on the first one's results). Here I consider how to test under the alternative experimental conditions, assuming we use only the second data set. That is, given the data of $N=20$ flips with $K=12$ heads, generated either by fixing $N=20$ ahead of time flipping until the difference between heads/tails is $m=4$ (fixed ahead of time) how consistent is the data with a fair coin? In the fixed $N$ case, the number of heads $k$ is binomial distributed $$\Pr\big[k\big] = \mathrm{Binom}_{N,p}\big(\,k\,\big)$$ where $k=0,1,\ldots,N$. Under the null hypothesis of $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$, the expected number of heads is $\langle{k}\rangle=10$, and the exceedance probability of the data is $\Pr\big[|k-\langle{k}\rangle|\geq|K-\langle{k}\rangle|\big]=50\%$. In the fixed $m$ case, the number of flips $n$ is now a random variable, known as the hitting time . Under the null hypothesis the head/tails difference is an unbiased simple random walk, with hitting time distribution $$\Pr\big[n\big] = \tfrac{m}{n}\,\mathrm{Binom}_{n,p}\big(\,\tfrac{n+m}{2}\,\big)$$ where $n=m,m+2,\ldots,\infty$. For a biased coin the hitting time will be shorter (since the boundaries $\pm{m}$ are symmetric). So we can measure consistency as $\Pr\big[n\leq{N}\big]=38\%$ under the null. So for the same data, produced by different experimental setups, give slightly different p values . A few notes: The second setup does not follow a negative binomial distribution (this would require fixing $m$ heads, rather than excess heads). Probably the first and second data sets could be combined to compute a consistent Bayesian posterior for $p$. In the case of a fixed-$N$ second experiment, the number of heads and tails could then literally be combined . For the fixed-$m$ second experiment, things are more complicated (e.g. for $p\neq\frac{1}{2}$ the $+m$ vs. $-m$ cases would differ and must be averaged together to get the total likelihood).
