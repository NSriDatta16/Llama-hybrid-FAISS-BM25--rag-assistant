Combining ordinal scales where each level is numerical range

I am working with a dataset that has several variables querying time spent using media each day. Each variable queries a different type of media use, with the same answer options. An example question is, "how much time did you spend today talking on your phone?" The answer options are: a) b) 30 Min - 1 Hr c) 1 - 2 Hrs d) 2 - 3 Hrs e) 3+ Hrs There are 7 questions in total. I would like to create a composite of these 7 ordinal variables. My idea was to take the midpoint of each answer and create an average. For example, if someone answered A, D, E, B, C, A, then D, that would translate to 0.25 hours, 2.5 hours, 3 hours, 0.75 hours, 1.5 hours, 0.25 hours, and 2.5 hours, with the average being 1.54 hours spent on media use per day. Is this considered an "appropriate" way to combine the variables? If not, is there a more appropriate way?
