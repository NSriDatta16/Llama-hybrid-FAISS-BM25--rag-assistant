part 1: 1:19 (prior odds = 5%) x 10 (likelihood ratio for positive test results = for every 100 true positives there are 10 false positives, so true positive is 10x more likely) = 10:19 (posterior odds) = 34% chance that contaminating agent is present. part 2: test a: 1:9 (prior odds = 10%, baserate for presence of agent in poorly maintained plants) x 10 (likelihood ratio for positive test results) = 10:9 (posterior odds) = 53% chance that contaminating agent is present. test b: 10:9 (prior odds based on test a result & baserate for poorly maintained plants) x 1 (likelihood ratio for negative result-- just as likely to be false negative as true negative) = 10:9 = 53% chance that agent is present.
