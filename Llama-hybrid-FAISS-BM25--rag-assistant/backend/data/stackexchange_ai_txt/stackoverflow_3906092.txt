Why do I get this error : "Domain operations cannot be started at design time?"

I have created a silver light user control and I want to test it in a new View (MyTest.xaml). I can see my user control in the toolbox. But when I drag and drop it to the design area in I get this error: Cannot create an instance of ctlMyControl. Domain operations cannot be started at design time. Basically, it is a control with a drop down which calls a RIA service to populate its ItemsSource. Any idea why I may be getting this error? Thanks
