How do I get fluent in Python?

Once you have learned the basic commands in Python, you are often able to solve most programming problem you face. But the way in which this is done is not really Python-ic . What is common is to use the classical c++ or Java mentality to solve problems. But Python is more than that. It has functional programming incorporated; many libraries available; object oriented, and its own ways. In short there are often better, shorter, faster, more elegant ways to the same thing. It is a little bit like learning a new language. First you learn the words and the grammar, but then you need to get fluent. Once you have learned the language, how do you get fluent in Python? How have you done it? What books mostly helped?
