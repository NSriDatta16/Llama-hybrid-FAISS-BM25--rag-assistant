Meaning of the notation $ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mu_{\text{ref}}, y\sim \mu_D(x)}[\ln y] $ in GAN framework

A very naive question about notations used in mathematical framework for generative adversarial network (GAN). What is precise mathematical definition of terms like $$ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mu_{\text{ref}}, y\sim \mu_D(x)}[\ln y] $$ as appearing in wiki intro. In generally, if $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ is a random variable on probability space $(\Omega, P)$ with density function $f_X$ and $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ , then $ \mathbb{E}[g(X)]= \int g(X) dP_X= \int g(x) f_X(x)dx $ by definition. My question is what means purely mathematically this expected value looking like object $ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mu_{\text{ref}}, y\sim \mu_D(x)}[\ln y] $ with the bottom notation $x\sim \mu_{\text{ref}}, y\sim \mu_D(x)$ in the expression above? Is this bottom notation just an additional reminder that the expected value is formed as before $\mathbb{E}[\ln y]$ with respect to two random variables $x$ and $y$ , where the former has density function $ \mu_{\text{ref}}$ and the latter $\mu_D(x)$ ? Right, of does it mean something different? Note, that $\mu_D$ is valued in probability measures, therefore $ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \mu_{\text{ref}}, y\sim \mu_D(x)}[\ln y] $ should probably better considered as "parameterized family of distributions". But I do not understand how this object looks to be explicitly written out? Maybe the question is trivial, but in classical stochastics I'm a little bit familiar with I never came across such bottom notation for expected values, so seems to be nonstandard "GAN specific" terminology, therefore I would like to clarify it's precise mathematical meaning.
