Implementing user controls is a magic on it's own. Before you invest the time to develop a complete ListBox implementation, you might be better of buying one off the shelf from a third-party vendor (DevExpress, Telerik, Infragistics, ComponentOne to name a few). They all have demos available on their homepages so you can check if they suit your needs. If you want to implement this yourself, maybe try using a DataGridView instead of a listbox. Owner drawn cells give you the freedom to customize them in every possible way.
