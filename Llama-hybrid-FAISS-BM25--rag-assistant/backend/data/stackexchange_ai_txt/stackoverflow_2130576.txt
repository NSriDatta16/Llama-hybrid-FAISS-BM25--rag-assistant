Can you add "filters" to the Class View in Visual C++ 2008?

I am using VS 2008 Express. One of the projects I'm working on uses a physics engine. For their own reasons, the maintainers of the engine suggest compiling the source with your project for better stability and compatibility, instead of linking to the static libraries. This means that in the Class View, all the engine's classes and methods show up together with my own code. It makes it tougher to pick out my own classes from theirs. Can you group the classes with your own custom filters, much in the way you can organize the source files?
