I suspect that there has been a misunderstanding or a typo. In GLMMs the fixed effects estimate are conditional on the random effects. That is, the estimates apply to units in the same subject/cluster/group. They cannot be interpreted as an average over all subjects/clusters/groups. The latter would be marginal estimates, while the former are conditional . In R, the GLMMadaptive package can produce both, so this is one approach you can take. Another approach is to fit a generalised estimating equations (GEE) model, which will produce marginal estimates.
