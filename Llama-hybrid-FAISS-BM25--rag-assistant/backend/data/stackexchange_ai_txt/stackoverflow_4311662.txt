Is it possible to process the push notification data in Windows Phone 7

i have a question for my student project. I am currently using push notification an the Windows Phone 7 and wanted to ask if it is possible - like as it is in Android - to process the delivered data in background, creating a wakelock or something. Here the scenerio how it works in Android: 1. I send a notification to the device (more precise to the C2DM Server, but that doesn't matters now). 2. The App receives my notification while it is closed, shows a tile on the screens and saves the data in a database so i can work with them later. Is it possible to store the data received by a push notification in a database/isolated storage in Windows Phone 7 while the Application is not running?
