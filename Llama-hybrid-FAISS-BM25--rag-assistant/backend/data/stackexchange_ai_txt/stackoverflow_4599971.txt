Algorithm For Ranking Items

I have a list of 6500 items that I would like to trade or invest in. (Not for real money, but for a certain game.) Each item has 5 numbers that will be used to rank it among the others. Total quantity of item traded per day: The higher this number, the better. The Donchian Channel of the item over the last 5 days: The higher this number, the better. The median spread of the price: The lower this number, the better. The spread of the 20 day moving average for the item: The lower this number, the better. The spread of the 5 day moving average for the item: The higher this number, the better. All 5 numbers have the same 'weight', or in other words, they should all affect the final number in the with the same worth or value. At the moment, I just multiply all 5 numbers for each item, but it doesn't rank the items the way I would them to be ranked. I just want to combine all 5 numbers into a weighted number that I can use to rank all 6500 items, but I'm unsure of how to do this correctly or mathematically. Note: The total quantity of the item traded per day and the donchian channel are numbers that are much higher then the spreads, which are more of percentage type numbers. This is probably the reason why multiplying them all together didn't work for me; the quantity traded per day and the donchian channel had a much bigger role in the final number.
