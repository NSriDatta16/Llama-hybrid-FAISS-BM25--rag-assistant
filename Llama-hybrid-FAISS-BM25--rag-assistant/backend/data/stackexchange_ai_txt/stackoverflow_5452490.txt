Java Guassian Distribution-Bell Curve

I have calculated mean and SD of a set of values. Now I need to draw a bell curve using those value to show the normal distribution in JAVA Swing. How do i proceed with this situation. List : 204 297 348 528 681 684 785 957 1044 1140 1378 1545 1818 Total count : 13 Average value (Mean): 877.615384615385 Standard deviation (SD) : 477.272626245539 If i can get the x and y cordinates I can do it, but how do i get those values?
