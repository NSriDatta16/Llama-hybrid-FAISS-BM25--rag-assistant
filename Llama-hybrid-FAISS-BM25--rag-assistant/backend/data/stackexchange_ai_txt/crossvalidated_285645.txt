How do I setup machine learning when each data point is a matrix?

Let’s use a simple example. My training set contains 5000 schools. For each school, there is a matrix. Each row of the matrix is a student, each column of the matrix is the grade of a subject (math, chemistry, biology, and physics). Let’s assume each school has the same number of students (1000), so each matrix is 1000 by 4. I also know which of these 5000 schools are public, which of these 5000 schools are private. Are there any machine learning algorithm that can take matrix as input and build a predictive model (without feature engineering)?
