IMHO the only way to compute expectations for arbitrary functions is to use sampling (Monte Carlo methods). E.g. you gather samples from the joint posterior distribution and expectation turns into simply averaging the value of $T$ over the samples. If you want an analytic solution, you IMHO need a specific form of $T$ and use your calculus to find the integral.
