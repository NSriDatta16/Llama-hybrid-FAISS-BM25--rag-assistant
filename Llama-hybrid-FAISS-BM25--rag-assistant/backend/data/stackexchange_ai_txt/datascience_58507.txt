If your data is not labeled and you want to transform them in numerical features, you could try Bourgain Embedding. For this you need a distance between two conference titles. This could be a combination of Jaccard Distance ( bag of words) and Levenshtein distance ( but this would only make sence if you have word which are written in characters similar, for example Physics and astrophysics). Having such a representation in numerical features, allows one to do k-means clustering for example or after labeling, doing supervised learning. For more details you might have a look here: http://www.orges-leka.de/automatic_feature_engineering.html (Disclaimer: I have written the blog article.) I have done something similar with search queries at my website: https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/keywords-similarity-dataset The main point when using the Bourgain algorithm, is how you define the distance / similarity of two conference titles, which impacts the representation.
