Understanding the augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test (tested using ur.df() function in R)

I tested for trend in a time series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test in R. I am having trouble interpreting the output below: trend |t|) (Intercept) 5.857e-02 1.867e-03 31.376 I am wondering if anyone can help me decide the acceptance of the $H_0$ hypothesis (i.e., no trend) or rejection of the $H_1$ hypothesis (i.e., trend). Based on the following post: Interpreting R's ur.df (Dickey-Fuller unit root test) results , I understand that $H_0$ is rejected as the test-statistic (i.e., 450.8666) is outside the critical threshold values ( phi2 ). But the $p$ -value of tt is 0.112 (i.e., $p > 0.05$ ). The significance level indicates strong support for rejecting the alternative hypothesis. Questions (1) Does this contradict the results in my output? If not, can anyone help me understand it properly? (2) Could someone please clear up my confusion as to why the $t$ -value in the coefficients table for tt is -1.588 instead of 450.8666?
