This isn't a coding standard issue, but is surely a tale of restrictive thinking. We had completed a short 4 week project in no less than 7 weeks. The schedule was loosely based on guestimating a feature list. The development process consisted of coding furiously. During the postmortem I suggested using milestones and breaking feature requests into tasks. Incredibly, my director dismissed my ideas, saying that because it was such a short project, we didn't need to use milestones or tasks, and asked for other suggestions. The room fell silent. Language: Java, C++, HTML Team size: Two teams, totaling 10 engineers Which ill effects it caused you and your team: I felt like I was caught in a Dilbert cartoon.
