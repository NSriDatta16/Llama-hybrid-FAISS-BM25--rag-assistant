Why do we want low autocorrelation for MCMC convergence?

Usually, autocorrelation is one diagnostical tool for judging the convergence of a MCMC trail. Low autocorrelation is desired as this would mean that the parameter space is well explored. I have a real struggle with this. Assume that we have a lot of data and the highest density interval of the posterior is very narrow. Thus, most of the density would fall onto a small range of parameters. If we derive this from a MCMC chain, this would mean that the parameters of the steps of the chain would not differ much. From my understanding, this would also imply that the autocorrelation is high. What am I misunderstanding here?
