Feature selection for linear regression with MCMC

Let $f_n(x;\beta)$ be the $n$-dimensional linear regression model, i.e: $$f_n(x,\beta)= x^T\beta,\ x, \beta\in \mathbb{R}^n$$ I have data $(y_i,x_i)$ but I just want to use $k To make use of standard MCMC algortithms I need to transform the discrete parameter into a continuos one but I don't know how to do this efficiently. A very brute force approach is to have an iterable $\{c_0,c_1,...,c_{N-1}\}$ of $C(n,k)$ (sort by lexicographical order for example) and then use a variable $z \in [0,1]$ that represents the combionation $c_j$ if $z \in \left[\frac{j}{N},\frac{j+1}{N}\right)$ and then place a prior over $z$ to sample the distribution. The problem I see with this low dimensional representation is that I don't really know how to implement it efficiently. Any help on this kind of feature selection problem will be appreciated Thanks and sorry for the bad english!
