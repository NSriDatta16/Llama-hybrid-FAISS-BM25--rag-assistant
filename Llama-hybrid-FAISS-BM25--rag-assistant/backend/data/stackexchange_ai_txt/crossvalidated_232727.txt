How to "highlight" an input feature of an artificial neural network?

I'm trying to solve a binary classification problem by using an artificial neural network implemented in Torch. My neural network has 82 input features (=neurons). After implementing a plain version that gives to the all the 82 input neurons the same importance, I need to design a new version of my algorithm in which a user can highlight / give more importance to one single feature among all the 82. How could I do this in statistical tems? How could I edit my algorithm to give more importance to a single feature ?
