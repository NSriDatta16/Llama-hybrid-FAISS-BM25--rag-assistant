Flex-Ajax Bridge issue on Safari

My flex project uses FA-Bridge, and apparently in Safari browser I cannot call any of my public AS functions that have arguments passed in. For example I can call this AS function from javascript: var myButton = CreateNewButton(); myButton.setLabel('Click here'); But if I try calling it in a single statement like this: var myButton = CreateNewButton('Click here'); In the above call safari throws an error # 1063, (i.e. Argument count mismatch) in the safari javascript console, and points to line 561 in FaBridge.js. It thinks I didn't pass in the requied parameters. Now the above issue exists only on Safari. Both of the above approaches work on IE, Firefox and Chrome browsers. Note: I am NOT using swfObject for embedding my swf.
