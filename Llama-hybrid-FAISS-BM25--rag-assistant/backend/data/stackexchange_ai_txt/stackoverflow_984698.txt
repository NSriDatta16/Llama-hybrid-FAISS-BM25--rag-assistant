as far as the ordering goes from the source: add_element(E, [H|Es]) when E > H -> [H|add_element(E, Es)]; add_element(E, [H|_]=Set) when E [E|Set]; add_element(_E, [_H|_]=Set) -> Set; %E == H add_element(E, []) ->[E]. So the ordering looks like a straight comparison on the element. Other than the ordering the it's exactly the same as the set. So I'd hazard a guess that for elements of lower "value" look ups would be faster on average than the set. But other than that I'm not sure. Since Erlang is process agnostic and doesn't allow variable modification the effects across distributed nodes should be identical to local nodes. Caveat: I haven't run any benchmarking on the two types so this is speculation on my part regarding performance.
