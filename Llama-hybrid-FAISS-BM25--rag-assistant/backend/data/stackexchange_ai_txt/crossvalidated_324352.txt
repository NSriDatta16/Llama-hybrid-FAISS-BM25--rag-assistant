How to prepare and structure data for multivariate time series forecasting?

I have multiple variables (x) that I want to use to be able to forecast multiple (y) that occur at the same time (t). I've provided a very basic outline below. In doing so, my requirement is to determine an overall relationship (if any) of how (x's) influence (y). x1 x2 x3 x4 t0 y1 t0 y2 t0 y3 t0 y4 t1 y1 t1 y2 t1 y3 t1 y4 The data consists of time periods = ~100, y's per time period = ~300 and variables for each y ie x = 4. I'm struggling to see if there is a simpler way to deal with the regression problem (perhaps indexing y's for each time period?). Or is there a standard way of dealing with such a forecasting/regression problem that someone may be able to refer me to? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
