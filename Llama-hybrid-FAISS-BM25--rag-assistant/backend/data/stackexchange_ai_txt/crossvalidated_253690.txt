Modelling the shape of a distribution / proportions based on a predictor

I'm a moderate beginner in stats, so this may or may not be something you can sensibly answer. In my data I have two parameters for each timeline, the number of events in a normalized timeline and the location of these events on the timeline. I have noticed a trend by which when the number of events is low, they tend to cluster towards the beginning or end of the time-line. The location of these events on the timeline can be seen as a proportion of the events that take place in that data bin (say 10%). Eventually these proportions will add up to one for each timeline. I am now looking to build a model of this relation. A quick and coarse way would be to model the proportions at each of these 10 bins among the timeline. And the data seems to allow for such modelling even with a linear regression (after some log transformations). And thus I could have a model for each of the bins (10 models altogether) and predict the values on the basis of that. At the same time, this leaves aside the very strict dependency on the 10 predicted values, that they are just about the proportions and will always add up to 1. Another option that I tried was to look at the distance from the edges as a function of the number of events, and the model seemed to give good results, but it also is not ideal, as on low numbers the events seem to be clustered more towards the end rather then beginning, and it is generally leaving out a lot of information. The best case scenario, I would like to model the distribution of the events on the timeline as predicted by the number of events (and by looking at the data, the connection seems to be there. An impression of the data can be seen from figures below, I can also share a reproducible example if it helps. Thanks! I will also appreciate if you can point me to similar issues that have already been solved. Figures: The left image is an average for low number of events, the right one for high number of events.
