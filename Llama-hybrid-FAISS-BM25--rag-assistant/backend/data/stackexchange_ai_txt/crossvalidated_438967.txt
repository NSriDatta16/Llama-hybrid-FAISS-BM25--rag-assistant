As a general rule you don't want to do piece-fitting using previous results to feed the next stage without a simultaneous optimization. In this case after identifying the regime shift (visually obvious) , we treat the most recent set of values reflecting homogeneous structure. I took your very interesting ( to me ! ) time series which visually appeared to to represent two different regimes. Using the Chow test for constancy of parameters , AUTOBOX .. a commercial poece of software that I have helped to develop ... concluded that a regime shift in parameters occurred on or about period 55 with this based upon this model and After refining the model with some needed pulse indicators we obtained and The Actua l/Fit and Forecast graph is here with forecasts here Finally the statisti cs for the final model are here with residual plot here We have identified the anomalies in the remainder
