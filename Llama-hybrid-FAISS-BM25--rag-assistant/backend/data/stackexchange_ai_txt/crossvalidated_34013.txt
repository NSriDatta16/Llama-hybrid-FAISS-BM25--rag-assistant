You have to keep in mind that SOM (Self organizing map) is an unsupervised learning algorithm, most commonly used for clustering applications. In other words SOM isn't quite appropriate for solving pattern recognition problems (classification problems). You should probably try using an supervised learning algorithm like back propagation neural networks (feed-forward). Moreoever, in the general case, you should have more samples for each classification category (each letter in your case). In order for your model to be trained and be able to generalize with an "acceptable" error in an unknown sample (sample that hasn't been used in the training set) you should certainly use more samples in the training set. So, to cut a long story short: 1. If you want to use SOM, try solving a clustering problem. 2. If you want to solve the problem you are describing (pattern recognition), try to use a supervised learning algorithm 3. In either case the sample patterns must be more than one for each category.
