How many neurons a deep learning model (specifically a CNN) does have?

I found total number of neurons of ResNet-50 model is 26,560 and 94,059 in two different papers. Their titles are below: 1: DeepXplore: Automated Whitebox Testing of Deep Learning Systems 2: Testing Deep Neural Network based Image Classifiers I found another article ( link ) that clearly describes how many neurons a CNN does have. If I follow this technique then the neuron count does not match with the count mentioned in those papers. Could anybody please help me how I can calculate number of neurons in a DL model? Also which layers have neurons and which don't have.
