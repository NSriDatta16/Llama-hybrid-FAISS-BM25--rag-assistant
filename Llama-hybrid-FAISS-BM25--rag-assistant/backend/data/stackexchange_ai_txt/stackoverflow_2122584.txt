Random linq result

I have this LINQ query: var agnts = (from a in db.agents select new { a.UserId, a.name }).Take(10); How can I get randomly get 10 records from my agents table? I have tried: agnts = agnts.OrderBy(n => Guid.NewGuid()); but this doesn't seem to do anything. I would appreciate anybody's help on this. Thanks, Louis
