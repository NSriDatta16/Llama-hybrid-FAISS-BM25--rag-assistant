It seems to work on IE6, IE7, and IE8 ( live example ), with this code (only addition is the draggable call): jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function(j) { j('.dnd .person').draggable(); j('.bin').droppable({ accept: ".dnd .person", cursor: "not-allowed", hoverClass: "active", drop: function( event, ui ) { alert('test'); j(ui.draggable).remove(); } }); });​ And this markup: person1 person2 So the problem seems to exist outside of the code you've quoted. Perhaps the above will help. Creating a self-contained, minimalist example is frequently helpful — about 90-95% of the time, in the process of doing it you figure out what's wrong. The other 5-10%, you get a nice self-contained thing you can post to StackOverflow...
