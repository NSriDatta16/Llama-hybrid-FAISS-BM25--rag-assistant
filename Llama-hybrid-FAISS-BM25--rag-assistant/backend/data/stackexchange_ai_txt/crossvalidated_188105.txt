Decompose ridge regression bias error into model bias and estimation bias

How can I show that the in-sample bias error in Ridge regression can be decomposed into model bias plus estimation bias? I.e., if $Avg$ takes the average over all the input variables $x$ in the sample, and $E$ denotes the in-sample expectation value over the noise component in the underlying modeled function $f$, then: $$ Avg[(f(x)-E[x'\beta_{Ridge}])^2] = Avg[(f(x)-x'\beta_{OLS})^2] + Avg[(x'\beta_{OLS}-E[x'\beta_{Ridge}])^2] $$ $$ = Squared Model Bias + Squared Estimation Bias $$ This is stated in Elements of Statistical Learning , Hastie et al, p.224, result 7.14
