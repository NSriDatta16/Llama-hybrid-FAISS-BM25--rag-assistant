How are natural language generation algorithms given a target

I've started learning about NLP and NLG and I'm fascinated! I've been blown away by the things I've seen from NLP; but I have a few questions about NLG. All my questions boil down to this: Given a network or Markov chain how does one specify what you want the system to talk about? To explain this a little; if I ask my 5 year old nephew to tell me something he'll talk about his toys, or what's on TV etc. whatever he decides - but I can also ask him to talk to me about something specific eg. tell me about dinosaurs , then he'll give me a few sentences about his favourite dino. How does one specify they want their NLG system to talk about dinosaurs specifically once you've fed the system the whole of Wikipedia?
