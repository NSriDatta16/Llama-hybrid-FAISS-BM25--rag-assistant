I detected your question just now, so probably, it is not up-to-date anymore. There are a lot of tools for (visually) analyzing categorical time series. I could imagine that a rate evolution graph (easily implemented in R) could be helpful to you. I can send you papers and pieces of code if you are still interested in the topic. http://mathstat.hsu-hh.de/weiss.html
