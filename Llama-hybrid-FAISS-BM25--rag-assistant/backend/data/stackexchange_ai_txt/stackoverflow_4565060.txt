You need a table that sits between the CUSTOMER and AGENT tables, linking them together: AGENT_CUSTOMERS AGENT_ID (primary key, foreign key to AGENT.AGENT_ID ) CUSTOMER_ID (primary key, foreign key to CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID ) The data type you seek means storing denormalized data, which would make for a royal pain to try to retrieve specific customer values. Save yourself the headache by setting things up properly.
