How to cache a collection in Magento?

I have a collection that takes significant time to load. What I would like is to cache it (APC, Memcache). It is not possible to cache the entire object (as it cannot be unserialized and it is over 1 MB). I'm thinking that caching the collection data ($col->getData() ) is the way to go, but I found no way to rebuild the object based on this array. Any clues?
