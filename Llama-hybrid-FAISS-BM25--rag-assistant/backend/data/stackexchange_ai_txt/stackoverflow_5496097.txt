This may not be a solution but may help in finding one. There are 2 parts to my answer: 1) Try this to see if it makes any difference at all. NSException *e = [NSException exceptionWithName:@"Testing" reason:@"Testing exception handling" userInfo:nil]; if (touched) { @throw e; } The only difference I see between the 2 code fragments you have, except for the fact that you need to throw the exception inside the if statement, is that the NSException is declared inside the if . 2) Have you tried this to check if the exception can be caught at all when it is thrown inside the if ? @try { if (touched) { NSException *e = [NSException exceptionWithName:@"Testing" reason:@"Testing exception handling" userInfo:nil]; @throw e; } } @catch (id anException) { NSLog(@"Exception: %@", [anException description]); } Or try this to see if it works differently than the code above. if (touched) { @try { NSException *e = [NSException exceptionWithName:@"Testing" reason:@"Testing exception handling" userInfo:nil]; @throw e; } @catch (id anException) { NSLog(@"Exception: %@", [anException description]); } } Please let me know if you find anything interesting (like the 2 code fragments of part 2 working differently). It will help me as I learn about exceptions and how to catch them. Eventually, I have to create a crash reporter for the project I'm working on.
