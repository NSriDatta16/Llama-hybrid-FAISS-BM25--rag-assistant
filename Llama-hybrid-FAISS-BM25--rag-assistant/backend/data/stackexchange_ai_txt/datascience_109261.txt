How do you handle the free-text fields in tabular data in ML/DL?

While we see a number of cases where the input data is only a single text fields (for the X variable) in NLP tasks, e.g. a tweet with a sentiment label being the only numerical field. But how do you handle the free-text fields in tabular data in ML/DL? The text field(s) is/are among all the numeric fields in a table! I think this is tricky to handle. It can be comment fields or some log data in some fields along with many other numeric fields. List as many approaches as possible. Any idea? For easy discussion, the 'free-text' defined here refers to a bunch of text where each row of data in the dataset can has variable length in the text. And the goal of this question is to find ways to transform such text field(s) such that they can be included into ML/DL models.
