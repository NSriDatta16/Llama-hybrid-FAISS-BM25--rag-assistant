Since no answers have yet been provided (though I would accept the comment of user1952009 was it posted as an answer), let me share what I have learned in the meantime: (1) It seems to me that my understanding is generally right, but the devil is in the details. (2) One thing that missed in "my understanding": How good will the parametrized hypothesis generalize to data outside the training set? The non-polynomial nature of the neural network predictions may be better there than simple linear/polynomial regression (remember how polynomials increase/decrease very quickly outside the training set). (3) A link which further explains the importance of being able to compute parameters quickly: http://www.heatonresearch.com/2017/06/01/hidden-layers.html
