PCA with soil cover of plant species

8 plots (quadrants 3 x 3 meters), 4 invaded with an alien plant, 4 without the alien plant. I have measured the soil cover (as %) of the species found in these 8 plots. If I make a PCA with log (n+1) transformed values, the resulting PCA has low eigenvalues of the first two PC (corresponding to 34% and 28% of variance, respectively). Also loadings are mostly low (mostly There are also many variables corresponding to species that are poorly represented in the plots (they are present in one or few plots with very low soil cover). The then scatter plot results a mess with many very short vectors. I have read that this state of things could be due to multicollinearity and that it could be necessarity to exclude some of the variables. Could it be that invaded and non-invaded plots are similar and then the overall variance is low? So, how to deal with such data? NB: I am not using R
