One approach would be to take the information you do have for all 4400 individuals and treat the situation as a logistic regression: model the probability of completing the survey as a function of the available information. That analyzes all the data together, avoiding the problem of multiple tests and handling different predictors in different ways. As you have a large sample with over 2000 cases in your minority class (the 2003 that completed the survey), such a model could be quite complex without much risk of overfitting, including: interactions among the predictors, splines instead of simple linear functions for continuous predictors, etc., up to something like 100 predictors and combinations. If the model as a whole isn't significant then you can say that there was no difference in response rate based on the information you have. If some of the predictors or combinations are related to response rate, that gives a hint as to how to proceed with analysis and interpretation. That approach should satisfy the concerns embedded in your two specific questions in a simple, efficient way.
