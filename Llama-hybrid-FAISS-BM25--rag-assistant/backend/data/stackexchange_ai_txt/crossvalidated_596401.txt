Yes, this is possible . Logistic regression is well-calibrated, meaning that the sum of predicted probabilities equals the sum of the outcomes (assuming coded as 0/1, and assuming the model contains an intercept). This is explained at why in logistic regression the probability mass equal the count . In formulas $$ \sum_i y_i = \sum_i \hat{p}_i $$ which is based on orthogonality to the intercept. Likewise, by orthogonality to the group indicator we can show $$ \sum_{i \in \text{Group 1}} y_i = \sum_{i \in \text{Group 1}} \hat{p}_i $$ and likewise for group 2. So if you make individual prediction for each $i$ , and average those, you will get what you expect. But that is not what you did, you made one prediction for each group, using means of the covariables. Then there is no garantee, and (especially with skewed distributions, I guess) you can be surprised like you.
