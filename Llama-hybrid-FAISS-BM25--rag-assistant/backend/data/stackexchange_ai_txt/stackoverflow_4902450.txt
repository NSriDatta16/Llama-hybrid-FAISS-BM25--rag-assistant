Excel - Output results of a calculation from multiple inputs

I have a spreadsheet which I am using to design a Linear Fresnel Collector: Basically, it has cells which you can input the parameters of the design, e.g. number of mirrors, width of mirror. Then it gives me other parameters back e.g. length concentration, ratio, etc. The calculations (and the spreadsheet) are sufficiently complicated that it is impractical to change the cells, record the outputs, change the cells, etc. What I want to do is compare many different combinations of mirror width and number of mirrors. (say 2 input cells, 6 output cells). Is there a way to get excel to produce one large table with results iterating over both parameters without having to do it manually? The speadsheet it too complicated to just put each variable in a column and drag down. Link to a picture of the spreadsheet: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sjraw.png P.S. I don't know any VB, so a solution that doesn't require would be great
