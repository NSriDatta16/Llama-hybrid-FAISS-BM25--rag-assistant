While you should use a library function if you have one, as KennyTM suggested, a simple regex to solve this can be: .{1,100}\b This will take 100 characters or less, and will not break words. It would break other characters though, for example the period at the end of a sentence may be parted from the last word ( last word . new line ). If that's an issue, you can also try: .{1,99}(\s|.$) That assures the last character in every match is a white space. All of these assume you count spaces as characters, and probably don't have newlines in your text (a single paragraph), and don't have word of over 100 characters.
