In algorithmic modeling, as opposed to parametric modeling, there is no explicit equation relating input and output variables (see this paper by Breiman). The assumption is that the phenomenon being modeled is complex and unknown, and rather than imposing a formal model (which comes with a suite of assumptions and limitations), algos directly learn the links between predictors and predictand from the data. In the case of a single tree, this is not so much of an issue because the tree explains its predictions in a very visual and intuitive manner, but with ensemble of trees (Random Forests, Boosting), interpretability is definitely traded off for accuracy.
