In Bayesian Inference the prediction step is done via the posterior predictive distribution, which is calculated as $$f(y_{new} | y_{(\underline{n})} ) = \int_{ \Theta} f(y | \theta ) \cdot \pi(\theta ) d \theta $$ (where $\pi(\theta)$ is the posterior distribution) which accounts for the uncertainty of and unobserved observation.
