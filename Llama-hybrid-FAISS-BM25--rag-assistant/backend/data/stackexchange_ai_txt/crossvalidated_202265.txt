Precision adjustment in biomarker analyses

In a causal modeling framework, we are concerned with measuring an association between an exposure and an outcome. To do that, we usually fit a regression model for the outcome as the "y" on the exposure "x". We typically present such results with careful attention to the causal language, tending to interpret things using terms like association. This serves to reduce the number of assumptions necessary to ensure our interpretation is correct. For instance, when there is reverse causality (Y actually causes X), the associative language is still correct. In looking for biomarkers, the causality is almost necessarily reversed. We know Y is causing X, but we definitively look at regression models treating Y as the outcome. For instance, in case control studies, the modeled probabilities from a logistic regression model simply represent the chances of being included in the sample as a case. From a causal perspective, the rationale for fitting multivariate models boils down to a couple things: is a certain variable a confounder? Is a certain variable a precision variable. There is usually no rationale for including any variable not fitting those criteria based on a conceptual model, due to the risk they may be colliders or mediators (which would bias results if included). A precision variable simply predicts the outcome and is independent of the exposure. An example is controlling for age in looking for risk factors of obesity in children, since age strongly affects the changes in body weight. If you are looking for a biomarker, and have identified something as a precision variable in the sense that it affects an outcome, but you are fitting a model regression the outcome on the exposure, in a sense, would you opt to include such a variable in a model? For instance, with Alzhiemer's disease, hippocampal atrophy is a strong predictor of disease but is not routinely or cheaply measured. However, cognitive tests are frequently applied and are cheap. One's cognition is certainly affected by AD and hippocampal atrophy. So we regress atrophy as an outcome on cognition as an exposure. However, we have identified other (genetic) risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Does the causal model framework suggest adding the genetic markers (precision vars) to this analysis?
