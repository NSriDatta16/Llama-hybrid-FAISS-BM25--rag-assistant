How to monitor and act upon the change in a variable in a JRuby Program

I developing a JRuby program whereby I set the value of a variable (var_a) to a text value on a web page. I would like to take an action when the value of var_a changes. Is there built-in functionality in JRuby to capture a change a value change event on a variable or does anyone have an elegant way of accomplishing this functionality. Ultimately, I would like to utilize it in an observer pattern implementation. Here's a little more background: I'm actually using Celerity to screen scrape a page that updates the data every 60 seconds or so. During a screen scraping session I set the value of a as follows: a = browser.frame(:id, 'mainframe').div(:id, 'CurrentTime').text Now what I'd like to do is something like this: onchange(a) do puts a Unfortunately, I don't think the onchange function exists. So I'm trying to come up with a and elegant ruby-like way of achieving this functionality. Update: Ok three ideas have been put forth: Use Looping mechanism to compare new_value to original value. Writing the value out to a file and comparing the new value to the "file" value. Utilizing a setter approach - which I need to understand better. Any other Rubyist have any input on these or suggestions on other alternatives.
