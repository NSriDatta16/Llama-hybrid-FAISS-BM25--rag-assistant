Quick and dirty paper prototyping: PowerPoint (see: Powepoint Prototyping Toolkit ) -Great for easily putting together prototypes that can be presented. The slide nature can also serve as a substitute for mock interaction. Downside is lack of standardization. Not for disciplined projects. Disciplined paper prototyping: Visio -Standardized and full featured, but more cumbersome Interactive prototyping: Visual Studio -Very quick interaction building using drag-n-drop and events. Can be data driven. You can even build a prototype 'base' as a starter kit. Only downside is the temptation to actually make it THE production application. ;)
