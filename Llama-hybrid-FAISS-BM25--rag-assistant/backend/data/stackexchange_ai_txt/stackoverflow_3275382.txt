Development, repository and deployment organization

I'm looking for your advice. Initial situation: we (at the moment 5 developers, 1 quality guy/documentation, 1 projectmanagement/organization) plan to do a small startup we all earn our living with coding, but for better paid projects you'll have mostly no chance as one-man-show located somewhere mostly in europe we'll do clojure, php, perl, python and ruby development not only web apps we'll do c coding for machine control etc. all of use have different experience with editors, cvs and co. we don't want to reinvent the wheel What's the best way to organize: the team's workflow? time logging for invoices= app staging -> developmen&repository / testing / deployment (own hosted and customer hosted systems)? creating documentation (I would like to use vimwiki, but not all of us use vim. Actually we think about LaTeX and graphviz)? Bug and issue tracking? everyone should be granted the most degree of freedom in using tools he knows and likes, without shooting ourselfs in the foot Please let me know: where to find experience approved informations (Books, Tutorial, Best Practices, Urls, etc.)? what experiences (good&bad) did you made? exist professional courses which teach this topics? is Scrum worth a test (no one of us has experience with Scrum)? What do you think about timemangagement (e.g. Pomodoro etc.)? I've read several posts on stackoverflow.com and superuser.com but up to now I did not get the puzzle... I don't expect a out-of-the-box solution. I'm interested in your experiences and recommendations.
