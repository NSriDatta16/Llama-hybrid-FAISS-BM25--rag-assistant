I'll be using database inbuild procedure (e.g. XML path) to get data already converted in xml format. Now there are 2 ways to write in the file: 1. If you have to have Java interface (JDBC) to retrieve data (due to business req) then I'll simply read this data and write in a File (No XML Parser involvement unless you need to verify the output). 2. If you do not have Java restriction then I'll simply write a Stored Procedure which will dump XML data in a file. Update to comment: Workflow for fastest retrieval: Create Stored Procedure which will retrieve data and dump into a file. Call this SP through Java (as you said you need it) Either SP can return you the file name or you can create SP which will take file name so you can dynamically manage the output location. I have not used Oracle for a very long time but I hope this link can help you to kickstart.
