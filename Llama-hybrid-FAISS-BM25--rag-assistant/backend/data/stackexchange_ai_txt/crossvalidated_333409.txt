Your audience will probably not be very pleased with the phrase "to a low but satisfying degree". The p-value either tests the null hypothesis that there was no difference among groups (Friedman's test) or that W = 0. You didn't cite the code you are using, but I suspect that the tests for these two hypotheses are the same. In either case, you have good evidence to reject the null hypothesis. A Kendall's W of 0.6 is probably fairly large. It's probably really large, by my assessment , but I don't know of any established interpretation of Kendall's W. Any interpretation of an effect size is relative to the expectations of the analysis. I guess in this case you were expecting a really high degree of concordance among raters. You might want to rethink your expectations. Where I live, you can't get 90% of americans to agree that the earth orbits the sun. I think the way you are trying to explain the data ("15 out of 23" judges, and so on). is good. One recommendation I have is to present the data for each organization as a histogram-like bar plot of values. This ignores the effect of blocking by rater, but I think tells the story. It should look something like this . If you have your data in long format, in R: Data$Score.f = factor(Data$Score, ordered=TRUE) library(lattice) histogram(~ Score.f | Organization, data=Data, layout=c(1,4) # columns and rows of individual plots )
