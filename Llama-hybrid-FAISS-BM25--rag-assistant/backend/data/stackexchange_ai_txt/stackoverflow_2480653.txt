8-10 detail rows or 8-10 detail columns ? If its rows, then you're mixing apples and oranges as a one-to-many relationship cannot be flatten out into columns. If is columns, then you're talking vertical partitioning. For large and very large tables, moving seldom referenced columns into Extra or Details tables (ie partition the columns vertically into 'hot' and 'cold' tables) can have significant and event huge performance benefits. Narrower table means higher density of data per page, in turn means less pages needed for frequent queries, less IO, better cache efficiency, all goodness. Mileage may vary, depending on the average width of the 'details' columns and how 'seldom' the columns are accessed.
