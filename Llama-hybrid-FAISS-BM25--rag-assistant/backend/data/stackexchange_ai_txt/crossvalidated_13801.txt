How to combine unbound variables with very different frequency distributions?

I want to combine three unbound variables. Each variable is the score provided by three different algorithms. Each algorithm predicts the likelihood (score) that a specific interaction between two molecules takes place. I have a gold standard with which I can rate the performance of each algorithm (that is, how many predicted interactions actually take place in real life). My goal is to come up with a combined score for each interaction, using the scores from the individual algorithms. Ex: interaction1 is predicted by algorithm1: $756$ score, algorithm2: $0.7$, algorithm3: $6.5$ Each has different samples sizes and frequency distributions. Example: score1: from 1000 to 0, huge peak around 895 score2: from 1 to .5, looks like a standard distribution score3: from 10 to 0, huge peak around .1 ... My first idea was to normalize each score using $\frac{X-min(X)}{max(X)-min(X)}$, and then do a weighted average with each score: $combinedScore=weight1*score1 + weight2*score2 + weight3*score3$. I get the weights from another variable. Should I use z-scores, or the logistic function to normalize? Am I doing something wrong?
