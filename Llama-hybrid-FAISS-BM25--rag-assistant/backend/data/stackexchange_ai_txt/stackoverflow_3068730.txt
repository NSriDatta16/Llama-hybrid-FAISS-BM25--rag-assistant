How to index a date column with null values?

How should I index a date column when some rows has null values? We have to select rows between a date range and rows with null dates. We use Oracle 9.2 and higher. Options I found Using a bitmap index on the date column Using an index on date column and an index on a state field which value is 1 when the date is null Using an index on date column and an other granted not null column My thoughts to the options are: to 1: the table have to many different values to use an bitmap index to 2: I have to add an field only for this purpose and to change the query when I want to retrieve the null date rows to 3: locks tricky to add an field to an index which is not really needed What is the best practice for this case? Thanks in advance Some infos I have read: Oracle Date Index When does Oracle index null column values? Edit Our table has 300,000 records. 1,000 to 10,000 records are inserted and delete every day. 280,000 records have a null delivered_at date. It is a kind of picking buffer. Our structure (translated to english) is: create table orders ( orderid VARCHAR2(6) not null, customerid VARCHAR2(6) not null, compartment VARCHAR2(8), externalstorage NUMBER(1) default 0 not null, created_at DATE not null, last_update DATE not null, latest_delivery DATE not null, delivered_at DATE, delivery_group VARCHAR2(9), fast_order NUMBER(1) default 0 not null, order_type NUMBER(1) default 0 not null, produkt_group VARCHAR2(30) )
