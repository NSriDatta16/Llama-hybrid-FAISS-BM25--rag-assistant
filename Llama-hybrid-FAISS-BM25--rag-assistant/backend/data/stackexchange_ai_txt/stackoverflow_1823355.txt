Magento - Custom Payment Module

This is a very general question, but here goes: I'm trying to create a custom payment module in Magento. I've created a 'regular' module that hooks into the Magento event/observer model. But how do I tell Magento to treat a module as a payment module, so it shows up in the admin backend AND on the checkout page?
