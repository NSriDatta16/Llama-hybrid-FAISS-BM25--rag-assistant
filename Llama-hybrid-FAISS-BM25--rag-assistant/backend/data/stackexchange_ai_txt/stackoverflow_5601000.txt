From Wikipedia - Marshalling (computer science) : Marshalling (similar to serialization) is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission. It is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another. In the case of calling an unmanaged function from .NET, marshalling is used to convert .NET's data into data that the unmanaged function can consume. For instance, System.String is Unicode based, but that string might need to be converted to an ANSI string to be passed into a unmanaged C function. For threading, marshalling typically refers to transfer of ownership of some data from one thread to another thread. For example, a program has two threads. The first thread reads data from the network, and the second thread computes that data. After the network thread reads some data it transfers (i.e., "marshals") the data over to computation thread to process. It might do this by writing the data to a queue shared between the two threads. Marshalling in threading almost always involves synchronization of the data being marshalled.
