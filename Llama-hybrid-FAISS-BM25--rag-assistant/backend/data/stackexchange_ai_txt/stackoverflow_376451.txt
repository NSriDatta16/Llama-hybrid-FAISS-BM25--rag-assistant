Take a look at Hey!Watch . It's a video converting webservice. It supports a lot of formats and the converted videos can be stored on FTP, Amazon S3... it also supports watermarking and a lot of other options. And it's not expensive at all. I don't recommend doing your own conversion and storage. Video conversion takes a LOT of CPU and RAM, and storage takes a lot of disk space and bandwidth. The CPU and RAM problems can be solved with Hey!Watch, the storage problem with S3.
