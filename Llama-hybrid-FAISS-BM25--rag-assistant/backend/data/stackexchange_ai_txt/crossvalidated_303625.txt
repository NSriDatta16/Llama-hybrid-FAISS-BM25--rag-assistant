Your question is broad, as there are infinitely many reasons why the location of the optimum changes (time-varying parameters, random variables, restrictions, networks...) So it would be useful if you specify the problems. You could take a look at the subfields in Cybernetics but the term is too over-arching IMO. Depending on your need, there are two subfields that may be helpful and please feel free to add more: Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a hot field of research Operations Research, where people study practical problems like time-dependent pricing, routing, resource distribution, etc. The basic assumption, as the name suggests, is Markov. Signal Processing in Electrical Engineering contributes many theoretical results on the analysis of signals in a continuous fashion, and I find its math particularly welcome to people familiar with statistics.
