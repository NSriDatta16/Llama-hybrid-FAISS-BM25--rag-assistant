Django and SQL Server 2005 - Zombie status?

I'm using Django 1.2 and django-mssql . While performing the following for unicorn in Unicorn.objects.all(): print unicorn.color I'm getting the following error at around the 100th iteration: com_error: (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (0, u'Microsoft SQL Server Nativ e Client 10.0', u'The object is in a zombie state. An object may enter a zombie state when either ITransaction::Commit or ITransaction::Abort is called, or when a storage object was created and not yet released.', None, 0, -2147418113), Non e) Any idea? This is really bugging me... starting to hate the whole Windows Server world... :(
