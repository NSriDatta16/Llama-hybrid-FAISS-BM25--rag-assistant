Sounds like you are actually working in Silverlight 3 not 4. The AllowDrop is a property of the UIElement added in Silverlight 4. It is related to the drag drop of file lists between the host system and silverlight. It is not related to the DragDrop framework supplied by the toolkit which focuses on the dragging of elements within Silverlight. You should instead be handling the DragEnter event of the PanelDragDropTarget and assigning your prefered value to the Effects propery of the eventargs in that event.
