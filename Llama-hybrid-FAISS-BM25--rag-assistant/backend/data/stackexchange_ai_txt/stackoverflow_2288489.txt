From the MySQL-manual: MySQL stores its data dictionary information for tables in .frm files in database directories. This is true for all MySQL storage engines As a result there is no transactional DDL possible in MySQL, one of the most handy things in PostgreSQL. Using PostgreSQL as an engine in MySQL, would kill this option. PostgreSQL also has a much richer SQL dictionary, that might give problems in MySQL. Another major difference is the usage of schema's in PostgreSQL. What is called a database in MySQL, is sort of a schema in PostgreSQL. Imho it doesn't make sense to create a PostgreSQL-engine in MySQL if you want to use PostgreSQL. I'm afraid you would lose the best things of PostgreSQL because of the limitations of MySQL.
