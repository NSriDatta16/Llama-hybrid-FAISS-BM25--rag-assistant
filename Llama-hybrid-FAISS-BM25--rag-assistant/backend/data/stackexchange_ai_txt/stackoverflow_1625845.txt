Full code coverage

I'm trying to obtain full code coverage for the following line of code... stringWriter.Write(HtmlEncodedString.Format(string.Format("{0,-10:C}", x + y))) The line above this one is showing as fully covered and is just writing out a string but this one is only showing as partially covered. Anybody have any ideas how I can make this line fully covered?
