Suggestion: Construct an interaction between your time variable and your regressor of interest. Essentially you will then estimate one coefficient for each time period. I chose decades, but looking at your data I think you had something else in mind: fishdata Suggestion: Estimate a random coefficient model. The advantage from a statistical point of view is, that you have to estimate fewer parameters which will make a real difference in smaller samples. Also the interpretation will differ, however you will find a lot of literature on this topic (mixed models) - so I don't want to comment on that (see point 3): library(lme4) summary(lmer(totalfao ~ marinefao + (1 + marinefao|decade), fishdata)) Looking at your problem you are doing time series analysis. Applying simple regression techniques you will assume stationarity. However, your variables are not looking stationary (constant mean and variance over time) but have a clear trend: plot(fishdata$year, fishdata$inlandfao) You can either estimate the trend or take differenced data (or other approaches). Looking at the first differences of your dependent variable I think it is not necessary to estimate time varying coefficients: plot(fishdata$year[-1], diff(fishdata$inlandfao))
