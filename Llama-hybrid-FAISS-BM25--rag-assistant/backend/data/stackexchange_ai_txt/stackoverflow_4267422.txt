How to get the new order for enhanced grid columns after a Drag and Drop(DnD) operation

we were looking for a way to record the order of the columns in the enhanced grid after some column drag and drop operations within the same grid, since the layout of the grid does not change after a DnD operation, I am not able to find any way to obtain the sequence of columns. Is there any direct way for this? Or otherwise, do we have any events associated with DnD which one can use to keep track of sequence of columns in the grid.
