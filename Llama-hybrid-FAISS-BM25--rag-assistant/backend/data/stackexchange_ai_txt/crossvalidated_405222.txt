As already noted in earlier replies, the "empirical bootstrap" is called "basic bootstrap" in other sources (including the R function boot.ci ), which is identical to the "percentile bootstrap" flipped at the point estimate. Venables and Ripley write ("Modern Applied Statstics with S", 4th ed., Springer, 2002, p. 136): In asymmetric problems the basic and percentile intervals will differ considerably, and the basic intervals seem more rational. Out of curiosity, I have done extensive MonteCarlo simulations with two asymetrically distributed estimators, and found -to my own surprise- exactly the opposite, i.e. that the percentile interval outperformed the basic interval in terms of coverage probability. Here are my results with the coverage probability for each sample size $n$ estimated with one million different samples (taken from this Technical Report , p. 26f): Mean of an asymmetric distribution with density $f(x)=3x^2$ In this case the classic confidence intervals $\pm t_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{s^2/n}$ and $\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{s^2/n}$ are given for comparison. Maximum Likelihood Estimator for $\lambda$ in the exponential distribution In this case, two alternative confidence intervals are given for comparison: $\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}$ times the log-likelihood Hessian inverse, and $\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}$ times the Jackknife variance estimator. In both use cases, the BCa bootstrap has the highest coverage probablity among the bootstrap methods, and the percentile bootstrap has higher coverage probability than the basic/empirical bootstrap.
