The principle you are looking for is probably Separation of Concerns which you can leverage by using the Repository Pattern, a business logic layer (may incorporate several patterns) and keeping the UI doing nothing but presenting information (i.e. no business logic there). The MVC, MVP, MVVM patterns would all be good starting points there. Good reading? Any software design patterns book but there are the canonical two: the GoF Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software and Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture are a good start.
