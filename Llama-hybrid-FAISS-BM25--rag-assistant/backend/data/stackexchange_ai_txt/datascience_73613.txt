Can I use SVC() as a base_estimtor for ensemble methods?

I am currently testing out a few different ensemble methods on my dataset. I've heard that you can also use support vector machines as base learners in boosting and bagging methods but I am not sure which methods allow it or not. In particular, e.g. for XGB i tried out trees and SVMs as base learners and got the exact same result for 5 different performance metrics which made me question the results and/or that the option can only take trees as base learners. I didn't find much info in the documentation or at least not in all of the documentations. I would be interested about AdaBoostClassifier(), BaggingClassifier() and XGBClassifier(). Does anybody know the details and whether or not I can use SVMs here as base learners?
