Can we express CNNs in terms of a MLP?

I have been wondering whether a convolution can be represented in terms of an MLP. We can say that in convolution we have shared parameters between different neurons. But how to express this mathematically? More specifically, I want to know what kind of decision boundary does a convolution gives to us? Like A perceptron gives us a linear boundary, is there some way we can visualize convolution as giving a decision boundary?
