Do you really need Random Forests, NNs, etc.for your longitudinal data? lme4 is able to handle millions of individuals: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/Theory.pdf It can easily deal with linear mixed models, and as you can see from the link, it has also support for nonlinear mixed models (though I wouldn't expect it to be lightning quick also for the nonlinear models).
