Compare clusters quality (internal validity) after and before dimensionality reduction by PCA

I've asked this question a few days ago Evaluating HCPC clusters using cluster.stats from fpc library because I was trying to evaluate the quality of my clusters after I did dimensionality reduction using PCA. But the x parameter of the silhouette needs the clusters and also needs the distance of the original data matrix if I understand it right https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cluster/versions/2.1.0/topics/silhouette So when I calculate the silhouette for the clusters with PCA I get very low values, for example using just k-means without PCA I get 0.3 avg silhouette and after PCA I get 0.05 avg slhouette.. I think I'm doing something wrong here, it does not make sense to compare the quality of the clusters this way. I did not upload my data, but it is the same for any data, iris for example, does it make sense to run k-means on iris and them run PCA and get the clusters with HCPC and calculate silhoutte in both of them and compare them?
