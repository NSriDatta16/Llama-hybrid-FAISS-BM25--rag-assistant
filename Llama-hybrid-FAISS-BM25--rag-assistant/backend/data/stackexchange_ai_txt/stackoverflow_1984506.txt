These are some tips for merging and organizing CSS manually Separate code into sections like Link Styles,Common Classes ,Layout or Structure Styles ,Header ,Navigation ,Content ,Footer Indent descendants and related rules This allows you more easily recognize page structure within your CSS and how elements relate to each other. This method can also be applied for a specific tag such as a heading tag. Compress your Code to one line Instead of having each attribute on its own line, have them all on the same line. This reduces the file size of your CSS file and also makes it easy to scan when trying to find a specific tag. Alphabetize attributes This just seems to make my CSS easier to read when Iâ€™m scanning it or looking for something. Use shorthand wherever possible This makes your CSS easier to read and understand and is much more efficient. Reset your CSS There are a ton of methods for resetting your CSS Use separate CSS stylesheets for different elements Have a main style sheet that you import others into. You could have a stylesheet just for typography, another for layout, and another for colors. By keeping these elements organized within their own style sheets this can make it easier to manage your code. Declare colors used at the top of your CSS files Within CSS comments at the top of your file code the colors you are using in your file and the color they represent.
