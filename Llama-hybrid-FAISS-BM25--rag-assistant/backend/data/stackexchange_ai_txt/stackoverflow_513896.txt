IE: Conditional commenting linking to file

all. I'm using conditional commenting in IE to fix some CSS problem that i'm having with IE7. I have a all.css file that work on firefox and ie7 with some execptions that will only fix the IE7 css problem. I put my fix on all_iefixes.css both files is in App_Themes/Default/ folder. I use have a master page (Default.master) that all my pages inherited. On some page that is inside another folder, for example, localhost/myapp/blah1/blah.aspx will not get the all_iefixes.css in the App_Themes/Default folder If i change the @import "all_iefixes.css"; to @import "./../App_Themes/Default/all_iefixes.css"; then it will work for the page inside the blah1 folder but it will break other page that doesn't live inside blah1 folder. I think i can create several master page and depend on where i want to put my aspx pages to live then i can adjust the link but i think this is a rather "stupid" fix (?). Is there an elegant way to do this. Jack
