There's no way to avoid setting up a full probability model. With only 15 observations your credible interval will likely to depend on the structure of your likelihood and prior. Nonparametric Bayesian approaches may be useful, but it's hard to imagine that you're going to do much better than just eyeballing your data and trying to transform it to a reasonable parametric family. A Dirichlet Process Mixture model of some bounded distribution may be a good starting point. Alternatively, the model you describe would essentially be a Bayesian Boostrap . However the point of that paper is that using the empirical distribution is not a reasonable model for some inferences.
