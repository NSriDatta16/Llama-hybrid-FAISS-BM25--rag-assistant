How to design linear regression when BOTH independent and dependent variable are Poisson?

I have found a lot of discussions about GLM that are suitable for Poisson regression , or even Poisson PCA However, I believe most of these cases don't take into account the case that the independent variables are also Poisson. I am wondering if there is a name for such problems so that I can google. Can someone provide a quick introduction here? Thanks a lot!
