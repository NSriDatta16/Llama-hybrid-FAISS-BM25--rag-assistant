Is Bayesian approach the correct way to solve this problem?

I have a dataset that has 4 variables and the target is a value between 1 to 5. this data is generated from an api that is black box and I don't know the formula that generates these values. I have been asked to find the values for x1,x2,x3, and x4 in a such way that my target is around 1.8. now I see this as an optimization problem. I am a newbie in Bayesian world but something tells me I can solve it with Bayesian approach. I am really trying to understand Bayesian role in solving this problem. Am I wrong here? Should I build the model to estimate the formula and then optimize it?
