The original poster asked for an "explain like I'm 5" answer. Let's say your school teacher invites you and your schoolmates to help guess the teacher's table width. Each of the 20 students in class can choose a device (ruler, scale, tape, or yardstick) and is allowed to measure the table 10 times. You all are asked to use different starting locations on the device to avoid reading the same number over and over again; the starting reading then has to be subtracted from the ending reading to finally get one width measurement (you recently learned how to do that type of math). There were in total 200 width measurements taken by the class (20 students, 10 measurements each). The observations are handed over to the teacher who will crunch the numbers. Subtracting each student's observations from a reference value will result in another 200 numbers, called deviations . The teacher averages each student's sample separately, obtaining 20 means . Subtracting each student's observations from their individual mean will result in 200 deviations from the mean, called residuals . If the mean residual were to be calculated for each sample, you'd notice it's always zero. If instead we square each residual, average them, and finally undo the square, we obtain the standard deviation . (By the way, we call that last calculation bit the square root (think of finding the base or side of a given square), so the whole operation is often called root-mean-square , for short; the standard deviation of observations equals the root-mean-square of residuals.) But the teacher already knew the true table width, based on how it was designed and built and checked in the factory. So another 200 numbers, called errors , can be calculated as the deviation of observations with respect to the true width. A mean error can be calculated for each student sample. Likewise, 20 standard deviation of the error , or standard error , can be calculated for the observations. More 20 root-mean-square error values can be calculated as well. The three sets of 20 values are related as sqrt(me^2 + se^2) = rmse, in order of appearance. Based on rmse, the teacher can judge whose student provided the best estimate for the table width. Furthermore, by looking separatelly at the 20 mean errors and 20 standard error values, the teacher can instruct each student how to improve their readings. As a check, the teacher subtracted each error from their respective mean error, resulting in yet another 200 numbers, which we'll call residual errors (that's not often done). As above, mean residual error is zero, so the standard deviation of residual errors or standard residual error is the same as the standard error , and in fact, so is the root-mean-square residual error , too. (See below for details.) Now here is something of interest to the teacher. We can compare each student mean with the rest of the class (20 means total). Just like we defined before these point values: m: mean (of the observations), s: standard deviation (of the observations) me: mean error (of the observations) se: standard error (of the observations) rmse: root-mean-square error (of the observations) we can also define now: mm: mean of the means sm: standard deviation of the mean mem: mean error of the mean sem: standard error of the mean rmsem: root-mean-square error of the mean Only if the class of students is said to be unbiased, i.e., if mem = 0, then sem = sm = rmsem; i.e., standard error of the mean, standard deviation of the mean, and root-mean-square error the mean may be the same provided the mean error of the means is zero. If we had taken only one sample, i.e., if there were only one student in class, the standard deviation of the observations (s) could be used to estimate the standard deviation of the mean (sm), as sm^2~s^2/n, where n=10 is the sample size (the number of readings per student). The two will agree better as the sample size grows (n=10,11,...; more readings per student) and the number of samples grows (n'=20,21,...; more students in class). (A caveat: an unqualified "standard error" more often refers to the standard error of the mean, not the standard error of the observations.) Here are some details of the calculations involved. The true value is denoted t. Set-to-point operations: mean: MEAN(X) root-mean-square: RMS(X) standard deviation: SD(X) = RMS(X-MEAN(X)) INTRA-SAMPLE SETS: observations (given), X = {x_i}, i = 1, 2, ..., n=10. deviations: difference of a set with respect to a fixed point. residuals: deviation of observations from their mean, R=X-m. errors: deviation of observations from the true value, E=X-t. residual errors: deviation of errors from their mean, RE=E-MEAN(E) INTRA-SAMPLE POINTS (see table 1): m: mean (of the observations), s: standard deviation (of the observations) me: mean error (of the observations) se: standard error of the observations rmse: root-mean-square error (of the observations) INTER-SAMPLE (ENSEMBLE) SETS: means, M = {m_j}, j = 1, 2, ..., n'=20. residuals of the mean: deviation of the means from their mean, RM=M-mm. errors of the mean: deviation of the means from the "truth", EM=M-t. residual errors of the mean: deviation of errors of the mean from their mean, REM=EM-MEAN(EM) INTER-SAMPLE (ENSEMBLE) POINTS (see table 2): mm: mean of the means sm: standard deviation of the mean mem: mean error of the mean sem: standard error (of the mean) rmsem: root-mean-square error of the mean
