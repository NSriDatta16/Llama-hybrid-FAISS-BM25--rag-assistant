Feature selection and feature reduction are two very different strategies. Generally speaking, non-parametric tests is probably your best option, I'd go towards a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test to get overall differential features or a Mann-Whitney rank sum test for each class label. For feature reduction, I believe zero-inflated factorial analysis (ZIFA) is a good solution (Pierson, Emma, and Christopher Yau. "ZIFA: Dimensionality reduction for zero-inflated single-cell gene expression analysis." Genome biology 16.1 (2015): 241.). However, more classical factor analysis, NMF or t-SNE may work. Now the data you describe really looks a lot like a single-cell RNAseq dataset. If this is the case, I encourage you to take a look at the following resource: https://hemberg-lab.github.io/scRNA.seq.course/biological-analysis.html#de-in-a-real-dataset
