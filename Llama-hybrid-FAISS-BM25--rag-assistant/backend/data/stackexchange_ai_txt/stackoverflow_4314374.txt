Sqlite3 Amalgamation on iPhone misbehaving GANTRacker

I added Sqlite3 3.7.3 amalgamation to my iPhone project which has already been using CoreData and the embedded Sqlite3 libraries for iOS. However, I needed to add FTS3 support for another sqlite db file in the project that I will be accessing directly (without CoreData's Help) In order to do this I had to add the sqlite3 amalgamation which seems to work fine in the simulator but when I run it on a device at startup I get a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error. The breakpoint seems to stop in sqlite3.c in the setPageSize function which is being caused by GANTracker Is there a known configuration change I need to make to the amalgamation to get it to support GANTracker?
