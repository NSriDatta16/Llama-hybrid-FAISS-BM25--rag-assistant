First of all I strongly encourage you to use has_many :through instead of habtm (more about this here ), so you'll end up with something like: Employment belongs_to :users Employment belongs_to :companies User has_many :employments User has_many :companies, :through => :employments Company has_many :employments Company has_many :users, :through => :employments After this you'll have has_many association on both sides and can assign to them in factory_girl in the way you did it.
