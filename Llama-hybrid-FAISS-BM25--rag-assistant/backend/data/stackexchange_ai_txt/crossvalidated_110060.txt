joint p.d.f. of stationary time series variables

if a stationary time series verifies that each variable depends only on the variable before it, and the joint p.d.f. of $x_i$ and $x_{i-1}$ is $f(x_{i-1},x_i)$ , which is the joint p.d.f. of $x_i,x_{i+1},x_{i+2}$ , and of $x_i,x_{i+1},x_{i+2},x_{i+3}$ ?
