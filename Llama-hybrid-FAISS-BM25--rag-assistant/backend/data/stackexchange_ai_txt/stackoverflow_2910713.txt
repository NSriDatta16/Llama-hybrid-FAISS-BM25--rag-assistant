ASP.NET allows you to save values using session state, a storage mechanism that is accessible from all pages requested by a single Web browser session. Therefore, you can use session state to store user-specific information. Session state is similar to application state, except that it is scoped to the current browser session. If different users are using your application, each user session has a different session state. In addition, if a user leaves your application and then returns later after the session timeout period, session state information is lost and a new session is created for the user. Session state is stored in the Session key/value dictionary. //Storing UserName in Session Session["UserName"] = txtUser.Text; //Check weather session variable null or not if (Session["UserName"] != null) { //Retrieving UserName from Session lblWelcome.Text = "Welcome : " + Session["UserName"]; } else { //Do Something else } For more information Exploring Session in ASP.Net
