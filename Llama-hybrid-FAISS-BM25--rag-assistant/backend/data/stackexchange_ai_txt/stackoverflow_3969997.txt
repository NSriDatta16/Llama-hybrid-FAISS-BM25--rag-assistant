Should I return null or throw an exception?

I found questions here Should a retrieval method return 'null' or throw an exception when it can't produce the return value? and Should functions return null or an empty object? , but I think my case is quite different. I'm writing an application that consists of a webservice and a client. The webservice is responsible to access data, and return data to the client. I design my app like this: //webservice try { DataTable data = GetSomeData(parameter); return data } catch (OopsException ex) { //write some log here return null; } //client: DataTable data = CallGetSomeData(parameter); if(data == null) { MessageBox.Show("Oops Exception!"); return; } Well, there is a rule of not returning null. I don't think that I should just rethrow an exception and let the client catch SoapException. What's your comment? Is there better approach to solve this problem? Thank you.
