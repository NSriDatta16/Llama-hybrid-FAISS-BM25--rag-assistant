Can I run a regression when both independent and dependent variables are all dichotomous?

I have conducted a survey where all my questions are asked in a dichotomous manner (Yes/No). Eg IV:"Are you a smoker?", "Are you obese", "Is your gender male/Female" etc. DV: "Have you ever had a stroke?" Therefore both my dependent variable and independent variables are all dichotomous(Binary= measured in 0s and 1s). My question is, is it appropriate to run a regression to determine the independent variables that drives the dependent variable given the fact that every single one of my variables (both dependent and independent) are dichotomous in nature? If so, what kind of regression is the most appropriate? (Logistic regression?) and is there anything I should do to make the regression model more accurate? I have rudimentary understanding of statistics and regression modelling and would be so grateful if someone would point me in the right direction.
