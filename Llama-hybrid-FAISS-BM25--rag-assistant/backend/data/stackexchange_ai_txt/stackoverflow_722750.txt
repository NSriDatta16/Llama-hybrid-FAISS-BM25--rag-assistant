I believe you can only feel the difference after you've been in a big project and seen how much mess WebForms approach could cause. When you've seen a page contains multiple components, user controls, some of them living independent lives like hiding/showing or enabling/disabling themselves, all these rules passing through multiple control layers which cannot be traced until you've been in a project for many long years (or at least have smoked something reeealy good before diving in with the debugger :) ), you begin to appreciate the possibility for a clearly defined flow of control when you see how your data defines what components with what properties are rendered on a page. I've also loved WebForms for a long time. I also disliked first few weeks/months MVC for exactly same reasons you put forth. After I've done some coding and could compare the experience, I began to enjoy MVC. Still, there are some areas where MVC approach would be much more complicated and create more mess than WebForms would. It'll come with time. Not really a long time. :)
