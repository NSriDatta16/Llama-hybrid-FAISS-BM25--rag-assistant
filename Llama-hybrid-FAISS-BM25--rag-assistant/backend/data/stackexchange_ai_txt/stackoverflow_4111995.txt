DragDrop event not raised

This is kind of a stupid question... I'm trying to drag and drop a picturebox onto a panel. I followed some exemples, but it doesn't work. The DragDrop event of the panel is never raised. I searched thi site for a solution andfound two topics over a year old, but their solutions did not work. I created a new project, with only this code : public partial class Form1 : Form { public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); pictureBox1.MouseDown += new MouseEventHandler(pictureBox1_MouseDown); panel1.DragDrop +=new DragEventHandler(panel1_DragDrop); panel1.DragOver +=new DragEventHandler(panel1_DragOver); } private void panel1_DragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine("DragOver"); } private void panel1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine("DragDrop"); } private void pictureBox1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine("Mouse"); pictureBox1.DoDragDrop(pictureBox1.Text, DragDropEffects.All); } } I also set the AllowDrop of the panel and the form to true. DragOver and MouseDown are raised. Also, when I drag the picturebox, the cursor become a barred circled, like it was an operation that wasn't allowed. Is there a way that the cursor becomes the image in the picture box? I don't want the picturebox to move, only to add an item to the panel.
