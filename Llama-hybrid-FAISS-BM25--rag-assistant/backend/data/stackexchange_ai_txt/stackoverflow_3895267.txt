In 2003 web developers in general didn't have great knowledge of consistent cross-browser, standards-compliant CSS and Javascript. Considering it was IE-specific, it most definitely used IE-specific and non-standard things such as: IE specific DOM functions ( attachEvent, NOT addEventListener ) IE specific Microsoft.XMLHttp instead of window.XMLHttpRequest IE specific non-spec conforming CSS rules DOM 0 standard document.forms.blah referencing Invalid HTML Based on the fact that the app looks great in IE, but like crap in Firefox. Is there anything you can infer that will help me focus my research to know where to look for a solution? Make sure the source is NOT coming from Microsoft because usually Microsoft developers are out of touch with standards. There are exceptions, but as a general pointer. Usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they'll cater toward that specific browser but Opera/Webkit ( Chrome, Safari )/Firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than M$ ones. Use the W3 validators to correct markup. Use whatever developer tool based on your browser ( Firebug, Chrome Developer, Dragonfly ) Use sites that archive cross-browser bugs .
