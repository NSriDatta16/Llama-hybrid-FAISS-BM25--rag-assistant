Xcode cannot run using the selected device No provisioned iOS devices are available

One of my coworkers set me up with a provisioning profile through our corporate profile. I have read through several tutorials and none of them corresponded to the steps he actually took to get it set up. In the end my device was listed under the devices section of the organizer with a green circle next to it (I am guessing that's good?) but when I try to run the application on my device I get the error I mentioned in the subject of this post. I should mention my device is jailbroken running iOS 4.2.6. Is the "jailbrokenness" of my device an issue? This is like day one with Xcode and it is pretty overwhelming coming from the Linux command line and Emacs. I don't expect a complete walk through from any of you. But if you can point me to a nice long tutorial showing me how to set this up with the latest version of Xcode I would appreciate it.
