The specific residuals depend on the distribution used and on the characteristics of the dependent variable. Sometimes these are not very informative and sometimes they can't be computed easily. The utility of residuals varies greatly as well, in evaluating how well the model works. Logistic regression of a binary variable is a good example. All the residuals can be computed, but making sense of them is difficult without a summary such as calibration and a Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Summaries of other kinds, eg, by another categorical variable, can also be useful. Sometimes you can learn from comparing the estimated probabilities from two different models. For ordinal or nominal logistic regression with several categories, you can compute a set of probabilities for each observation. These can be useful but are difficult to interpret with straightforward graphical methods or summary statistics. Residuals for censored survival data are not uniquely defined. Estimated survival time might be longer or shorter than the time of censorship. Residuals for highly skewed dependent variables, eg, exponential, negative binomial, Poisson, etc, can be misleading in graphical displays since models do not reduce or remove the skewness. They leave you with the impression of many large outliers. Sometimes it is better to examine these on a transformed scale, such as logs. So, there is no general purpose answer to your question. The use of residuals depends on the model. For Gaussian residuals the story is easier. Unfortunately, we often find out that there are problems with a linear model that are not resolvable in simplistic, algorithmic ways.
