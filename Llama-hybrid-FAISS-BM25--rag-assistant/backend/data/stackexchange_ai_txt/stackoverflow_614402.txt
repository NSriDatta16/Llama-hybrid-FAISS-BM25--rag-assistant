The proper way of doing it is specifying cache http control headers in your request, or configuring no-caching on the server. If you have control over the server you can specify pragma no-cache, or something equivalent, so that certain files are never cached. The timestamp is indeed not such a good idea, because it might screw with all kinds of caches along the way.
