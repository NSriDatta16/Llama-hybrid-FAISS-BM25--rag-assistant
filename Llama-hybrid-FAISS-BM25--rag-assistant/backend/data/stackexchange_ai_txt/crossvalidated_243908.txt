Tuning Order XGBoost

A random forest in XGBoost has a lot of hyperparameters to tune. I have seen examples where people search over a handful of parameters at a time and others where they search over all of them simultaneously. What are some approaches for tuning the XGBoost hyper-parameters? And what is the rational for these approaches?
