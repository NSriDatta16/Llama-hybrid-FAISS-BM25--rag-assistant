how to set contents of setSingleChoiceItems in onPrepareDialog?

Guys, in onCreateDialog i have this: case DIALOG_REVIEW: { if (bundle.containsKey("POSITION")) { final int position = bundle.getInt("POSITION"); ArrayList alterNumbers = numbers.get(position); final String[] phoneNums = new String[alterNumbers.size()]; for (int i = 0; i which is working and great. BUT pay attention to line dialog.setSingleChoiceItems(phoneNums, 0, new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() { phoneNums are suppose to be changing each time the dialog pops up. I've overriden onPrepareDialog method but I don't know how to assign new values to it. and also there is no setSingleChoiceItems there. here is my onPrepareDialog method case DIALOG_REVIEW: { final int position = bundle.getInt("POSITION"); ArrayList alterNumbers = numbers.get(position); final String[] phoneNums = new String[alterNumbers.size()]; for (int i = 0; i What is the solution? thanks in advance guys.
