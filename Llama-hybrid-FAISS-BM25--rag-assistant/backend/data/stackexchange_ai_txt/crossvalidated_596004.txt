Finding better machine learning model for default prediction

I have two logistic regression models, model 1 and model 2. I want to find out which model is better. I'm predicting the default rate. I have compared the two models using Gini, plotted gini on month to month basis. But I want a business metric which can help me show a monetary benefit that model 2 can give over model 1. A good metric to fascinate stakeholders and make them realize that yes model 2 will make them more money.
