WPF DevComponents Dock Control will not fill screen

I am using the DevComponents third-party control to create a screen with multiple docking components organized in three rows, the last row having three columns. I have been successful in creating this layout, however I cannot figure out how to expand the height of the DockSite to the borders of the screen. I have posted the XAML below: Dock Test # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I have tried removing the DockSite.Site property but then the DockSite defaults to a Left Docked. Also, upon docking one window to the Bottom site there still remains an empty area about the height of the cursor that I cannot remove.
