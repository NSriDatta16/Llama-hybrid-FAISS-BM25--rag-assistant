Effective Sample Size greater than Actual Sample Size

I used the effectiveSize from the coda package to compute the effective sample size, but I get an effective sample size which is actually greater than my actual sample size (e.g. 11'043 to 10'000). I am also aware of this and this thread, and also tried to use the ess command from the mcmcse package, but the results get even worse with this package. Is there a workaround for that? PS: If I should have posted this as answer to one of the other threads, please merge.
