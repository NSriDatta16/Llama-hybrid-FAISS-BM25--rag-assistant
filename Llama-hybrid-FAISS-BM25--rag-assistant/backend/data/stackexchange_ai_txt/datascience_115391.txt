Feature Importance and Threshold Moving

Problem Type : Binary Classification Dataset : Imbalanced Current sklearn pipeline uses XGBoost model and involves moving threshold from 0.5 to a considerably higher value like 0.8 - 0.9. Is it viable to use XGBoost's feature importance metrics for identifying the relevant features, if not what would be a better alternate?
