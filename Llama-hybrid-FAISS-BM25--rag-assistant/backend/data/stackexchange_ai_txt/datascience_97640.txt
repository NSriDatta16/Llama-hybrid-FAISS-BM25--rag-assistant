What type of 'Naive Bayes' algorithm is provided by Orange?

I've been using Orange for a while to rapidly prototype a few classification models. One of the ones I've been using is 'Naive Bayes'. If I understand correctly, there are a few types available based on the Bayesian principle -> Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli etc. I see these as explicitly classes with scikit-learn as well. However I'm unable to tell which type is the one 'Orange' adopts for its 'Naive Bayes' widget. Can someone help me with this?
