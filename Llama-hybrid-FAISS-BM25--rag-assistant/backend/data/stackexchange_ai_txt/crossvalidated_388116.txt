Advice on ML ideas/models for a data set I have

I have a very large marketing data set (300GB in size) and I am wondering what ML models I can apply to it. The dataset consists of transactional data from supermarkets. The type of data I have is the following: There are 20 years worth of data, with 52 weeks in each year. 50 markets/regions -- Within each region there are approximately 20-40 stores. ---Each store sells approximately 40 different products (think; shampoo, toothpaste, chips, frozen pizza, beer etc.) ---- Each product consists of many brands ---- Each product has many characteristics For a few markets I have Panel level information where I can determine income, race, sex etc. (approx 1 million observations). For the whole data set I estimate that there are approx 5-10 billion observations. So I have 20 year time series transactional data for 50 different markets, with a lot of information on the products (type of packaging, Price, qty sold, glass bottle or tin can, colour, flavor etc. What I have currently done: Apply a simple LSTM model to forecaste future sales for certain brands Apply XGBoost in order to classify which customers Will purchase a certain product What I want: I am looking also for some more "economic" theory to be applied. It is great to apply ML in order to forecast sales etc. but I want to prove/disprove some economic theory. i.e. are certain customers (based on PANEL characteristics) more willing to buy a particular Brand than other customers. Do customers who shop at stores with fewer choice choose the same product as customers who shop at stores with a higher selection. Ideas: Could it be possible to apply reinforcement learning over a sequence (time) in this model? At the moment I am just brainstorming some ideas so your advice, comments Will only add to future ideas. My question is: Given this data set which ML model would you apply and to which problem? I have some ideas myself but I want to know if there are better suggestions for such a data set.
