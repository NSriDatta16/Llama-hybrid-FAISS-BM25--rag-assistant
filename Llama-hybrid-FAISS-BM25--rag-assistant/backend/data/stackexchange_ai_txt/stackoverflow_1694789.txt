The whole concept behind REST is that you leverage the power of the underlying HTTP protocol. In this case there are two HTTP headers that can help you find out if the list on your mobile device is stale. An added benefit is that the client on your mobile device probably supports these headers natively, which means you won't have to add any client side code to implement them! If-Modified-Since : check to see if the server's copy has been updated since your client first retrieved it Etag : check to see if a unique identifier for your client's local copy matches that which is on the server. An easy way to generate the unique string required for ETags on your server is to just hash the service's text output using MD5. You might try reading Mark Nottingham's excellent HTTP caching tutorial for information on how these headers work. If you are using Rails 2.2 or greater, there is built in support for these headers . Django 1.1 supports conditional view processing . And this MIX video shows how to implement with ASP.Net MVC.
