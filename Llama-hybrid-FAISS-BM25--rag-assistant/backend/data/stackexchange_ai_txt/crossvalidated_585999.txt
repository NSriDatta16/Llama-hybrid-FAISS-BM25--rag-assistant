Frequency detection in machine learning

I was tasked with developing an ML algorithm to predict machine failure based on vibration analysis. To do so, I must do the following: Detect different frequencies from an input signal Input can be any sample frequency from 1hz to 100 kHz Train an ML algorithm to detect the faulty frequencies My current approach is to take a Fourier transform of the input signal, and then feed the result into a linear classifier (LDA). What would be some good methodologies about approaching this?
