Ruby functions vs methods

In the Ruby Programming Language , Chapter 6 (second paragraph) they state: Many languages distinguish between functions, which have no associated object, and methods, which are invoked on a receiver object. Because Ruby is a purely object oriented language, all methods are true methods and are associated with at least one object. And then in the middle of the 6th paragraph: Both procs and lambdas are functions rather than methods invoked on an object. I am a bit confused about these statements. Is Ruby truly pure OO, and therefore doesn't have functions that aren't associated with objects (if that is a valid definition of pure OO), or are procs/lambdas associated with the Proc object? What is the difference between functions and methods in Ruby? Any help in parsing and understanding this would be appreciated.
