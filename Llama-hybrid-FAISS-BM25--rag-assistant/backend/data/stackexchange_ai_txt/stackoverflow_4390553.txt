You can do this with standard C (since you only care about dates, you don't have to worry about the timezone headaches that come with these functions). This assumes the POSIX definition of time_t, but AFAIK there is no currently-in-use OS with a different definition. #include /* before calling, memset() the 'struct tm' argument to all-bits-zero, set tm_hour to 12, then fill in the tm_year, tm_mon, and tm_mday fields; on return, pay attention to those fields only. */ struct tm add_days(const struct tm *base, long days) { time_t t = mktime(base); t += 3600*24*days; return *localtime(&t); }
