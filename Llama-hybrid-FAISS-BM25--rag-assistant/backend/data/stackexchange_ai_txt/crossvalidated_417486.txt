I don't think this can be answered without knowing whether (i) whether the relationship is truly linear and (ii) the other assumptions of linear regression are met. If these conditions are met, I don't see how a linear regression can be improved upon. If the conditions are not met, then XGBoost (which is a boosted regression tree) could quite conceivably improve upon it. The specific $^2$ is not really relevant, for reasons discussed in this thread .
