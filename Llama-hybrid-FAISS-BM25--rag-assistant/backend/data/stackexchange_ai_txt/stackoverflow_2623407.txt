Load external script dynamic, and access it, so I can trigger its domready function

I am trying to load the Zopim chat client. Normally it is included with a document write action. This causes it to be loaded before the domReady function is triggered, as it needs this to start itself. I want to load it later, and this works by using prototype (framework determined by Magento) to create a new script element and attaching it to the head. The script is loaded perfectly, but the domReady doesn't fire, so the script is never started. The script is a nameless class, by this I mean that all its functions are encapsulated in {} UPDATE: Sorry, I got it wrong, it is as self invoking function, the same syntax as the first answer suggest. (function C(){ })(); This function call when run sets up listening events for the domReady event under various browsers and then waits. When the domready event fires, it calls a function (that is within the self-invoked function) that starts everything. What I need, is a way to access this function somehow. END UPDATE Within that is a function named C. How can I call this function directly? Or put another way, how can I start an external javascript file that depends on domready going off, when that event doesn't happen? Can I load an external javascript file into a variable, so I can name the class? Can I access the nameless class {} somehow maybe via the script tag? Is there a way to alter the external file/javascript so I can have it look for another event, one that I can trigger? About the only solution I can think of at the moment is to create a iframe and load the script in that.
