Embedding CKEditor in SWT Java application in Linux

I'm having a problem with CKEditor not functioning properly. I have an SWT Java app running in Ubuntu. The app uses a Browser object to display an HTML page in the project which does nothing but display a CKEditor instance. If I open the HTML page in Firefox , CKEditor renders OK, and everything works. If I run my Java app through Eclipse , the widget displays the HTML page, CKEditor renders OK, and everything works. If I package my application up into a jar file and then run the app, the widget displays the HTML page, CKEditor renders OK, but nothing works. I can't type in the text area, none of the toolbar buttons work, and the javascript I have which runs CKEDITOR.on('instanceReady', function( e ) { e.editor.execCommand('maximize'); }); does not execute. I suspect something is wrong with the way the relative paths work when the files are packaged inside the jar, but everything appears to load correctly - the toolbar images, stylesheet, etc all load, but then no buttons can be clicked. It's like the UI breaks. The only button which responds at all is if I click "Source", in which case I can edit the text area; clicking "Source" a second time goes back to WYSIWYG mode and leaves the CKEditor toolbar disabled (greyed out; no icons can be clicked on). I have no ideas left for what to try. Suggestions?
