Edit: I had first said: What's inelegant about the dictionary solution? It seems perfectly elegant to me, especially since you only need to set the comparator in creation of the dictionary. Of course though, it is inelegant to use something as a key when it's also the value. Therefore I would use a HashSet. If later operations required indexing, I'd create a list from it when the Adding was done, otherwise, just use the hashset.
