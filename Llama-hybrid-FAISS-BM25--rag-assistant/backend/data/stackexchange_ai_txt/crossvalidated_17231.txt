Second moment of draws from a multivariate normal covariance matrix

Suppose I have an $N\times N$ covariance matrix that describes a multivariate normal joint distribution. Now take 100,000 draws of the covariance matrix. I measure the variance of values for each draw -- call this the "cross sectional dispersion". If I average the result of cross-sectional dispersion across draws what is the analytical expression for the mean and variance of this dispersion? Here is some code if you'd like to toy with this or test your idea: # create 3x3 covariance matrix m1
