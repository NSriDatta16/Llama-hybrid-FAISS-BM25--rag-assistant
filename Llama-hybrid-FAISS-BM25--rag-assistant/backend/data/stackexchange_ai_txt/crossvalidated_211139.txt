Multi-class SVM Calibration

Say we have multiple SVMs used in a one-vs-all approach, such that classes a, b, c correspond to 3 SVMs trained positively on the class and then negatively on all other classes. When we test these we get 3 results. For a class a sample we may get a:0.9, b:0.2, c:0.3 . Because each SVM is computed slightly differently and has different scales, I cannot compare them. Is there an approach that will work on the outputs of one-vs-all classifiers to calibrate the outputs? I have found a paper which discusses it in section 2.1 ( http://www.metarecognition.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cvpr2012_attributes.pdf ) but I am unsure if this would work one my one-vs-all approach as the paper seems to be talking about applying this to only one classifier and I have 3.
