When a continuous predictor $x$ contains 'not applicable' values it's often useful to code it using two variables: $$ x_1=\Big{\{} \begin{array}{ll} c & \text{when $x$ is not applicable}\\ x & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \Bigg{.} $$ where $c$ is a constant, & $$ x_2=\Big{\{} \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \text{when $x$ is not applicable}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \Bigg{.} $$ Suppose the linear predictor for the response is given by $$\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots$$ which resolves to $$\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \ldots$$ when $x$ is measured, or to $$\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 c + \beta_2 + \ldots$$ when x is 'not applicable'. The choice of $c$ is arbitrary, & does not affect the estimates of the intercept $\beta_0$ or the slope $\beta_1$ ; $\beta_2$ describes the effect of $x$ 's being 'not applicable' compared to when $x=c$ . This isn't a suitable approach when the response varies according to an unknown value of $x$ : the variability of the 'missing' group will be inflated, & estimates of other predictors' coefficients biased owing to confounding. Better to impute missing values. Use of LASSO introduces two problems: The choice of $c$ affects the results as the amount of shrinkage applied depends on the magnitudes of the coefficient estimates. You need to ensure that $x_1$ & $x_2$ are either both in or both out of the model selected. You can solve both of these by using rather the group LASSO with a group comprising $x_1$ & $x_2$ : the $L_1$ -norm penalty is applied to the $L_2$ -norm of the orthonormalized matrix $\left[\vec{x_1}\ \vec{x_2}\right]$ . (Categorical predictors are the poster child for group LASSOâ€”you'd just code 'not applicable' as a separate level, as often done in unpenalized regression.) See Meier et al (2008), JRSS B, 70 , 1, "The group lasso for logistic regression" & grplasso .
