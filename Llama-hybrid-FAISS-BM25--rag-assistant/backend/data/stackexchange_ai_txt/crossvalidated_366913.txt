In random forests (w/o any modifications), resulting target values of each decision tree are purely averaged. And, each leaf node of one decision tree should contain a unique target value, since it is also the average of member samples in that leaf. But, you cannot guarantee the entire range of possible target values for a specific decision tree because of bootstrap sampling. Your highest and lowest possible target values may not be member of a decision tree you've constructed; or even if they're members, you might be averaging them with others corresponding to the same leaf node.
