How can I use my laptop to implement analysis in Python but use a different fast server for computation of analysis?

I am working in a company but I am new in the field. We have a central server which is faster than my laptop (of course). So my goal is that I still use my laptop to do python analysis for machine learning but actual computation is happening in the central server so that the computing power is stronger. I am not considering any cloud service as we have a fast server computer. But I am clueless in this yet. Can anyone advise me how to do this? Thank you very much in advance.
