The first option does not take account of the reduced variance that you get from the sample The first option gives you five lower 95% confidence bounds for the mean based on a sample of size 1 in each case. Combining them by averaging does not create a bound that you can interpret as a lower 95% bound. No one would do that. The second option is what is done. The average of the five independent observations has a variance smaller by a factor of 6 than the variance for a single sample. It therefore gives you a much better lower bound than any of the five you calculated the first way. Also if the X$_i$ can be assumed to be iid normal then T will be normal.
