The model $$y = \frac{1}{1+e^{S(I-x)}}$$ can be reparametrised with $I = -a/b$ and $S=b$ as $$y = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(a+bx)}}$$ This can be solved with GLM using a logit link function. Then you can use the estimates of $a$ and $b$ to compute the estimates of $I$ and $S$ and use the Delta method to compute the error. Or potentially you use nls with the GLM result as start conditions (although in this approach there would be smarter, faster, methods to generate starting conditions) to have nls compute the Hessian, which can be used as an approximation of the error (you could also derive this Hessian analytically). Note: these estimates for the error assume that your data points are independent. This may not need to be the case. For instance, if the data points are a time series then likely the error terms are correlated. Also, the error might not need to be with equal variance for different values of $x$ . Does nls (assuming Gaussian errors with equal variance) make sense? In this case it may be easier to use a Monte Carlo method, which allows you to use whatever structure for the errors of the data and create a straight forward estimate of the fitted coefficients by simulations. Another addition, if your model is misspecified, then estimates of the variance based on the Hessian or residual variance are not correct. This will overestimate the variance/error of the estimates. (In your case you might for instance think about a missing baseline term which causes such misspecification)
