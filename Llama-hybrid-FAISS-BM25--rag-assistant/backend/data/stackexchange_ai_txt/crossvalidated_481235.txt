How to consider wage data in a logistic regression model when the values are bucketed?

If I have data such as wage : under 10K 10K - 20K 20K - 40K 40K - 80K over 80K don't know rather not say Which I wanted to use in a model, I don't think that I can use this as anything other than an ordinal variable? It feels natural to want to be able to talk about things in terms of wages increasing/decreasing, but as there are categories of don't know and rather not say it seems that this is forced. Looking at this post seems to support my thinking, but I wanted to check, perhaps there is some basic literature that might be recommended that covers this.
