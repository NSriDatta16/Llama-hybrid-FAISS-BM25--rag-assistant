Different SKUs per store in Magento

If I wish to get functionality of different SKUs per store for a particular product, what do I have to do? Say that I have different stores, like men's shoes.com and women's shoes.com, in which the same product (CN Clogs Beach/Garden Clog) is present in each store. Now, I want to define the SKU in the men's store as mens_shoes_cnclog , and in the women's store as womens_shoes_cnclog . Here I'm handling one website, and two stores. So, how can I define different skus based on store name? I have tried to override the saveAction() method of Catalog_ProductController , in which I can easily get the website code, but I want store-wise SKUs so that, in search engines, they will be considered two different products. TIA
