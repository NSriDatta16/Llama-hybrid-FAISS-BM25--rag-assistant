Space filling curves are sometimes used for nearest neighbor search. See these applications of Z-order curves and Hilbert curves . The idea is as follows. Let $f$ be a space-filling curve. Given a point $x$ , index it as $f^{-1}(x)$ .* Given a query point $y$ , return all points indexed in an interval around $f^{-1}(y)$ . If $y$ is close to $x$ , there is a good chance that $x$ will be returned so long as $f^{-1}$ tends to preserve locality. Different space filling curves have this property to different degrees. * Note that space-filling curves are not injective so the inverse is not uniquely defined. But in practice we choose a finite grid on $[0, 1]^n$ and an appropriate iterate that is bijective so we don't have a problem.
