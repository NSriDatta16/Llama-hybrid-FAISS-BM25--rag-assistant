Robust logistic regression vs logistic regression

It's been a while since I've thought about or used a robust logistic regression model. However, I ran a few logits yesterday and realized that my probability curve was being affected by some 'extreme' values, and particularly low ones. However, when I went to run a robust logit model, I got the same results as I did in my logit model. Under what circumstances should a robust logit produce different results from a traditional logit model? (in terms of coefficients) R Code: > library(Design) > ddist options(datadist='ddist') > me = lrm(factor(dlstatus) ~ dlour_bid, data=dlmydat) > me Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = factor(dlstatus) ~ dlour_bid, data = dlmydat) Frequencies of Responses 1 2 906 154 Obs Max Deriv Model L.R. d.f.
