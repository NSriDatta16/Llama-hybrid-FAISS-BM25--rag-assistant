From my research I found that TImageList stores the images as TBitmaps, so the alpha information is lost on storage, and you can't achieve what you're looking for with the current implementation of TImageList. Update: A little more experiments and with the code below i could make transparency work with the code below. ImageList1.ColorDepth := cd32Bit; Image2.Transparent := True; Image2.Canvas.Pen.Style := psClear; Image2.Canvas.Rectangle(0, 0, Image2.Width+1, Image2.Height+1); ImageList1.Draw(Image2.Canvas, 0,0,0); But it didn't look as pretty as a loaded png.
