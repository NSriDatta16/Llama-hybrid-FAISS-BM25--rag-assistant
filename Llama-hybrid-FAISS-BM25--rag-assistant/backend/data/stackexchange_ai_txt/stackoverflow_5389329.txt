I had a similar problem with LINQ-to-CRM and went back to QueryExpressions because they worked, until I found the solution in some SDK sample while looking for something else: You need to add a ProxyTypesBehavior to your IOrganizationService object. I don't know what it does, but that definitely was the change that allowed me to use LINQ with the early bound classes (as I perceive it, LINQ-to-CRM can only be used with the early bound classes). So the line you need after creating your IOrganizationService is: organizationService.ServiceConfiguration.CurrentServiceEndpoint.Behaviors.Add(new ProxyTypesBehavior()); I hope that helps.
