One large image mainly gives you more work and more headaches. It's harder to maintain but is probably less ram intensive because there is only one structure + data in memory instead of many structures + data. (though probably not enough to notice). Looking at the contents of .app bundles on regular Mac OS, it seems the generally approved method of storage is one file/resource per image. Ofcourse, this is assuming you're not getting the image resources from the web, where the bottleneck would be in http and its specified maximum of two concurrent requests.
