I'd recommend you look at TBATS models. These are state space models for forecasting, and the "T" stands for using trigonometric functions to model multiple seasonalities - so these are smooth, as required. There is a tbats() function in the forecast package for R. We also have a tbats tag. Finally, the original publication is De Livera, A. M., Hyndman, R. J. & Snyder, R. D. (2011). Forecasting Time Series With Complex Seasonal Patterns Using Exponential Smoothing. Journal of the American Statistical Association , 106, 1513-1527 .
