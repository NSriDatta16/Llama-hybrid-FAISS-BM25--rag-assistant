To get totally unbiased is impossible, you can do various stuff like running minimum processes etc but IMO best way is to run scripts in random order over a long period of time over different days and get average which will be as near to unbias as possible. Because ultimately code will run in such environment in random order and you are interested in average behavior not some numbers.
