The Wilson score interval is a simple and accurate confidence interval for the binomial proportion parameter, that automatically adjusts near the boundaries of the range. The coverage properties of various intervals have been examined in Brown, Cai and DasGupta (2001) and this is one of the intervals they recommend as having good coverage properties. The interval is constructed as follows. Suppose you observe $N_1$ "successes" and $N_0$ "failures" giving a total of $n=N_0+N_1$ data points. The Wilson score interval uses the normal approximation to give the following pivotal quantity: $$\frac{(N_1 - n \theta)^2}{n\theta (1-\theta)} \overset{\text{Approx}}{\sim} \text{ChiSq}(1),$$ Letting $\chi_{\alpha}^2$ denote the critical point (upper tail area of $\alpha$ ) of the chi-squared distribution with one degree-of-freedom, and solving the resulting quadratic inequality for $\theta$ , then gives the probability interval: $$\begin{align} 1-\alpha &\approx \mathbb{P} \Bigg( (N_1 - n \theta)^2 \leqslant n \theta (1-\theta) \cdot \chi_{\alpha}^2 \Bigg) \\[6pt] &= \mathbb{P} \Bigg( \theta \in \Bigg[ \frac{2N_1 + \chi_{\alpha}^2}{2n + \chi_{\alpha}^2} \pm \frac{n \chi_{\alpha}}{n + \chi_{\alpha}^2} \sqrt{\frac{N_0 N_1}{n} + \frac{\chi_{\alpha}^2}{4}} \Bigg] \Bigg). \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ Substitution of the observed values of $n_0$ and $n_1$ then gives the resulting confidence interval. This confidence interval is implemented in various functions. You can implement this interval in R using the CONF.prop function from the stat.extend package . Here is the interval you get with your data: #Compute confidence interval using Wilson-score method library(stat.extend) CONF.prop(alpha = 0.05, sample.prop = 123/9876, n = 9876) Confidence Interval (CI) 95.00% CI for proportion parameter for infinite population Interval uses 9876 binary data points with sample proportion = 0.0125 [0.0104489771546811, 0.0148390256803883]
