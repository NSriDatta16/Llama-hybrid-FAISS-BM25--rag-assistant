What's the difference between binomial regression and logistic regression?

I've always thought of logistic regression as simply a special case of binomial regression where the link function is the logistic function (instead of, say, a probit function). From reading the answers on another question I had, though, it sounds like I might be confused, and there is a difference between logistic regression and binomial regression with a logistic link. What's the difference?
