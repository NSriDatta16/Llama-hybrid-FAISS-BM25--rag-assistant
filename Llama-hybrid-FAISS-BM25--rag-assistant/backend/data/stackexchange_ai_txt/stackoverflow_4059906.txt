Using google search API services in the backend using C#

I'm trying to use the google search API services in the backend using C#. I know there is ajax api that you can use with javascript. so what is the similar thing in C# so I can use it at the backend level. I know that I can do it this way: var searchTerm = "Paris"; var web = new WebClient(); web.Headers.Add("Referrer", "http://localhost:49360/"); var result = web.DownloadString(String.Format( "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?v=1.0&q={0}", searchTerm)); Console.WriteLine(result); but it doesn't give me any flexibility. e.x how can I set a site restriction and specify the search catagory?? e.x I want to be able to search news and finance articles for the term "Microsoft" from the CNN website only and store the urls in text file. How can I do that?? please let me know, I have been struggling for many days looking it up online and I'm getting very frustrated. thanks a lot,
