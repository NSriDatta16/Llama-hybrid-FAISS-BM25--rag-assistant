Has Anyone Tried FastReport .Net before?

I'm looking for reporting solution for .net, my company has used Crystal Reports XI (and its Server edition) and SQL Server Reporting Services for our previous projects. However we're going to develop a new product and we want a fast, easily deployed/managed assemblies,programmable report document object, and has runtime report designer. I've tried the trial of FastReport.Net, it seems ok but it will be better if someone here has experience & issues with FastReport.Net. And how about other products (ActiveReports, Telerik Reporting, etc) ? Thanks for your attention
