There is a recent paper discussing complex separation mask (basically spectrum + phase estimation) Complex Ratio Masking for Monaural Speech Separation Donald S. Williamson, Student Member, IEEE, Yuxuan Wang, and DeLiang Wang, Fellow, IEEE They tried but it was not a great success. Most likely it is not due to the task is "hard", it is simply that they has not yet come with the right network architecture. Also check Multi-talker Speech Separation with Utterance-level Permutation Invariant Training of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks Morten Kolb√¶k, Student Member, IEEE, Dong Yu, Senior Member, IEEE, Zheng-Hua Tan, Senior Member, IEEE, and Jesper Jensen. They also provide results for phase estimation for masks.
