Correlation between top 10 cryptocurrencies?

I have time series data for top 10 cryptocurrencies including these features: open, close, high, low, volume. 1). I want to know which method is better for correlation testing between them - Pearson's Correlation or Spearman Correlation? Why? 2). Correlation should be tested for which price - low, high, open, close, average? 3). Since it is time series data, for testing correlation how much time period data is required(minimum)?
