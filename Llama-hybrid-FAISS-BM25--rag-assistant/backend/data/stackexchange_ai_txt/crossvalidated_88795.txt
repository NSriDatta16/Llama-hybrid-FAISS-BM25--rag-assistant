Regression with TBATS error?

I'm working on a time series model which includes multiple seasonal components (daily and weekly). I believe the best way to approach this would be BATS/TBATS model, however I have a concern if I can incorporate external factors in a proper way. I'm thinking about a regression with BATS/TBATS error, in analogy to a regression with ARIMA error: Fit a linear regression to forecast the outcome based on available external predictors Fit BATS/TBATS model to forecast residuals; Do you see any fundamental problems with this approach and is there a better way to build a model with multiple seasonal components and external predictors?
