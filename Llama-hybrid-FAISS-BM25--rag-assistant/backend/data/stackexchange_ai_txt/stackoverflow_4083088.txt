Php Eclipse on windows azure using cloud storage in local testing

I have been trying to access a queue that is on the cloud while running the role in dev fabric. To do that I followed the steps: Project->Proprieties->Windows Azure->Data Storage and I selected the approrpiate fields and entered my credentials. Then I do the following: require_once 'Microsoft/WindowsAzure/Storage/Queue.php'; $storageClient = new Microsoft_WindowsAzure_Storage_Queue(); if( !($storageClient->queueExists('worktodo'))){ $result=$storageClient->createQueue('worktodo'); echo 'Created queue: ' . $result->Name." "; }else{ echo 'worktodo queue exists'." "; } $storageClient->putMessage('worktodo', $id.','.$name, 3600); // 3600 = time-to-live of the message, if omitted defaults to 7 days echo($storageClient->getAccountName()); Long story short the queue are always created in DevStorage.... My Configuration settings: Has anyone done this before ? Are my configuration settings correct ? Thanks
