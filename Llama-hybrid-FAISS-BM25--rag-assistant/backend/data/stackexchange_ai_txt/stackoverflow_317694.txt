I'd go with: String strSomething1 = someObject.getSomeProperties1(); String strSomething2 = someObject.getSomeProperties2(); // clean-up spaces strSomething1 = removeTrailingSpaces(strSomething1); strSomething2 = removeTrailingSpaces(strSomething2); someObject.setSomeProperties(strSomething1 + strSomething2); My personal preference is to organize by action, rather than sequence. I think it just reads better.
