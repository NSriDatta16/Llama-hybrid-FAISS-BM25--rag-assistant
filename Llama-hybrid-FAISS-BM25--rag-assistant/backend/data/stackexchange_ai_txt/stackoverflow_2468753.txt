A lot of real world web applications are moving towards Single Sign On functionality. What they do is quite similar to what you have described i.e. there will be some kind of agent running on your application that will intercept the requests and check the cookies, session, authentication etc. with some external server that is responsible for maintaining a database of users, permissions, groups, roles etc. Depending on how you have configured it requests will be allowed or disallowed. The main point here is that you should be able to write your application without bothering too much about cross cutting functionalities like authentication, authorization etc. You can take look at OpenSSO , OpenSSO wiki , others
