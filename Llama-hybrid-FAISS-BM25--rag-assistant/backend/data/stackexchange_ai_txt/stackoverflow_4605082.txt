How to launch an application from Lotus Notes, then later save into Lotus database?

I work on a team that's developed a Java Swing application, and now I'm trying to help another team integrate this application into Lotus Notes. Unfortunately, I don't know that much about Notes, and can't seem to find any documentation related to what we're trying to do. What we want to do is have the user launch our application with some data passed in from Notes, have the user work with the passed in data, then when they are ready to save, the modified data is saved back into the Notes database. The first part we achieved with a Notes agent - it's able to launch our application and pass the original data in - the problem is saving. The agent seems to complete and "die" after the call to launch our application, so there's no way to get a reference to the session/database later when the user is ready to save. One of the Lotus developers kind of got it to work by making a busy wait loop in the agent to keep it alive after launching the application - but this has the side effect of preventing any other use of Lotus Notes while the application was open, so it's not really an acceptable solution. Anyone know if what we're trying to do is possible? How to do it? Links to any examples/documentation on this?
