What is the accurate null hypothesis for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test?

I've read some works on the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (HLT) but still I'm uncertain what is the exact null hypothesis for the HLT. I'd like to formulate a nullhypothesis as precisely as possible. I think the fitted model is significant says everything and nothing. The observed frequencies equal the estimated frequencies is more acccurate for a pearson chi-square test and misses the logistic model. I prefer this one: $$\hat{\pi}_{k_j} = \pi_{{k_j}_0} \; (j =1, \ldots, c_k) (k=1, \ldots, g)$$ where $\hat{\pi}_{k_j}$ is the from the logistic model estimated probability $\pi_{{k_j}_0}$ is the real but unknown probalbility $c_k$ is the number of covariate patterns in the $k$ th grouop $g$ is the number of groups What are your suggestions? Edit As I think now, the proper null hypothesis is in fact The model fits and the alternative is the model does not fit . (Hosmer, Lemeshow: Applied logistic Regression, Ku√ü: Globale Anpassungstests im logistischen Regressionsmodell ) That means the HL-test evaluates the fitted model.
