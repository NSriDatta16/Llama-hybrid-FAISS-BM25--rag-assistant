If you want to acquiesce to (i) avoiding methods that do p-values (ii) producing a more "bespoke" test for this problem (objectives mentioned by Taleb, not necessarilly something you agree with) One solution would be to simulate and find parameters by rejection sampling (actually approximate Bayesian computation). So let's say there are two key parameter: (a) the infection rate when maskless $r$ and (b) the % change in infection rate wearing a mask $m$ . Let's put two uniform priors $r \sim U [.0001,.005]$ and $m \sim U[.5,1.5]$ : a priori you think mask can cut risk by 50% or increase it by 50% (two-tailed as you suggested). We can run a simulation where we draw those two parameters, use them to sample 2392 observations with mask and 2470 without it. However we accept the simulation only where we it outputs precisely 5 positives when wearing no masks and 0 positives when wearing it. We keep doing this until we collect, say, 5000 simulations. When we look at the posteriors, the multiplier distribution has clearly shifted left and away from the original center at 1. However it is still true that the probability that the multiplier is above 1 is about 17% (far above the threshold of 5% we set ourselves).
