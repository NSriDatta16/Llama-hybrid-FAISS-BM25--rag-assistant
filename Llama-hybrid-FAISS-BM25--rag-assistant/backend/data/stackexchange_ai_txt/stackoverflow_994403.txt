PVCS can be automated. The Software Engineering people in my organization have created a whole set of scripts to go along with PVCS. We use these scripts to automate our SW integration and release process. For example, we have a script to create a Release, which means creating a new project with specific versions of files coming from many projects and databases. Sounds similar to what you want to do.
