You could assume that the allele frequency is some parameter p. Now the sample frequency in a population of size s1 will follow the binomial distribution $P(x1) = {s_1 \choose x_1} p^{x_1}(1-p)^{s_1-x_1}$. The sample frequency in a population of size s2 will follow the binomial distribution $P(x2) = {s_2 \choose x_2} p^{x_2}(1-p)^{s_2-x_2}$. Now if you want to be Bayesian, you could find the likelihood ratio assuming a common parameter p vs different parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$. To get a p-value, you could find $P(x_1/s_1 - x_2/s_2 > y)$ and integrate out $p$. Though this sounds a little weird.
