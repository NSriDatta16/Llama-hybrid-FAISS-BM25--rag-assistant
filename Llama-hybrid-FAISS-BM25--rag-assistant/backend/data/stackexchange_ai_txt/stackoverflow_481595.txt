If I was to be brutally honest, I would say that it sounds like you're the one confused about web postbacks, not your application (that's if you're the one who wrote it). ;-) That said, in addition to other suggestions, what I would do in this case is place a "token" in hidden field in the form - like a GUID - that is posted back. Use this to track the work being done and only allow it to be used once. E.g. when posted back, place it in session storage. Each time a postback is performed check the session first for this token, and if it is there then do nothing. If it's NOT there, store it in session and do the work. When the session ends, tokens are thrown away automagically. Easy. Much better than some convoluted database token. Oisin
