Ok, I figured out how to cure the symptom, although I'm not sure why this would happen. Basically one of the columns in my ADG didn't pass this check if ((item.x +item.width) on line 2609 of AdvancedDataGrid.as by a tiny amount and thus does not get drawn. I now override drawVerticalLine and add a small epsilon to x to pass the test - make no claims on the elegance of the solution, but seems to do the trick.
