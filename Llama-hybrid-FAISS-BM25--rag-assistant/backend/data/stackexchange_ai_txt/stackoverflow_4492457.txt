If you need full control on the process (result values, parameters to be provided, etc), I would suggest you to create your own task scheduler, where you can use the cron algorithm to schedule the time you want execute your task. I know it may sounds overkill to create a service to run once a week, but if you make a generic scheduler, you will be able to reuse your schedule for other purposes. I created this scheduler in the past, and it has been used for years in production. I implemented the cron algorithm in .Net, based in the open source algorithm that one developer (Artif Aziz) wrote. Check out my blog for more information on this: CronTab schedule parser algorithm If you think in a higher level (enterprise level), you could consider buying Control-M, one of the most powerful scheduler tools I have ever used, however it is quite expensive.
