TeamCity can't find NAnt

I am trying to call a NAnt script from TeamCity, but I'm encountering something that makes no sense to me. I've tested the NAnt script from the command line and it works perfectly. I've configured the NAnt build runner in TeamCity, and when I run it, I get the following error: Step 3/3 The following paths do not contain NAnt: C:\nant\bin C:\TeamCity6\buildAgent\work\59c8c293c5dec971\C:\nant\bin Please check "NAnt home" parameter at the build runner settings page I've checked many times that the NAnt executable resides in C:\nant\bin Am I missing something?
