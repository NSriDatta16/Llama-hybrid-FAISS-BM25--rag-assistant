Execute bash script from URL

Say I have a file at the URL http://mywebsite.example/myscript.txt that contains a script: #!/bin/bash echo "Hello, world!" read -p "What is your name? " name echo "Hello, ${name}!" And I'd like to run this script without first saving it to a file. How do I do this? Now, I've seen the syntax: bash But this doesn't seem to work like it would if I saved to a file and then executed. For example readline doesn't work, and the output is just: $ bash Similarly, I've tried: curl -s http://mywebsite.example/myscript.txt | bash -s -- With the same results. Originally I had a solution like: timestamp=`date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` curl -s http://mywebsite.example/myscript.txt -o /tmp/.myscript.${timestamp}.tmp bash /tmp/.myscript.${timestamp}.tmp rm -f /tmp/.myscript.${timestamp}.tmp But this seems sloppy, and I'd like a more elegant solution. I'm aware of the security issues regarding running a shell script from a URL, but let's ignore all of that for right now.
