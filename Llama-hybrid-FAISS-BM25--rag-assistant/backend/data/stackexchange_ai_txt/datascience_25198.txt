What is training

I'm a newbie on deep learning and I have a simple question. I'm reading some article about the neural network. It says that people created a simple neural network named perceptron. And this network can't solve a very simple question: exclusive or. I think it's because I don't know how to train a neural network or how to set the weights for a neural network. Could you describe the process of training for perceptron with the example AND: 0 & 0 = 0 1 & 0 = 0 0 & 1 = 0 1 & 1 = 1 With such a training, how do the weights in perceptron look like?
