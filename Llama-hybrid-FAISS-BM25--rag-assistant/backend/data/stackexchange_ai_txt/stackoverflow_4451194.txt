You need to add a unique index or a primary key on the IPGeo.code3 column in order to reference it with a foreign key. You can see the error by running show engine innodb status\G and looking under the LATEST FOREIGN KEY ERROR section. The error probably looks something like this: Cannot find an index in the referenced table where the referenced columns appear as the first columns, or column types in the table and the referenced table do not match for constraint. Note that the internal storage type of ENUM and SET changed in tables created with >= InnoDB-4.1.12, and such columns in old tables cannot be referenced by such columns in new tables. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-foreign-key-constraints.html for correct foreign key definition.
