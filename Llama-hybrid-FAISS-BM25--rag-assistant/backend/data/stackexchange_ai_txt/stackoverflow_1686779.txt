Multifile rake build

I have a build system that consists of several subdirectories with projects, where in each of them there's a separate rakiefile (or couple of rakefiles). No the top-level directory has a rakefile that goes through all subdirectories and calls rake via: system("rake "), gets resulting packages and sends them to appropriate machine. Is there more elegant way of doing this? I've tried Rake.application.load() but this doesn't seem to accept any argument as to which file must be loaded (as I've mentioned sometimes there are 2 rakefiles in each subdirectory),
