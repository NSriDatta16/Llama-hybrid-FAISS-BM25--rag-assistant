I don't have any specific knowledge about reddit, however the usual way to handle this would be to make the request, then see if you got an error saying "Not logged in" as the response. Checking to see if there is a cookie in the store or not is possible, with [[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookiesForURL:[url absoluteURL]] however this will not tell you if the cookie is valid - it could have been expired on the server side or could have become invalid on the server side - so you will still have to check the responses for "Not logged in" errors. (Although it appears from the API documentation that reddit only sets session cookies, so they'll never appear in the persistent store - in that case you can use [ASIHTTPRequest sessionCookies] to see the cookies.)
