This article can be helpful: Understanding Convolution in Deep Learning by Tim Dettmers from March 26 It doesn't really answers the question because it explains only the first convolution layer, but contains good explanation of basic intuition about convolution in CNNs. It also describes deeper mathematical definition of convolution. I think it is related to question topic.
