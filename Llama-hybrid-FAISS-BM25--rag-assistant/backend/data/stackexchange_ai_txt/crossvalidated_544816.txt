Hypothesis test for Poisson rates with stochastic time distribution

I am aiming to run some hypothesis test for a couple biological simulations. In these simulations I assume that biological mutations are accumulated at a Poisson rate proportional to time, and I want to run a hypothesis test to determine whether the rate of accumulations of mutations is different between two simulations. That is $X_1 \sim Poisson(t_1\lambda_1)$ and $X_2 \sim Poisson(t_2 \lambda_2)$ . I want to test $H_0: \lambda_1 = \lambda_2$ (up to some factor). I have read some literature on this test, but it seems that most take the time factor to be a given: https://www.smu.edu/~/media/Site/Dedman/Departments/Statistics/TechReports/TR356.ashx . I don't exactly know the times, but I know that $t_1$ and $t_2$ are drawn from some distribution $P$ , and I know the number of events in both simulations. Is there any approach or theoretical results that have been studied for this problem. One workaround that I was thinking of is just simply doing some sort of bootstrap test where I draw the times at random and then compute the p-value and take an average.
