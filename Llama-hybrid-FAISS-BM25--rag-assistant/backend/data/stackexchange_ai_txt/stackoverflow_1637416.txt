The obvious answer is that Java is free (as in beer) for anything you are willing to invest time on. Other than the hardware, you can run Linux (or Open Solaris, or etc.), a free JVM, tons of free APIs - it is part of the culture, free encourages free. The Microsoft ecosystem is more of a pay as you go environment. Many tools that have free in the Java world only have for pay options in the Microsoft world. In the research world, where you have plenty of underpaid graduate students, manpower is much cheaper so the ostensible benefit of the commercial licensed tool saving manpower isn't as much of a benefit. Add to that that a research project could be required to run on a wide distribution of machines. When that happens in the commercial environment, the commercial entity is making money (say for example an e-commerce company that needs to increase the number of machines in its cluster - they are getting more traffic, more sales, more money so they can spend to increase infrastructure). In research, the increased licensing requirements of commercial software aren't necessarily justified by their underlying economics. So all told, Java gets the preference. Once that happens, that becomes the tool everyone is talking about, and the effect snowballs to the point where .NET is crowded out. Of course you will find exceptions to all the above, but the point is that it outlines the trend.
