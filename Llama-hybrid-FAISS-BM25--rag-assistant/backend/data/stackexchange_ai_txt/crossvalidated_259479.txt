If I toss a biased coin 4 times, and I bet on one side twice then the other side twice, does it matter which side I start on?

Steven and I have a biased coin. The coin has a 90% chance to show heads, and a 10% chance to show tails. We flip the coin in the same way 4 times. Steven picks heads for the first two rounds and I pick tails for the first two rounds. Then I choose heads for the last two rounds and Steven chooses tails for the last two rounds. In order to win, one of us must succeed 3 times. Is one of us more likely to win? My calculation shows that we each have a 0.1557 chance of winning. My friend is arguing that I am wrong based on absorbing markov chains. Here's what I've done: https://www.scribd.com/document/338158368/Swap-Side-Balance Am I crazy or is this really obvious that it doesn't matter which side you start on?
