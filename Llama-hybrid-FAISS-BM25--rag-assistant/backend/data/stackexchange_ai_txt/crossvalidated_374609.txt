MDP is an expansion of MP, and the difference is written in your question, but maybe an illustration will help. MP is a stone rolling down the road and has a probability at each fork in its path to go left or right. MDP is when you put someone (agent) on the stone that tries to or has the ability to affect the stone's path and steer it a bit to the left or the right. This means that the probability of the stone actually veering to the left or the right is dependent upon the action that the agent takes. This answer is weird, but I hope it helps you understand.
