I usually have Database project stored inside my source control repository that contains all the scripts necessary to create a new database, all the tables, views , sp's etc. Generating scripts for SP's is quite easy. Simply open up the Server Explorer and connect to you database, sekect any existing sp and drag it onto the database project in the project browser window.
