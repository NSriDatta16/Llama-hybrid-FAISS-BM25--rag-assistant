What is mAP in object detection?

I have been reading through this blog in order to find what mAP is .In the sub heading of AP, they give the example of 5 apple images and finding out the average precision.As far I understand false positive is when the object is localised and classified but IOU Also what does the table in the blog really respresent.The 'correct?' is for one particluar example or 5 examples together.Could you just brief me what is going on in your own terms or just what the blog says?
