I would agree with Kyle and go with a package product like PI. Be aware PI is quite expensive. If your looking for a custom solution I'd go with Stephen's with some modifications. Have one server recieve the messages and drop them into a queue. You can't use a file though to hand off the message to the other process because your going to have locking issues constantly. Probably use something like MSMQ(MS message queuing) but I'm not sure on speed of that. I would also recommend using a db to store your data. You'll want to do bulk inserts of data into the db though, as I think you would need some heafty hardware to allow SQL do do 5000 transactions a second. Your better off to do a bulk insert every say 10000 messages that accumulate in the queue. DATA SIZES: Average Message ~50bytes -> small datetime = 4bytes + Topic (~10 characters non unicode) = 10bytes + Message -> 31characters(non unicode) = 31 bytes. 50 * 5000 = 244kb/sec -> 14mb/min -> 858mb/hour
