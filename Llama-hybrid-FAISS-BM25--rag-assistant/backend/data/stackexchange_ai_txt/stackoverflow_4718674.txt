How to validate a price (money amount) mySql decimal column in Yii?

I am using a mySql DECIMAL(12,4) column to hold price values (seeing how that's what Magento uses). I want to validate them in my ActiveRecord model using Yii's CValidator rules, but I'm not quite sure how to do it. I assume I can do it with the CTypeValidator set to "float", but I wanted to see how other folks are doing this. I don't see an actual "currency" validator. Maybe I should just validate the length? array('price', 'type', 'type'=>'float'), or array('price', 'length', 'max'=>17), // 12 + 4 + . = 17? Suggestions and examples? Thanks!
