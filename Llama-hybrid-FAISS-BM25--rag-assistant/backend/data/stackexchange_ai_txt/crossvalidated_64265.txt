It is a uniform distribution (either continuous or discrete). See also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_estimation#Bayesian_point-estimation and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation#Description If you use a uniform prior on a set that contains the MLE, then MAP=MLE always. The reason for this is that under this prior structure, the posterior distribution and the likelihood are proportional.
