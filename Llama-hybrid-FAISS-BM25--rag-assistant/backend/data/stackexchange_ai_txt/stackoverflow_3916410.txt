I am not exactly sure whether the MERCI module has every functionality you want. I ran some tests and it looks pretty good, works even better. It is though available only in the prerelease aplpha 5 version but it should do it's job. To drag and drop. It should not be that difficult to improve the forms using some JQuery as @Fabian suggested.
