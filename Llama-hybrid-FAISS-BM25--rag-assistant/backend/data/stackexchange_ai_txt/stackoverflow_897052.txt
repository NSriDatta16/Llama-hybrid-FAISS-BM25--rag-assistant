We use couchdb in production and have since just before the project went under the Apache umbrella. We use it to store everything that we might otherwise use a dbms, plus all sorts of unstructured data. Personally, I really like how you can just throw all sorts of data into it and use the views to cull what you don't need depending on the situation. The hardest part was moving away from the dbms mindset. We wrote our own migration utils when the storage format changed just to be safe, so that wasn't really a problem. We haven't had any negative experiences yet, but then again we haven't had the setup under any kind of huge load. I think things would work pretty well since we have two slave type servers that replicate from a single master server that gets all of the writes. I'm pretty sure that we don't have to do it that way for replication to work correctly, but it's how we set it up in the beginning and it stuck.
