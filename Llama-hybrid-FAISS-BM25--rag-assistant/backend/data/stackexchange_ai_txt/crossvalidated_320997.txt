Whenever you can do simple random sampling, you would. In fact, when there's just a simple distribution involved, you can often just calculate what you are interested in without doing random sampling. You use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques when that is not possible. One example would be a Bayesian hierarchical model. Very rarely do you know the distribution of the posterior. It will not usually be some known standard distribution (so even if you could derive the distribution, a sampler likely does not exist) and because you lack the normalizing constant of the distribution, but MCMC sampling is possible.
