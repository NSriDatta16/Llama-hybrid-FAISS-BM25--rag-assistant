Coverage tools should only be used to tell you what has not been tested. The scenario you pointed out illustrates why you can't rely on them to show you what code has been tested. Writing tests just so the coverage is 100% is pointless (as you suspected), and it's so easy to game that this isn't really a useful metric. I used to try and stay at or near 100%, but I came to the same conclusion that you did. I was writing tests that didn't really test anything just so the numbers were right. Use the tools to spot areas that you haven't tested yet, then write good tests or accept the fact that those parts of the code aren't critical.
