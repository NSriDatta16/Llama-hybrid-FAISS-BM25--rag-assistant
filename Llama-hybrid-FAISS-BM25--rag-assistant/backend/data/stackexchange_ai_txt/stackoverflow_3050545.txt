BitBucket Wiki: Create a hierarchy structure?

I want to create a hierarchy in my wiki like so: General FooPages Foo1 Foo2 Foo3 ODP Bar Baz I would like to create these pages, and use > table of contents macros to organize them. How can I do that? Do I need to clone and edit the wiki on my own machine, or can I do that exclusively through the web interface?
