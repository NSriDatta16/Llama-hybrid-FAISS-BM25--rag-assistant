Surely you can stash the frame in question in a local variable somewhere? As for actually maximizing the Frame once you've got ahold of it, Frame.setExtendedState(MAXIMIZED_BOTH) is probably what you want. Javadoc While not as elegant as it could be, quick path to ground on your existing code: public Frame getApplicationFrame(ActionEvent event){ if(event.getSource() == null) return null; Window topLevel = SwingUtilities.getWindowAncestor(event.getSource()); if(!(topLevel instanceof Frame)) return null; return (Frame)topLevel; } ... //Somewhere in your code Frame appFrame = getApplicationFrame(myEvent); appFrame.setExtendedState(appFrame.getExtendedState() | Frame.MAXIMIZED_BOTH); ... Minimum Java version 1.4.2. Be forwarned I have not tested the above code, but you should get the idea.
