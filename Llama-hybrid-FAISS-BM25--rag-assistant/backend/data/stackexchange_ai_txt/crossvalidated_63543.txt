How do I go from Labor Statistics results to generalities on the population?

I'm currently looking at survey results from the US bureau of labor statistics concerning hourly wages. With the raw survey data, I get different respondents who state how many hours they work in a week, along with the average pay, and some demographic data like age and sex. How can I go from this information to making an educated guess about the amount of hours have been worked by the entire US population at a certain wage level, for example? Is there some way to "correlate" the values considering more than just a single parameter like age? EDIT: I'm going to try and ask a more specific question then. Please forgive my complete lack of statistics knowledge: Let's say I'm doing a survey about how much people earn in an hour. Based off of my survey, I know that , in my survey sample, men make about \$10 an hour, and women make \$8 an hour. I also know that in the same sample, people under 40 make \$7 an hour on average, and people over 40 make \$11 an hour. Assuming that the population is 50/50 male/female, I can make an educated guess that the population , on average, makes \$9 an hour. Likewise, if %30 of the population is over 40, then I can guess that the population on average makes \$8.20 an hours But how can I "combine" both of these information points? How can I consider both the sex and the age of the people to fit it to the population? Am I just supposed to do a weighted average or something?
