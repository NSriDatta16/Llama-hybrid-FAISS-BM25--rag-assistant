WSS 2.0 - Customizing document library toolbar

I am using Windows Sharepoint Services 2.0 and was looking out for a way to add a new item to the Document Library toolbar along side 'New Document' menu item. I would like to add the menu item for the existing libraries as well as any new libraries created in future. Is this possible? I found that the toolbar items are defined in SCHEMA.xml file. But changing this would affect only the new libraries created right? Also editing this file seems complicated. Appreciate any help. Regards, Jagannath
