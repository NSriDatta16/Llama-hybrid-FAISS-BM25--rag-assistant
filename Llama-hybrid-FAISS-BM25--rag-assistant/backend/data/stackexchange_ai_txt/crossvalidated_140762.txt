If you find Hamilton too difficult then there is Econometric Modeling: A Likelihood Approach (Princeton Uni Press) by Bent Nielsen and David Hendry. It focuses more on intuition and practical how-tos than deeper theory. So if you're on a time constraint then that would be a good approach. I would still recommend to persevere with Time Series Analysis by Hamilton. It is very deep mathematically and the first four chapters will keep you going for a long time and serve as a very strong introduction to the topic. It also covers Granger non-causality and cointegration and if you decide to pursue this topic more deeply then it is in invaluable resource. For a more intuitive treatment of cointegration, I would also recommend Cointegration, Causality, and Forecasting by Engle and White. Finally for very advanced treatments, there is Soren Johansen's book " Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated VARs " and of course David Hendry's " Dynamic Econometrics ". Among those two, I would think Hendry's is more big-picture oriented and Johansen is pretty hard-going on the math.
