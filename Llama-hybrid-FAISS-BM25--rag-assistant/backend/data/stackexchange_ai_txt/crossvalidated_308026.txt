Extrapolation of Time Series in Python

I have the following plot in time series and would like to extrapolate it to derive a value in X[n+20], for instance. I tried poly fitting it but extrapolation does come out correct that way. Any proposed approaches? The data comes from blood glucose after a meal overtime, it usually starts at some value, say 90mg/dl at mealtime, peaks to 150mg/dl, then decreases down to some value which can be less than the intial 90mg/dl. Since we have several post-meal signals which all start at different values, we aligned them by substracting the offset so that we can derive a general curve fit for them all, of course it will only be an approximation and that is fine. x is time. \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0. \\ 5 & 4.3 \\ 10 & 12.7 \\ 15 & 22.1 \\ 20 & 32.6 \\ 25 & 41. \\ 30 & 47.8 \\ 35 & 50. \\ 40 & 51.9 \\ 45 & 52. \\ 50 & 51.2 \\ 55 & 45.4 \\ 60 & 43.4 \\ 65 & 39.9 \\ 70 & 40.2 \\ 75 & 35.4 \\ 80 & 30.2 \\ 85 & 27.9 \\ 90 & 25. \\ 95 & 19.6 \\ 100 & 15.8 \\ 105 & 13.9 \\ 110 & 9.1 \\ 115 & 4. \\ 120 & 1.6 \\ 125 & -1.4 \\ 130 & -4. \\ 135 & -5.6 \\ 140 & -6.8 \\ 145 & -7.7 \\ 150 & -8.6 \\ 155 & -10.4 \\ 160 & -10.9 \\ 165 & -10.9 \\ 170 & -10.2 \\ 175 & -10.2 \\ 180 & -10.3 \\ 185 & -10.7 \\ \end{array}
