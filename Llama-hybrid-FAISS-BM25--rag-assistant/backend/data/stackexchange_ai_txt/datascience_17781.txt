How can I handle missing categorical data that has significance?

I have a data set that is highly categorical and has a lot of missing values. For instance: i | A_foo | A_bar | A_baz | outcome --+-------+-------+-------+-------- 0 | nan | nan | nan | 1 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 2 | nan | nan | nan | 0 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 The problem is that 1 and 0 have a different meaning that nan. I don't want to impute the data because assigning values of 0 or 1 will bias my data, but many machine learning algorithms will not work on a dataset with missing values. How can I handle this?
