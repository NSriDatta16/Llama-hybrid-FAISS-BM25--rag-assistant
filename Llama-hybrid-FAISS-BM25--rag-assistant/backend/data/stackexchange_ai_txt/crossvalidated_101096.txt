Using PyMC to obtain the posterior for the parameters of a parametric model?

I am a newbie with pyMC and I want to program an MCMC sampling for a complicated problem. I have a function given by in the following: $$g(r,c,\theta_1,\theta_2)=\frac{\delta_c}{\Sigma x^2}\log{\frac{x}{2}}$$ The parameter $\Sigma$ and $\delta_c$ and $x$ are given by $$\Sigma(z)=\frac{const*z+\sqrt z}{(1+z)^2}$$ $$\delta_c=\frac{c}{\log(1+c)-c}$$ $$x=\frac{c\sqrt{\theta_1^2+\theta_2^2}}{r}$$ The free parameters which I would like to find their posterior probabilities are $r$, $c$ and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, while for $r$ the prior is exponential , $c$ has lognormal prior and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ have uniform priors. My main problem is how to define the model, because for each of point in data set I have a probability distribution for parameter $z$ which I would like to marginalize over and I don't know how it should be done. I have written so far the following piece of code, I have written a class for $g$ : import pymc as pm import g_class import numpy as np import math import random from scipy.stats import expon data=np.loadtxt('test.cat') #my data for i in range(len(data[:,0])): if (i t1_h) or (value t2_h) or (value The problem is that when I define my model as Deterministic and use observation to construct the model, I get the error message that theta is not defined properly as a parent . I am wondering, how could I include theta ?
