Yes it can. A common approach is to embed each multi dimensional feature separately into one vector, and then continue with these vectors into the main RNN, LSTM network. Examples for how to reduce multi dimensional input features into one vector: Embed each input separately and do average embedding or weighted average embedding. Use attention in order to get a learned weighted average of the embedding to get one vector. Put the feature into another RNN\LSTM cell, and extract the last layer as the result for the reduced vector. Put the features in to a subnet of dense layers and take the final layer as the result for the reduced vector. As an example, questionnaire on quality, you can make an embedding for $x_1$ and $x_2$ separately, then use average embedding or use one of the above methods, this will give you one vector that will represent the, questionnaire on quality, and then you can pass this vector along with other inputs into main RNN.
