persisting persistence; or moving legacy webapp to non-relational store

Suppose you have a huge app with a data access layer bound to SQL You want to provide other non-sql DAL, for instance a GoogleAppEngine instance or XML-based backup. How would you approach this migration to a different storage paradigm but with limited flexibility, since it is legacy. I might be missing info here, but One solution I have in mind is to first rewrite the current legacy DAL into a standard API base, for instance JDO; from there, interfacing with any storage would be a matter of time based on the technology-specific learning curve. AND OR NAND?
