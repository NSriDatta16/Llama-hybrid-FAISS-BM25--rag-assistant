Non-independence of data points a problem when only doing model comparison?

I have a dataset that behaves sort of like time series data. It's 150 measurements in ~15000 individuals, with each measurement either a 0 or a 1 (failure or success). In addition, for each individual, I have a single measurement for a particular quantitative variable Z. I want to know 1) if the distribution in time of successful trials depends on Z 2) if any such effect is merely additive or if there is an interaction between time and Z. At the moment, I have fit three binary logistic regression GAMs. 1) success ~ time 2) success ~ time + Z 3) success ~ time * Z. Using AIC, I have determined that 3 is the best model. However, I know that my approach is erroneous. I am modelling each trial as an independent data point although in actuality, it is not, as individuals that have successes at one time point are also more likely to have successes at other time points. My question is, does this matter if I'm only doing model comparison? As in, if I was interested in parameter estimates, then of course this would be a bad approach. But if I'm just comparing between models, given that all of the models share this defect, it shouldn't matter for the comparison, right? I know that ideally, I should fit a multi-level model but with 15000 individuals, it just becomes very computationally expensive (especially as the relationship between time and the response variable is non-linear) and I'm not sure I would get much out of it. Any help is greatly appreciated!
