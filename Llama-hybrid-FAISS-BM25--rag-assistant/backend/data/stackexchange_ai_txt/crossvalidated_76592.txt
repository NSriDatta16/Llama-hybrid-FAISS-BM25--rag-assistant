Forest is an ensemble method of trees. So I think your question is more based on the algorithm of trees about splitting variables. There is two kind of categorical predictor, ordered factor, and not ordered factor. Ordered factor is similar to numeric variable and the random forest will find the cut point, while the latter one is used another algorithm as below. It will try to catch first level of the factor out as the split and try to fit the model and find the performance with loss function. Then try to find the second level and fit it again and find the performance and so on. In the end, it find the best splitting level combinations according to the best performance. So you will find that it takes a much longer while and memory for trees model or random forest model to fit factors than numeric.
