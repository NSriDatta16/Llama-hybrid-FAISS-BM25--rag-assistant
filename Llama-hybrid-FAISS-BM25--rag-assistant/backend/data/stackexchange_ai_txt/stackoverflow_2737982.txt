No. Don't do this for a few reasons: I think it's a bad idea. [More on this below.] It cannot be done. Multiple apps cannot be installed as a result of one application being downloaded. Some apps act like bundles of apps, but what they really are is a bunch of mini-apps built into a larger one. I highly discourage this sort of bundling. There are a lot of apps out there that say, “51 Tools All-In-One, Only $1.99!”, but these are incredibly trashy and are bought by unsuspecting noobs with no taste. Don't contribute to that.
