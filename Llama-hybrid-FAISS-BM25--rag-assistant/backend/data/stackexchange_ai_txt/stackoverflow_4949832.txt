try plural "posters" in your routes file: resources :events do member do get :posters end end The downloads_files_for method assumes the plural attachment name in the URL; see: https://github.com/patshaughnessy/paperclip/blob/master/lib/paperclip/storage/database.rb#L190 If you want to use "poster" and not "posters" in the URL then you'll have to write the controller action yourself manually. Basically it's just Event.find... and then call send_data with Event.poster.file_contents and pass the type and filename also. Did this fix it? - pat
