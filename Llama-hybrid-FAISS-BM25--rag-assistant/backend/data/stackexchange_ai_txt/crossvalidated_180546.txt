Random forest regression - residuals correlated with response

I am trying to use Random Forest regression. I have a response variable: y = rnorm(10000, mean=0, sd=3) And a few predictor variables (which are just the response with added noise): x = data.frame(v1=y + rnorm(10000, mean=0, sd=3), v2=y + rnorm(10000, mean=0, sd=3), v3=y + rnorm(10000, mean=0, sd=3)) I build the random forest: r = randomForest(x, y) The model is good, explaining ~73% of the variance. However, when I look at the residuals: plot(y, y - r$predicted) Instead of being centered around zero, they are correlated with the response variable. It seems that the model should correct this. Maybe, since each OOB prediction is an average, this behavior is some kind of "regression to the mean"? Does anyone know why this happens? Is anything I can do about it? I am trying to build a model and use the residuals to estimate something. Right now, they are useless because they only reflect the value I'm trying to predict. If anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it!
