Telerik makes purpose-built tools for ASP.NET MVC, as Robert noted. The Telerik Extensions for ASP.NET MVC have been built from the ground-up to embrace the MVC platform, meaning: They're based on jQuery They work with any MVC ViewEngine (including the new Razor) They easily integrate with Controllers / Actions They're open source! You can visit the online demos , or you can read more on Telerik.com: http://www.telerik.com/mvc This is by far the best way to build rich MVC Views, but if you are set on using the RadControls for ASP.NET AJAX in MVC, that can be done. The approach has drawbacks since the RadControls are built for WebForms, but you can find an example implementation here: http://demos.telerik.com/mvc/Home/Help Hope that helps.
