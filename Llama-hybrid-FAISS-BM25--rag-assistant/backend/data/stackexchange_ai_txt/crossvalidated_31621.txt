Autocorrelation from multiple time series samples

I have multiple samples of a time series (for example, the time series might be minutely samples from 12am to 3pm, and I have that for ten different days) and I'd like to compute the autocorrelation function $\rho(k)$ together with confidence intervals. I can think of two "obvious" things to do: Chain all of the samples together end-to-end and compute the autocorrelation function and confidence intervals for the combined sample. Compute the autocorrelation function for each sample individually. Average the values pointwise to get the total autocorrelation function, and apply a square root rule to get the confidence intervals. Both of these have disadvantages. Option (1) will have artifacts from where I have joined together the time series, which will become more import as I compute $\rho(k)$ for large $k$. Option (2) seems too ad-hoc - I wouldn't know whether to believe my confidence intervals. Is there a canonical or correct way to do this?
