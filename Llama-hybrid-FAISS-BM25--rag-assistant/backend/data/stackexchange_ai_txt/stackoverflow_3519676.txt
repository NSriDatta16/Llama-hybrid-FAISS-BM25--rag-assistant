IIOP Client Authentication and ProgrammaticLogin in Glassfish v3

In Glassfish v2 I secure my JNDI lookups by enabling the "IIOP Client Authentication" checkbox in the admin console under the ORB node. In my standalone client I then perform a "ProgrammaticLogin", which then allows me to do JNDI lookups. In Glassfish v3 however, I get this error if want to do any JNDI lookups in the same setup: 18.08.2010 14:31:10 com.sun.enterprise.transaction.JavaEETransactionManagerSimplified initDelegates INFO: Using com.sun.enterprise.transaction.jts.JavaEETransactionManagerJTSDelegate as the delegate org.omg.CORBA.NO_PERMISSION: ----------BEGIN server-side stack trace---------- org.omg.CORBA.NO_PERMISSION: vmcid: 0x0 minor code: 0 completed: No I am pretty sure the "ProgrammaticLogin" works in general, since it allows me to do remote method calls on my secured EJB's (using @RolesAllowed but if the IIOP Client Auth is turned off). The user I login with is a simple user that I created for the "file" realm. Any ideas, why the ProgrammticLogin fails to work in Glassfish v3 for authorizing JNDI lookups? Or what is the correct way to authenticate with the ORB from a standalone client; for this purpose?
