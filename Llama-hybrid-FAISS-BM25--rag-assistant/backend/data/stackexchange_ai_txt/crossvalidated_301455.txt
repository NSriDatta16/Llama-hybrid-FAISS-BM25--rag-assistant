I believe you are talking about class weighted SVM implementations that will give higher penalty to misclassified labels belonging to smaller class. This definitely is preferred over Logistic regression which carries no such notion of assigning weights. The issue you mention is called unbalanced classes, not skewed data. Also, in such cases, I would suggest you to focus on recall metric also.
