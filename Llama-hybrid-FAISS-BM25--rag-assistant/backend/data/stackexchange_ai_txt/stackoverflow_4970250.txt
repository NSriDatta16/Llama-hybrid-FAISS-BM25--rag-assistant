Is there a way to prevent browser from sending a specific cookie?

I'm storing some preference data in cookies. However, I just noticed that this data gets sent to the server with every request. Is there a way to prevent that from happening? A friend tipped off web storage, but this still leaves IE6/7 without a solution.
