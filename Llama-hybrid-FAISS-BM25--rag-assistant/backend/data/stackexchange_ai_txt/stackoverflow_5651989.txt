Click: Pragmatic approach added much underrated command mode and :global Update Fixed after a correct comment. It happened with whitespace-only lines containing Tab -character(s)... sry bout that. :g#\v[^\s\t]#normal vipJ How does that work for you? (perhaps replacing vipJ -> vipgJ if you like) Update Here is one that not uses normal mode (inspired by Peter's comment) The big benefit is that it reuses the same pattern in negative and positive sense; That way it can be genericized to :let @/='\v^\s*$' :v//.,//-1 join Now the second line shows the simplicity of the this approach (for every nonmatching line, join up until the next matching line). The best thing is that you can use any odd search pattern instead Of course you could write this particular task as one line, but it wouldn't quite be as elegant: :v#\v^\s*$#.,//-1 join
