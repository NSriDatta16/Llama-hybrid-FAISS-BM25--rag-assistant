Neural Networks - Back Propagation and Perceptrons

While studying about neural networks (still on basics - not Deep Learning etc.,) two questions came on my mind. What is the reason for replacing the hard limiter function in the nodes of the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with smoother ones? Does the Back propagation algorithm always find the best possible solution for the classification problem at hand?
