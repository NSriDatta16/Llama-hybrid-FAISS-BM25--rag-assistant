The last time I saw this problem, the issue was that the webserver didn't have enough memory. Magento checks to see whether it has enough memory to create the new image w/ GD before creating it, and will use the default image instead if this isn't the case. Try increasing the memory available to PHP and see if it solves the problem. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
