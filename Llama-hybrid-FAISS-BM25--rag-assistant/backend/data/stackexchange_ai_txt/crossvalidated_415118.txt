Your time series is really strange with a staircase effect where it shift from different means at different times. I'd suggest an ARIMA modeling in this particular case when it comes to series like that that are purely shift + stay at the mean for a long time. But since your series isn't obviously stationary, don't forget to work on a differentiate serie.
