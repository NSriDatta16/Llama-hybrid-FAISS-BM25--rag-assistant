The closest thing I could find is Amelia's prior information inclusion. See chapter 4.7 in the vignette , specifically 4.7.2: Observation-level priors Researchers often have additional prior information about missing data values based on previous research, academic consensus, or personal experience. Amelia can incorporate this information to produce vastly improved imputations. The Amelia algorithm allows users to include informative Bayesian priors about individual missing data cells instead of the more general model parameters, many of which have little direct meaning. The incorporation of priors follows basic Bayesian analysis where the imputation turns out to be a weighted average of the model-based imputation and the prior mean, where the weights are functions of the relative strength of the data and prior: when the model predicts very well, the imputation will down-weight the prior, and vice versa (Honaker and King, 2010). The priors about individual observations should describe the analyst's belief about the distribution of the missing data cell. This can either take the form of a mean and a standard deviation or a condence interval. For instance, we might know that 1986 tari rates in Thailand around 40%, but we have some uncertainty as to the exact value. Our prior belief about the distribution of the missing data cell, then, centers on 40 with a standard deviation that re ects the amount of uncertainty we have about our prior belief. To input priors you must build a priors matrix with either four or five columns. Each row of the matrix represents a prior on either one observation or one variable. In any row, the entry in the rst column is the row of the observation and the entry is the second column is the column of the observation. In the four column priors matrix the third and fourth columns are the mean and standard deviation of the prior distribution of the missing value. So while you won't be able to generally say something like x1 , you could loop over your data set and add an observation-level prior for each relevant case. Constant bounds can also be applied (such as setting x1, x2, and x3 to be non-negative). For example: priors = matrix(NA, nrow=0, ncol=5); for (i in seq(1, length(data))) { x1 = data$x1[i]; x2 = data$x2[i]; x3 = data$x3[i]; if (is.na(x1) && !is.na(x2) && !is.na(x3)) { priors = rbind(priors, c(i, 1, 0, x2+x3, 0.999999)) } } amelia(data, m=1, bound = rbind(c(1, 0, Inf), c(2, 0, Inf), c(3, 0, Inf)), pr = priors);
