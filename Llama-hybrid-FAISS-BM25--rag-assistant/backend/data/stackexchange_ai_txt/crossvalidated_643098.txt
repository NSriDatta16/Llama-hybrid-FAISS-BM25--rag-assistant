Where is your notation from? $F$ is a poor choice to represent a link function which is different from a CDF. The "logit" link, $g(x) = \log(x/(1-x))$ , is the link function, together with a binomial variance structure, that defines logistic regression as a special case of a generalized linear model. The inverse of the logit $g^{-1}(x) = \exp(x)/(1-\exp(x))$ is the mapping that transforms the linear predictor, i.e. log-odds of response, into a response probability. The CDF for a binary response is not a continuous function, but rather a step function with the height of the first step corresponding to the probability of a 0 response at $x=0$ and a height of 1 at $x=1$ .
