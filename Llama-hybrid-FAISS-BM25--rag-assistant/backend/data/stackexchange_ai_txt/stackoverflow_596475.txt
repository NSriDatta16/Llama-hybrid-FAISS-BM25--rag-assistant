I was getting the same problem as you, however my experience was a little different. I am on vista x64, my developers are in xp x64...they haven't been having any issues at all. I just upgraded and could not run any unit test for a asp.net MVC project. I was receiving the same 500 error you were receiving. I turned off code coverage, everything magically started working.
