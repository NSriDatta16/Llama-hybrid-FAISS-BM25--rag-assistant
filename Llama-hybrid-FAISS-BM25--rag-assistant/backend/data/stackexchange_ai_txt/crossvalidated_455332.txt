random forest regression with uncertainty output

For a Bayesian optimization problem, I wish to use a random forest regressor in Python, able to predict for unseen data a probability distribution, like in the paper Decision Forests for Classification,Regression, Density Estimation, ManifoldLearning and Semi-Supervised Learning , figure 4.3 page 55 for example. Scikit-learn proposes a random forest regressor but the output is a predicted value with no uncertainty measure. Do you know any packages in Python implementing a random forest regressor able to predict a value for unseen data as well as some uncertainty over it (in the form of a probability distribution, or confidence interval) ?
