The template for Slider includes a Thumb, which raises the ThumbDragDelta event as the mouse is moved. Slider will always update the bound value immediately when it receives a ThumbDragDelta event. The trick is to stop this event. The easiest way is to subclass Slider: public class SliderIgnoreDelta : Slider { protected override void OnThumbDragDelta(DragDeltaEventArgs e) { // Do nothing } } This slider will not update the value until the thumb drag completes. Another solution is to intercept the ThumbDragDelta event on the Thumb. If you happen to be re-templating the Slider anyway, this might be a better solution. For example if you already have an EventBlocker class coded up that sets Handled true on the given RoutedEvent, you could put this in your template: But for most cases you'll probably want to go with my first solution.
