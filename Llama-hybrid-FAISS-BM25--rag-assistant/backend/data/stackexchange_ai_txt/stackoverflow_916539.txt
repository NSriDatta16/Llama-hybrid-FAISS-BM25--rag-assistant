Firstly, you need to pick one methodology and stick with it. Having one developer do things one way and others do it in a diametrically opposite way is asking for trouble before you even start. Secondly you need to throw away the idea of an identical experience in every browser - if that's hard to grasp then think of it this way: A browser is only a single way for your users to consume your content. Are you also planning on offering an identical experience to every person visitng your site using a mobile browser? or a text based browser? Or a screen reader? What about IE5? What about the thousands and thousands of user-agents available to your users? It's not all bad news. There are a lot of resources out there that can help with getting layout correct using CSS and plently more that can help with the bugs inherent in IE.
