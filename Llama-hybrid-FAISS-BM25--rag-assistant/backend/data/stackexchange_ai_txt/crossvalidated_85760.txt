For completeness, the reference to Said & Dickey (1984), who converted an ARMA to a long AR prior to the test, is not a full story. Hall (1989) criticized Said & Dickey (1984) because the order of the long AR model will increase with the sample size, leading to loss of degrees of freedom. He used an instrumental variable technique to improve on Said & Dickey (1984) and Phillips & Perron (1988), who earlier proposed an alternative modification. Li (1995) studied the power of the instrumental variable tests. This is from section 11.2 of Howell Tong's Personal Journey through Time Series in Biometrika , where modifications and extensions of the Dickey-Fuller test developed in Biometrika are reviewed.
