extend element height by sliding (as opposed to abruptly expanding)

i would like to expand the height of the box when it is clicked on. $(this).find("textarea").css("height","2.6em").focus(); The code above expands the box, but does so abruptly. How can i make it do so in a sliding manner that is much more elegant?
