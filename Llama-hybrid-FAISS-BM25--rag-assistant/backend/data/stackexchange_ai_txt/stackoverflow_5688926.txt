code was working, but suddenly stopped working

This code opens a text file, then checks to see if each word in the text file Exists in a another large 2MB dictionary file. If it does exist, it stores the line from the dictionary file into a variable. The code was working, but then began to generate Server 500 errors, and now It only lists about 7 matches and then loads nothing forever. It used to list the 1000's of matches and then stop. $file_handle = fopen("POSdump.txt", "r"); while (!feof($file_handle)) { $line = fgets($file_handle); $words= explode(" ", $line ); foreach ($words as $word) { $word = preg_replace('#[^\w+>\s\':-]#', ' ', $word); $subwords= explode(" ", $word ); $rawword = $subwords[0]; $poscode = $subwords[1]; $rawword = strtoupper($rawword); $handle = fopen("dictionary.txt","r"); // if ($handle) { while (!feof($handle)) { $buffer = fgets($handle, 4096); if (preg_match('#\b'.$rawword.'\b#',$buffer)) { echo $rawword; echo " "; } } } } } ?>
