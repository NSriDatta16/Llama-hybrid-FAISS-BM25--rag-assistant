Is multicollinearity a problem when fitting a Bayesian regression model using ADVI?

If I’m fitting a bayesian regression model using ADVI, is it important to ensure all the covariates are uncorrelated with each other? I have a vague understanding that ADVI doesn’t play well with correlations in the posterior, and my understanding is that multicollinearity should produce correlation between the posterior estimates of the coefficients.
