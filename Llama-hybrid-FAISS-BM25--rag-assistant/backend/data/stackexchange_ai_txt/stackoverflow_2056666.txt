Using iPhone touch & drag interface for intuitive List creation

1) I want to create a List by touch and dragging icons from a Master List. 2) Also have the ability to Delete items in this newly created List or Rearrange their order. Is there some code sample one could look at or possible design pointers on cleanly accomplish this functionality. I realize UITableView could accomplish this. But doing it visually in a single screenful is intuitive as it maintains the overall context of the task at hand. Thanks
