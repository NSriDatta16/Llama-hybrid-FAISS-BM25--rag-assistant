Not in Vista; see Vista problems page at TortoiseSVN: The Windows explorer in Vista has changed quite a bit, and one of those changes was to abandon the additional columns but introduce a new "property system". Since the property system is file type based, we can't add a column for Subversion information anymore :( It's doable in XP; see TortoiseSVN doc : Simply right click on one of the headings of a column, choose More... from the context menu displayed. A dialog will appear where you can specify the columns and their order, which is displayed in the “Detailed View”. Scroll down until the entries starting with SVN come into view. Check the ones you would like to have displayed and close the dialog by pressing OK. The columns will be appended to the right of those currently displayed. You can reorder them by drag and drop, or resize them, so that they fit your needs.
