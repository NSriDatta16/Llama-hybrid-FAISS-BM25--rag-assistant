It sounds like you're on the right track. Your problem is essentially the same problem I have, and I've designed mine in much the same way as you described - Windows service hosting three WCF services (to date) and a front-end application for the user to use for interacting with the WCF services locally or remotely. If the logical divisions that you describe are truly independent of one another, then having each one of them be its own WCF service module makes a lot of sense. However, if there is some overlap (for example, the configuration service needs to interact with the network information service in some way), then I would impose the logical divisions at the WCF contract level, not necessarily as completely separate WCF modules. It'll make things a little easier to deal with inside the Windows service. If you do not have Juval Lowy's book, Programming WCF Services , I would highly encourage you to get a copy. It is THE great WCF reference book. You can also visit his site, IDesign.net , for a lot of freely available WCF code examples.
