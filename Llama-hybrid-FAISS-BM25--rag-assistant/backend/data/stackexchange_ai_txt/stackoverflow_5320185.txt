how does it work that the leaf nodes only hold pixels? Why dont the other nodes hold pixels? This depends on what you're using the Quadtree for. You can link any kind of information to the other nodes, f.e. a pointer to the upper-left corner and the width/height of the rectangle this node describes, but you won't need it in most cases (or need things like the average values you can precompute to speed things up). And how do we know how many times to subdivide our original root node to represent that given image? With every subdivision, you half the width and height of a region, so for a square image of size n you'll need to subdivide log2(n) times, for a non-square image of size n*m you'll need at most max(log2(n), log2(m)) steps.
