Can I use the principal components of control variables in regression?

I am running a logistic regression and one of my control variables is categorical with $100$ categories. This leads to problems because some categories have $3$ data points, out of tens of thousands. The outcome is the success rate in $N$ trials, where each data point has a different $N$ . Some categories have $0$ success rates, often because the $N$ is small and they have very few data points. I have read about using principal components for prediction but that's not what I am trying to do. I need the variable as control - what happens if instead I use the principal components whose variance explained sums to a high number, like $95\%$ ? What if I use all of them?
