Using a framebuffer as a vertex buffer without moving the data to the CPU

In OpenGL, is there a way to use framebuffer data as vertex data without moving the data through the CPU? Ideally, a framebuffer object could be recast as a vertex buffer object directly on the GPU. I'd like to use the fragment shader to generate a mesh and then render that mesh.
