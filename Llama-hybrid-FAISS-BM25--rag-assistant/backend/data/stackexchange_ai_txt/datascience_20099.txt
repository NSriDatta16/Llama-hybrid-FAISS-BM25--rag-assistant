Excel can be an excellent tool for exploratory data analysis it really depends on your needs and of course it has its limitations like any tool, but excel definitely deserves a place in the data science hall of fame. Worth remembering that in practice most users will be exploring a heavily reduced data set anyway (created from an SQL query). Excel is powerful for exploring data when you use the "table" object in combination with pivot tables, visualising is all 1-2 clicks max and a lot of excel charts in powerpoint look great, unless your looking to create something very bespoke e.g. in a scientific computing context. The interactive nature means you can explore rapidly. The benefits of the "table" object is that as you transform the data further in excel to enable you to explore new distributions the pivot tables all remember the variable. Where excel is weak is that the formula list is arguably limiting, for instance a SQL case statement or python statment is way more flexible than an endless chain of if functions. It really depends on your needs but excel definitely deserves a place in the data science hall of fame. Interesting anecdote, the team who work on the Facebook newsfeed algorithm can all regularly be seen to be playing with excel and lots of spreadsheets.
