Predicting the increase/decrease of number

I have these entries in my database that looks like this: ItemID Number Time 14 1.74 "2014-12-21 17:13:29" 14 1.73 "2014-12-21 17:13:30" 78 2.55 "2014-12-21 17:17:11" 78 2.56 "2014-12-21 17:18:12" For each item I have an entry for each second for a a period of ~5 minutes. So each item has ~300 data entries. All in all I have thousands of items, therefore lets say 300 000 entries. I would like to know in average, is there a tendency that the Number within these 5 minutes will rather drop or increase over all these items and how strong is this tendency . I can see it visually that one items number does fall or increase, but what algorithm should I use to find it out over all of these items? I am not strong in maths, but I was googling about it, and found out about regression, but not sure how to exactly use it. Can you give me a hint or suggestion, which algorithm I should use to analyze this data?
