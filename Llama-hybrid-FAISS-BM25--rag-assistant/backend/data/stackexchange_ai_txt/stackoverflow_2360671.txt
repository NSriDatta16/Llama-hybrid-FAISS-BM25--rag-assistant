As Robert Harvey said, you can look it up from database, but you could also store it in Session: [HttpGet] public ActionResult ShowQuestion(int id) { var questionModel = new QuestionViewData(); //populate questionModel Session["CurrentlyHandledQuestion"] = questionModel; return View(questionModel); } [HttpPost] public ActionResult ManageAnswer(params) { var questionModel = (QuestionViewData)Session["CurrentlyHandledQuestion"]; } Session data can be lost in many situations, so you should think about situation when questionModel is not available anymore in POST action, but it will work ok most of the time.
