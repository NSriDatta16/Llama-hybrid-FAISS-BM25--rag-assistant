There are several OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0 debugging tools from GPU vendors. Almost these tools require real device, but Imagination Technologies provides an emulation libraries and a tracing tool which you used. Did you use PVRTrace with PVRVFrame? PowerVR (Imagination Technologies) PVRVFrame is an emulation libraries for OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0 on OpenGL. And GL calls can be traced by PVRTrace with GUI. PVRTrace can also connect with Linux ARMv7 devices. Adreno (Qualcomm) Adreno Profiler can trace GL calls with Adreno devices, such as Android with Snapdragon. Nexus One and many devices. It can render GL calls that are executed on the target device. WEBINAR: OPTIMIZE YOUR APP WITH ADRENO PROFILER Tegra (NVIDIA) PerfHUD ES has Frame Debugger as Adreno profiler. It require Tegra Development Kit. Mali (ARM) Mali GPU Performance Analysis Tool . It require Mali device. AFAIK, there are no Mali devices in the consumer market at the moment. (I believe that gDEBugger 5.7 is the best tool for debugging OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0. But it is no longer available...)
