no attribute '_inbound_nodes' error even when using Lambda layer in Keras

I have a (28,000 x 300) dimension matrix, let's call it label_embedding , which I want to do a dot product with the bottleneck layer of my model. I have created an architecture which gives a (batch_size x 300) at its bottleneck layer. I am using a generator function for input. The label_embedding matrix is taken as input in the following way: inp7 = Input(tensor=labels_embeddings) And for the dot product I am doing the following: out = Lambda(dot_)([x1, K.transpose(inp7)]) where x1 is the bottleneck layer and dot_ is: def dot_(tensors): return K.dot(tensors[0], tensors[1]) The problem is that even though the shape of the out variable is correct, that is, (batch_size x 28000) , I get the following error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_inbound_nodes' P.S.: I am using tensorflow and keras P.S.: I have been using keras layers until the out variable where I use keras backend as K
