I would estimate a PCA on the Ys and regress X against the factors that explain the most significant amount of the variation of each of the Ys. Based on your comment, however, a classical PCA may be problematic since you have significantly more variables than observations. Asymptotic PCA a la Connor and Korajczyk (1986) might be a better choice. There are other variations on PCA that may be appropriate (like probabilistic PCA).
