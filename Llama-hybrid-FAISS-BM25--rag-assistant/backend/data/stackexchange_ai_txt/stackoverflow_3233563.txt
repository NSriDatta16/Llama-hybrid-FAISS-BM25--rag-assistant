Generally speaking, when you have a lot of if/else-if's, you consider replacing them with a switch/case statement. http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/switch.shtml Now, this wouldn't necessarily be appropriate for your situation, as the type of seat is a separate condition from its position (front/middle/back).
