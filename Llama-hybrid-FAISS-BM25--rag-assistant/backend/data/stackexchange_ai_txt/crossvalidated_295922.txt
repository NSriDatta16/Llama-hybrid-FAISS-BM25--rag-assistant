The problem with your data set is called Complete separation of the data. The likelihood associated to logistic regression models is concave, provided that there is no complete separation of the data. The phenomenon of complete separation of the data is defined and discussed in: Albert, Adelin, and J. A. Anderson. "On the existence of maximum likelihood estimates in logistic regression models." Biometrika 71.1 (1984): 1-10. It has also been discussed in this site: How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression?
