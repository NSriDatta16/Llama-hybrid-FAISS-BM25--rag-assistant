From a personal experience, I started with a random direction of each undirected arc and then measured the arc strength using the arc.strength() function. Finally, I compared the score with the score of the opposite direction. The higher negative values are better. Note that when the direction is changed not only the score of that arc changes but also the score of other arcs might change. In this case you have two options, either compare the average score of all arcs or only the arc that you are interested in. In some cases you might end up with a graph that contains cycles. In this situation you are forced to choose the other direction.
