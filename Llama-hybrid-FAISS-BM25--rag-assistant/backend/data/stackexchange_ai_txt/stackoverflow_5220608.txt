In my opinion you are wasting your time. The technology is not prepared for that. If you want duplex communication with clients use Publish/subscribe pattern. If you want just server to call clients expose service on clients and user server as client of that services. Why? It will save you enormous amount of time and budget It will work - it is tested by thousands of real world solutions People will understand it and help you if you have troubles. If you really need to follow your scenarion give up with WCF and use other programming model - probably sockets directly. Edit: Ok if you still want to use duplex service I have this idea: Use WsDualHttpBinding when agent is not behind firewall Use PollingDualHttpBinding when agent is behind firewall - to get this binding you must install Silverlight 4 SDK. It is in separate assembly System.ServiceModel.PollingDuplex.dll. You must register binding as new binding extension if you want to use it in config file.
