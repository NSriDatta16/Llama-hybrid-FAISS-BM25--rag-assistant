In average, the more complete and helpful the web framework is, the more limiting it is when you try to do things another way than the way the web framework thinks is The Right Way. Some web frameworks try to be very helpful and still not restrictive, and some do that better than others. And the general recommendation there is: Don't fight the framework. You will lose. So it's important to chose a framework that helps you with the things you want to do, but doesn't enforce anything else. For your webservice case, this should not be a problem. There are tons of minimalistic web frameworks out there, at least in the Python world (which is all I care about). Bobo, BFG, Pylons, Werkzeug, etc, etc. None of these will get in your way one bit. Also don't forget that you often can use several frameworks together by having them run side by side. Especially using techniques such as Dexterity/XDV. Plone.org for example is mostly Plon (duh) an excellent content management system, but extremely restrictive if you want to do something else. So part of the site is Trac, the excellent Python bug tracker. It's all integrated to look the same.
