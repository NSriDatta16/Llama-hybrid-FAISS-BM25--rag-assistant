kCGErrorFailure while performing drag and drop in NSView

I have created a simple drag and drop application in which I am sometimes getting this exception msg, displayed in debugger console: kCGErrorRangeCheck: CGSNewWindowWithOpaqueShape: Cannot create window kCGErrorFailure: Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged. kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSMoveWindow: Invalid window 0x0 kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSOrderWindowList kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSOrderWindowList kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowBounds: NULL window kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSMoveWindow: Invalid window 0x0 kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSOrderWindowList kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowBounds: NULL window Can anyone suggest me why is it occurring and how can I resolve it? Also can anyone suggest how to set breakpoint for @CGErrorBreakpoint() so that I can debug and trace its cause? The code in concludeDragOperation is: NSPoint dropLocation = [sender draggedImageLocation]; id dragSource = [sender draggingSource]; NSPasteboard *pb = [sender draggingPasteboard]; NSData *draggedData = [pb dataForType:IconDragDataType]; id unarchievedObject = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:draggedData]; [unarchievedObject setFrameOrigin:dropLocation]; Thanks, Miraaj
