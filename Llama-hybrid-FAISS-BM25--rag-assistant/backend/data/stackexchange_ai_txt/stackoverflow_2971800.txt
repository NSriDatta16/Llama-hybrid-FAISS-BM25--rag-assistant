you could try doing the insert like insert into mytable(col1,col2,col3) select 1,2,3 union all select 4,5,6 on the chance you're using sql server 2008 or better you could also do something like this: INSERT INTO MyTable (FirstCol, SecondCol) VALUES ('First',1), ('Second',2), ('Third',3), ('Fourth',4), ('Fifth',5) this generally is much more efficient, though i'm not sure if you mean that the drag is on reading the file or inserting individual records.
