Is there a pluggable tree app for Django with a good admin?

Or asked the other way: is there a good pluggable admin for any existing tree apps? I've been trying to find a good way to handle hierarchal data in a Django app. django-mptt and django-treebeard both seem to work well enough for the infrastructure, but the admin options I've found are either broken, don't allow any sort of easy reordering or depend on installing a large external CMS. All I want is an admin list view that shows the hierarchy and allows some sort of reordering (drag n drop optional, I'll settle for up/down arrows!).
