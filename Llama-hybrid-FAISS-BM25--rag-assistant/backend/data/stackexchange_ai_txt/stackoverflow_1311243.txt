Just some answers off the top of my head (since I deal with low-level disk structure a lot): You can just use a good hex editor that will let you write directly to a disk (such as HxD ), or roll your own app that uses the CreateFile API (or the Linux equivalent). You can check out something like BartPE , which allows you to make a bootable XP image on a USB device. USB drives are 99% FAT. Linux does indeed support FAT natively for reading USB mass storage.
