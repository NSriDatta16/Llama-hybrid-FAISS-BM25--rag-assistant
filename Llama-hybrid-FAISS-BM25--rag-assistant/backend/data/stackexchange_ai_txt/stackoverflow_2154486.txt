How should I include a remote page fragment in php in a performant way?

I'm working on a site in Drupal which will reside at http://sub.clientdomain.com , pulling in an static html fragment from a server on at http://clientdomain.com/path/to/fragment.html , which I need to display in a page, to give a parent menu for a site. I'm working on a VPS, so I have access to curl, wget and pretty much anything I want to install. What's the optimal way to do this?
