Basic database (MongoDB) performance question

I'm building a web app for bookmark storage with a directory system. I've already got these collections set up: Path(s) ---> Directories (embedded documents) ---> Links (embedded documents) User(s) So performance wise, should I: - add the user id to the created path - embed the whole Paths collection into the specific user I want to pick option 2, but yeah, I dunno... EDIT: I was also thinking about making the whole interface ajaxified. So, that means I'll load the directories and links from a specific path (from the logged in user) through ajax. That way, it's faster and I don't have to touch the user collection. Maybe that changes things? Like I've said in the comments, 1 huge collection in the whole database seems kinda strange. Right?
