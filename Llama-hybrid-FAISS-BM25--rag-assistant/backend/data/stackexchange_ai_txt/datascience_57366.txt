Is it valid to compare SHAP values across models?

Let's say I have three models: a random forest with 100 trees a random forest with 1000 trees an xgboost model. I can rank the importance of my features on my dataset for each model using SHAP, and compare relative importance across models. What is not clear is whether I can meaningfully compare the actual numerical SHAP values across models. I am using the same features for all models.
