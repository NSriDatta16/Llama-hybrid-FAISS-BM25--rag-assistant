It is explained in the second edition of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction book on page 151: Note that the importance sampling ratio here starts and ends one step later than for n-step TD (7.9). This is because here we are updating a stateâ€“action pair. We do not have to care how likely we were to select the action; now that we have selected it we want to learn fully from what happens, with importance sampling only for subsequent actions.
