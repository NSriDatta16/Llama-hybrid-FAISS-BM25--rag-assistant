We use leading zeroes for some of our references "numbers" where I work and I can't tell you how many wasted hours I've had over the last seven years forcing Excel to treat them as text. Don't do it. Auto-incrementing integers are all well and good for computers, but they greatly reduce human beings ability to spot errors. How important that is will depend on your business. I work with property (housing) related data and our primary reference has the front door embedded in it. It's not elegant but it means that experienced admin staff can spot 90% of minor errors (when we get invoices, etc in) before they get near a database. But in an environment where you're not relying on that kind of process this argument is less compelling. (Now, some folks have strongly warned about using meaningful data in references as it could be changed, and there's some truth in that, but you can be smart. You don't have to pick something obviously fickle like whether the person is married - you can anchor yourself on past events like a character representing the region they first opened a particular account. Even if you don't do that, have some kind of pattern to help communication with customers. I've worked in a number of call centres and people sometimes come to phone with every piece of documentation from birth certificate onwards as they desperately try to find their account/order/customer number. I don't think saying "It'll be a number between 1 and 100 trillion" would be very handy) It's been said, but don't create enormously long references. We're busy people, we haven't got time to be keying in this crap over a phone system and making a mistake on digit 17 only to restart (again). Some of your customers may have disabilities and it's likely a growing number will be over 55+. Once again, watch out for the zeroes. You see purchase order numbers and the like with fourteen digits. How many orders do they think they're going to be placing? If there's going to be any data aggregation outside of your network (and thus not connected to your database) - have some sort of check digit/regular expression pattern which your partners/suppliers can verify they've not made mistakes. One example of this is the UK's electrical supply numbering system (MPAN) is a good example of this - designed for people to maintain their own records without having to download the big list of every electricity meter in the universe to check they've not made a typo.
