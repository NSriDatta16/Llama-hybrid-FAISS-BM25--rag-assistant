best way to import dataset into matlab and organize data into appropriate structure

I have a text file of 10001 lines, where first line contains the name of the attributes and the following lines contain values. The attribute types are mixed (strings and floats) and delimited by '\t'. Does anyone know what is the best way to import such text file into matlab and organize these data into appropriate structure for further analysis? I would like to use these data for some data mining applications so it would be very useful if each column could contain metadata as well (variable type, numeric/categorical value...) Thank you for the suggestions!
