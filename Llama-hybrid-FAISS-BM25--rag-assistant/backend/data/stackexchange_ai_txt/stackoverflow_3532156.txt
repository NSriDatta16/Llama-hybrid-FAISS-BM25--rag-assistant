Secure way to do password retrieval/resetting?

Before I begin, my reason for not using OAuth is I believe it is not really something we should be using on this project, we're targeting a platform that will be packaged and resold to companies, which connect to their own set of uses that we really don't want to have accounts that we are not %100 in control of, we don't want it to be a shared-login with other services, and we don't want to force people into getting a google/yahoo/openID/aol/facebook/blogger/wordpress/whatever account. Now then, What I would like is the best way to let users re-set a password. I hate the concept of secret-questions: What school did you goto? Well, lets check your facebook page. What was your first-grade teacher? Lets just ask them casually. I hate using one-time-passwords via email: Since when is email secure? Your boss reads it. Your sending out spam emails to me every day. It went into your junk-bin. It's not sent encrypted. I don't want to use a password to reset a password either. This just doesn't make sense. I'm really out of ideas here for the best way to do this, so I figure I would ask the community.
