Your first question essentially is a general question of model selection, and there are numerous good answers on the topic on this site. You would have to filter through the large number of threads to identify the most relevant ones, though; these ones are specifically about GARCH. But the fact that you are choosing between EGARCH and GARCH specifically does not make it very different from choosing between some other models, and the same common principles apply. You cannot know which model is preferred before you learn some characteristics of your data. E.g. if you observe asymmetric reactions of volatility to positive and negative shocks, then EGARCH may be more suitable than GARCH (because the answer to your second question is a Yes). Generally, you want a model that adequately describes your data without being too complicated. Formally you may compare models using information criteria such as AIC or you may assess out-of-sample forecasting performance. The answer to your second question is a Yes. You can find a confirmation in any textbook that covers both GARCH and EGARCH, e.g. Tsay "Analysis of Financial Time Series" (3rd ed., 2010, p. 143).
