what does this +/- of "average" mean?

I have a set of data points and I was told that for it to be valid, every data point should be within +/- say 5% of the average of the entire dataset. I have no problem of checking each data point and reach a conclusion if it is valid. My question is, how can I relate above statement to a statistic measure so that I can say, how valid it is. Put in another way, is there any relationship between the +/-5% deviation from average and the dispersion measure such as sd etc? Thanks Oliver
