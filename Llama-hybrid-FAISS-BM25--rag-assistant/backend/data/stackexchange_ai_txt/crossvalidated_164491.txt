GPML generally tunes the hyper-parameters as well as fitting the model, which takes quite a while. This ought to be done for SVMs as well for a like-for-like comparison (SVMs can take a very long time to train depending on the hyper-parameter values). If you are using the minimize function, that probably explains the difference.
