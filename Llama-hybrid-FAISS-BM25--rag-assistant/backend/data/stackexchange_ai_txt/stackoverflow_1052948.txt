This looks like it would get a bit tricky if every component in your view handled the same mouse event. ie, if the user drags item 1 , item 2 would process those events as well? if i understand correctly, you are looking to have this and this.parent and this.parent.parent handle mouse actions on this . in that case the recursion would be up, and not down. you could create an Interface like this: public interface MyInterface() { public void performSpecialAction(Event event); } you then have your containers implement this interface. your components would then need to incorporate this call to their appropriate event handling: public static void performRecursiveUiAction(Component comp, Event event) { if (comp.getParent() == null) { return; } if (comp.getParent() instanceof MyInteface) { ((MyInterface)comp.getParent()).performSpecialAction(event); } ThisUtility.performRecursiveUiAction(comp.getParent(), event); }
