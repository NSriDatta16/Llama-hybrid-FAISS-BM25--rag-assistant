Thirst of all I would recommend to look for a better method, or at least a method with more in-depth description, since the "Distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo" from the paper that you are refering doesn't seem to be clearly stated. The advantages and disadvantages are not well explored. There is a method, that showed up in arxiv quite recently called " Wormhole Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ", I would recommend to check it. Going back to the paper that you gave reference, the remote proposal $R_{i}(\theta_{i})$ is very vaguely discribed. In the application part it is described as "maximum likelihood Gaussian over the preceeding t/2 samples". Maybe this means that you average the last t/2 values of the $i^{th}$ chain? A bit hard to guess with the poor description given in the reference. [UPDATE:] Interaction between several chains and the application of this idea to sample from posterior distribution can be found in parallel MCMC methods, for example here . However, running several chains and forcing them to interact may not fit for the multimodal posterior: for example, if there is a very pronounced region where most of the posterior distribution is concentrated the interaction of the chains may even worsten things by sticking to that specific region and not exploring other, less pronounced, regions/modes. So, I would strongly recommend to look for MCMC specifically designed for multimodal problems. And if you want to create another/new method, then after you know what is available in the "market", you can create more efficient method.
