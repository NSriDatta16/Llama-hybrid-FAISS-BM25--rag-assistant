What is a channel in a CNN?

I was reading an article about convolutional neural networks, and I found something that I don't understand, which is: The filter must have the same number of channels as the input image so that the element-wise multiplication can take place. Now, what I don't understand is: What is a channel in a convolutional neural network? I have tried looking for the answer, but can't understand what is it yet. Can someone explain it to me? Thanks in advance.
