On more of the style side of things, I've always found it easier to maintain other people's code when they've Declared Option 'Explicit' in the Declarations section Declared variables from approximately higher to lower (eg, session before db before view before doc) Prefixed notes objects with their type (docMail, dbMyDatabase, viewOutstandingInvoices) Put all of the Declarations at the top before (helps finding the declaration when you come across a variable) As others have mentioned, break it up into functions/subs where applicable. Your comment about copying this agent for other instances of the same problem also raises a flag. Try to work out what is common between these agents and push those functions into a script library. This sort of thing saves a lot of time when maintaining the code as you don't need to think about in what way each agent is different (Eg. does my change apply to all instances of this agent, or just some of them?)
