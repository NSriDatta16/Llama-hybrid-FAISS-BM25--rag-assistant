I think the other answers do a good job at identifying more or less what Machine Learning is (as they indicate, it can be a fuzzy thing). I will add that Logistic Regression (and its more general multinomial version) is very commonly used as a means of performing classification in artificial neural networks (which I think are unambiguously covered by whatever sensible machine learning definition you choose), and so if you mention Logistic Regression to a neural net person, they are likely to immediately think of it in this context. Getting tied up with a heavy hitter in machine learning is a good way to become a machine learning technique yourself, and I think to some extent that is what happened with various regression techniques, though I wouldn't discount them from being proper machine learning techniques in and of themselves.
