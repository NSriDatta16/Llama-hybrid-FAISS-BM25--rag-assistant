I would also add that LDA is usually preceded by a variable selection step, which basically removes variables that are too correlated (using criterias such as Wilks' lambda/ Fisher's F, Rao's V, etc.). LDA itself is then performed in the selected variable subset. It is also common to perform PCA to compute a higher-level set of variables that you can give to LDA. Before PCA, you usually center-reduce your variables so that the mean is 0 and variance is 1 so they become normalized. PCA then removes the noise added by the correlated variables.
