As far as bullet proof runtimes yes Sagekey is an answer. However another alternative is Albert Kallal's Inno script which checks to see if a version of Access is installed. If not it tells you to install a runtime version of Access. If installed then it continues to install your FE MDE and other assorted files. http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.access/msg/10e3fc9234660872?hl=en Sample inno script which "wraps" the package wizard install into a single .exe http://groups.google.com/group/comp.databases.ms-access/msg/4aa1b33a191bf1f8?hl=en Deploying updates to your software in a Runtime environment for Access 2007 http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/RunTime/InstallExample.htm The only scenario which it wouldn't handle well would be if the user does install Access or a different Access runtime on their system later. However if you ship your product in Access 2000 format the problems are minimized.
