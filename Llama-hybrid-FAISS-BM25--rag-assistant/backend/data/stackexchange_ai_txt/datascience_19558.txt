MSE and time delay relation

I have time series for which I used autocorrelation property and made autoregression model for prediction, with different time delays 0-30. I got diagram which is dependency MSE on time delay 0-30 https://i.stack.imgur.com/JK41F.jpg and I don't know how to explain this discontinuity with the first dot for which delay is 0 and MSE is equal 0?
