Android asking for unneeded permissions

I have an Android widget that needs internet access, fine and coarse permissions only. However, when I install the apk file, it says it also needs access to read the phone state and identity, and access to storage. It doesn't need access to either, and the only permissions that are in the mainfest are: Any ideas on why this is happening? Thanks for the help.
