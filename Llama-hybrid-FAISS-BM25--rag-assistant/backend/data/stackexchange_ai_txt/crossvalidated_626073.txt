There are many X validated entries on the approximation of a normalizing constant given a sample from the associated distribution: Can MCMC algorithm estimate partition function (normalizing constant)? Computation of the marginal likelihood from MCMC samples Marginal Likelihood from the Gibbs Output Approximating the marginal likelihood in Bayesian Model Comparison We wrote a comparison study about those methods with Jean-Michel Marin a few years ago but the main message is that the Newton-Raftery/harmonic mean method should be avoided at all costs! See also this answer of mine . Once a sample from (*) is available, my #1 suggestion is to use Geyer's (1994) inverse logistic regression method.
