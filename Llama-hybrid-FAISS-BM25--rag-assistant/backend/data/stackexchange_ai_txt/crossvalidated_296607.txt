How can I show whether or not two time series are “different” from one another?

I have a small dataset that shows the number of young patients in a disease registry is increasing over time. I suspect that this is just because the registry has become more successful over time and now captures a greater proportion of cases. I would therefore like to plot the number of young patients in the registry each year, e.g. on a line graph, alongside the total number of patients (i.e. all ages) included within the registry each year and demonstrate whether or not I have done this crudely in Excel and the trends are not identical. I would therefore like to demonstrate whether or not the trends are consistent with each other statistically/graphically. Can anyone suggest a good way to do this using either Stata or Excel?
