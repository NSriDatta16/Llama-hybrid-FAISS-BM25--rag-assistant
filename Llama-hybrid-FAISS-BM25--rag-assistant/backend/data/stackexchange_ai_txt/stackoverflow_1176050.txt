Implement IDropTarget

I would like to drag and drop files from windows explorer onto my application which is being built in Codegear RAD studio 2009. Then I would like to be able to access data from the object I am dragging and dropping. I believe I have to implement IDropTarget. Can someone please provide an example of how I might implement IDropTarget to achieve this?
