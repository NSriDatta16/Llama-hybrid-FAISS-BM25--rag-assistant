How to determine when a chemical steady state procees has been achieved?

I'm trying to figure out what statistical test to use to determine when a chemical process has reached steady state for temperature and the process for a process tool. For example I have a process where I'm ramping the temperature up to 100 °C and monitoring the output in ppm. I can visually see when the temp and process has hit steady state but I would like to use a statistical test to show this. Here is an example of the data set (The actual data set is measure in seconds over the course of 4 days) I'm working with : Time Temperature ppm 2018-01-30 11:30 25 90 2018-01-30 11:31 50 120 2018-01-30 11:32 75 150 2018-01-30 11:34 100 175 2018-01-30 11:35 101 205 2018-01-30 11:36 102 195 2018-01-30 11:37 99 200 2018-01-30 11:38 102 205 2018-01-30 11:39 101 195 2018-01-30 11:40 100 200 Visually I can see the temperature has reached steady state around 11:34 and the output has reached a steady state around 11:35 (±5 ppm). My thought is to take a moving average and then take the derivative to show the rate of change has reached zero. Is there a better way to show this statistically?
