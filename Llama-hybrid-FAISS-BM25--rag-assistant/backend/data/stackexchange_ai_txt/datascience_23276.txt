Matrix class not being recognized

I have a data frame, and I am only interested in the numerical variables (variable class is double): Example A B C D E 0.13 2.22 3.44 3.30 6.54 3.55 4.23 0.43 5.33 3.55 ... I want to build a linear regression xgboost model, so I converted the data frame to a dense matrix. I took out all categorical variables from my data, and am left with the five variables of interest. But I can't seem to be able to use the dense matrix, despite it being a type of input that xgboost accepts. See here . I am instead getting this error: Error "Error in xgb.DMatrix(train_mat[, -n], label = train_mat[, n]) : [23:57:13] amalgamation/../dmlc-core/src/io/local_filesys.cc:66: LocalFileSystem.GetPathInfo 2007 Error:No such file or directory". Code train_mat I tried to convert to a xgb.DMatrix, but I am not clear on what it's asking for to do the conversion. train_mat How do I input data into xgboost?
