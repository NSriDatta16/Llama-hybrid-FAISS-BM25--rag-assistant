Data preparation for EOF Analysis in R

I am pretty much new to RStudio, I am DOING EOF Analysis in RStudio on time series data, and I have my data in CSV format, can someone please guide or refer me to the literature on how can I use this data in R for EOF Analysis or what changes are required in data?
