Is the example distribution conditionally independent?

I am studying for my machine learning exam and i have problems with basic conditional probability. I have to solve the following exercise: The formular for conditionally independence is $P(Y|x) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} P(Y_{i}|x)$ and also $P(Y|x) = P(Y_{1}|x) \prod_{i=1}^{m} P(Y_{i}|Y_{1},...,Y_{i-1},x)$ So i thought about the problem and came to these conclusions: $P(Y_{1}|x) = 0.6$ because given an $x$ the probability of $Y_{1}$ being 1 is $0.3$ plus $0.3$ . I've done the same for $P(Y_{2}|x) = 0.4$ $P(Y_{3}|x) = 0.3$ So now i can compute $\prod_{i=1}^{m} P(Y_{i}|x)$ , but what is $P(Y|x)$ ? I thought that i can get $P(Y|x)$ by the second formula, but for that i require $P(Y_{1}|x)$ , $P(Y_{2}|Y_{1},x)$ , $P(Y_{3}|Y_{2},Y_{1},x)$ . For $P(Y_{2}|Y_{1},x)$ i came up with this: $P(Y_{2}|Y_{1},x) = \frac{P(Y_{2}|x)}{P(Y_{1})}$ , and $P(Y_{1}) = P(Y_{1}|x) P(X)$ But what is $P(X)$ ? How can i solve this problem? Are there any mistakes?
