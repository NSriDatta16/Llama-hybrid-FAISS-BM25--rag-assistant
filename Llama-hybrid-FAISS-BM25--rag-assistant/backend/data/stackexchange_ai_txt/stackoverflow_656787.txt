What are some good patterns for performing initial configuration of a web application?

I have a Java web application designed to be deployed on the internet. It needs a database connection. Depending upon hosting environments it may not be possible for the deployers of the web application to configure appropriate data sources so the application needs to store it's database connection information somewhere to be reloaded if the application is restarted. I also need to give one user administrator privilileges. If this is just the first user account created there is the small possibility that the admin account could be hijacked in between the time that the application is deployed and the time that the installer logs in. I need to do both of these tasks securely and in a way that is lowest common denominator for a web application. Clarification: Upon first use I want the application to set up an admin user. That admin user will have all security access in the system. Somehow I need to determine what that user is called and what their password will be. If the application gets deployed on a shared web host the application will be live from the moment it is deployed. If I allow the site to be configured through a web interface there is the small possibility that an unauthorised person will do the web configuration before the site owner effectively hijacking the site. I am looking for an elegant way to avoid this.
