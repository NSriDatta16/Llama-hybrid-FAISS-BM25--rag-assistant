Using neural networks for multi target prediction

I have a spatial dataset with some xs and ys at different spatial locations. I want to learn a non linear regression function using neural networks. I looked in to the training data and the outputs are different locations i.e. ys are high correlated. So I was thinking of modelling a multi target prediction, instead of learning a separate regression for each case. I was thinking of learning a joint one using neural networks. I tried to use nntool of Matlab, however it lets me model only one output at a time. What should I do to model multiple outputs at the same time?
