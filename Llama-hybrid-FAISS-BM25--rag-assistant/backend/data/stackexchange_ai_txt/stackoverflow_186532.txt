It's almost impossible to properly organise the testing without keeping good track of your test and their results. We use PMC suite ( 1 ) and it has a very useful organisation structure for the tests: Test Scenarios (batteries of tests) Test Cases (linked to the Requirements) Test runs with their respective results These are linked to the Bugs which are in their turn linked to the Tasks etc. When a manual test is run the tester executes a scenario and goes through the test cases, with the results being tracked. All found issues are documented as Bugs. 1. it's developed by my company but please don't consider this to be a ad :)
