How to model a zero-inflated 'continuous' response data in r 'without' assuming an underlying normal distribution?

I have a weather data set with rainfall as response. It has 56% observations as 0, while the rest as continuous rainfall data. I can't use tobit, hurdle or any other zeroinfl() model as they require count data; my data is continuous. I know I need to use a mixture model or a two-part model without assuming an underlying normal distribution ... My issue is that I don't know how to go about it: how would I model this in R? I searched online, but I couldn't find use cases for continuous data. I'm not sure whether I should create a logistic regression model first to predict rain or no rain (0 or 1) and the create another model to predict quantity of rain? Or does the mixture model do both things simultaneously?
