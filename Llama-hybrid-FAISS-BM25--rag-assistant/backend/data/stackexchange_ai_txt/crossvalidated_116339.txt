Wrong predictions for weekend, but good predictions for weekdays

I have a set of 3 years of daily data. I saw weekly and annual seasonality in the data so I used msts time series and tbats (from the forecast package in R) to fit the best fitted model. The predicted values for weekdays are with 5% of the actual data but it has very off predictions for weekend. I did not expect that as I included daily seasonality in a week (different weekday and weekend patterns) in my time series which I though will consider the seasonality correctly. I wonder if anybody have any idea whats going wrong with my data. I also used ts with single seasonality of frequency 7 and again used tbats to fit a model. Th new model has better predictions for weekend but worse predictions for weekday. I also tried auto.arima (also from the forecast package) but as I have a huge number of data points, arima was not able to find a good model.
