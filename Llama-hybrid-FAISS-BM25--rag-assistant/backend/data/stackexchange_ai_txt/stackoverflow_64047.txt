Binary logs are probably the correct way to do incremental backups, but if you don't trust binary file formats for permanent storage here is an ASCII way to do incremental backups. mysqldump is not a bad format, the main problem is that it outputs stuff a table as one big line. The following trivial sed will split its output along record borders: mysqldump --opt -p | sed -e "s/,(/,\n(/g" > database.dump The resulting file is pretty diff-friendly, and I've been keeping them in a standard SVN repository fairly successfully. That also allows you to keep a history of backups, if you find that the last version got borked and you need last week's version.
