What is the best open source solution for storing time series data?

I am interested in monitoring some objects. I expect to get about 10000 data points every 15 minutes. (Maybe not at first, but this is the 'general ballpark'). I would also like to be able to get daily, weekly, monthly and yearly statistics. It is not critical to keep the data in the highest resolution (15 minutes) for more than two months. I am considering various ways to store this data, and have been looking at a classic relational database, or at a schemaless database (such as SimpleDB). My question is, what is the best way to go along doing this? I would very much prefer an open-source (and free) solution to a proprietary costly one. Small note: I am writing this application in Python.
