A slightly more rigorous approach to solving this problem would be to use queueing. Queueing theory is the broad term for the study of waiting in queues (lines). This sort of analysis could give you more insight you are looking for, that regression likely will not. For example, if you are looking to predict the number of employees (agents) you should have on-hand for the day, you would do something similar to the following: Project the rate at which people enter your store (system) and the amount of time a customer would normally spend in the system shopping. Both of these can be modeled using relatively simple functions. Estimate the amount of time it takes for a customer to "check out," or be serviced by an agent. This is also easy to model with a simple function. Now that you know the rate at which people (i) enter the store, and (ii) enter the queue, and (iii) are serviced, you can estimate the time a customer will spend in the queue. Ideally, you are looking to keep the probability a single customer waits for longer than $m$ minutes less than some threshold value $p$, by hiring multiple agents $a$. This is the general approach to this type of problem. Big retailers (Macys, Costco, etc.) do this type of analysis before any sort of large event to determine the minimum number of employees to retain to keep waiting time below some pre-determined maximum. You would need to account for many factors (not achieving steady-state, jockeying, and many other situation-specifics). You also rely heavily on estimations and assumptions, like assuming customers arrive according to a random process $\sim \lambda$, or estimating how long it will take an average customer to be serviced. In your case, since you are not dealing with this rigorous approach, you may as well rely on intuition. Black Friday is absolute mayhem, regardless of the exact number of employees you retain on the day.
