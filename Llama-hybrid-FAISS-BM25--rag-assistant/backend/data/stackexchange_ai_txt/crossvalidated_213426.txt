Interesting problem. Here is how I would set it up. For coin $i$, let $\theta_i$ represent the success probability, $y_i$ the number of successful flips, and $n_i$ the number of trials. Then assume $$ y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} Bin(n_i,\theta_i). $$ Let $\theta=(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n)$. Then to incorporate the ordering you mention, I would use the prior $$ p(\theta) \propto \mathrm{I}(\theta_1>\theta_2>\cdots>\theta_n). $$ (Any prior that incorporates this ordering could be used.) Let $y=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$, the posterior is $$ p(\theta|y) \propto \left[ \prod_{i=1}^n \theta_i^{y_i}(1-\theta_i)^{n_i-y_i} \right] \mathrm{I}(\theta_1>\theta_2>\cdots>\theta_n) $$ and, if nothing else, you can draw samples from this posterior using MCMC. Then your question of interest is to calculate probabilities of this nature $$ P(\theta_i>c,\theta_{i+1} where $c$ is your cutoff. This can be estimated for $i=1,\ldots,n-1$ and augmented with $P(\theta_1 c|y)$ which are the only other possibilities.
