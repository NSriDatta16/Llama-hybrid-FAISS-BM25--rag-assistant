The only rules, that I'm aware of, is that the thead (if used) must be defined first , and the tfoot (if used) before the tbody (somewhat counter-intuitive, to my mind, but them's the rules). I think that the purpose of thead is partially for print purposes, allowing columns printed on a second page to have the thead repeated, in order that the data makes more sense. In theory it could also allow for a scrolling tbody in the case of long tables, with fixed headers: This division enables user agents to support scrolling of table bodies independently of the table head and foot. When long tables are printed, the table head and foot information may be repeated on each page that contains table data. Source: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#edef-TFOOT This does not, however, work currently (without using at least two tables, I think). The largest benefit, though, as @Glenn Slaven notes, seems to be semantic.
