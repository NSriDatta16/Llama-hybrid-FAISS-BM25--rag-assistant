i'm reading this geotargeting in webmaster tool and imho there is several pro and cons around. the pro would be if you targeting local market and only local market can reach your product then this option would be valid and i think you will have faster indexing for local market. the cons would be low on non-domestic visitors from organic search result. but if you do targeting international visitors then using gTLDs would be a good idea. this way the crawler would know which page for which country (read: http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=182192 ) but i can't quite sure whether when you specifying for geotarget for specific country, does that mean your page won't come up in SERP for other country? if this true then there is a low use for geotargeting. probably example below can be more enlighting: if i were to specify geotargeting for my website to Spain market only in webmaster tool i'm worried that Spanish around the world can not find my website because they are not living in Spain. anyway all i'm saying that this feature can be a great advantage for selling product online locally.
