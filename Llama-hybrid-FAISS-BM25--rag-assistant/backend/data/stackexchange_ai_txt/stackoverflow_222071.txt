The -w command-line switch turns on warnings globally for the entire interpreter. On the other hand, use warnings is a "lexical pragma" and only applies in the lexical scope in which it's used. Usually, you put that at the top of a file so it applies to the whole file, but you can also scope it to particular blocks. In addition, you can use no warnings to temporarily turn them off inside a block, in cases where you need to do otherwise warning-generating behavior. You can't do that if you've got -w on. For details about how lexical warnings work, including how to turn various subsets of them on and off, see the perllexwarn document.
