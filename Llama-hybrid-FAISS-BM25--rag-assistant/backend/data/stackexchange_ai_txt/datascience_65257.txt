Is it possible to decompose a scalar value to a inter-dependent vector neural network?

My data contains a scalar feature $r$ , I found this feature is important for training my deep model. My idea is supposing there is a 3-layer MLP $f(x), x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , where $n=1$ . It outputs a vector with dimension $m$ where each value in $[0, 1]$ . For my data, it inputs $r$ and outputs an m-sized vector. So here is my decomposition idea make sense?
