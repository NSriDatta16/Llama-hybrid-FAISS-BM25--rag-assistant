Let $p$ be the probability of the outcome occurring. Then, under the baseline scenario when you do not take any action your expected profits, denoted by $E_0$, is $3000p$. If you take action A then the expected profits denoted by $E_A$, $3000*1.02*p - 200$. If you take action B then the expected profits denoted by, $E_B$, is $3000*1.05*p - 500$. Thus, take Action A if $E_A > E_0$ and $E_A > E_B$,take Action B if $E_B > E_0$ and $E_B > E_A$ and do not take either action if $E_A Working through the inequalities implied by the above paragraphs you will get some bounds on $p$ which will determine what you should be doing which may be helpful in making a decision.
