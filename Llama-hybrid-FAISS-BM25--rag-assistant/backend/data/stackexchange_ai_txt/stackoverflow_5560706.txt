Could you maybe post the code in question so we can give it an inspection and see what's up? at first guess, it does sound like a memory issue related to inability to allocate that much storage space, the allocation is returning a null pointer in the underlying system and thus Perl can't actually create the GD object, since you're trying to allocate somewhere in the range of 125MB off the heap with 2000000 64bit (assuming you're on a 64bit host) ints/floats. But, it could just be something syntactical.
