Develop a training set, validation set and test set. Training set contains 40% of observations, validation and test set contain 30% each of the observations (assuming you have a fairly large dataset in the first place). Develop 5 decision trees, each with differing parameters that you would like to test. Run these decision trees on the training set and then validation set and see which decision tree has the lowest ASE (Average Squared Error) on the validation set. You can use a different validation criterion if you so choose but I prefer the ASE. If you feel that the best performing tree can still perform better given the ASE on the validation set, then go back and tweak the parameters of this tree and re-run on training and validation set. Once you are happy, use your final tree and predict on your test set.
