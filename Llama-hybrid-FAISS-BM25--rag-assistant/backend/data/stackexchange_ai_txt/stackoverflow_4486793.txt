Correctly distributing a Java Desktop Application

I would like to distribute a program I'm halfway done writing but I'm having trouble figuring a few things out... needs to check for latest JRE and check for updates/patches to my app (jnlp?) the program will have one or two built in encryptions so I need to somehow wrap it in an .exe shell maybe..? (NSIS?) How do I lock down my code? Upon install I need to create a directory where my app can read and write from automatically so I can save settings and log in info to the client's computer, and then be able to automatically reference it from then forward. I feel like the jump to being able to do a few things with Java to distributing an app with these prerequisites is a large one, I'd appreciate any advice or wisdom you can share.
