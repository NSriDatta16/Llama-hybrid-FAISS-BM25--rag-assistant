It depends on whether the encoding should be reversible or not. Reversible Use URL encoding ( java.net.URLEncoder ) to replace special characters with %xx . Note that you take care of the special cases where the string equals . , equals .. or is empty!ยน Many programs use URL encoding to create file names, so this is a standard technique which everybody understands. Irreversible Use a hash (e.g. SHA-1) of the given string. Modern hash algorithms ( not MD5) can be considered collision-free. In fact, you'll have a break-through in cryptography if you find a collision. ยน You can handle all 3 special cases elegantly by using a prefix such as "myApp-" . If you put the file directly into $HOME , you'll have to do that anyway to avoid conflicts with existing files such as ".bashrc". public static String encodeFilename(String s) { try { return "myApp-" + java.net.URLEncoder.encode(s, "UTF-8"); } catch (java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException e) { throw new RuntimeException("UTF-8 is an unknown encoding!?"); } }
