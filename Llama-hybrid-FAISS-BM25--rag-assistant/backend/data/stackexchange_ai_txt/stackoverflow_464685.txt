Yes. Of course all the tests you performed during TDD of your release will have been added to a regression test suite. But, in the case of a bug, that regression suite obviously wasn't detailed enough. The first step in fixing a bug is replicating it and this is TDD. Once you find a test case that replicates the bug, you can expand on it if you wish (to catch other obvious problems of the same class), but I don't tend to do a lot of expansion since we have specific turnaround times for fixing a single bug. Once you have a fix for that bug, add the test case to the regression suite. The idea is to keep adding test cases to the regression suite for both releases and bug fixes to give it very good coverage.
