At the moment the first code runs a poisson regression. So if you want to change it to logistic regression you must use the following R code : glm_a Since your dependent variable is binary (death yes vs. no) I would use the logistic regression instead of using the anova. This is because ANOVA assumes a continuous dependent variable . Or in fact, if you have recored the time to event and censoring you could use a cox regression. EDIT Thank you for providing the data. I had a look at the data which indeed is kind of a summary table indicating number of deaths per condition. You could recreate the original data with this information because you know the sample size per group and the number of deaths per group. If you do so you will get data where each row contains information about one single snail (variables about the conditions and a variable whether this snail died). Then you could use a logistic regression. Or maybe someone has an other suggestion
