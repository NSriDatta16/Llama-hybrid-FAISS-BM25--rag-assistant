Why does confusion matrix shows inverse output?

I am working on a logistic regression binary classification with 1000 rows and 28 columns While I have split my dataset into train and test , I am using the test data to validate my model. After building the model, I got the below matrxi upon calling .predict() Please find the confusion matrix below [[ 2 53] [ 0 190]] However, my label distribution (in test set) looks like below status 0 55 1 190 As you can see that most of my labels are 1 but in confusion matrix above most of them are under True Negative . Shouldn't they be either under True Positive , False negative . It doesn't make sense to see such a huge number under True Negative . because my actual negative is only 55 records as shown above Am I making any mistake here? Can you guide me here? Am I constructing/interpreting the confusion matrix incorrectly?
