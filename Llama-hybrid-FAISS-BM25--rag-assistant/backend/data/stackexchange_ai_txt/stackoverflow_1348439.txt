Is there a way to programatically turn text into a circle in actionscript?

Has anyone here come up with an elegant way to take a piece of text and make it go around the edge of a line that is warped? (specifically, circular, but I'm sure once it's following the line, the shape is not relevant). I can't find a good resource for how to do this. I assume I'll need to create separate movie clips for each character and then rotate, and position, but I'm having a hard time finding a resource for how to do this. edit: Sorry, forgot to mention that the text is dynamic, obviously. I'm not interested in how to make static text go in circles :)
