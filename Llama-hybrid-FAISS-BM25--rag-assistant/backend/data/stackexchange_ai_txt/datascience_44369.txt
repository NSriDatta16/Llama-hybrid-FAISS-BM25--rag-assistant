What is the meaning of the Variant Q-learning and To what INPUT and OUTPUT refer? in Abstract of DeepMind DQN paper 2013

-INPUT and OUTPUT OF ATARI DQN: In the abstract paragraph of the DQN work by DeepMind it has written: " We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning , whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards . " Would you please explain the bold sections? • Input and output refer to Q-learning or DNN? • Why it is said that learn control policy , however DQN is composed of QL which is a value iteration and"off-policy" algorithm and it is not a policy iteration and "on-policy"? • What is the meaning of variant type of Q-learning is vague? it is variant because approximation of Q-learning is implemented?
