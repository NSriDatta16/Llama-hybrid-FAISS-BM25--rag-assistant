This is a natural question but as such it has no answer: EM is an optimisation algorithm, not a statistical inference principle. As such, it returns a maximum likelihood point estimate of the parameter in the best case (or a local mode in the worse cases). To find confidence intervals on the parameters, you need to involve other statistical principles, like bootstrap or Bayesian inference. Note that in the case of mixtures standard approximations fail because of the lack of identifiability of the parameters and the degeneracy at the boundaries of the parameter space.
