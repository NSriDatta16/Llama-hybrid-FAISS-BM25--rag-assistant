Never store a password in plaintext. I would recommend to read those questions: How to best store user information and user login and password Best practices for storing database passwords Password Management Best Practices (soup to nuts, not just storage or generation) Salting Your Password: Best Practices? Is it ever ok to store password in plain text in a php variable or php constant? If your customer isn't interested in details - just implement it. (Also provide a proper password recovery procedure). It's not really a big deal for you as a programmer but really improves the security & quality of your product. If he wants to know what you intend to change - explain it to him. Tell him about the security issues and he will understand. Also a live example really helps to open customer eyes: Simply retreive his password from their old system and show him how easy it would be for everyone. I've always done it that way: If I feel it's important to have a security feature in one of my products - I've always included it. It adds a big plus to the quality of your products and gives you many "woah you thought of everything" moments.
