Check out caret's function findLinearCombos and run it on your data. The object returned is a list--the second element is a vector of indices which can safely be removed from your data set since they are linear combinations of other columns (which, now that I think about it makes total sense because you only had 500 observations and, as a result, your model was totally over-specified). When you pass in your data frame the resulting vector has a thousand elements . Basically, you can go right ahead and delete columns 501 to 1500. Do that from the get-go and try re-building those models. A couple quick side notes: If you include the 'data' argument, then only refer to the columns by their names in the formula (i.e. write age ~. instead of data$age ~. ). If you plan on doing PCA then you might want to consider setting it up via the preProcess argument in the train function (you can tweak the threshold in trainControl function). (Since you're already using carat anyway you might as well have it handle your pre-processing, too--it gives you one less thing to worry about). By the way, try checking out this code. prepped
