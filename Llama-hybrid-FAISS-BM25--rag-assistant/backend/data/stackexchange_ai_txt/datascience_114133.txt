You can try this transformer model called Re-Punctuate . Code: from transformers import T5Tokenizer, TFT5ForConditionalGeneration tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('SJ-Ray/Re-Punctuate') model = TFT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('SJ-Ray/Re-Punctuate') input_text = 'the story of this brave brilliant athlete whose very being was questioned so publicly is one that still captures the imagination' inputs = tokenizer.encode("punctuate: " + input_text, return_tensors="tf") result = model.generate(inputs) decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(result[0], skip_special_tokens=True) print(decoded_output) Example: Input: the story of this brave brilliant athlete whose very being was questioned so publicly is one that still captures the imagination Output: The story of this brave, brilliant athlete, whose very being was questioned so publicly, is one that still captures the imagination.
