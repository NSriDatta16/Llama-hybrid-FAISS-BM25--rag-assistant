According to Philip Good's text Permutation Tests , a good rule of thumb is "between 100 and 1600, depending on the precision that is desired" . See the link for greater elaboration. If you're interested in a more computationally efficient, but somewhat more complex, solution, you could consider implementing something from Axel Gandy's paper Sequential Implementation of Monte Carlo Tests with Uniformly Bounded Resampling Risk (or use his R package if you're using R). This method basically guarantees that your stopping rule has only an arbitrarily small probability of falsely coming to the wrong conclusion, while allowing you to compute a small number of permutation tests if it's obvious that the p -value lies on one side or the other of the cutoff.
