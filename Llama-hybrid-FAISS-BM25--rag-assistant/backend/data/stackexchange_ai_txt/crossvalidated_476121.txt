Nonlinear models can have more flexibility, but this need not be desirable. With that flexibility comes increased ability to overfit to your training data, detecting mere coincidences that will not be present in new data. The major goal of predictive modeling and machine learning is to make predictions on data where you donâ€™t know the answer. What is a stock price going to be tomorrow? How many new COVID cases will there be by the end of July? What word did this person say to Alexa? It is easier to trick complex models than simple models.
