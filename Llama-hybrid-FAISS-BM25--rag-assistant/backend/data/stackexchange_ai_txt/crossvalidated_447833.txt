Dimensions Of The Covariance Matrix

I know that PCA can be obtained by eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix, and the covariance matrix $S$ is obtained by the equation: $S = X^TX $ , where $X$ is the centered data matrix. But I am a bit confused about the dimensions of the covariance matrix. In some resources, they define the data matrix as: $X_{n \times d}$ where n is the number of samples and d is the dimension. In other resources, it's the opposite: $X_{d \times n}$ . And this definitely yields covariance matrices with different dimensions, and also eigenvectors of different dimensions. I am not sure what am I getting wrong, but I think I am missing something important here.
