How to test whether a factor differs from 50%, and which levels within the factor differ from 50%?

I have a categorical factor with 100 levels and 100 different proportions. I would like to test (a) whether these proportions differ from 50%, and (b) if any of the levels in particular differ more from 50% than others. I was thinking I could use a binomial generalized linear model to predict proportions. The intercept in the regression model would tell me whether any of the levels differ from 0, right? props This intercept above would indicate whether the average proportion differs from 0. But how would I be able to tell whether any of the proportions in particular differ more or less from 50% than others? I was considering an effects coded categorical factor but that seems potentially odd since the categorical indicator/level is different for every single row. It also provides a ton of different coefficients. df $group group) contrasts(df$group) For each group, I only have one observation. This may be odd but this was actually originally multilevel data with one instance of each group within each cluster. I wanted to focus on the groups and if the average count (i.e., proportion) per group differ from 50% so I collapsed the counts/binaries across clusters, giving me these proportions. Is there a better way to model this? I was considering a X2 goodness of fit test but the expected proportions there needs to sum to 1 which would not be the case if the expected proportions are all = .50.
