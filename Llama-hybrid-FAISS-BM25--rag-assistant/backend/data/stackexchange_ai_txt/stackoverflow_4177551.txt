Sounds like you need to read up on the document-based architecture: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Documents/Documents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000006-BAJJJHEG In particular, you need to define CFBundleDocumentTypes in your application's .plist file, then the Finder just magically knows about the association when it encounters your .app bundle, such as when the user drags it into /Applications, or drags the icon into the dock.
