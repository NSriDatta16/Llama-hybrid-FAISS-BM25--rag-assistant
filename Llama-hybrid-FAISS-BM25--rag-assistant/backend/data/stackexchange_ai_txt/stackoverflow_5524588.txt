I think, the following should work: @Entity public class UserGroup { @EmbeddedId private UserGroupPK id; private String field; @ManyToOne(referencedColumnName = "mail") @JoinColumn(name = "mail") private User user; } See the corresponding paragraph 5.1.7.1. Using a foreign key or an association table in the hibernate documentation: The @JoinColumn attribute is optional, the default value(s) is the concatenation of the name of the relationship in the owner side, _ (underscore), and the name of the primary key column in the owned side. In this example [user_mail] because the property name is [user] and the column id [(actually, the referencedColumnName)] of [User] is [mail]. (I replaced the values in the [] brackets.) Please note, that your User entity doesn't have a primary key, which is probably not a good idea. What are you trying to achieve?
