The other alternative is to override the views template. While editing your view, click Theme: Information Look at the list of template files being used Open up the /sites/all/views folder and look in those templates to find out which one is sending the problematic div Copy that template to your theme's directory Edit whatever you need to (in this case, remove the div) Flush the Drupal theme registry and the markup should be as you want it. It's not a hack; overriding of .tpl.php's is an encouraged practice in Drupal. I'd agree that just changing the jQuery selector would be easier and better, but this is just an alternative to be aware of.
