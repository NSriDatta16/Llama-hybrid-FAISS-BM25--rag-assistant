Is this prior distribution exchangeable?

I am reading the book Bayesian data analysis written by Gelman. And I do not confirm the answer of this question: suppose it is known a priori that the $2J$ parameters $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_{2J}$ are clustered into two groups, with exactly half being drawn from a $N(1,1)$ distribution, and the other half being drawn from a $N(-1,1)$ distribution, but we have not observed which parameters come from which distribution. $(a)$ Are $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_{2J}$ exchangeable under this prior distribution? $(b)$ Show that this distribution cannot be written as a mixture of $iid$ components. $(c)$ Why can we not simply take the limit as $J\rightarrow \infty$ and get a couterexample to $de \space Finetti's$ theorem? IMO, we have no any information about ordering or grouping of the parameters can be made, so the parameters $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_{2J}$ are exchangeable in this prior distribution? Besides, not all parameters are identity distributed, can we simply say this distribution cannot be written as a mixture of $iid$ components? We cannot take the limit as $J\rightarrow \infty$ and get a couterexample to $de \space Finetti's$ theorem since this distribution is not exchangeable. Right? If you have any idea please write your comment. Let me know I do a right answer or not. Thanks :)
