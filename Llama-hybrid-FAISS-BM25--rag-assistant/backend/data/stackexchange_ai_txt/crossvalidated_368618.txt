Multivariate Gaussian distribution

I was going through Andrew Ng's Machine learning course and was a bit confused about the difference between Gaussian distribution and multivariate Gaussian distribution. As per my understanding multivariate Gaussian distribution is for models where we have multiple features like x1,x2...xn but the same thing could be done for original model I know I am totally confused here.
