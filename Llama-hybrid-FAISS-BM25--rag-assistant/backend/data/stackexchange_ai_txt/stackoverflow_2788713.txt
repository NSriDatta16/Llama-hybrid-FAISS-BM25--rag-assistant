matlab precision determinant problem

I have the following program format compact; format short g; clear; clc; L = 140; J = 77; Jm = 10540; G = 0.8*10^8; d = L/3; for i=1:500000 omegan=1.+0.0001*i; a(1,1) = ((omegan^2)*(Jm/(G*J))*d^2)-2; a(1,2) = 2; a(1,3) = 0; a(1,4) = 0; a(2,1) = 1; a(2,2) = ((omegan^2)*(Jm/(G*J))*d^2)-2; a(2,3) = 1; a(2,4) = 0; a(3,1) = 0; a(3,2) = 1; a(3,3) = ((omegan^2)*(Jm/(G*J))*d^2)-2; a(3,4) = 1; a(4,1) = 0; a(4,2) = 0; a(4,3) = 2; a(4,4) = ((omegan^2)*(Jm/(G*J))*d^2)-2; if(abs(det(a)) Analytical solution of the above system, and the same program written in fortran gives out values of omegan equal to 16.3818 and 32.7636 (fortran values; analytical differ a little, but they're there somewhere). So, now I'm wondering ... where am I going wrong with this ? Why is matlab not giving the expected results ? (this is probably something terribly simple, but it's giving me headaches)
