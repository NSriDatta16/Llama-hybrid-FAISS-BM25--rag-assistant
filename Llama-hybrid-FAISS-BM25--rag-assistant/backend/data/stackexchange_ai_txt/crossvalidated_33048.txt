Is there any way to fit an exponential model with a discrete predictor in R?

I'm trying to estimate the growth rates of a number of ant colonies. I have measured colony mass at three different time points. I was thinking about measuring growth rate by fitting an exponential growth model to each colony's masses across time. It was drawn to my attention that I may not be able to perform non-linear least squares (nls) as I had hoped, because the predictor is a discrete variable (i.e., it's t1, t2, or t3). I was wondering: whether this is indeed problematic & whether anyone had any recommendations for how else to estimate growth rates in this case?
