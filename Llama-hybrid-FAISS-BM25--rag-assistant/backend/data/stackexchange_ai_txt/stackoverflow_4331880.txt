best way to automatically convert microsoft office documents

What is the best way to convert Microsoft Office documents automatically on a server? We need to convert lots of such documents automatically to PDF files. Currently we use PDFCreator with an OLE script, but it is a fragile process since Microsoft Office popups keeps interrupting the flow. I have tried OpenOffice, but it is not good enough at converting Microsoft Office documents.
