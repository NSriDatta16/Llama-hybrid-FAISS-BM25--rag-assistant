Sentiment Analysis- Airbnb

Are there specific packages in R to do sentiment analysis? I have public reviews of airbnb Seattle here ( http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html ) and I am intersted in seeing the positive, negative and neutral scores of every review received. New to Data Science. Any help would be much appreciated
