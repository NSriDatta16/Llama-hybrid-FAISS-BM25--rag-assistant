I think there are at least 3 types of marginal effects for a non-linear model like the probit. Authors are often unclear about which one they are using. The marginal effect at the mean (MEM) is what Matt Simpson described. That's the derivative evaluated at the mean values of the explanatory variables. There is also the average marginal effect: $AME=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\partial \Pr \left( y_{i}=1|x_{1},...,x_{k}\right) }{\partial x_{j}}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\phi \left( \alpha +\beta _{1}x_{1i}+...+\beta _{k}x_{ki}\right) \beta _{j}$, where $\phi$ is the standard normal density function. That is the average of derivatives for everyone in your sample. There is also the marginal effect at a representative value (MER), which is kind of like the MEM, but the values of explanatory variables are chosen to be representative, perhaps means or medians for continuous and modes for categorical. For dummy variables, the logic is analogous, but you should use the approach written up by Matt. If you got the dummy version working, you can also treat continuous variables the same way. Here's one 's an example of how to do this with the dummies with R. Here's one for continuous variables.
