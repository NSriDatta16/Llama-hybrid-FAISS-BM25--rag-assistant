If you declare a variable static within a function it is only initialized once when the function is entered for the first time. If you declare it non-static it is initialized each time the function is entered. In your case it can make a slight difference. With static the array will be allocated in the static storage and initialized no more than once. Without static it will be allocated on stack and each time the function is called.
