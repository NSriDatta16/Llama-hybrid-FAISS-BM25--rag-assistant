Find the optimal n_estimator by looping the model accuracy indicator in random forest algorithm - python

i'm trying to find the best n_estimator value on a Random Forest ML model by running this loop: for i in r: RF_model_i = RandomForestClassifier(criterion="gini", n_estimators=i, oob_score=True) RF_model_i.id = [i] # dynamically add fields to objects RF_model_i.fit(X_train, y_train) y_predict_i = RF_model_i.predict(X_test) accuracy_i = [accuracy_score(y_test, y_predict_i), i] results.append(accuracy_i) # put the result on a list within the for-loop question #1 ** What i like to understand is if this could be a good way to understand how to decide the n_estimator parameter and possibly why (i'm not so sure it is) 2.**question #2 If what i'm doing have some sense, could be a good idea extend this loop to all of other main parameters? What i obtain is this: a level of accuracy for a number of estimator associated with which i runned the random forest algorithm Thank you
