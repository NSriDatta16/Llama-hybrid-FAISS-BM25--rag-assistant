In Python, is there an elegant way to print a list in a custom format without explicit looping?

I know you can do print str(myList) to get [1, 2, 3] and you can do i = 0 for entry in myList: print str(i) + ":", entry i += 1 to get 0: 1 1: 2 2: 3 But is there a way similar to the first to get a result similar to the last? With my limited knowledge of Python (and some help from the documentation), my best is: print '\n'.join([str(n) + ": " + str(entry) for (n, entry) in zip(range(0,len(myList)), myList)]) It's not much less verbose, but at least I get a custom string in one (compound) statement. Can you do better?
