Consider two set of conditions, the first described by the vector of independent variables $X$, and the second described by the vector $X'$, which differs only in the ith variable $x_i$, and by one unit. Let $\beta$ be the vector of model parameters as usual. According to the logistic regression model, the probability of the event occurring in the first case is $p_1 = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-X \beta)}$, so that the odds of the event occurring is $\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} = \exp(X \beta)$. The probability of the event occurring in the second case is $p_2 = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-X' \beta)}$, so that the odds of the event occurring is $\frac{p_2}{1-p_2} = \exp(X' \beta) = \exp(X \beta + \beta_i)$. The ratio of the odds in the second case to the odds in the first case is therefore $\exp(\beta_i)$. Hence the interpretation of the exponential of the parameter as an odds ratio.
