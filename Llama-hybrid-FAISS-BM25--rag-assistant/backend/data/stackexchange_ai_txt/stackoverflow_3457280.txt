I could figure out what is the problem. FormEventCapture_FormEvent should have same signature as delegate function i.e. __vFormAgentLib_FormEventEventHandler. When i changed the signature of the FormEventCapture_FormEvent , it did not give the error. But i am getting some run time error, If i do not succeed in figuring out i have ask you all for help. Thanks.
