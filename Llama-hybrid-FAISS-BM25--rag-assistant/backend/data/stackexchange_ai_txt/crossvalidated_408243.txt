First of all, the Random Forest cannot be applied to the following data types: images audio text (after preprocessing data will be sparse and RF doesn't work well with sparse data) For tabular data type, it is always good to check Random Forest because: it requires less data preparation and preprocessing than Neural Networks or SVMs. For example, you don't need to do feature scaling. For Random Forest training you can just use default parameters and set the number of trees ( the more trees in RF the better ). When you compare Random Forest to Neural Networks , the training is very easy (don't need to define architecture, or tune training algorithm). Random Forest is easier to train than Neural Networks.
