Pay attention to this line You're actually executing link_to_destroy_task function here, once for each task. From the docs def link_to_function(name, *args, &block) Returns a link of the given +name+ that will trigger a JavaScript +function+ using the onclick handler and return false after the fact. Never used this method, but it seems its purpose is to invoke JavaScript function, not Ruby function. There're examples too.
