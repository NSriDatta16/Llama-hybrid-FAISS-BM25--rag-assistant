Data Science & Stats questions

I have a few probability and stats questions and was hoping if someone could help in answering those. 1). Imagine there is a square. There is an ant at one corner of the square. At each step it reaches the other corner. The rule for it move is as follows: Flip a coin. If it is heads, the ant moves clock-wise. If it is tails, the ant moves counter-clockwise. The goal of the ant is to reach the diagonally opposite corner of square. What is the average steps the ant would take to reach there? 2). There is a building with 100 floors. You are given 2 identical eggs. How do you use 2 eggs to find the threshold floor, where the egg will definitely break from any floor above floor N, including floor N itself. 3) A Russian gangster kidnaps you. He puts two bullets in consecutive order in an empty six-round revolver, spins it, points it at your head and shoots. click You're still alive. He then asks you, do you want me to spin it again and fire or pull the trigger again. For each option, what is the probability that you'll be shot? Thanks a ton!
