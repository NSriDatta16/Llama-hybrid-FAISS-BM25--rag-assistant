Given that you're just looking for an average across the whole image, and not per-pixel brightness values, averaging PIL's histogram and applying the brightness function to the output seems like the best approach for that library. If using ImageMagick (with the PythonMagick bindings), I would suggest using the identify command with the "verbose" option set. This will provide you with a mean value for each channel, saving you the need to sum and average a histogram â€” you can just multiply each channel directly.
