Inserting many DOM elements chokes

I've got a loop where I insert about 500 s into the DOM via document.getElementById(target).appendChild(docFragmentDiv) , and each has probably 20 or 30 descendants. I can insert up to about 100 just fine, but the page temporarily freezes while the DOM is updated if there's something like 200+ inserts. How can I avoid this choke? Right now I have an interval set up to insert 50 per interval, with 25 ms between intervals. Is there a better way to do this?
