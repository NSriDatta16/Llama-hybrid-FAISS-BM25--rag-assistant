Have you tried switching the order - i.e. iframe first, script next? The script runs before the iframe is inserted into the DOM. Also, this worked for me in a similar situation: give the iframe an onload handler: Last but not least, pay attention to the cross-site scripting issues - the iframe may be loaded, but your JS may not be allowed to access it.
