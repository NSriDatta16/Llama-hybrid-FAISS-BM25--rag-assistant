You should include it in the SELECT part: SELECT *, (if ....) AS average FROM ... ORDER BY average Edit: assuming that your ifnull statement actually works... You might also want to look into joins to avoid querying the database again for every user; you can do everything in 1 select statement. Apart from that I would also say that you only need one average and the number of total votes, that should give you all the information you need.
