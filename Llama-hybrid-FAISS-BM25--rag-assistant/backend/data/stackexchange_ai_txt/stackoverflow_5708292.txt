The task you're interested in is often referred to as 'sentence segmentation'. As larsmans said, it's a non-trivial problem, but heuristic approaches often perform reasonably well, at least for English. It sounds like you're primarily interested in English, so the regex heuristics already presented may perform adequately for your needs. If you'd like a somewhat more accurate solution (at the cost of just a little more complexity), you might consider using LingPipe, an open-source NLP framework. I've had pretty good luck with LingPipe, the few times I've used it. See http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/demos/tutorial/sentences/read-me.html for a detailed tutorial on sentence segmentation.
