How to correctly compute p-value for hypothesis test?

Let the random variable X represent the amount of money carried by a student in class. To determine μ , the mean amount of money carried by a student, an experiment was conducted in class. The class was divided into four groups, and random samples from each group was taken. From Groups 1 and 2, random samples of size n=5 were taken, while from Groups 3 and 4, random samples of size n=10 were taken. Some sample results for the four groups are shown below. Group Average 1 46.60 2 6.80 3 16.00 4 13.90 Your instructor is interested in testing the following hypothesis about the mean amount of money carried by a student: H0: μ ≥ 28.79 H1: μ Assume that the amount of money carried by a student follows a Normal distribution, and s2 = 4929.1. Using the average results for Group 2 from the above table, what is the p-value for this test? I'm getting the answer as .24, while the correct answer is .2611. What did I do wrong? I first calculated z-score as (6.80-28.79)/sqrt(4929.1/5) = -0.7. P(z
