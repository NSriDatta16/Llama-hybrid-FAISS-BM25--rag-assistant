ARIMA Model Residuals correlation in small sample?

I'm working with simulated data, trying to estimate the best ARIMA model for a time series consisting of 100 observations. This is the original data. First of all, I performed a combination of ADF and KPSS (following what was posted here and here ) tests which suggested that the original series was not stationary and had a unit root. After differentiating once, I ran the tests again and no indication of unit root was shown. In addition to that, I couldn't reject the null for the KPSS test. After that, I used auto.arima (focusing on BIC criteria for model selection). I also created a pool of models and ranked them according to BIC (which, as expected, did not match the auto.arima suggestion). This is a data.frame that I created with each model's specification and it's corresponding BIC value. After that, I started testing the residuals of each model: Ran several normality tests (JB, SW, K-S) as well as plots for visual identification of 'normality'. So far, no issues here for any model. The problem appears when I run the Ljung-Box test to test for correlation of the residuals. For every model that I tested, the residuals appear to be correlated. For one particular model, I even tested for the presence of ARCH effect (using Q and LM tests) and there were signs of such effect. So this is the first question: is it possible that this effect is due to the small sample, disregardless of the model chosen? Or is it possible that I need to differentiate again in order to eliminate this issue? Among the models in the table, there are some that require differentiation a second time. Did that, tested for autocorrelation (again, using Ljung-Box test) in the residuals and couldn't reject the null. All this is shown in the next image: Am I failing to identify the presence of unit root after differentiation for the first time? Is it auto.arima as well as my function that created a pool of models failing to identify the need for a second differentiation? Or is there any explanation given the size of the data for this issue with the autocorrelation of residuals? If necessary, data can be found here . Thanks in advance!
