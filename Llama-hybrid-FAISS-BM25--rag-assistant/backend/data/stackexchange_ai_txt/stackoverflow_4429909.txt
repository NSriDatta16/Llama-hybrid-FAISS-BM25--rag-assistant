My radio button background is transparent, how do I make it opaque?

Update 1: I followed the directions provided by Archimedes below. Problem is that my API 9 "drawable" folder already has an XML doc titled "btn_radio.xml" and the code inside is exactly the same as you presented above. Now, when I go back to eclipse and tell it: ` ` I get an error message in return saying Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'background' with value '@drawable/btn_radio_on'). So what I did instead is I went to the API 8 folder and looked found the drawable_hdpi and mdpi folders, did a search for btn_radio_off and btn_radio_on and copied those two images into the corresponding API 9 folders. This fixed the issue in Eclipse of radio button backgrounds not showing up. However, when I run my code, the virtual device still displays the old broken (transparent) image.* Original Post: Hi, I'm following a Gingerbread 2.3 (I'm running Win7/Eclipse) tutorial from this site and I'm looking at this image here: http://www.vogella.de/articles/Android/images/first50.gif Each time I add a new radio button to my graphical layout in Main.xml the silver part of the radio button is transparent. So regardless of the background color of the main window, I will only see the outline of a radio button and that radio button will be filled in with the color of the entire background. If I create a grouped item and put two radio buttons in a group, I can get toggle between the two and the green indicator showing which one is toggled is available but the buttons themselves are transparent. How do I make my radio button look like the one in the image above? It seems that no matter how many times I start a "new" project, the problem persists. The only thing that affects it is toggling another "theme" but that's not really a solution once I run the app. Thanks for your help.
