ActiveState hasn't given me any help yet. Whatever. Now I've figured out a workaround for my problem and this workaround looks very weird. First I added some otherwise useless utf-8 encoded characters to my DATA section, like the following: __DATA__ aardvark 'ɑ:dvɑ:k aardwolf 'ɑ:dwulf aasvogel 'ɑ:sfәugәl 3400 Qiū 3401 TIǎN 3404 KUà 3405 Wǔ And then I removed the use utf8; pragma from my script; and then I removed the utf8 flag from the following line of code: open $out,'>:utf8',"./modified.txt"; Now it becomes open $out,'>',"./modified.txt"; But I had to let the following line of code unchanged: open $in,' Then everything was okay except that I'd receive "wide characters in print" warnings. But I added another line of code: no warnings; And then I Perlapped my script and everything worked fine :) This is really strange. I'm suspecting this problem is somehow OS specific. It's also quite likely that there's something wrong with my Windows system. And I also tried Perl2exe and the compiled executable gave me some "memory 0010c4 cannot be read" error. Whatever. My problem is somehow fixed by myself :)
