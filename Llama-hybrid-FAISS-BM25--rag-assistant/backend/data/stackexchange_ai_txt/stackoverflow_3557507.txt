Haskell: Escaped character from character

I'm writing a parsec parser which reads in strings and converts escaped characters, as part of exercise 3 here . For that exercise I am using this function: escapedCharFromChar :: Char -> Char escapedCharFromChar c = read $ concat ["'\\",[c],"'"] I am not to impressed with the use of read to convert the character x into the escape character with the name x . Can anyone suggest a more elegant function of type Char -> Char to do this?
