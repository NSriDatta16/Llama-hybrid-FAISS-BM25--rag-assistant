I think you're confused as to where pathForResource: is looking. This works: NSString *plistPath = @"/Users/andrewf/MyApp/Resources/Plates.plist"; Notice that this path does not point to your application. It points to your project directory. Your plist is supposed to be at @/Users/andrewf/MyApp/build/Release/MyApp.app/Resources/Plist.plist" (for an iPhone app this would be different, more like @"/Users/andrewf/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/User/Applicatons/(unique id)/MyApp.app/Resources/Plates.plist" ), and it is inside the Resources folder of your app that pathForResource: is looking. What this implies is that your resource is not in the "Copy Bundle Resources" phase of your build target. You need to drag it from the Groups and Files area to inside that phase.
