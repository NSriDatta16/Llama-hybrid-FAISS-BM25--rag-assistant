What you are doing will "work" but its not very flexible. In practice I have found copying the settings values to a POCO (plain old clr object) to work best, on "reset" you throw the object away, on save, copy the values back and Save(). When you do the binding etc you would bind to the copy of the settings. if you have multiple "sets" of settings this helps keep things organised to. Make sense? Your plan is good though ;-)
