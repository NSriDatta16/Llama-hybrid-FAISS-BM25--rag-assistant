Why is it important to correct for correlated (dependent) measures when reporting Cohen's d?

I am calculating within-group effect sizes from pre-test to post-test. Cohen's d av reports this effect size as a proportion of the average standard deviation (Lakens, 2013) : Meanwhile, Cohen's d rm corrects for the fact that the pre-test and post-test measures are correlated (i.e., dependent): Some argue that d rm should be used instead of d av , because pre-test and post-test scores are not independent of one another ( Cuijpers et al., 2017 ). My question is this: Why is the fact that these measures aren't independent a problem? In other words, why should one adjust the effect size estimate based on the correlation of the pre-test and post-test measures? Consider these two simulated effects: In the correlated example (left), the correlation between pre-test and post-test measures is .9, d av is 1, and d rm is .6. In the uncorrelated example (right), the correlation is .1, d av is still 1, and d rm is also 1. In both examples, the SD at pre-test is 1 and the SD at post-test is 2. Clearly, the average person in the correlated example improved the same amount as the average person in the uncorrelated example. So why "correct" the effect size?
