Methods designed especially for time series work better for such data then black-box machine learning algorithms as shown, for example, in this blog entry . The time-series models take into consideration the time-dependence of your data, while the general purpose methods do not. Of course, you can add to your data additional columns with lags , but then still you would be assuming that $Y_{t-4}$ is some distinct variable that does not have to have anything in common with $Y_{t-3}$, or $Y_{t-5}$... You could think of some more complicated transformation of your data so to try to imitate what the time-series models do, but then, why to re-invent the wheel..? As about H2O, you should ask the authors. (However, as it is a general purpose machine learning software, so I doubt they will be interested in implementing some specialized models.)
