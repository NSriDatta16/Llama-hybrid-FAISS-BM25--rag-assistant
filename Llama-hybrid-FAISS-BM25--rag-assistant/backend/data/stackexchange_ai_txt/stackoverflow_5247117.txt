If I understand the question you are talking about HTML5 offline mode. This is what I think is the best approach: With Wicket.Ajax.registerPreCallHandler() you can add an interceptor (a function) that will check window.offline and either let the ajax call go to the server or suppress it and execute some custom JavaScript that will save the related data in browser's DB (see localStorage, IndexedDB, web sql database). I.e. it is your job to decide what to happen when linkX is clicked and there is no internet connection. In this case you'll need also to subscribe for "ononline" event and upload the collected data when the connection is back. Sounds like a fun project. Good luck!
