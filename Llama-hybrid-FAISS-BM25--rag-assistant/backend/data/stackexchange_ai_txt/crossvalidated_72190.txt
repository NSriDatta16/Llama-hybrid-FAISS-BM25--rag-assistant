If I understand correctly, you are asking that; given there is a true underlying model, e.g. y = f(A,B) , will any of the above learners discover and return the mathematical form of that relationship. The answer is no. Although, something like a neural network is sometimes called a universal function approximator, it is often discarded in favor of a more explainable model, like a linear model. In that case, the mathematical form is known. For what you are describing, the use of evolutionary algorithms (e.g. genetic programming) are often used to find mathematical relationships between input predictors and output response. If you are only asking if they can find some complex hidden relationships, without necessarily revealing the mathematical form of the model, then I agree with bayerj-- Yes.
