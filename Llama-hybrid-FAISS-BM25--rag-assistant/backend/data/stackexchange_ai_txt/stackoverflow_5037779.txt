Updating JTable after inline edit

I have 2 classes, one to make a frame and the other to handle and implement the interface TableModel. When editing cells inline and updating the values in the class that implements TableModel I then need to refresh the table to show the updated data (as the table needs to auto sort thus when I inline edit a cell the rows may need to be re-ordered). The problem I'm having is after updating the data I can't figure out how to refresh the table, I've tried a hacky way of refreshing it when you click off the cell or press enter but I feel there could be a more elegant solution, any ideas?
