As of iOS 3.2 UIScrollView does not listen to touchesBegan:, touchesMoved:, touchesEnded:, etc. anymore, afaik. You should add Gesture Recognizers instead to handle touch events in your UIScrollView. http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uikit/reference/UIGestureRecognizer_Class/Reference/Reference.html But if you want to handle the touches in one of the UIScrollView's subviews, it would be best to read the Overview section in the UIScrollView documentation. See touchesShouldBegin:withEvent:inContentView: , pagingEnabled , and delaysContentTouches , among others. http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIScrollView_Class/Reference/UIScrollView.html
