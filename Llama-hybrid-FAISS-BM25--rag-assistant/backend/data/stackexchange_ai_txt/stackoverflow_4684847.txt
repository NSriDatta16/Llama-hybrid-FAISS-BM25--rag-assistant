Flex validator issue

I'm working with flex 3.5 and I have a problem with a validator. I have a field that dynamically has o has not an asigned validator, the problem is that in a specific moment the field haven't the validator assigned but the textInput had a red border. I dont know what do I have to remove the red marker? Here is an example of my validator: This is the validator: I have a textInput named ccNumberTextInput and a combo named cardTypeCbx When I have to set the validator: validatorArr = new Array(); validatorArr.push(ccV); validateForm(); And when I don't need it: validatorArr = new Array(); validateForm(); The validateForm Function is: private function validateForm():void { var validatorErrorArray:Array = Validator.validateAll(validatorArr); isFormValid = validatorErrorArray.length == 0; } And I have a button that been enable or disable because it has a binding with a boolean var isFormValid. The most weird thing is that when remove the validator the button becomes enables but the red border is still in the textInput. Thanks in advanced.
