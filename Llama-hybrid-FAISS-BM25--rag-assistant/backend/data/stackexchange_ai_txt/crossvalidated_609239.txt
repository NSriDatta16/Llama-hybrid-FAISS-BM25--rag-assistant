One of the conditioning techniques used for Bayesian inference is grid approximation. This takes a finite grid of values (say 100 values from 0 to 1), and generates a continuous posterior distribution based off these values. Some more information on this technique can be found at this link: https://pub.towardsai.net/bayesian-inference-how-grid-approximation-works-e2c79a516c49
