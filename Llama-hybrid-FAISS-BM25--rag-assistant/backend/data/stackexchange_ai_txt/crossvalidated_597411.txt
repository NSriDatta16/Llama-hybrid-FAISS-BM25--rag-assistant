Modelling predictor as quadratic term lowers BIC but marginal effect plot shows linear distribution?

I am using a modified Hosmer Lemeshaw approach, culminating in all possible combinations model selection, to conduct multiple logistic regression that should distinguish between use (1) and available points (0). I used univariate models to determine whether predictors should be modelled as linear terms or quadratic terms by building models as follows: linmod If quadmod was associated with an AIC value less than 2 smaller than that associated with linmod , I allowed the predictor in question to be either quadratic or linear in the final all possible combinations approach (dredge function). The all possible combinations approach led to a top model that included a positive quadratic term ( DecScatOG ). Model performance was good according to ROC AUC, cross validation and pseudo R2. BUT when I plotted the predicted effect of the predictor in question (i.e., marginal effect), I got a distribution that doesn't look very quadratic at all. It looks super linear! plot_model(FinalModel, type = "pred", terms = "DecScatOG", ci.lvl = 0.95) I removed the term I(DecScatOG^2) from the model, retaining only DecScatOG (i.e., retaining the predictor as a linear term, but not a quadratic term). Doing so increased BIC by ~ 11. The marginal effects plot still looked like a linear distribution, as follows: I'm very confused about how modelling a predictor as a quadratic could lower BIC if the 'quadratic' term really doesn't look like it fits a quadratic distribution... For context, the variable in question, DecScatOG is decay distance to nearest scat. It's a transformed variable so that 0 is at the scat, and 1 is > ~50 m from the scat. Transformation occurred prior to model construction. Thank you so much for any help!
