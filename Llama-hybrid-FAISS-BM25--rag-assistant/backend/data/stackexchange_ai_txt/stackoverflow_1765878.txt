Well the scenario that you have mentioned is generally where one has to use a queue rather than a persistent storage to meet the throughput needs. On searching on the net you can find a lot of case studies for the same where people have employed queuing systems to enhance the throughput of the system. SQL server can just not scale to that levels. In special cases when your need to make your queue persistent very special methods are used as to how to mitigate the performance effects because of this. For ex. Apache's ActiveMQ has its own special file storage system which performs much better compared to simply using a MySQL for the backend persistence. Probably MSMQ also provides a similar option but am not sure.
