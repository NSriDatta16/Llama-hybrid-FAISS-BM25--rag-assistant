i wrote a recipe for Adobe Cookbooks a while back that might help you with this. basically, i found it much much easier to completely forgo using the span and paragraph elements in favor of focusing primarily on container controllers. hope it helps: Generating a formatted TextFlow Layout for plain text assets Update for dynamic containers, you could probably use an end of line delimiter to determine your target string, along with it's string length, font size, padding, etc., you could find the required size for your container and change the size of your container accordingly by calling: targetFlow.flowComposer.getControllerAt(controllerIndex).getContentBounds().width; //and/or targetFlow.flowComposer.getControllerAt(controllerIndex).getContentBounds().height; here is another recipe i wrote which automatically changes the font size of a text flow to fit inside its container: Automating font size for TextFlow containers but instead of changing the font size as i have done, you could change the container size to fit your text. i hope this helps.
