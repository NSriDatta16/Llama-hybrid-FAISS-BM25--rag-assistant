The Filesystems and storage lab from Stony Brook published a rather extensive performance (and energy) evaluation on file data compression on server systems at IBM's SYSTOR systems research conference this year: paper at ACM Digital Library , presentation . The results depend on the used compression algorithm and settings, the file workload and the characteristics of your machine. For example, in the measurements from the paper, using a textual workload and a server environment using lzop with low compression effort are faster than plain write, but bzip and gz aren't . In your specific setting, you should try it out and measure. It really might improve performance, but it is not always the case.
