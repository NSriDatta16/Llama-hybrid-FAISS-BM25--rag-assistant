How long does it take to capture 42 balls if it takes 5 mins in average to capture 1

I saw this problem somewhere and I don't really know what to do with it. Here is the question: Suppose that there is 42 Pok√©mon balls and that in average it takes you 5 minutes to catch one ball. How long does it take before you capture all 42 balls? You can use any software you like but be sure to state your assumptions. I don't know where to begin honestly. I was thinking maybe I would create a random variable for this 42 balls. So maybe $X_i$ signifies the time taken to catch ball $i$ and that I can only be able to catch one ball at a time. So what I will be ultimately computing is $Z_i = X_1 +...+X_n$ I am thinking that $X_i$ ~ Normal distribution with mean 5, but I don't know what to do with the variance. I cant really think of any distribution with one parameter that might be appropriate. Then I am thinking to generate numbers with R from this distribution. Clearly I don't know what to do exactly with the problem so if anyone has any thoughts, I would love to hear it!
