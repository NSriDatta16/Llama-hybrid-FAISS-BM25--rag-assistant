Finding the vectors/modes "maximally responsible" for the fluctutation of a quantity?

I have a question which I fear might be simple but i am completely unable to figure out. Lets say we have a time-series of a vector of coordinates which define a molecule ( column vector of x,y,z) coordinates. This is just a simple trajectory. This trajectory also has a time-series of another quantity eg. energy. Both the coordinates and the energy fluctuate with time. I want to find out the vectors( which might be linear combination of the coordinates) which are maximally responsible for this fluctuation. I feel this is a kind of eigenvalue problem, but I cant to seem to figure it out. While a PCA/SVD of just the time-series coordinates can tell me which directions are active the most, how do I relate the correlation of energy fluctuation ? *Edit: By "maximally responsible" I mean the fluctuation in the value of direction along time( which might be a linear combination of the coordiantes ) would have the best overlap with the fluctuation of the energy quantity. So there should be something which measures/quantifies how much two time-series are similar/correlated to each other. There should be a way to compute which linear combination of the input-basis correlates best which the energy fluctuation. I apologize for lack of correct maths nomenclature which is due to lack of my knowledge.
