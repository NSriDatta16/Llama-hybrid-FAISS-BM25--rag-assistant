DO178 Level D would be doubtful and higher would be impossible. The Lua VM uses lots of dynamic memory allocation. For Level A you need to show source to object code tracability. I don't see you doing that in Lua. Also there is no ready made tools for everything you need. Doing everything yourself is not really an option once you realise all the work required on level C or higher. Using recognized tools with ready certification packs makes it a lot easier. Is there any statement and branch coverage tools for Lua? Is this tool qualified? As you said certification is like case law and authorities know C and is not going to question anything if you use C. As soon as you use anything else you are opening yourself up for all kinds of questions about interpretation and implementation. I would love to use Ruby on a aircraft but I know it is not going to happen.
