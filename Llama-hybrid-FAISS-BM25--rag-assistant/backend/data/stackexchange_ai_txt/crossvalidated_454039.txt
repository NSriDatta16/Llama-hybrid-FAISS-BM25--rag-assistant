Treat the general modeling approach as a hyperparameter: this part of your overall training and should be decided within the training set (so e.g. using a cross validation within the training data). If you "flatten" the hyperparameter grid you evaluate, that can be done together with the optimization of the other hyperparameters. As an example with two modeling approaches that both need hyperparameters tuned: hyperparameter set | model | k | C | Î³ -------------------+-------+----+-----+--- 1 | SVM | NA | 1 | 1 2 | SVM | NA | 10 | 1 : | : | : | : | : 26 | SVM | NA | 1e4 | 10 27 | kNN | 1 | NA | NA : | : | : | : | : 50 | kNN | 5 | NA | NA
