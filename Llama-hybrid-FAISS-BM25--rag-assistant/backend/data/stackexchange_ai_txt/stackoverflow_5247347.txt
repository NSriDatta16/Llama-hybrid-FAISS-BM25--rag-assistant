Trying to use ORDER BY with average values

I need to sort values from an SQL table according to the averages of certain values. My 'Exams' table looks like this: +------------+------------+------+ | Exam | Student_ID |Points| +------------+------------+------- | Math | 3 | 20 | |Accounts I | 23 | NULL | |Statistics | 12 | 15 | |Accounts II | 3 | 21 | +------------+------------+------+ Here's the query I've attempted: SELECT Student_ID FROM Exams GROUP BY Student_ID ORDER BY avg(POINTS) desc My aim is to get the student ID of the student with the highest average rating, in this case, 3 Is my approach correct, or is there an error lurking in there? How will I be able to handle NULL values in the Points column?
