[Java error]Cannot find anything named "number"

I'm making a calculator in Java using Processing as a framework. I'm writing a class that stores number input so that it can be retrieved later on. //store numbers in memory class memStorage { float storedNum1, storedNum2; //constructor void Memory(float num1, float num2){ storedNum1 = num1; storedNum2 = num2; } //Store numbers and call them when needed //Store the first number void mem1(float num1){ num1 = number; println("number 1 has been stored"); } //Store the second number void mem2(float num2){ num2 = number; println("number 2 has been stored"); } } void processNumber(char number){ //Instantiate memory storage class and execute method memStorage storedNum1 = new memStorage(); storedNum1.mem1(); //print keypressed numbers println(storedNum1); } When I run the sketch in processing it gives me an error that says: Cannot find anything named "number" I'm sort of stuck as to what I'm supposed to do to get this to work. Any advice is appreciated.
