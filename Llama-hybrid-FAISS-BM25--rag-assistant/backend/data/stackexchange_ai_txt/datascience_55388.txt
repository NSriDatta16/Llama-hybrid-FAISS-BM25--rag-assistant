Tweedie Loss for Keras

We are currently using XGBoost model with Tweedie loss for solving a regression problem which works very good, now I wanted to move our model to Keras and experience with neural networks, do anybody know how I can implement Tweedie loss for Keras? I only care about the instance when p=1.5 which gives us the best result in XGBoost. Thanks
