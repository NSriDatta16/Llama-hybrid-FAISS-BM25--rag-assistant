If your sprites have unique IDs, and you can use a Dictionary, then what's the question? Dictionary is definitely faster. The average search on a Vector or Array takes, at best, O(log(n)) time. Though you can only achieve that if your Vector is sorted, which means spending time elsewhere to ensure it stays sorted. If you don't sort it then you have to scan, which means O(n). Dictionaries (variously known as hashtables, maps), when implemented right (and I can only assume that what Actionscript provides is implemented right) guarantee O(1) access time. You pay for that in more memory. The O(1) hides some constant times that are higher than those of Vector searches, so for small lists of items Vector would be more efficient. However, from the description of your problem it sounds like a no-brainer.
