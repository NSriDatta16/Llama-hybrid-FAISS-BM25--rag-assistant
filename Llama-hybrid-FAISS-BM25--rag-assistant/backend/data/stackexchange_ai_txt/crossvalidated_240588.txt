Statistical significance of classifiers with p value

I have the following accuracy results of 10 fold cross validation for different machine learning algorithms, My question is how can I identify whether the algorithm results are statistically significant? And how can I measure their p-value. I have asked a similar question here I realise that I literally don't know anything about the statistical terms, p-values, ttest etc... So I am kindly asking you, either with python or matlab, how I can prove their are statistically significant. Thank you soooo much.
