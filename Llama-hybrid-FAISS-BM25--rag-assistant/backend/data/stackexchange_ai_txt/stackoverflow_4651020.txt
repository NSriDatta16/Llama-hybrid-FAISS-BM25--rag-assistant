For what you are looking for I would say that javascript is the best you could do. You can retrieve the encrypted data onto the server and decrypt it using javascript on the client side. No transmission of password, no secret for the user. It depends which encryption algorithm you are using but there is libraries for that (for example Stanford Javascript Crypto Library ) (but I don't understand why are you talking about cookies) If you are interested in the storage aspect rather than the cryptography aspect, perhaps you might consider Thomas Frank's session variables
