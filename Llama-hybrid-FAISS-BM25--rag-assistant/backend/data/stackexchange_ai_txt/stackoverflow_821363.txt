How do I use an NSFormatter subclass with an NSPopUpButton

I want to use an NSFormatter subclass to format the contents of an NSPopUpButton I'm using to display a list of choices. Basically I have an NSArray of MyObjects which is bound to the NSPopUpButton via the Content Values binding and I want to display something in the pop up menu other than what is returned by -description. I don't really want to use a transformer because then I have to create an entirely new array and transform each object into a string before adding it to the new array. Using setFormatter: on the NSPopUpButton itself via either IB or code doesn't work, I suspect because only the formatter for the individual cell is applied to the items in the list. Is there an easy way to set a formatter for all the cells of the NSPopUpButton? Basically I want to just be able to set it once and forget about it.
