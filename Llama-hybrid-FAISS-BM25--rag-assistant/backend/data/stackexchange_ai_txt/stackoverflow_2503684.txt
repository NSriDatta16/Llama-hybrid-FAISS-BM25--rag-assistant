I'd recommend definitely using revision control for solo development. It doesn't matter too much which you use, SVN, Git, Hg, etc. The reason why is that it allows you to rollback in the event of regressive bug, loss of code, corruption, and of course branching and merging capabilities (you should always develop in a branch and only merge with trunk when the new feature/bug is full tested), etc. All these things (and more) you won't be able to leverage without a version control system.
