Easiest way to do SSLSocketServer (certificate generation at runtime)

I want a simple way to create a SSLServerSocket. I would like for a self-signed certificate to be generated and used at runtime because the data needs to be protected, but it isn't super important that it is very, very secure. I found tutorials on making an SSLServerSocket but they assume that you had a proper certificate. Psuedo-code, code examples and a simple paragraph are all acceptable answers.
