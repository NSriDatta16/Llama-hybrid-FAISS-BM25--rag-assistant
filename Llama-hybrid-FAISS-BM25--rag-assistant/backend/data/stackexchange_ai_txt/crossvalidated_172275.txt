For the fused score, there will be a decision boundary $y=f(x)$, where $x$ is the face score (say) and $y$ the fingerprint score, such that the subject is declared genuine iff $y\ge f(x)$. Let's say that the scores are normalised to $[0,1]$ such that a fraction $1-x$ of random imposters have score bigger than $x$. The probability that a team of two independent random imposters can beat the system is then $$ 1\ -\ \int_0^1\!f(x)dx $$ For one random imposter, the probability depends on whether random people's face and fingerprint scores (relative to the genuine subject) are correlated or not. I'm unfamiliar with the literature, but I suspect there's a working assumption of uncorrelated. If, in fact, face and fingerprint scores are positively correlated (which seems just about plausible) then the formula above underestimates the single random imposter's chances. So, mathematically speaking, one random imposter probably has the same or (perhaps slightly) better chance than two random imposters of breaking the system. But are "random" impersonations really the right thing to consider? It might be practical, with a small dose of luck (possession of a good photograph) and a reasonable amount of work, for a criminal mastermind to find a near-match before attacking any single-factor system (e.g. face recogniser), raising his chances by a factor of 100, say. So the practical probability of impersonating a single-factor system may be 100 (say) times the random probability. In a two-factor system, the criminal mastermind could (a) search for a single reasonably-close-matching individual and, as before, hope for 100 times impersonation gain over random; or (b) split his search for near face- and fingerprint-matches into two teams, each achieving a factor of 50 improvement on random, for a practical-vs-random gain of 2500 overall. So, yes, the practical impersonation probability does indeed depend on whether you attack the system with one or two imposters. In summary, your two scenarios (one attacker or two) are probably so close mathematically in the random case that it makes no difference. I don't know the literature, but I suspect it's random-case figures that get quoted. On the other hand, there is a very large difference in the practical chances of a gang with sufficient collateral (grainy photos, mucky fingerprints etc) in the two scenarios, and perhaps the literature could do with being clearer on that subject.
