What you describe is a bit weird - the maximized window can't usually be moved. In particular it occupies the whole desktop area, and AFAIK the system doesn't 'drag' it when its caption (i.e. - the area for which hit test was HT_CAPTION ) is dragged. Can you please specify more info: How many desktops do you have (is it a multi-monitor system)? Do you respond on WM_GETMINMAXINFO to prevent your window from occupying the whole desktop area? BTW I can imagine a workaround: when your window is maximized - don't return HT_CAPTION on hit test. Instead you may return HT_CLIENT , this will prevent your window from dragging. However you'll have to manually implement "restoring" of your window when double-clicked. You should then respond on WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK and restore your position manually.
