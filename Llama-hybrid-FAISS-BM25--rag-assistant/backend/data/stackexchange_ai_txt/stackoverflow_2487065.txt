Calculate initial velocity to move a set distance with inertia

I want to move something a set distance. However in my system there is inertia/drag/negative accelaration. I'm using a simple calculation like this for it: v = oldV + ((targetV - oldV) * inertia) Applying that over a number of frames makes the movement 'ramp up' or decay, eg: v = 10 + ((0 - 10) * 0.25) = 7.5 // velocity changes from 10 to 7.5 this frame So I know the distance I want to travel and the acceleration, but not the initial velocity that will get me there. Maybe a better explanation is I want to know how hard to hit a billiard ball so that it stops on a certain point. I've been looking at Equations of motion ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion ) but can't work out what the correct one for my problem is... Any ideas? Thanks - I am from a design not science background. Update: Fiirhok has a solution with a fixed acceleration value; HTML+jQuery demo: http://pastebin.com/ekDwCYvj Is there any way to do this with a fractional value or an easing function? The benefit of that in my experience is that fixed acceleration and frame based animation sometimes overshoots the final point and needs to be forced, creating a slight snapping glitch.
