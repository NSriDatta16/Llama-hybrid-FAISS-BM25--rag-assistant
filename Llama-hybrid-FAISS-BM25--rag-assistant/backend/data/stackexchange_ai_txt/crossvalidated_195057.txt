Odds ratio discriminatory power

In logistic regression, logit Y = ax1+ bx2 +cx3. a variable has a coefficient attached to it. So we can directly measure the change in y per unit change in x. Can I get a similar relationship from odds ratio? per unit change in x contributing to how much change in y. Basically I want to understand the contribution to score. E.g. a variable has odds of 20:1 compared to 6:1
