You can use image bugs aka tracking pixels (because they are usually invisible 1x1 images). Don't expect this to be 100% reliable, since there's a chance that because of that email clients will flag your emails as spam. Some clients just won't request images at all. That's how litmus tracks their emails, with several metrics: whether an email was forwarded, printed, how long it's been read, etc. Their foundation is... Image bugs. I explained how each of those work here . Embedding any kind of javascript code will increase the likelihood of a spam flag by orders of magnitude. Don't do that.
