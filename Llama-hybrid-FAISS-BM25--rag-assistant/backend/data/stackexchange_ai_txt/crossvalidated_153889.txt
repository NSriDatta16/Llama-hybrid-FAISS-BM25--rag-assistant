Insignificant coefficients in Logistic Regression after LASSO variable selection

I am trying to use the LASSO technique to identify which variables to include in my model. I used cross validation to identify the value of lambda which minimizes the CV error. For this minimal value of lambda, I get the list of variables with non zero coefficients. I then ran a logistic regression including the variables with non zero coefficients, that I got from the LASSO output. However, when I view the model summary many of the variables are highly insignificant (as per the $p$-value of the coefficient) Is that expected? Or am I doing something wrong here? I am using the glmnet package in R.
