RoR: clear_link per record

I'm talking half-ruby half-english in the following paragraph I have Person s and I have 'Pet's. Person has_many Pet . I have a table of Person s displayed with pets included in the cell, like: def pets_column(record) if record.pets.count == 0 'no pets' else record.pets.collect{|p| html_escape(p.to_label) }.join(' ') end end It is displayed correctly and it is a link which displays a nested table for the pets. I want to decide that it should be a link or not on a per record basis according to some condition. For example if record_frozen_at is not null then the Pet list of the record also must be frozen. (No addition, no removal, no update for those pets) (The columns[:pets].clear_link does it for the whole table not on a per record basis.)
