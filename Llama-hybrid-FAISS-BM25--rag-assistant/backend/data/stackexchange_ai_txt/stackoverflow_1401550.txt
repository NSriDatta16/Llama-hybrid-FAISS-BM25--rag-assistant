I went through a similar path as it sounds like you are trying to go through, so let me tell you what I did and you can pick and choose: Where should I start to learn about virtualization & cloud computing? I learned about virtualization by example. If you've got a spare Linux box around, put Xen or KVM on it and play with some virtual machines. I used older versions of the guides in the previous links and found them to be extremely straightforward and easy to follow. And since cloud computing just adds a few more pieces on top of virtualization (such as network isolation for VMs), learning virtualization takes care of most of that. Anything from articles to academic papers to blogs to books would be great. I would like to learn everything I can from architecture to deployment on cloud Here's a link to an article about Amazon's Dynamo, a chunk of the underlying storage system / database that lies under a large part of Amazon's architecture. An open-source implementation of the Amazon AWS APIs is Eucalyptus , which you may want to try out if you have multiple Linux machines you're not using. More info describing the architecture of that can be found here .
