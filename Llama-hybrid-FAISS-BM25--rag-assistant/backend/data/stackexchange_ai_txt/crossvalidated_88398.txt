Model selection with Firth logistic regression

In a small data set ($n\sim100$ ) that I am working with, several variables give me perfect prediction/separation . I thus use Firth logistic regression to deal with the issue. If I select the best model by AIC or BIC , should I include the Firth penalty term in the likelihood when computing these information criteria?
