The box-Cox transformation is used for the dependent (response) variable in regression, and with logistic regression the response is binary, and transforming a binary variable do not make much sense. If you think about something like Box-Cox for transforming predictors, that is known as Box-Tidwell transformation, but I guess that today using splines is a better idea. Or maybe you just want some way to investigate the linearity of the relationship in logistic regression. That have been asked many times on site, below some relevant earlier posts. See also the comments thread to this post. Investigating robustness of logistic regression against violation of linearity of logit Solution in case of violation of the linearity assumption in the logistic regression model? (possibly in R) Testing nonlinearity in logistic regression (or other forms of regression) Why does including $x\ln(x)$ interaction term in logistic regression model helps to assess linearity assumption?
