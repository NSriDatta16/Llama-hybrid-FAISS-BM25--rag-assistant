This is not a complete answer but I hope it gives you some ideas as to how to model the situation in a coherent manner. Assumptions The values at the lower end of the scale follow a normal distribution truncated from below. The values at the upper end of the scale follow a normal distribution truncated from above. (Note: I know that you said that the data is not normal but I am assuming that you are referring to the distribution of all the values whereas the above assumptions pertain to the values at the lower and the upper end of the scale.) A person's underlying state (whether they have TB or not) follows a first-order markov chain. Model Let: $D_i(t)$ be 1 if at time $t$ the $i^\mbox{th}$ person has TB and 0 otherwise, $RTB_i(t)$ be the test response to the TB test at time $t$ of the the $i^\mbox{th}$ person, $RN_i(t)$ be the test response to the NILL test at time $t$ of the the $i^\mbox{th}$ person, $f(RN_i(t) | D_i(t)=0) \sim N(\mu_l,\sigma_l^2) I(RN_i(t) > R_l)$ $f(RN_i(t) | D_i(t)=1) \sim N(\mu_l,\sigma_l^2) I(RN_i(t) > R_l)$ Points 4 and 5 capture the idea that a person's response to the NILL test is not dependent on disease status. $f(RTB_i(t) | D_i(t)=0) \sim N(\mu_l,\sigma_l^2) I(RTB_i(t) > R_l)$ $f(RTB_i(t) | D_i(t)=1) \sim N(\mu_u,\sigma_u^2) I(RTB_i(t) $\mu_u > \mu_l$ Points 6, 7 and 8 capture the idea that a person's response to the TB test is dependent on disease status. $p(t)$ be the probability that a person's catches TB during the 6 months preceding time $t$ given that they were disease free during the previous test period. Thus, the state transition matrix would like the one below: $\begin{bmatrix} 1-p(t) & p(t) \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ In other words, $Prob(D_i(t)=1 | D_i(t-1) = 0) = p(t)$ $Prob(D_i(t)=0 | D_i(t-1) = 0) = 1-p(t)$ $Prob(D_i(t)=1 | D_i(t-1) = 1) = 1$ $Prob(D_i(t)=0 | D_i(t-1) = 1) = 0$ Your test criteria states that: $\hat{D}_i(t) = \begin{cases} 1, & RTB_i(t) - RN_i(t) \ge 0.35 \\ 0, & otherwise \end{cases}$ However, as you see from the structure of the model you can actually parameterize the cut-offs and change the whole problem to that of what should be your cut-offs to accurately diagnose patients. Thus, the wobbler problem seems to be more an issue with your choice of cut-offs rather than anything else. In order to choose the 'right' cut-offs, you can take historical data about patients definitively identified as having TB and estimate the resulting parameters of the above setup. You could use some criteria such as number of patients correctly classified as having TB or not as a metric to identify the 'best' model. For simplicity, you could assume that $p(t)$ to be a time invariant parameter which seems reasonable in the absence of epidemics etc. Hope that is useful.
