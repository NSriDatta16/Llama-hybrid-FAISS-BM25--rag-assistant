SQL Managment Studio 2008 R2 dual monitor support?

I have a question. If it is possible to achieve I may just jump with joy. As many of you undoubtedly already know, Visual Studio 2010 has support that allows you to drag and position your open files within a project. For example you have Page.aspx and Page.aspx.cs open. You can drag the tab and position it around. You can dock it in parts of visual studion, but you can also allow it to float as a separate window. I am wondering. Can the same thing be done with Microsoft SQL Managment Studio 2008 R2? This would be extremely useful when I need to view a stored procedure or table and work on another stored procedure or table. I would love to be able to somehow drag out the tab to my second monitor. If there isn't any built in functionality for this, is there any third party add-ons available? If not, does anybody have any tricks that they use?
