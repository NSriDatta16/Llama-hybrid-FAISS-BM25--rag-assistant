Weird behviour of creating graphics from a form's handle

EDIT: sorry, my bad, i forgot a line. and those are clean conditions (completely new project) Form frm = new Form(); Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromHwnd(frm.Handle); frm.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None; frm.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized; frm.TransparencyKey = Color.Magenta; frm.ShowDialog(); with, and without the second line, i get two quite different results.. some why, when i create the graphics object from the form handle, it does not maximize the form... am i the only one it happen to? do you have any idea why does it happen (to me, or, at all)? thanks a lot.
