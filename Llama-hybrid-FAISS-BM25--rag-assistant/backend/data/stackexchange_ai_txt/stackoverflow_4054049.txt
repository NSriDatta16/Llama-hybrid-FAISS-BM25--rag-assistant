I can't give any recommondations, as I'm searching for a service to implement for many clients myself. However, perhaps I can help anyone else who is also looking. It seems there are a couple type of services: Encoding Zencoder Encoding.com PandaStream Ankoder HeyWatch Encoding, hosting and video players Ooyala Brightcove 23 Video In looking at these services, a few things to consider: API supported features Progress calls, encoding complete pings, job tracking, output formats XML or JSON or both Authentication techniques (oauth etc) Direct client uploads (no proxy to your server) Storage of complete video Temp storage, FTP to your server, Amazon S3 Availability of direct (if hosted) url for each format Encoding formats All HTML 5 formats (mp4 h264, ogg etc) Mobile encoding support (special settings for android) Support SLAs? Phone/email/turn over time? Cost (many different payment types) Time of video Number & Time of outputs Filesize (input/output) Large volume discounts
