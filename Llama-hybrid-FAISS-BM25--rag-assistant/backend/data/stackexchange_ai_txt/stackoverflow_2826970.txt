UITouch object behaving oddly

I wanted to get points where user is touching on the screen therefore I wrote following code which will fire when user will touch somewhere on the screen -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; UITouch *touch = [[UITouch alloc] init]; touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:self]; if (CGRectContainsPoint([dob frame], point)) { [self showDatePickerforDOB:YES]; } } but this code is giving run time error. Upon debugging it was revealed that locationInView is not recognized as a function of touch object on the other hand it is documented in iphone class reference documentation. When I changed code to exclude alloc i.e UITouch *touch; touch = [touches anyObject]; then locationInView is perfectly working fine. Any ideas why UITouch *touch = [[UITouch alloc] init]; is giving runtime error.
