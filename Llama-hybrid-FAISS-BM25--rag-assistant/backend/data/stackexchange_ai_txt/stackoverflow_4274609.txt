C++ Collections : how to create a map like structure

What kind of collection method would store a pair (key and value) where the key isn't unique (which technically doesn't make it a key I think)? Somewhere in my program I have: typedef struct { int nKey; string strFormType; } KeyPair; Then I'll store objects in a vector using this struct. vector vKeyList; KeyPair MenuOne; MenuOne.nKey = 1; MenuOne.strFormType = "Window"; vKeyList.push_back(MenuOne); MenuOne.nKey = 0; MenuOne.strFormType = "Window2"; vKeyList.push_back(MenuOne); MenuOne.nKey = 1; MenuOne.strFormType = "WindowC"; vKeyList.push_back(MenuOne); This is basically how I want to store objects in the vector. My problem is, If I'm to store like a hundred KeyPairs, I should be doing it in a loop and just read off the KeyPairs from a storage then push_back it the the vector. What if I have to store these KeyPairs: KEY WINDOW 1 Window 0 Window2 1 WindowC 3 Windowfoo 1 Window and so on... I couldn't store it in a map because you have to have a unique key. The keys of the KeyPairs I have aren't unique. Any suggestion?
