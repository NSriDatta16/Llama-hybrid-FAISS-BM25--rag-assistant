Having similar problem. My MSTest tests run with Visual Studio test runner but not R#'s runner. The exception thrown is directly attributable to R# test run not finding the files that have to be deployed (and are specified in the testrunconfig). Tried letting it pick the configured file and specified the file. No dice. Don't know how to "disable code coverage" in the testrunconfig file other than to not specify any (and I don't). Have asked R#. Now asking the StackOverflow audience.
