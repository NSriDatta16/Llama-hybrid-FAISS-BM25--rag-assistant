Multivariate supervised LSTM for for regression only (not for prediction)

I am a beginner with machine learning. I want to get a multivariate regression model with LSTM. I followed this tutorial by Jason Brownlee: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/ In that tutorial the output feature (var1) is also part of the input features, just with another time lag (t and t-1). But what if I don't have the output feature (var1) when I use the model on new data? I want to get a regression model based on 10 input features and one output feature. I want to train the model in a supervised manner (with 10 input and one output feature). The model should then deliver an output sequence (e.g. of 100 values) based on input features. I always have input features, so I don't want to predict without input features. Do you understand what I mean? I want to get a LSTM model in a way of a multiple linear regression model where I can get with some input values an output value. How should I prepare the LSTM model?
