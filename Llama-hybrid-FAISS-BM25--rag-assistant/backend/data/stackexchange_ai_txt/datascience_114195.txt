Which deep learning model is best in terms of instance segmentation and Object detection both?

I am trying to find most efficient and robust Object detector+Segmentation model. I came to know about Mask-rcnn, Yolov5, Yolact, yolov7. As, YOlov7 is new and i read somewhere that yolov7 surpasses all object detectors. Is it true ? If yes kindly elaborate how and let me know your suggestion too that Is there any detector similar to mrcnn or yolov7 available that crosses both ?. I want that model should properly place the mask on object and correctly identify it .
