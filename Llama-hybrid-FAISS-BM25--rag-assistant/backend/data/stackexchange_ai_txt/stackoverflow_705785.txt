return all xml items with same name in linq

how can I query an xml file where I have multiple items with the same name, so that I can get all items back. Currently I only get the first result back. I managed to get it to work with the following code, but this returns all items where the specific search criteria is met. What I want as output is to get two results back where the location is Dublin for example. The question is how can I achieve this with linq to xml Cheers Chris, Here is the code string location = "Oslo"; var training = (from item in doc.Descendants("item") where item.Value.Contains(location) select new { event = item.Element("event").Value, event_location = item.Element("location").Value }).ToList(); The xml file looks like this C# Training Prague Oslo Amsterdam Athens Dublin Helsinki LINQ Training Bucharest Oslo Amsterdam Helsinki Brussels Dublin
