Pay attention to the Range notation. (At least, pay more attention than I initially did!) There is a difference between 0..10 (two dots) and 0...10 (three dots). http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Range.html I enjoy Ruby a great deal. But this dot-dot versus dot-dot-dot thing bugs me. I think that such a subtle dual-syntax "feature" that is: easy to mistype, and easy to miss with your eyes while glancing over the code should not be able to cause devastating off-by-one bugs in my programs.
