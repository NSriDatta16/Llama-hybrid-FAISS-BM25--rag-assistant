If it was development for external clients, I would say that you need to charge a little more for "Emergency" requests. However, short of changing your organisation's internal charging model (and ticking of your F&A branch), there's not much you can do on that end. You have a good case for bringing in one more developer, but of course $$$'s always tight. Frankly, I love FogBUGZ (and to be fair there are other case/incident trackers out there, by FB is my favourite). I can see quickly what I have in the queue and their priority (regardless of project/client). The other pieces of advice I'd give you are these: Advertise the size of your work queue. There may be some internal secrecy required, but perhaps you can post on a wall/website all the project s you have on the go. Get organizational priorities for the existing projects. Someone in your organisation must have an idea of what is needed when, and what is most important - be it the manager, CEO or BOD. . Everything else goes at the end of the queue. . If Bob has an emergency request and you are working on Jim's and Mary's requests; make Bob go through Mary and Jim first to get permission to leap frog them in the queue (or if necessary go above their heads). Or, Bob can choose to push one or more of his projects that are higher in the queue down and replace it with his Emergency request. Either way, it imparts an inherent extra cost on the the emergency request. Things that aren't really emergencies tend not to be called that any more. It kind of like that ER line "Mark every lab request as STAT even if you don't need it right away" e.g., [Jim1] The answer for your internal (and external) clients is almost always yes (sometimes no for technical reasons). However, that "yes" is always followed by a "but". You - Yes bob, we can work on that project for you, but we can't start until around X months from now. bob - That's not good enough You - OK, you have a couple options. If you want to shift some of your other requests around we can push it to the start of your queue, that would get it started in Y months. Bob - Still not good enough You - Well, you can negotiate with Jim and Mary to leapfrog their projects. Bob - They won't budge You - Then go over their heads, and talk to Mr. Dithers` [some time later] You - Yes Mr. Dithers, we can work on Jim's requests. You are aware that will push back Jim and Mary's requests. Mr. Dithers - Yup. You - Aye-Aye Capt'n. [some time later] Jim - Why the $%#$%#$5 aren't you working on my request You - Talk to Mr. Dithers And remember, if EVERYTHING is a top priority, NOTHING is top priority. Edit: Further to FogBUGZ (since you asked), it's more than just issue/bug tracking. You have features requests, inquiries and schedule items too (you might have to upgrade to the latest version to take advantage of those). Use it to its fullest. Make sure that you are including your feature requests in FB. The more you dump into FB the better the picture it will give you. Remember to use the filters and the grid views. FB's got a wiki. Post your groups high level work list there for all to see.
