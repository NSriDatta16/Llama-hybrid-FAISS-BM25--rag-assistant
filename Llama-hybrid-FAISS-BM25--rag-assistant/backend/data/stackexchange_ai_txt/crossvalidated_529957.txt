I work in retail forecasting. When you need to forecast tomorrow's demand for product X at store Y, you only have a limited amount of data available: possibly only the last two years' worth of sales of this particular product at this particular store, or potentially sales of all products at all stores, if you use a cross-learning model. But in any case, you cannot simply create new data. (And creating new data consists in actually running your supermarket and recording sales and inventories, so this is not a trivial matter.) Also, if a worldwide unprecedented pandemic hits you, the value of your data from before that time suddenly becomes dubious indeed, so for practical uses, your amount of data just decreased dramatically. Of course, you are right that certain use cases have practically unlimited data, or can create data on the fly. One example is training networks to play games like chess or go: you can simply let multiple instances of your models play against each other (reinforcement learning).
