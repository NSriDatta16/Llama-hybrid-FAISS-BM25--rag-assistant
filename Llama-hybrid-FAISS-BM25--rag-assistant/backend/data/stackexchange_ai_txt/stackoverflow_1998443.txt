Are you sure you don't want to actually merge the branches? If the working branch has some recent commits you don't want, you can just create a new branch with a HEAD at the point you want. Now, if you really do want to cherry-pick a range of commits, for whatever reason, an elegant way to do this is to just pull of a patchset and apply it to your new integration branch: git format-patch A..B git checkout integration git am *.patch This is essentially what git-rebase is doing anyway, but without the need to play games. You can add --3way to git-am if you need to merge. Make sure there are no other *.patch files already in the directory where you do this, if you follow the instructions verbatim...
