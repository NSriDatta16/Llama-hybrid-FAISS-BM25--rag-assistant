Self driving has to do with the branch of machine learning and data science that focuses on the development, testing, or implementation of autonomous vehicles (AV). These systems are designed to pilot vehicles with little or no human interaction. They used primarily to direct cars, trucks, trains, drones, etc. and rely heavily on concepts like object detection and both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
