How can I simulate a validation group with jquery validation plugin?

I have a form with multiple fields that I'm validating. I have organized my controls into 2 fieldsets: MASTER and DETAIL. I use the Save button to submits the form and the Add button to add a new item to my array of objects, where I store temporarily the data entered trough the DETAIL inputs that then I'll send to the server along with the data of the MASTER part. The problem is that when I press the Add button and I still haven't filled in the MASTER inputs, I can't go on adding a new detail because of the Master validation. And similarly, when I attempt to submit the form and the DETAIL fields are empty the Detail validation fires. My question is: Is it possible to simulate a validation group with jQuery validation plugin?
