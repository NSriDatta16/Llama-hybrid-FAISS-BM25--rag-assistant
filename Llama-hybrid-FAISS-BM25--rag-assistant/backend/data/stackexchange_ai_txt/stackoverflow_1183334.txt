A Twitter client ends up being a good way to get started with WPF, for a few reasons: It's got lists of data with images, which gives you practice with formatting and styling lists There are a lot of options for styling what you're working on - partly due to the avatars, limited text blocks, etc. A Twitter app is the kind of application where you expect to see good UI There are some good libraries availble (I highly reccommed tweet#) so you don't need to bother with any of the plumbing It's something you can show off and be proud of - people will understand what it does There are plenty of complex things you can add on later if you want - skinning, drag and drop, autocomplete, spell checking, etc. There are some open source WPF clients out there, so you can find some sample code if you get stuck And the number 1 reason why it's good idea... you can start contributing your code to the Witty project . We'd love more help!
