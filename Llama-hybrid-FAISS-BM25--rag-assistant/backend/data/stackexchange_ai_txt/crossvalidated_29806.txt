What is a "polynomially bounded" function, and why is this a requirement of the The Delta Method?

I am reading a paper "A note on the Delta Method" by Gary Oehlert, JASA, 1992 . I am trying to estimate the variance of a function of a random variable, but first I want to understand the limitations of using the Delta Method Taylor series. Oehlert states:$^1$ when the function we are approximating is polynomially bounded in the random variables, then the naive Taylor series approximation will yield the correct asymptotic approximation..." How can I tell if a function is polynomially bounded? Why is this a requirement of using the naive Taylor series approximation? Is the alternative to a naive Taylor seires a higher-order Taylor series or a different approximation? $^1$ p 28, middle of right col, last paragraph before Examples
