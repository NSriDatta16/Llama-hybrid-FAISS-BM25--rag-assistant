Algorithm for nice graph labels for time/date axis?

I'm looking for a "nice numbers" algorithm for determining the labels on a date/time value axis. I'm familiar with Paul Heckbert's Nice Numbers algorithm . I have a plot that displays time/date on the X axis and the user can zoom in and look at a smaller time frame. I'm looking for an algorithm that picks nice dates to display on the ticks. For example: Looking at a day or so: 1/1 12:00, 1/1 4:00, 1/1 8:00... Looking at a week: 1/1, 1/2, 1/3... Looking at a month: 1/09, 2/09, 3/09... The nice label ticks don't need to correspond to the first visible point, but close to it. Is anybody familiar with such an algorithm?
