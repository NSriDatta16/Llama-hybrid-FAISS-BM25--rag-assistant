what is a good encoding to use for storing password hashes in DB or transferring them on a network

we have a wcf authentication service and a .net c# CAB client. The service is responsible for saving and verifying user password hashes. It is also required that the hashes be stored in a readable format. Also, we will need to send hashes from the client to the service for verification. So is using a Base64 encoding for storage and transfer a good choice? what are the advantages and disadvantages of using this versus other encoding?
