The mean of the values in $S$ is $6.7576,$ as you say. So, with replacement, each of the three chosen values has an expected value of $6.7575$ and thus the average of the three is again $\bar X_3 = 6.7575.$ s = c(0,0,0,0, 22.95, 0,0,0, 19.125,25.5) mean(s) [1] 6.7575 In sampling without replacement, the mean $E(\bar X_3)= 6.7575$ and the variance $V(\bar X_3)$ of the sample mean will be somewhat smaller because there are fewer possible samples of size three that may be drawn. (For example, once value $25.5$ is chosen, it can't be chosen again.) Without working through the combinatorial detains, it is possible to get a good idea of the sampling distribution of $\bar X_3$ according to each sampling method by doing a simple simulation in R. With 10 million iterations one can expect about three place accuracy. set.seed(3033) s = c(0,0,0,0,22.95,0,0,0,19.125,25.5) a.wo = replicate(10^7, mean(sample(s, 4))) mean(a.wo); sd(a.wo) [1] 6.760266 # aprx 6.7575 [1] 4.254535 summary(a.wo) Min. 1st Qu.
