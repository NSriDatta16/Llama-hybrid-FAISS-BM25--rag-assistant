Framework for building structured binary data parsers?

I have some experience with Pragmatic-Programmer-type code generation: specifying a data structure in a platform-neutral format and writing templates for a code generator that consume these data structure files and produce code that pulls raw bytes into language-specific data structures, does scaling on the numeric data, prints out the data, etc. The nice pragmatic(TM) ideas are that (a) I can change data structures by modifying my specification file and regenerating the source (which is DRY and all that) and (b) I can add additional functions that can be generated for all of my structures just by modifying my templates. What I had used was a Perl script called Jeeves which worked, but it's general purpose, and any functions I wanted to write to manipulate my data I was writing from the ground up. Are there any frameworks that are well-suited for creating parsers for structured binary data? What I've read of Antlr suggests that that's overkill. My current target langauges of interest are C#, C++, and Java, if it matters. Thanks as always. Edit: I'll put a bounty on this question. If there are any areas that I should be looking it (keywords to search on) or other ways of attacking this problem that you've developed yourself, I'd love to hear about them.
