For feature selection (I assume you have lots of samples of your class) - You could simply use PCA , (which finds the features with the most variance) or other features such as UFF ( Unsupervised feature filtering ) , I don't know if other methods (matlab & Mutual information, or mrmr ) will work with just one class. For prediction - You might want to try using one-class SVM maybe? Or Positive-Unlabelled learning. Do you want to predict? Cluster? Find information about the specific features that characterize a class?
