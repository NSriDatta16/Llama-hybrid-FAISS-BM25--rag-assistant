I assume by "industrial" statistics you mean 'applied' statistics, where the theory behind it is not as relevant. But as the above reply says, all fields of statistics SHOULD be more-or-less the same, although some emphasize different things than others. My own work is kind of in-between academic, social-science-type of statistics and applied industrial statistics. I do a lot of data exploration (biomedical data) and often end up doing regressions and things in an attempt to both explain and predict outcomes. My advice is do indeed include variables in your regression models that may not be statistically significant IF they improve model fit (or if taking them out reduces model fit). Two little diagnostics I make use of (talking about linear regression here) is the R-squared value and the standard error of the regression. The R-squared shows how much the predictors explain the outcome variable, i.e., how well one accounts for the other. If you keep adding variables into your model, the R-squared ALWAYS goes up, even if those variables have no real value and don't predict things any better. The standard error of the regression is the average deviation from the regression line that your outcome variables have; i.e., how "tight" the points are around the line. Both are often overlooked in regression, and both are very useful. Some other tips of the trade: Sample size matters a lot; often a result won't be significant NOT because of the effect size, but because of the sample size. Become familiar with statistical power (to detect a significant result) and use it in your reports as necessary to larger sample sizes in the future and to qualify your results. Graph your results. And intermediate steps. A picture is worth a thousand words. And that includes getting skilled with graphing in your software. Learn new techniques often. There are free and paid forums and statistical learning sites on-line. Use them. As Julia Child said, "learn every time you cook." And in statistics, you are cooking numbers! Scan the literature and see how others are presenting their results; you'll get good ideas for data presentation at least. Keep improving your writing. The write-up of your results is vital. People hear what they want to hear sometimes, so learn to phrase things carefully, especially any caveats or assumptions or violations of assumptions about the statistical models you use (which isn't always a deal-breaker). 4a) Publish something once in a while, even if it's just a minor technical finding or example in your field with a colleague as co-author. It boosts your credibility and is helpful to get your next job. And keep your resume updated at all times. Keep it simple. The simplest solutions (for example in regression) are often the best for practical utility. Learn bootstrapping. I've just become familiar with it and it is intriguing. It may be quite useful for small samples. Learn TWO statistical software packages. I don't know what field you're in exactly, but I recommend R and SAS as one of them. (I'm an SPSS man myself, but I could probably earn literally twice as much money doing the same kind of work if I had learned SAS instead. They don't teach you those lessons in graduate school).
