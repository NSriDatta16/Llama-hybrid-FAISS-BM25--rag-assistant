It sounds like you have an event handler for the drop event directly in your ViewModel class. Would it make more sense to have the handler in your UI layer, which in turn will call a function in your ViewModel? This way, your unit test could just call the function (simulating a drag and drop operation, as far as the ViewModel is concerned). Plus, it would better separate your ViewModel from your UI code.
