I am trying to analyse the effect of the gender of a CEO (women vs. men) on a performance measure…I control for some observable firm characteristics… Unfortunately, this doesn't work. Without causal assumptions, you can't support counterfactual conclusions with observational data. In your case, these assumptions would be of the form of assuming no back doors, which is unrealistic. When you just control for your possible mediating variables, you open back doors to unobserved confounders. This is like cutting heads of the hydra. Each back door that you open would need to be controlled for and doing that can open many more back door paths, and so on. You need to freeze the value (this is an intervention since it disconnects causal parents) of your mediating variables as you change the treatment. I think this is what you're getting at in the second paragraph. This freezing is Pearl's counterfactual operator. He writes: The reason such conditioning does not work for the natural direct effect is that the latter is not defined in terms of a population experiment (i.e., control M to level M = m and change T from T = 0 to T = 1) but in terms of a hypothetical manipulation at the unit level, namely, for each individual u, freeze M at whatever level it attained for that individual, then change T from T =0 to T =1 and observe the change in Y). (Where, $T$ is the treatment, $M$ is the mediator, $Y$ is the outcome.) Almost your exact example is discussed by Pearl in his recent paper: Pearl, Judea. "Interpretation and identification of causal mediation." Psychological Methods 19.4 (2014): 459. If you can't do experiments, I guess you can try to be very thorough about closing back doors, but the validity of your conclusions will depend on your assumptions.
