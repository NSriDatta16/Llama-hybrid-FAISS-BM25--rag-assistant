This can't be answered by us, only by you. But I can give you the information you need to make the decision. In correlation (whether Spearman or Pearson) we are looking at the relationship between two variables. Neither is dependent or independent - they are treated equally. In regression (of any sort) one variable is the dependent variable and one or more are independent. The measurement of the dependent variable is critical. If it was measured on a 5 point Likert scale, then you probably need ordinal logistic regression. Which to choose? Since you say you have a dependent variable, that indicates regression. But if you are new to statistics you might not be able to run and interpret an ordinal logistic regression, so you might have to hire a consultant.
