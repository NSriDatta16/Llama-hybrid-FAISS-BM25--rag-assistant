Execute a method that takes a second to complete without temporarily halting code

Basically, i have a method that takes a few seconds to complete as it copies some files using NSFileManager. This is invoked on the touchesMoved event when the user picks up a draggable UIView icon. However, there's a slight delay before the icon's position is updated. I'm guessing it's waiting for that method to copy it's files before continuing. The method HAS to be triggered on touchesMoved, so please don't suggest moving it. How can i execute a method that takes about a second to complete, without holding up the code? (..and don't worry the copy method doesn't get repeatedly called from the touchesMoved event)
