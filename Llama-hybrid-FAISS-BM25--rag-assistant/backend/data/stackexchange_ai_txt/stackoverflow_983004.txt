As mentioned, it's always preferable to have a visible label for all input elements -- this will help both sighted and non-sighted users. Having said that, there are certain scenarios where this isn't feasible, which I'm guessing your case falls under. For these situations you have a couple options. The first is to use the "title" attribute, which has the added benefit of displaying a tool-tip for sighted users: A couple others have mentioned the second option, which involves positioning the label off the screen using CSS: Unlike using "display:none", screen readers will still read the label. It's also elegant in that users that choose to disable CSS will see the label. No matter what you go with, I definitely recommend downloading a trial copy of JAWS from Freedom Scientific and testing your solution out.
