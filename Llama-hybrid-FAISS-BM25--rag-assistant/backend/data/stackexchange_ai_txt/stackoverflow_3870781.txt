Contrasting the different ways of adding an existing framework to Xcode

In Xcode (specifically v3.2.4), there are two ways of adding an external framework to a solution Dragging and dropping a framework from finding into XCode Clicking on add existing, and selecting one Surprisingly, the two ways do not yield the same result (I learned this the hard way). Here is a diff of the two methods on the contents of project.pbxproj in the .xcodeproj package: By dragging 005DB04C1255606C005A66F1 /* GHUnitIOS.framework */ = {isa = PBXFileReference; lastKnownFileType = wrapper.framework; path = GHUnitIOS.framework; sourceTree = ""; }; By adding existing 005DB06C12556222005A66F1 /* GHUnitIOS.framework */ = {isa = PBXFileReference; lastKnownFileType = wrapper.framework; name = GHUnitIOS.framework; path = Library/Frameworks/GHUnitIOS.framework; sourceTree = DEVELOPER_DIR; }; A different value for the path and a different one for the source tree is produced. Does anyone know what these differences are, and what the advantage of each method is?
