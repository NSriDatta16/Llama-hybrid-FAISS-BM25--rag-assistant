Sample size determination for Bayesian logistic regression

Suppose we have three different treatments A, B, and C and we are modeling response(0,1). I want to know how to do sample size determination for each group(A,B,C) given say normal priors on each group. I need to show how we can (and how much we can reduce) the sample size and get similar testing of differences in main effects if we have prior info. the most important thing is being able to show how we can reduce the sample size if we incorporate the prior info.
