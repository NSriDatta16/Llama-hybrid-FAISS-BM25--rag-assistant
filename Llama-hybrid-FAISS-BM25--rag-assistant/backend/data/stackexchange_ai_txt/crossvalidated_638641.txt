Some examples: The name of a soccer team and daily temperature. Card faces and the speed of drivers nearby. School type in New York and number of monthly books sold in Texas. The example from a coin flip and dice roll by Demetri also works. Edit Your comment is a much more complicated question than your original post suggested. For a good exploration of causal reasoning, I recommend Robert Long's post here about the usage of DAGs, which are graphical techniques for positing the causal forces behind variables. Note that causality can never be known for certain, it can only be inferred. This book also does a good job of explaining causality , though I admit that I haven't finished it yet.
