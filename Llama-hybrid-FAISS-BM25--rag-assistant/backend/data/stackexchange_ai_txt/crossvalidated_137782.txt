What is a good book about the philosophy behind Bayesian thinking?

What is a good book about Bayesian philosophy, contrasting subjectivists against objectivists, explaining the view of probability as state of knowledge in Bayesian statistics, etc.? Maybe Savage's book? At first I thought Berger (1986) could work, but it is not what I am looking for. Searching for such a book just doesn't quite lead to the results I am looking for.
