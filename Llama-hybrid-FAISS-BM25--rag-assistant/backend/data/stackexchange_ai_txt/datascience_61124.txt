Spatial and temporal information processing together (CNN and LSTM)

I have small problem that requires to process both spatial and temporal information. I need to predict vehicle's trajectory based on previous trajectory information and map information. My current situation: Predicting future trajectory of vehicle was successfully done using seq2seq model. Where I give previous N points and model returns K possible trajectories I have tried crop map information(based on vehicle's position) and giving it to CNNLSTM model with trajectory information. But even test accuracy was not good. What architecture is best for my problem? P.S I am new to this forum. Feel free to improve question or point out my mistakes.
