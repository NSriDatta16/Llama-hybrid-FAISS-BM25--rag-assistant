You're getting at two distinct concepts: Statistical significance Material significance, some notion of practical significance. In economics, people call number (2) economic significance . In biology, I imagine they call it biological significance. Statistical significance can be seen from the p-value (assuming your standard errors etc... are done properly). Material significance, economic significance is a more field, problem specific question. Is a 0.05% difference in return materially important? Almost certainly no for high risk venture capital investing, but almost certainly yes for short term rates on near risk free securities. Is aerodynamic drag requiring 5 watts of power at 25 mph materially important? Almost certainly not for a car, but quite possibly yes for a pro racing cyclist. Does a big number imply material significance? Of course not because you can always make a number big by measuring in tiny units! What if you standardize a variable by its standard error, making the estimated coefficient at least invariant to units? This may be better, but as @Gung discusses, it still doesn't answer how this effect relates to other effects. Is the $\beta$ in question measuring the effect of a small brook flowing into the Niagra river while the massive Niagra falls is nearby? Answering the question of whether an effect is materially important is inherently field and problem specific. Generally speaking, you want to capture the materially important effects when forecasting.
