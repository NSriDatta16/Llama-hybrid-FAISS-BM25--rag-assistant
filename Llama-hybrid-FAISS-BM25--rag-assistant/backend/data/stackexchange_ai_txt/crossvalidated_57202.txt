Singer and Willett have been published a lot on this subject. I highly recommend that you read some of their papers . You also might want to get their book "Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis: Modeling Change and Event Occurrence" . Clearly one of the best textbooks in this field. For most book chapters there is R sample code (see chapters 11ff) available that demonstrates how your data has to be structured ("person-period format") and how to analyze that kind of data. For a standard discrete-time model you do not need the ID variable and you also do not need to estimate a mixed-effects model as suggested by @ndoogan. A simple glm(event ~ time + ..., family = "binomial") works just fine. Singer and Willett also discuss many issues how to model the time variable (linear, quadratic, ...) To cite two more references that I highly recommend: Allison (1982): "Discrete-Time Methods for the Analysis of Event Histories" ( PDF ) (the Allison article also discusses why you can use a standard glm instead of a mixed-effects model) Mills (2011): "Introducing Survival and Event History Analysis"
