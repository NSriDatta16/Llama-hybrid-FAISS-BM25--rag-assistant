Class A would need an instance of B somewhere first. Nesting classes in .NET is simply a way of organizing the types. It doesn't imply any kind of ownership of an instance. So you'd have to do something like: class A { private B instanceOfB; // constructor public A() { instanceOfB = new B(); instanceOfB.handleClick += instanceOfB_handleClick; } // event handler private void instanceOfB_handleClick(object sender, EventArgs e) { // blah } public class B { public event EventHandler handleClick; public void eventraising(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (handleClick != null) handleClick(this, e); } } } Also, your event should just be called Click, not handleClick.
