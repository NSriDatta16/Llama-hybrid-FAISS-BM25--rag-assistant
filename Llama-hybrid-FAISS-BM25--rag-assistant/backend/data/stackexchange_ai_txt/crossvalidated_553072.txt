Do Time Series Models fall under GLM?

I have the following question: Can Time Series Models (e.g. ARMA, GARCH) be considered as GLM's? For example, below is the standard form of a GLM: At first glance, Time Series Models have some properties which make them seem different to standard GLM's - for instance, autocorrelation of errors. But seeing as Time Series Models can be "written" in a similar style as some GLM's - does this make Time Series Models fall under the designation of GLM's?
