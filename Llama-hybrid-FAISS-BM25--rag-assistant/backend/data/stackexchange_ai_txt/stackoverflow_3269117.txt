Adding a Resource View/Gannt chart to jQuery Fullcalendar

I am using jQuery Fullcalendar and if you're not using it I suggest you do too because it is absolutely fantastic at what it does! However to be really useful to me and my project ( and many others ) I honestly believe it needs a resource/gannt view. Not a problem one would think... until you look under the hood of jQuery FullCalendar and see that the way it generates it's views is not for javascript developer wannabes... ie me. Having realised this is out of my league I had to go searching elsewhere looking for any calendar/scheduler that will provide a resource view. Here are three proprietary calendars that promise this feature. http://java.daypilot.org/ http://www.dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/index.shtml http://web2cal.com/ajaxeventscalendar/calendar-demo/912-premium-demo/157-scheduler-view Unfortunately both daypilot and dhtmlxscheduler lack the clean and clear interface that FullCalendar achieves so well and web2cal just looks and feels unfinished and is still in Beta. Alternatively I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how I could integrate a jQuery Gannt chart with jquery fullcalendar. I have found a few projects that look promising http://www.maro-z.com/examples/jquery.gantt/ http://code.google.com/p/jquery-gantt/ http://github.com/thegrubbsian/jquery.ganttView I have looked into how fullcalendar generates its views and so far have not had any success in extending this to provide a container for one of these gannt charts to 'sit within' fullcalendar and be triggered by its buttons. This seems to be one of the more popular feature requests with many people asking for it on the official issue tracker http://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=150&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Milestone%20Summary%20Stars So I am left at a cross roads. I could pay for a half baked proprietary solution that has minimal to no community support or I can try and find a way of getting a resource view inside of jquery Fullcalendar by asking the people who really know jQuery. I would happily donate the funds saved from using a proprietary solution to the developer of Fullcalendar. The developer of FullCalendar seems to have a lot on his plate and I would like to again thank him for this truly amazing calendar. I hope someone can share a solution with us! Tim
