You shouldn't really be using br to control spacing. You should be using block level elements with margin or padding, or inline/block elements with a proper line height to generate the spacing you want. a br is a soft break like shift+return in a word processor. You should only be using br to move something to the next line for line-breaking reason in the context of the flow of text, not for visual-structure reasons. /typesetting-rant I wold configure the rich-text editor to wrap elements appropriately to generate block spacing. I don't really know the context of the data in your table but the default choice would be a p element assuming these are in fact full paragraphs of text. If they aren't there may be more appropriate elements like a div or a span set to display: block; . IF on the other hand they are doing this to achieve a particular table sizing instead of actually controlling the space between lines of text inside the cells then that should be handled with css applied directly to the table elements Kale suggests.
