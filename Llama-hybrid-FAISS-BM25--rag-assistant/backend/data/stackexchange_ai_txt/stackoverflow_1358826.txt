Is there a multiline text workaround for Flex

Is there a workaround for displaying multiline text in Flex 3? The two controls I have tried so far are mx:Text, and mx:TextArea. Each control has its own bug associated with it. For reference: mx:Text bug - http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-9819 mx:TextArea bug - http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/SDK-12616 . Basically, neither control handles scrolling correctly if you do not specify a height and the text wraps onto the next line (height is determined dynamically by Flex, based on the wrapping). Does anybody have a workaround that might be helpful? Thanks. Update: One of the methods I have tried in the past has been to manually calculate the height of a mx:Text element. I can do this by using the following: var textItem:Text = new Text(); var len:int = value.length; var lines:int = int(len/115) + 1; var height:int = lines * 20; textItem.height = height; While this seems to get around the problem in mx:Text, there is one big fault. The calculation relies heavily on font-size, letter-spacing, and the width of textItem. I can use this method, and move on with my project. However, maintenance on this is inevitable, and with code like this, it will a gigantic PITA.
