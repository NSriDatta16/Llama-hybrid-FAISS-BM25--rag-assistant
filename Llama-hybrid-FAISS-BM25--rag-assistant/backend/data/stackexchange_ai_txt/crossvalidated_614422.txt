The algorithm implemented in mice.impute.rf is described in Appendix A.1 of Doove, L.L., van Buuren, S., Dusseldorp, E. (2014), Recursive partitioning for missing data imputation in the presence of interaction Effects . Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 72, 92-104. Available here: https://stefvanbuuren.name/publications/2014%20Recursive%20partitioning%20-%20CSDA.pdf In short, for each tree in the ensemble, the algorithm determines the leave from which a missing observation would be predicted, then the elements of all these resulting leaves are pooled together and the imputed value is randomly selected from them (the pooled elements make up a predictive distribution). There is no averaging across trees in order to preserve uncertainty of the imputed value.
