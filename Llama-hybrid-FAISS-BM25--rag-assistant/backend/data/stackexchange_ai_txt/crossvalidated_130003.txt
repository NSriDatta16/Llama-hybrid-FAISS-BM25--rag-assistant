Maybe this will help: I. Sutskever, O. Vinyals, and Q. V. V Le, “Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks,” in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2014, pp. 3104–3112. If you have definition for your exact time window on the data like sentences in this paper or paragraphs then you will be fine with using LSTM, but I am not sure how to find the time window that are not obvious and are more context aware. An example for that can be how many of log data you are seeing are related and that's not something obvious.
