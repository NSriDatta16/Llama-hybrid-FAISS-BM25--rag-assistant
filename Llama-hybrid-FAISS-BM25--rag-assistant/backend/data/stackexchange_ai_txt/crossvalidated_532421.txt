Are there guidelines to the 'Alphabet Soup' of Statistics?

This is a somewhat 'meta-statistical' question that pertains to the discipline of Statistics, rather than to Statistics itself. I will not be accepting any answers due to the subject being open-ended. It really is open-ended, and therefore will possibly be closed, but it is quite relevant to the practice of Statistics. There is a frequent pattern of statistical estimators (or hypothesis tests) in following a naming convention of . Most of us probably name a few off the top of our heads including: Bangdiwala's B Box's M Cohen's $\kappa$ Cram√©r's V Somers' D Cochran's Q Cochran's C Pearson's r Pearson's $\chi^2$ Spearman's $\rho$ Kendall's $\tau$ -(a/b) Mann-Whitney U Goodman and Kruskal's $\gamma$ Goodman and Kruskal's $\lambda$ Yule's Y Hotelling's T Kendall's W Student's $t$ Cronbach's $\alpha$ There are also statistcs with just a single letter: $\chi^2$ F $\phi$ Z And there are statistics that are just the (possibly hyphenated) names of people: Brown-Forsythe Brunner-Munzel Levene Kolmogorov-Smirnov Shapiro-Wilk D'Agostino Anderson-Darling Dickey-Fuller Kruskal-Wallis Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin Friedman Durbin Durbin-Watson Durbin-Wu-Hausman Wilcoxon Matthews Bartlett Hartley Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Breusch-Godfrey Breusch-Pagan Ljung-Box Wald-Wolfowitz Wald Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chow Welch Mantel Sorensen-Dice Renkonen Tversky Bray-Curtis Jaccard Jarque-Bera Akaike Gershunov Mann-Kendall It seems that some statistics such as U-statistics , V-Statistics , L-Statistics , and Q-Statistics may inspire/generate naming patterns. But on the whole, the names seem to follow the idiosyncrasies of history. If I were to publish a new statistical estimator, what considerations would I put into naming it?
