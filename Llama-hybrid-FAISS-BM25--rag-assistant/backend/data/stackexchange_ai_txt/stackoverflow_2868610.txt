Interesting question. I would say "of course, that's the whole point of criteriaqueries", but I did not find a single word to back this in here: http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/tutorial/doc/gjivm.html However: if they weren't reuseable, that would mean that the entitymanager actually modifies them, which would be awful api design. So: I hope they are reuseable, but I can't guarantee it
