Monte Carlo estimation of convex hull overlap probability

This is a statistical version of my Math.SE post. Given natural numbers $b$ and $r$, uniformly randomly choose $b+r$ points within a unit square. Call the $b$ points the blue points and the $r$ points red points . Let $p(b,r)$ be the probability that $H_r$, the convex hull of red points, overlaps with $H_b$, that of the blue points. How do I efficiently estimate $p(b,r)$ via Monte Carlo (or perhaps better) methods? I can think of averaging the probability over a large number of randomly chosen test cases, but how can I sample the search space in a way that gives me error bounds?
