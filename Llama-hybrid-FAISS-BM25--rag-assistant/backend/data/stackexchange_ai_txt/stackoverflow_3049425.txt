1) Just to be sure but have you really confirmed that DTC is running. Right mouse click on "My Computer" from your Component Services screen. The top menu item should say "Stop DTC". 2) Have you checked that your configuration of MSDTC is the same on both ends (your application server that initiates connection to the database and at your database server)? Pay special attention to the Security Configurations under your MSTDC tab Good luck
