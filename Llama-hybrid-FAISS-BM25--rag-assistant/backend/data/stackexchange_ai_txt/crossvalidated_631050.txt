Residuals vs Standardised Residuals. Residuals are the differences between your observed values and the values predicted by your model. Standardised Residuals in the context of GARCH models are the residuals divided by the conditional volatility (the square root of the conditional variance predicted by the GARCH model). The diagnostic tests below require standardised residuals. Apply the Ljung-Box test or Breusch-Godfrey test to the standardised residuals in order to detect autocorrelation. Given the substantial number of observations (1039), it is feasible to examine a considerable number of lags, such as 20 or 30 lags. However, in the case of GARCH models, it is often more pertinent to concentrate on the initial few lags, typically up to 10. Assess the presence of ARCH effects by using the Li-Mak test on standardised residuals. This test checks for the presence of autocorrelation in their squared values. Rejection of the null hypothesis (of no autocorrelation in squares) indicates that your GARCH model did not capture all ARCH patterns. For Goodness of Fit, you can inspect a QQ plot to assess whether the standardised residuals are plausibly t-distributed. You can also look at the overall goodness of fit for your model, which can include evaluating the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), especially if you are comparing multiple models. If you have alternative models, compare them using AIC, BIC, or likelihood ratio tests to see which model fits the data better. Assess the model's performance both in-sample and out-of-sample. Out-of-sample forecasting performance is crucial for understanding the model's practical applicability. Lastly, don't forget the power of visual inspection: plot the standardised residuals and their squared values to visually inspect for any patterns or anomalies.
