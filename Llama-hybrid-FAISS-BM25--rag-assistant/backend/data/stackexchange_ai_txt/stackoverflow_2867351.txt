Data binding manually update in WPF MVVM

My ViewModel: class ViewModel { public string FileName {get;set;} } and in my View I bind a label's content to ViewModel's FileName . now When I do drag-drop a file to my View, How can I update the label's Content property, so that the ViewMode's FileName also get updated via binding? Directly set the label's Content property won't work, it just simply clear the binding.
