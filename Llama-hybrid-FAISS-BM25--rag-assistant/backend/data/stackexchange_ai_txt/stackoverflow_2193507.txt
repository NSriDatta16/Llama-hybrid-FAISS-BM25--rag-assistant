Manually Add a Resource File (Visual Studio)

I have a solution in VB.NET (VS 2005) In this solution I have a custom control, that inherits from a abstract class. Now, as VS is VS, it doesn't want to display the control in designer, because its parent is abstract. Now, I want to add a picturebox with an image (bmp or ico) to this control. Normally I've done this opening the designer and dragging a picturebox, selection also a image in background. But as designer is unavailable, how can I do adding however the image to my control?
