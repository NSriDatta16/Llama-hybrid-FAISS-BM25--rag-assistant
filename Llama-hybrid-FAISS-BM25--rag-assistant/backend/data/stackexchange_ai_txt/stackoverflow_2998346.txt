Which WPF Control Suite?

If you were to buy one control suite for WPF, which would it be? EDIT - I know that this is vague and understand that the answer might be different depending on the exact requirements. I guess what I'm getting at is that there are numerous WPF control libraries out there (e.g. Infragistics, Telerik, Syncfusion to name but a few) and instead of forking out for a different one per project because that is the best fit right now, based on experience with costs, upgrades, support, etc. who would you choose as a "preferred" supplier?
