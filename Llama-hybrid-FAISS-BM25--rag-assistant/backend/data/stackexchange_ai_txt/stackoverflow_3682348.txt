Here are three reasons not to to switch: Oracle PL/SQL is a complete programming language. It's not just some frozen SQL statements and some conditional programming. So it is quite likely that the PL/SQL layer contains logic which cannot easily be implemented in ORM. Notoriously Oracle database licenses are expensive. The best way to maximize ROI on them is to leverage the built-in features. This is harder to do with an ORM tool, sometimes flat out impossible. You describe your application as "legacy" which suggests it is in production. If so, changing the data access architecture would be a gross indulgence. You and your co-worker will spend a great deal of time writing code, not to mention regression testing for the entire application, with no discernable benefit to your users .
