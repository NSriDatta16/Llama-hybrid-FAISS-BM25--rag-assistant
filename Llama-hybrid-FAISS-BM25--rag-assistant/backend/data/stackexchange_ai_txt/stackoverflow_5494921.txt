.htaccess RewriteRule not working in subdirectory

I'm programming the new version of my website and I'm trying to get .htaccess to rewrite properly. My new site is stored here: www.example.com/storage/new/ I need to rewrite these URLs: www.example.com/storage/new/welcome/ -> index.php?action=welcome www.example.com/storage/new/page/name/ -> index.php?action=page&url=name www.example.com/storage/new/post/name/ -> index.php?action=post&url=name This is my .htaccess file: RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^/welcome/$ index.php?action=welcome [L] RewriteRule ^/page/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/$ index.php?action=page&url=$1 [L] RewriteRule ^/post/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/$ index.php?action=post&url=$1 [L] It does not work, however; all results in a 404 Not Found. I've tried everything, even typing out www.example.com/storage/new/ in lieu of ^ . I have another .htaccess in the server root ( www.example.com ) that looks like this: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.example.com$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [R=301,L] I can't imagine how that would affect www.example.com/storage/new/ but you never know. Can anyone help me with this?
