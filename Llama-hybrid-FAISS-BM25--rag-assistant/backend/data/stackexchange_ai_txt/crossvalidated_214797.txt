Why Are Impulse Responses in VECM Permanent?

The usual interpretation of impulse response functions in standard vector autoregression (VAR) models is that they represent the response of a variable, say $y_t$, to a shock of one standard deviation (or one unit, depending on how they are computed) in another variable of the system, say $x_t$, over time. In VARs, the impulse response function reverts to $0$, and you can compute the total (or long-run) effect of $x_t$ on $y_t$ using cumulative functions (by summing the impulse responses). However, in vector error correction models (VECMs), the impulse response functions sometimes do not go back to $0$. Some textbooks (e.g. LÃ¼tkepohl's New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis ) mention that this is normal. However, it's not clear why. What would be a correct interpretation of an impulse response that does not go back to $0$ in a VECM? And how would one interpret the cumulative impulse responses in that case, which will then grow (or decrease) infinitely? To be clear, suppose that the function illustrating the response of $y_t$ to an impulse of $x_t$ converges at +0.5 and stays at that value. Does that mean that when $x_t$ increases by one unit (or one s.d.), $y_t$ increases by 0.5, every period, again, and again, until the end of time? If the variables are cointegrated, shouldn't they stay "close" to each other, separated by some value that is constant over time? In that case, one variable cannot grow indefinitely when the other changes by a fixed amount. I can't find a clear answer to that and would very much appreciate any help.
