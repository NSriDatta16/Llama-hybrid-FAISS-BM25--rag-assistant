According to the Naive Bayesian graph, the covariate $Y_1$ is independent of the covariate $Y_2$. Therefore $P(Y_1|X) \cdot P(Y_2|X)=P(Y_1,Y_2|X)$ and $P(Y_1,Y_2) = P(Y_1) \cdot P(Y_2) $ Implementing these into your last equation, you can see that: $$P(X|Y_1,Y_2) = \frac{P(Y_1,Y_2|X) \cdot P(X)}{P(Y_1,Y_2)} $$
