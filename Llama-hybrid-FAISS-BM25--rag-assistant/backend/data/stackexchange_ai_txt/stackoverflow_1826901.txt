Should I add .vcxproj.filter files to source control?

While evaluating Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2, I see that in the converted directory, my vcproj files became vcxproj files. There are also vcxproj.filter files alongside each project which appear to contain a description of the folder structure (\Source Files, \Header Files, etc.). Do you think these filter files should be kept per-user, or should they be shared across the whole dev group and checked into SCC? My current thinking is to check them in, but I wonder if there are any reasons not to do that, or perhaps good reasons why I should definitely check them in. The obvious benefit is that the folder structures will match if I'm looking at someone else's machine, but maybe they'd like to reorganize things logically?
