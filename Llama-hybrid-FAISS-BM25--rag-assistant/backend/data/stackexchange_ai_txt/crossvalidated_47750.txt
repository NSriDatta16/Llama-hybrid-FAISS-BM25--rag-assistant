Significance index of unlabeled data prediction

I have a training set used to train an SVM classifier, the model found is used to predict a dataset of several unlabeled examples. I would like to know how to extract an index of the goodness of the prediction. I found some papers to estimate the prediction probability using the distance from the SVM hyperplane, but a distant example doesn't necessarily mean a well classified example. Is there another method to assess this question?
