Averaging Brier score

To score a RandomForestClassifier using GridSearchCV for multiclass classification, I decided to use Brier score. However, I could only manage to get the Brier score for each class. Is it reasonable to get the average of that as an overall performance measure? Or can you think of a better way instead? Edit: I am aware this question is similar, so I'll explain why I think it's a different problem: When I run my model with brier_score as defined by that question's author ( brier_multi ), the score obtained for the best model is 202.3 However, when I apply the following code (made by me) def brier_score_multi(y_true, y_pred): y_true_bin = label_binarize(y_true, classes=[0,1,2]) y_pred_bin = label_binarize(y_pred, classes=[0,1,2]) score = mean([brier_score_loss(y_true_bin[:,0], y_pred_bin[:,0]),brier_score_loss(y_true_bin[:,1], y_pred_bin[:,1]),brier_score_loss(y_true_bin[:,2], y_pred_bin[:,2])]) return score The best score is 0.0432. As you can see, this is a big difference, and given the definition of a the brier score, I'm biased towards the second result. EDIT 2: Seeing as the first result is incorrect, I started thinking... maybe instead of the average between classes, the sum of the brier score between classes makes more sense?
