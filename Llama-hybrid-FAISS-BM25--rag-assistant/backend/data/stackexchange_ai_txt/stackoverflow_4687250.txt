django app using amazon aws s3 storage in stead of DB?

I'm looking at django for a rapid prototype to a photo sharing app with an amazon aws s3 storage back end. However, as far as I can tell, Django is tailored toward the typical database MVC type of pattern. is there a way to for example provide a custom Django model implementation that talks to s3 in stead of a DB? a custom DB engine? would either of these be practical, or am I looking in the wrong direction?
