The last equation in your description is valid as long as it's episodic. It's not necessary to ask for it from the first equation. So if you directly write it with the natural meaning, then it's OK if lambda is 1. By "natural meaning": the lambda return of TD(lambda) is the weighted average of future returns in each step. Then, facing an episodic case, it's "natural" to write in that way, and not necessary to derive it from other case (continuing case).
