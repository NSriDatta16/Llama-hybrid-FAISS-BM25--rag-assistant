Yes, you can reduce the noise by averaging or in general by reducing the sampling rate of the signal. This is a very common technique in signal processing commonly refereed to as oversampling . It is widely used in sigma-delta converters. Oversampling basically means that the sampling rate of the signal is much higher than the needed Nyquist limit (i.e. 2 times higher than bandwidth of the signal). By low-pass filtering and decimating the signal, you reduce the standard deviation of the noise by the decimation factor (assuming a uniform distribution for the noise). Having said that, I doubt in your example you can downsample by a factor of 20000. From your description it seems that your "signal" include frequency up to few Hertz. Notice that to get best/correct results you should sample your signal higher than the Nyquist limit. For example if you want to preserve everything below 20 Hz, you should not decimate by a factor more than 500 (i.e. 20000 / 500 = 40 Hz = 2 x 20 Hz). If you are not much into signal processing, to do the downsampling correctly I suggest using a ready made package so that you know the lowpass-filter is implemented correctly. In MATLAB you can use the resample function in the signal-processing toolbox. In R you may use the decimate function from the signal package.
