Capturing initial patterns when using truncated backpropagation through time (RNN/LSTM)

Say that I use an RNN/LSTM to do sentiment analysis, which is a many-to-one approach (see this blog ). The network is trained through a truncated backpropagation through time (BPTT), where the network is unrolled for only 30 last steps as usual. In my case each of my text sections that I want to classify are much longer than the 30 steps being unrolled (~100 words). Based on my knowledge BPTT is only run a single time for a single text section, which is when it has passed over the entire text section and computed the binary classification target, $y$, which it then compares to the loss function to find the error. The gradients will then never be computed with regards to the first words of each text section. How can the RNN/LSTM then still adjust its weights to capture specific patterns that only occur within the first few words? For instance, say that all sentences marked as $positive$ start with "I love this" and all sentences marked as $negative$ start with "I hate this". How would the RNN/LSTM capture that when it is only unrolled for the last 30 steps when it hits the end of a 100-step long sequence?
