Well, the problem is, you are trying to use hypothesis testing for something it can't really do, which is claiming that a certain (even approximate) value GAVE rise to something you observed. What in my opinion would work as a heuristic is that you take your lower ($0.5 - \delta$) and upper bound($0.5 + \delta$) and calculate the probabilities of observing the result that you have - for the lower bound you could do a right-tailed test, for the upper bound you could take a left-tailed test. Scipy should be (but I'm not 100% about that, I don't use SciPy so can't test): scipy.stats.binom.pdf(your_test_result, n, 1/2 - delta) * 2 (1 - scipy.stats.binom.pdf(your_test_result, n, 1/2 + delta)) * 2 This would give you two probabilities that would upper bound the probability of your observation for all "truthes" outside of your specified range (edit: I'm assuming here that your observation is within your specified range). But I would like to stress that this would not allow you to infer a probability for the truth being in your specified interval, since ultimately this requires a model/assumption on the true value of p. To really answer a question like this, you would need Bayesian Methods (which gives you ways to model the prior distribution of p you need to actually quantify interval probabilities) - If it's important that you get this right, maybe switching to Bayesian is the way? In that case you might search for "Bayesian credible intervals"
