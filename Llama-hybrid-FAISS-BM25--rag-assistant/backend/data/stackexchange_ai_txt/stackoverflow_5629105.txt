Relative coordinates with slider widget containing thumb widget

My slider had a child button widget. I have recently changed my gui to send the mouse coordinates as relative to the widget, so if the widget is at 50,50 and the mouse is at 50,50, it will now report as 0,0. This has created some problems for my slider. When I would drag around the button it would position to value. The only solution I have thought of is to take the given mouse coordinate, add back the absolute position of the button, then subtract the absolute position of the slider. I was however hoping for a solution that did not envole absolute positioning. I used to receive the absolute mouse position, when I did, I positioned it like this: int mousePos = getOrientation() == AGUI_HORIZONTAL ? mouseArgs.getPosition().getX() - getAbsolutePosition().getX() : mouseArgs.getPosition().getY() - getAbsolutePosition().getY(); setValue(positionToValue(mousePos)); mouseArgs gives the mouse position relative to the button. Not relative to the slider, which is what would be needed. I can obtain the relative locations of the widgets, but I don't think that would do it. Thanks
