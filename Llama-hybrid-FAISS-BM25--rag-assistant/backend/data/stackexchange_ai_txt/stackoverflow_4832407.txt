Drag and drop with modifiers in wxpython

Is there a way to capture modifiers during a drag-and-drop in wxpython? It is mentioned in a couple of posts as a sidenote ( The OLE way of doing drag&drop in wxPython , wx.TreeCtrl drag and drop, copy and move ), but neither of those mentions how to catch these modifiers. I am aware of CmdDown(), but that requires an EVT_CHAR. Is there a way to force an EVT_CHAR during a drag and drop (to a canvas)? At the end of the day, I could use some global hook, but I know there are equivalents in similar packages that allow you to catch modifiers. Any help is appreciated.
