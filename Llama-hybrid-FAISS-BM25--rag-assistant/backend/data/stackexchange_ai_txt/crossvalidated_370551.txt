A couple of notes: Your depenent variables accent and comprehensebility are bounded and also seem to be discrete. Both the aov() and lmer() analysis assume normally distributed error terms. Hence, you need to see how good the normal approximation is for your data. With regard to intelligibility , this is binary, and therefore you will need to analyze it with a mixed effects logistic regression, i.e., glmer(..., family = binomial()) . The specification via random effects and lmer() is more flexible than the aov() . Fitting separate models for males and females means actually that the variance components (i.e., error variance, and variances for the random effects) are different between males and females. If you only include the interaction sex * group * condition only the fixed effects of group , condition and their interaction group:condition are different between males and females, but not the variance components. Using the latter approach, you can more easily test if you need the interaction with sex . For a fitted mixed model, you can do multiple comparisons and obtain adjusted $p$ -values using either the emmeans of multcomp packages.
