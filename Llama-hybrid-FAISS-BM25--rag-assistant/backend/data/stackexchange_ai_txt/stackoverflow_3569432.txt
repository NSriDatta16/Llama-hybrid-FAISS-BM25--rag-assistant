To allow the data to survive you are going to have to move it outside the pervue of IIS - and that means either an XML store (in App_Data, Isolated Storage or somewhere else), a Database, or a service. I mention a service because, while its potentially overkill, I imagine that there is some caretaking that needs to be done with this data as well? Removing stale entries, adding new entries and generally taking care of housekeeping? Putting all of that into a service allows the data to persist outside of the limits of IIS (but beware how far this is taken, as at some point you may just be reinventing some aspects of a database server anyway).
