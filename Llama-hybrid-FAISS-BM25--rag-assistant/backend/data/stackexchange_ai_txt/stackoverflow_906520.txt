Why my eclipse [on vista] shows incorrect file modification timestamp?

When I right-click on a recently modified file (like a jar generated by Java Builder) and view the file properties, the modification timestamp is always off by 2.5 hrs. Windows explorer, on the other hand, is showing correct timestamp. I suspect that their some time zone setting in eclipse somewhere that is used in translating the file system time. I am running Ganymede on Vista with Sun JDK 1.6
