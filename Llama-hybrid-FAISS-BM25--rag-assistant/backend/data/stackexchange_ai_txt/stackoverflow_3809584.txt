WPF Custom control deriving from UserControl not responding to MouseClick

i have a simple custom control that derives from UserControl with the following XAML: An instance of this Maptip is added to the DragCanvas provided by JSmith here: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/DraggingElementsInCanvas.aspx This control is dynamically provided a toolbar with buttons bound to commands in a ViewModel. When I click on the buttons, nothing happens. However, if I replace the base class of Maptip with System.Windows.Primitives.Popup class, buttons respond to mouse click event events and commands are executed, when this maptip is added to the drag canvas. Any hints on what I am seeing here? TIA.
