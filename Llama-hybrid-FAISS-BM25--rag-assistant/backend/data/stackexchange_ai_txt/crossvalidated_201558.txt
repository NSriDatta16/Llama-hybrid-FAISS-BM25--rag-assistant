Neural network for text generation from examples

I am a student and am have been looking into machine learning and neural networks during the past year. I have basic understanding and some experience with simple neural networks. My question is, suppose I want to train a network with a set of short phrases and I would like the network to generate output phrases based on the examples I gave it. How would one go about this? Do you have any pointers as to what I should look into to achieve this effect?
