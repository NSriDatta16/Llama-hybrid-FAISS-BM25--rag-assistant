I think that the same task could be done in XSLT. This stylesheet: With this proper input: Approval Status Document / Diagram / Object Approval Status Draft - Work in Progress Text Next Document Review Date When is this document to be reviewed next? Date Stakeholder View Select the Stakeholder View PMO Text Whit param pKeywords default value set to 'Draft', output: Draft - Work in Progress Note : When param pKeywords is not set or is set to empty string '' output all the node set in param pAttributes , so you can think about this template as a filter. Also, you can edit the ouput to make it usefull for your logic, as example: you could just output the test value for non empty pAttributes , declare a variable with the content of calling this template, test for the string value of this variable and apply the templates as in your stylesheet fragment.
