Sico87, More of than not you don't want to test all of the fields simultaneously. For instance you may have a contact field that contains a phone-number entry option that isn't mandated, and rejecting the submission for that reason would be problematic. In many cases, it's easier to test your fields individually so you can give each the special attention it needs. You'll want to give special attention to email addresses, and special attention to birthdays. Treating all equal could cause very serious problems in the long-run.
