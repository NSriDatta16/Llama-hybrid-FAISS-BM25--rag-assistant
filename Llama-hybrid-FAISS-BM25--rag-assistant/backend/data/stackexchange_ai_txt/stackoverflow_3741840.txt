How do I sensibly store large numbers of serialized binary files in C#?

I'm serializing a large number of objects to binary files, however I want to keep everything neatly organized and don't really want hundreds of files in a folder. Is there anyway to group them into zip files, and then access the individual files within that zip? For example, say I created 100 binary files and zipped them. Would I be able to access a single file in that zip and deserialize it without unzipping everything?
