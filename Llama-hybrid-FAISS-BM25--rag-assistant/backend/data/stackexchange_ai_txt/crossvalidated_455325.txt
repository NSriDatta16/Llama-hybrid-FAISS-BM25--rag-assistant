You are mixing two different things. One is related to the central limit theorem, the other is related to unbiased estimators. The sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean, meaning that - on average - the sample mean will estimate the true population mean, that is it won't underestimate or overestimate it. The central limit theorem states that if you sum some random variables (with some assumptions) their sum will be normally distributed - and since the mean is the sum of random variables divided by some constant - this also applies to the mean. So the sample mean is normally distributed (if you were to sample many times). We can use this information to make inference about the sample mean - how it's distributed, based on the information gathered from our sample, which is quite useful in many scenarios.
