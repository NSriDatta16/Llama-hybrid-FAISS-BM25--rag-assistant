The first answer in your commented link answers one point about how region proposals are selected. It is the Intersection Over Union (more formally the Jaccard Index ) metric. So how much of your anchor overlaps the label. There is usually a lower limit set for this metric to then filter out all the useless proposals, and the remaining matches can be sorted, choosing the best. I recommend reading through this excellently explained version of a proposal network - Mask-R-CNN (Masked Region-based CNN). If you prefer looking at code, there is the full repo here , implemented in Keras/Tensorflow (there is also a PyTorch implementation linked somewhere). There is even an explanatory Jupyter notebook , which might help make things click for you.
