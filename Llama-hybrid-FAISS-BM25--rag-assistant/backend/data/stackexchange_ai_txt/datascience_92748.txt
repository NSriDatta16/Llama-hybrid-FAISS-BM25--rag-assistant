How to make a neural network output a specific number out of a certain range?

I have a neural network with an Input layer, 2 hidden Dense layers and an Output layer. I would like for each neuron in the Output layer to give me a number between 0 and 2 (either 0, 1 or 2), like so: If I use a neuron for each possibility (a neuron for 0, a neuron for 1 and another for 2) and then pick the one with the best prediction, the output layer length would be far too much. Is there a way to implement this ? (I am fairly new to neural networks and the like)
