Tools for data mining hand-written html

I need to convert a large website from static html written entirely by humans into proper relational data. First there comes a large amount of tables (not necessarily the same for every page), then code like this: Pidgin Author: Sean Egan Version: 2.6.8 Psi Version: 0.13 Screenshots: and then some tables again. I've tried using an HTML parser and looking for a[name] (a CSS selector), but i always got some entries lost: sometimes, because of non well-wormed html written by civilians, it thinks that some entries are inside each other instead of a flat list. Right now i'm using some Vim regexes grouped into a function which transform this code into XML, but this isn't a silver bullet either: most output files aren't well-formed because some HTML slipped in. So i wonder which tools exist for doing tasks like this?
