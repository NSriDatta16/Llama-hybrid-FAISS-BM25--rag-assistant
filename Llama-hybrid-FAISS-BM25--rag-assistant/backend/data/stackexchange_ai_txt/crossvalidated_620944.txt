How do I determine whether there is a correlation between geographic groups and PC2?

I have used PCA on a group of individuals based on a specific feature of their genetic data. I now want to see if PC1 or PC2 correlates with their grouping based on geographic location (each individual falls into one of 12 groups based on their location). So basically, I want to ask do individuals in group 1 have significantly lower PC1 values compared with the rest of the individuals? Any ideas on how to test this?
