Three Entity Intersection Table "many-many-many"

I'm currently working on a data model design (which will be backed by an RDMS). It is based around 3 entities relating to benefits for a member of the organization. The entities are the Benefit, Membership Type, and Provider. I've created a standard many-to-many intersection table to relate two entities, but never 3. I'm wondering if anybody has done such a thing and if there are any potential pitfalls I should keep out for. The table would be like the following: create table BENEFIT_MEM_TYPE_PROVIDER ( BENEFIT_ID reference BENEFITS not null, MEMBERSHIP_TYPE_ID reference MEMBERSHIP_TYPES not null, PROVIDER_ID reference PROVIDERS not null, primary key (BENEFIT_ID, MEMBERSHIP_TYPE_ID, PROVIDER_ID) ) Something about this relationship just doesn't sit right with me, so I thought I'd ask the smart folks for any advice. Thanks
