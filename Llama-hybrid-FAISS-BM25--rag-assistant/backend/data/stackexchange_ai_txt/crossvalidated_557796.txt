How to compare two random forests in scikit-learn?

With most learning algorithms, one can compare the models resulting from applying the algorithm on samples of data by the parameters of the models. For example, one can compare two logistic regression models by comparing the learned model parameters (I'm not referring to the hyperparameters here). I would like to do that with two random forest models trained with scikit-learn's random forest algorithm. However, I do not see any properties or methods that give me access to parameters that can be used to draw a comparison. How would you compare two random forest models?
