Not at the javascript level. You can have a good deal of control on what the user agent (browser) will attempt to do, by changing the the Mime Type of the content served - that can be done from the web server or server side application. That means, your ".txt" file is sent to the browser with a Content-Type: text/plain http header. If instead it is served with: Content-Type: application/octect-stream http header instead, most likely the user will be prompted to save the file (regardless of the file name or extension)
