Explain overfitting / data leakage to a colleague

I have a situation where we are calculating a customer life time value using some binary variables (ie have they purchased xyz widget?, etc.) and multiplying by a number that we believe approximates the value of these behaviors. CLV = x1 * 500 + x2 * 300 + x3 * 100 The problem comes when a colleague wants to do a logistic regression to determine which customers will have CLV's above a certain threshold (ie if CLV >= 1000, y = 1, else y = 0 )and use x1 , x2 and x3 as variables. I'm pretty certain this is a no-no as it's basically leaking info to the model but I'm having a hard time explaining this to my colleague. Has anyone dealt with this issue before or know of a good source to explain this to someone who is math literate and intelligent but just doesn't have a ton of experience with modeling?
