Basically it depends on what you're after and how you want to organize your code. If DataTypeA is distinctly different than DataTypeB (i.e. Animals vs. Automobiles) then you'd probably want to use different controllers. But, if DataTypeA is a subset of (or similar to) DataTypeB, then I'd use one controller with different actions. ASP.NET MVC is so flexible it is very cool, though admittedly, at the beginning, the flexibility feels like you're drowning. Just start writing code and you'll realize if you're headed down the wrong path. There is a learning curve to MVC. Go with it.
