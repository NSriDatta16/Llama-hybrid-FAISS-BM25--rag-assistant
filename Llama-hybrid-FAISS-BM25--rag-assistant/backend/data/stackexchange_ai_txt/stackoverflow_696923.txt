Drag and Drop files into a SharePoint webpart to upload into DocLibrary

Is it possible to create a SharePoint (wss3 or MOSS 2007) webpart, to allow files to be dragged and dropped onto it, which would then upload the files into a predefined document library ? I imagine that this would require some form of client side scripting (Ajax ?), but my knowledge in ajax is a bit sketchy. From my exploration so far, I'm thinking: User drags file onto 'drop zone' Webpart. This action triggers some code This code Loads the file into a SharePoint library (like this : Uploading a File to SharePoint ) Any pointers would be gratefully recieved Many thanks. Nick
