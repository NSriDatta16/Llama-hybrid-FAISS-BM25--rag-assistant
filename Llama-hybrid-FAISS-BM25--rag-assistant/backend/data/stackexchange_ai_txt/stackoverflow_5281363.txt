Both can be used, and there is no "standard" as such, but they have a few key differences: Jetty has traditionally had better support for embedding within your own code (starting from code, for instance a test), although I hear this has gotten better in Tomcat 7. Jetty is probably the fastest of the two, while Tomcat has much higher standards compliance. If your application is to be run on a different applications server in production, Tomcat is probably the best choice.
