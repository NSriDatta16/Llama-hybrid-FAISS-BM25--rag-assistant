I think in your case, it'd be necessary to drop an agent on to their network which performs the authentication locally, then creates a signed token which "proves" to your SaaS app that it has done so; this can be passed on by the browser in a query string or form post (for example). The agent might be an IIS-installable web app which can just authenticate the user and then direct them on to your servers in the cloud. This should not be a major hassle to install, but will create tech support issues. In particular, you need to get this component right first time, as users are not going to update it on a regular basis. Making it work securely may be interesting.
