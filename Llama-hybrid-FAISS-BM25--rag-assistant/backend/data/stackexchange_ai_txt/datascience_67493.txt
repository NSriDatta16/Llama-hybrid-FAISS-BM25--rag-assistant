Techniques for increase random forest classifier accuracy

I build basic model for random forest for predict a class. below mention code which i used. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler ss2= StandardScaler() newdf_std2=pd.DataFrame(ss2.fit_transform(df2),columns=df2.columns) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(df2,y2,test_size = 0.3, random_state = 0) from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=2, random_state=0) clf.fit(x_train,y_train) clf.score(x_test,y_test) output accuracy of the model 0.758266818700114 I got 75% accuracy but i want increase accuracy furthermore, so what are thing i want to do this code, for increase accuracy? or is there any classification techniques better than random forest please suggest? this data set have lot of outliers and missing values before build model i removed all missing values and outliers
