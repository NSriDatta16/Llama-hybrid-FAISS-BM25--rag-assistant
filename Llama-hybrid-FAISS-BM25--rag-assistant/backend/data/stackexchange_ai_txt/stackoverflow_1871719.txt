Hey, I have check the documentation for Doctrine 1.2, and the way to create the query is (put attention on the alias): $query = Doctrine_Query::create(); $query->addSelect('AVG(price) as price'); $query->addSelect('AVG(cost) as cost'); // as many addSelect() as you need $query->from('my_table'); To output the SQL query created: echo $query->getSqlQuery(); To execute the statement: $product = $query->fetchOne(); And to access the retrieved data is: echo $product->getPrice(); echo $product->getCost(); Read the rest of the documentation at Group By Clauses .
