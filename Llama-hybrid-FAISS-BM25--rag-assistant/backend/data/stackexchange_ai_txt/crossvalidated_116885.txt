What method should I use to model simplified performance

I have the data of some build times. These builds occur on a cloud and the runtime has been more varied than in the past. One thing that could be occurring is an improper sharing of resources between clients. To test this, I've downloading the dataset containing Start Time Agent ID Length of Run I want to test to see if when there are more machines running, the builds get slower. What method should I use to do this?
