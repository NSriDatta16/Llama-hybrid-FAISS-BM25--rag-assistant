Has anyone resharper 5 with xunit running?

I installed the latest binaries from http://xunitcontrib.codeplex.com/releases/view/35006 and followed the suggestions from http://xunitcontrib.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=79225 because the linked installation instructions are out of date (basically there are more libs to copy to the plugins dir) Now my resharper shows the plugin in the Plugins diialog, but I have no testing functionality at all. Not even Testdriven.NET seems to recognize the xunit tests (even if I "reinstalled" them via the xunit.installer.exe). What a drag! Anyone can give me a hand here? --Jan
