This is not cool API. It's object oriented, not service oriented. And it will not work. You will have to use KnownTypeAttribute (or ServiceKnownTypeAttribute) for polymorphic queries. (see this question). Also this is not very elegant solution and I would discourage you from that. Be explicit when in Service World.
