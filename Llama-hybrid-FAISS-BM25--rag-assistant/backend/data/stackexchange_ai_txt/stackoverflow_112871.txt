I'd go with just a single BoxItems table with IsDefective, ShippingBoxID, the shipping-box-related fields, ReturnBoxID and the return-box-related fields. Some fields will always be NULL for each record. This is a very simple and self-evident design that the next developer is unlikely to be confused by. In theory this design is inefficient because of the guaranteed empty fields for each row. In practice, databases tend to have a minimum required storage size for each row anyway, so (unless the number of fields is huge) this design is as efficient as possible anyway, and much easier to code to.
