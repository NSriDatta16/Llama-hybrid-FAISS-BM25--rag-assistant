I'm kind of surprised to learn this didn't get fixed for IE 8. Geez, talk about dragging your feet. This is an intentional omission in Internet Explorer's implementation of innerHTML â€” you can't set innerHTML in a table. The creator of the feature has offered an explanation and a workaround . Basically, you can get hold of an actual tbody node and use replaceChild() to turn the original table's tbody into that.
