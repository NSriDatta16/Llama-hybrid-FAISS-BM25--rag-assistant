With respect to factor analysis, I would recommend reviewing some of the answers to a question I asked previously, just so you're clear on what your goal is: What are the differences between Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis? Interpreting and creating correspondence analysis plots is discussed here (with examples on how to create the plots as well, pay strict attention to the differences in taking inference from horizontal and vertical axis distances) Interpreting 2D correspondence analysis plots
