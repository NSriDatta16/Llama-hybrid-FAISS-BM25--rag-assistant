Mozilla is trying this very hard with HTML 5 for things such as video, audio and drag&drop. However, they aren't being very successful yet since other some other browsers, including Internet Explorer and older versions of Firefox, don't implement these technologies. As a result, I don't think Flash-like technologies(including Silverlight) will be gone soon.
