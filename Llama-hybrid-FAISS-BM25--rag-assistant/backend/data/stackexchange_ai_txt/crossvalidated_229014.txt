Matrix notation for logistic regression

In linear regression (squared loss), using matrix we have a very concise notation for the objective $$\text{minimize}~~ \|Ax-b\|^2$$ Where $A$ is the data matrix, $x$ is the coefficients, and $b$ is the response. Is there similar a matrix notation for logistic regression objective? All the notations I have seen cannot get rid of the sum over all data points (something like $\sum_{\text data} \text{L}_\text{logistic}(y,\beta^Tx)$). EDIT: thanks for joceratops and AdamO's great answer. Their answer helped me to realize that another reason linear regression have a more concise notation is because the definition of the norm, which encapsulate the square and the sum or $e^\top e$. But in logistic loss, there is not such definition, which makes notation a little bit more complicated.
