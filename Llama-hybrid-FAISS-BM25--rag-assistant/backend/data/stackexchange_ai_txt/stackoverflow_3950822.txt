How can I get the object of an Event in objective-c?

I would like to know which element was under the finger, when the touch event was called. Got this event-method: - (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {} I know how to get the object with custom events: for example: -(void)onThumbnailClicked:(NSNotification *)notification { //Image-Class has been instantiated a certain times and I get the touched Image through the notification object... Image* myObject = [notification object]; } To illustrate my issue: I instantiate a set of Image-Classes through Image *myImageView = [[Image alloc] initWithImage:myImage]; in this Image-Class I have touches-began / touches-ended methods. Know I try to figure out which image was under my finger when I touched the screen, to perform a certain Action.
