Frequency bin of the positive and negative frequency

I am using this MATLAB tutorial for Frequency-Domain Linear Regression. There is one part of code they provide, where it is necessary to determine the "frequency bin of the positive and negative frequency", for fft and ifft: freqbin = 72/12; freqbins = [freqbin 72-freqbin]+1; tsfit = zeros(72,1); tsfit(freqbins) = tsdft(freqbins); tsfit = ifft(tsfit); mu = mean(ts); tsfit = mu+tsfit; Length of time series is 72, and 12 months is considered as one cycle. How there can be only one frequency bin for positive frequency? How do we know that it is exactly 72/12 + 1 (+1 is because first bin is for zero frequency)? Is this some formula or what? I don't understand what is exacty frequency bin, and why there is only one bin for positive frequency? I thought that we have many bins in time series.
