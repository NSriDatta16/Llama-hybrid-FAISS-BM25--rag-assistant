I am interpreting your question as much more general in that "Is there any gain to using a reversible Markov chain over a non-reversible Markov chain?". Here are two reasons I can think of off the top of my head: Standard errors: If the chain is reversible, then a Markov chain CLT can hold for geometrically ergodic Markov chains while assuming only a finite second moment. If the chain is not reversible, then you have to assume $2 + \delta$ for $\delta > 0$ finite moments. So if you are estimating the posterior mean, and have only two finite moments available, then only a nonreversible Markov chain might not allow analysis of standard errors. You can find more information here . Spectral Gap: Often analysis of the convergence rates of MCMC samplers is done by looking at the spectral gap of the Markov chain. For a reversible Markov chain, the second largest eigenvalue determines the mixing time, and there are many known bounds for this. Maybe see a review here . So if your Markov chain is reversible, it is likely easier to study its convergence rates. There is also some work that has been done for non-reversible Markov chains (see this ), but the literature is not as rich. This is some more discussion on this in Mathoverflow . Overall, if you don't have a need to study the exact convergence rate for your sampler, and your distribution is well behaved enough that it has larger than 2 moments for most functions of interest, then there should be no reason to restrict yourself to just reversible Markov chains. This is part of the reason why fixed-scan Gibbs sampler are so often used; in practice nothing is lost.
