Neural Network Approximation Function

I'm trying to test the efficiency of the Neural Networks as approximation functions. The function I need to approximate has 5 inputs and 1 output, which structure should I use? I have no idea on what criteria should be applied in order to decide the number of Hidden Layer and the number of Nodes for each layer. Thank you in advance, Regards Giuseppe.
