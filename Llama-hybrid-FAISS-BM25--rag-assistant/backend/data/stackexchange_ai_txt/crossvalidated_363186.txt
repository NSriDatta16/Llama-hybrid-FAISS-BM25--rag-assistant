How often do you encounter normal and not-normal distribution, in real-life data? Honestly, you almost never encounter normal data in real-life cases. There are several tests like Shapiro-Wilks, and yes, with real data you are more likely to reject, even with big samples. (Almost always with time series data for example). Often it is better to be a little less strict, for example by looking at the QQ-plot (and not at the p-value). Is the distribution of the points close to what is expected in the normal case? If yes (and you define how close) then you can assume that the data are somewhat normal (ie: unimodal, not heavy tails ecc). However, even if the distribution of the individual observations is not normal, the distribution of the sample means will be normally distributed if your sample size is about 30 or larger This doesn't mean that if your sample is big the data is normally distributed. This refers to the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of large Numbers .
