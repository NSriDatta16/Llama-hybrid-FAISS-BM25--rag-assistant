MSBuild: Task to embedding a file before compilation

I have the following need: I'll have to create an MSBuild task that will produce an xml file, which I then need to embed as a resource to one of the projects being built. How do I change my MSBuild proj to accomplish that? Is there a built-in task I can use for embedding the file, or do I need to create one? If the latter, any direction on that would be great. Thanks in advance! Update: based on the suggestions given, I've ended up adding an empty xml file to the project as a resource, creating a simple MSBuild custom task (http://bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2008/02/15/the-custom-msbuild-task-cookbook.aspx) that writes content to that file as I need it, and running that task as a "BeforeBuild" target. Works like a charm. Note that I've had to "exclude the file from source control", so it won't get checked out every time I build the project, and I've also added some code to the task to make sure the file isn't read-only (http://www.del337ed.com/blog/index.php/2007/09/05/clearing-the-read-only-flag-on-a-file-in-c/).
