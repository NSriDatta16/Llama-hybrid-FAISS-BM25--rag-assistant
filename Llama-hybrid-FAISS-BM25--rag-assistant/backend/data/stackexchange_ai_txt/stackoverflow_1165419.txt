Problem with WCF Service - The protocol 'http' is not supported. How to resolve?

I'm after setting up a WCF service on my dev box but I'm getting an error when accessing it. I've set the service up as per this guide . It's is written in VS2008 / C# / .NET 3.5 and my dev box is Vista SP2 with IIS 7 . At the moment the service is nothing more than the default structure since I am literally after testing a connection to it. I've checked what needs to be installed and I'm fairly sure I've got everything enabled, screen shot below shows current options: Full error message on accessing http://localhost:8000/Service.svc is as follows: Server Error in '/' Application. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The protocol 'http' is not supported. Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. Exception Details: System.InvalidOperationException: The protocol 'http' is not supported. Source Error: An unhandled exception was generated during the execution of the current web request. Information regarding the origin and location of the exception can be identified using the exception stack trace below. Stack Trace: [InvalidOperationException: The protocol 'http' is not supported.] System.ServiceModel.AsyncResult.End(IAsyncResult result) +11536522 System.ServiceModel.Activation.HostedHttpRequestAsyncResult.End(IAsyncResult result) +194 System.ServiceModel.Activation.HostedHttpRequestAsyncResult.ExecuteSynchronous(HttpApplication context, Boolean flowContext) +176 System.ServiceModel.Activation.HttpModule.ProcessRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) +278 System.Web.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute() +68 System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously) +75 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Version Information: Microsoft .NET Framework Version:2.0.50727.4016; ASP.NET Version:2.0.50727.4016 Any suggestions on how to go about debugging / fixing the error would be gratefully received. Googling the error gives very little help. I've probably missed something really obvious! Edit - web.config as requested (apologies for its length): Asp.Net Configuration option in Visual Studio. A full list of settings and comments can be found in machine.config.comments usually located in \Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v2.x\Config --> section enables configuration of the security authentication mode used by ASP.NET to identify an incoming user. --> section enables configuration of what to do if/when an unhandled error occurs during the execution of a request. Specifically, it enables developers to configure html error pages to be displayed in place of a error stack trace. --> --> --> --> --> Edit 2 - I've removed the paragraph about creating a Delphi Win32 client since Delphi 2007 doesn't support SOAP 1.2, which is what the WCF Service uses. Delphi 2007 only supports SOAP 1.0... So client will now be a C# WinForms app.
