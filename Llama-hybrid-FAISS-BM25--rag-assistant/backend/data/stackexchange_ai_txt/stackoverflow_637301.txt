I think a cleaner organization would be to have a parallel hierarchy of display controls or formats. Maybe use something like the Abstract Factory Pattern to create both the instance of Customer and of CustomerForm at the same time. Display the returned CustomerForm instance, which would know about the extra properties and how to display and edit them.
