I think you may be using the wrong data structure. Instead I'd create two tables and pre-populate one with a 1000 rows (successes) and the other with 50 (failures). Put a primary ID on each. The when you record a result instead of inserting a new row find the ID+1 value for the last timestamped record entered (looping back to 0 if > max(id) in table) and update it with your new values. This has the advantage of pre-allocating your storage, not requiring a trigger, and internally consistent logic. You can also adjust the size of the log very simply by just pre-populating more records rather than to have to change program logic. There's several variations you can use on this, but the idea of using a closed loop structure rather than an open list would appear to match the problem domain more closely.
