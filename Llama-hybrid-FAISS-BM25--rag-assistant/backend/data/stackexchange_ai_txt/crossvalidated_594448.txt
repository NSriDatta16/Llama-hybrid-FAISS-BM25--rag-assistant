When to use train test split?

I am new to Machine Learning. I am trying to predict water levels and was given two data sets. 1 file is a Training data set with my water levels and factors that cause it, the other file is Testing data with only the factors and not including the actual water levels. I am thinking of using the method of Decisions trees, would I just make a model using my Training and then compare it to my Testing data? p.s sorry if this sounds confusing
