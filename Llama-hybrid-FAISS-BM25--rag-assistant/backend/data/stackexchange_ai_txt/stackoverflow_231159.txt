Use "greater than or equals" or just "greater than"

I remember from C days that we were encouraged to use i > -1 instead of i >= 0 because of performance. Does this still apply in the C# .NET world? What are the performance implications of using one over the other with today's compilers? i.e. Is the compiler clever enough to optimize these for you? (As an aside try and type the question "use >= or >" into the question field on Stack Overflow and see what happens.)
