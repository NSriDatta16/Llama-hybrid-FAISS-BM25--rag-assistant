Bayesian inference problem with three parameters

Assume that I observe a yearly time series for the number of certain events occurring per year. Also, assume that the data points come from a Poisson process with parameter $\lambda$ . The dataset in question is the dataset coal in the boot package. library(boot) data(coal) x Now, assume that there is a changepoint $t_1$ in the time series whereby points before $t_1$ are generated by a Poisson process with parameter $\lambda_1$ and points on or after are generated by a Poisson process with parameter $\lambda_2$ . I'm trying to perform Bayesian inference on the parameters $\lambda_1$ , $\lambda_2$ and $t_1$ to obtain the posterior distributions. I'm bound to use the following priors: $\lambda_1$ $\sim \Gamma(2,1)$ , $\lambda_2$ $\sim \Gamma(2,1)$ and $t_1\sim U(1851,1960)$ . how can I approach this task using direct sampling methods?
