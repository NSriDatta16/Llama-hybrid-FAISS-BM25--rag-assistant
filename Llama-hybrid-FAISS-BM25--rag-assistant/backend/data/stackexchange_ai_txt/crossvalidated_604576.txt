What should I do about it when I need the intercepts for the latent variable and for the indicators? Not sure why you would, since the latent variable's mean is arbitrary. The effects-coding identification constraint would do the trick ( Little et al., 2006 ), although it is just as arbitrary as any other constraint, despite the misleading title. In the case of only 2 reflective indicators, the factor mean would just be the average of the 2 indicator means, and the indicator means would be deviations around that "grand" mean. GDP ~ m2*1 M1 ~ m3*1 m2 == -1*m3
