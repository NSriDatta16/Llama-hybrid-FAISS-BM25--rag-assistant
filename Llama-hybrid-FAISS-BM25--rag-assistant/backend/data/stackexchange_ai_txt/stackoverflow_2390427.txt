If the methods on the stack are obfuscated in your release, you will get the obfuscated method names in any stack trace. If you put anything into your code to help you figure out what methods were involved, potential hackers can use that information to gain a better understanding of your code. One common strategy is to obfuscate only some of the code, including (but not limited to) the parts that do license checking. If you obfuscate JUST the license checks, it's pretty easy to zero in on the part that needs a hacker's attention.
