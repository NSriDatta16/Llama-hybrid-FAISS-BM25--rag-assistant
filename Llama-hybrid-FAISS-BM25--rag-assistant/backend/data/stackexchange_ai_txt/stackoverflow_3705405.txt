Flat files are a better choice than databases for tile-based maps. If you can fix the maximum number of objects that can be present on a tile - for pre-defined objects, this could just be a bitmask - then each tile will require a fixed amount of storage and you can then just lay out your map as a flat sequence of tiles. You can index to any tile (x,y) in this representation by seeking to the y * map_width + x -th position.
