JSON is basically a Javascript object storage format. So, it's native to Javascript. Loading a JSON File You could load a JSON file when your webpage is loaded like this, just like any .js file: —clipped— It is also important to have a callback function, or a function that's called when the JSON has loaded. For example, the contents of "myfile.json" should read: anz([arbitrary JSON here]); where anz() is defined somewhere as: function anz(JSONdata) { //process data here } JSON can also be dynamically loaded , or loaded after the page has rendered/loaded. Getting Data From a JSON File So, once you have a JSON file that is somehow loaded, and calls your callback function with the JSON data, you can read it — just like any other Javascript Object . If this was passed to your callback function… {"data":{"user_name":"Joe", "user_id":"97304239042", "user_rank":3}} … To get the user's name: function anz(JSONdata) { var userName = JSONdata.data.user_name; // userName returns "Joe" }
