Is there another property associated to each of your values? There are 'Value' and 'Text' properties on the value lists so if you could find something that sorts better to put in the 'Value' column I guess that might be ideal? If not you could probably use an UltraDropDown / UltraCombo instead of a value list. They are like mini UltraGrids so you should be able to apply the custom sort to one of those the same as you would on a grid (not 100% sure but I don't have Infragistics on this computer so I'll check at work tomorrow).
