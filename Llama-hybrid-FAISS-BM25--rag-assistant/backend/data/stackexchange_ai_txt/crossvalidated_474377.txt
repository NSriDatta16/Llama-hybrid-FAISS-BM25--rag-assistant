Machine Learning terminology to describe when using future data to predict the past values?

In time series forcasting, do we have a terminology to describe that, when we randomly shuffle the data and training on future data and predicting the past values? I mean if we destroy the sequential order within the data and build a bad cross validation, what technical term in Machine Learning to describe that behavior? In Chinese, we often use time travel , but I've never seen people use this in English.
