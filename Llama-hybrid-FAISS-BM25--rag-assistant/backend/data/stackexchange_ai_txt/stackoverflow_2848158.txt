Wouldn't it be easier to set the class or style property of found paragraph to text-weight: bold or a class that does roughly the same? That way you wouldn't have to worry about adding in tags, or searching for existing tags. Might perform better, too, if you don't have to do any string replaces. If you really want to add the strong tags anyway, I'd suggest using DOM functions to find childNodes of your paragraph that are , and if you don't find one, add it and move the original (text) childNode of the paragraph into it.
