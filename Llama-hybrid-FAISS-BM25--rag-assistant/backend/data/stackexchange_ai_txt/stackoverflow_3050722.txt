Of the languages you've mentioned, you will probably find the most readily useful tools available in Java, especially for machine learning resources. A good example of this is WEKA , which is a popular data mining tool written in Java. Machine learning algorithms are generally something you don't want to have to code from scratch if you don't have to. Although you would certainly learn a lot from doing so, they can take a significant amount of time to debug since it can often be hard to tell the difference between working and non-working behavior, e.g., they can sometimes fail to learn either with or without bugs, and they can also learn patterns with or without bugs. I'd look for tools first, then decide on the language with the tool options in mind.
