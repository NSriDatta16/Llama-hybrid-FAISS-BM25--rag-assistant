I've extracted a bit of code to get you on your way.. This code allows you to place text anywhere on a page using an x and y. You may actually want to use iTextSharp's built in paragraph and margin support, but this will be useful, just needs converting to C# Dim stamper As PdfStamper Dim templateReader As PdfReader = New PdfReader(yourFileName) Dim currentPage As PdfImportedPage = stamper.GetImportedPage(templateReader, 1) stamper.InsertPage(1, PageSize.A4) Dim cb As PdfContentByte = stamper.GetOverContent(1) cb.AddTemplate(currentPage, 0, 0) Look this next bit with each element you want to add.. cb.BeginText() cb.SetFontAndSize(bf, 12) cb.SetColorFill(color) 'create a color object to represent the colour you want cb.ShowTextAligned(1, "Content Table", x, y, 0) 'pass in the x & y of the element cb.EndText()
