All characters that may be bullet points (e.g. "*") or "dash" points

This question is a simple point (pardon the pun): What are all the characters that may, when starting a paragraph, be reasonably interpreted as indicating (in the Anglo-saxon demographic) that the paragraph was meant to be a bullet point or a "dash" point. Here are the ones I would expect, so far: Bullets Asterisk: "*", HTML entity &#8266; : "•" Dash The dash: "-" The en-dash ( &ndash; ): "–" The em-dash ( &mdash; ): "—" Are there others? Thank you for reading. Brian
