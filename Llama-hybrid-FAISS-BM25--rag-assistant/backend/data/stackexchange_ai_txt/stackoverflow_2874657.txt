Spiking neural networks

Which is the book one should start with in the domain of spiking neural networks? I know about Gerstner's "Spiking Neuron Models" , published in 2002. Is there a more recent book, or maybe a more suitable one? I have a background in maths and artificial neural networks. If there are some good articles or overviews in this domain, also add them to the list. Thanks. LATER EDIT Karel's answer: " It depends what do you mean by spiking neural networks - there are at least several basic points of view. Gerstner represents the first one - he is focused on modelling of biological neurons. And his book from 2002 is really good starting point for understanding bio-physical models of neuron. It the past it was possible to find this book also in html .. On the other hand by Â¨Spiking neuron" in the computer science context is usually meant the SRMo model (Spike Response Model), which can be used also as an alternative to classical percepron-based networks. This model is described very well in the works of Wolfgang Maass ( http://www.igi.tugraz.at/maass/ ). He has focused on the computational power of the model and he compares the SRM model with percepron and RBF-unit. If you want to use the model in a network I recommend to you works of Sander Bohte ( http://homepages.cwi.nl/~sbohte/ ) who derived SpikeProp algorithm. (I personally derived a variant of SpikeProp which was fast enough to be used for real-word applications.) "
