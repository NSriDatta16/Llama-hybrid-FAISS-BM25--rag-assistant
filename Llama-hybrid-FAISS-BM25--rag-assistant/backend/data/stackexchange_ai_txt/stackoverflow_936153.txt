Regex matching in ColdFusion OR condition

I am attempting to write a CF component that will parse wikiCreole text. I am having trouble getting the correct matches with some of my regular expression though. I feel like if I can just get my head around the first one the rest will just click. Here is an example: The following is sample input: You can make things **bold** or //italic// or **//both//** or //**both**//. Character formatting extends across line breaks: **bold, this is still bold. This line deliberately does not end in star-star. Not bold. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries. My first attempt was: \1 ", "all") /> Then I realized that it would not match where the ** is not given, and it should end where there are two carriage returns. So I tried this: \1 ", "all") /> and it is close but for some reason it gives you this: You can make things bold * or //italic// or //both// * or // both *//. Character formatting extends across line breaks: bold, this is still bold. This line deliberately does not end in star-star. Not bold. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries. Any ideas? PS: If anyone has any suggestions for better tags, or a better title for this post I am all ears.
