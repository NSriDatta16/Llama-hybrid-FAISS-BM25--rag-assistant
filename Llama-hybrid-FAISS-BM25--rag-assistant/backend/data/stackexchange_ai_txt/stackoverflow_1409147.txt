A couple of questions: Is there actually a repository in C:\Webserver\SVMRepository? (can you verify that the directory contains subdirectories like conf, db, hooks, locks?) Which command are you trying to execute in TortoiseSVN? Also, note, I use TortoiseSVN on Windows 7, and it works exactly like expected. Note that I get exactly the type of error message when I try to use a repository directory that doesn't contain a repository. Ie. I simply created C:\Temp\svn, did nothing to it, then tried to import another directory using file:///c:/temp/svn as the repository url, and got this: Import C:\Temp\dddd to file:///c:/temp/svn Unable to open an ra_local session to URL Unable to open repository 'file:///C:/temp/svn'
