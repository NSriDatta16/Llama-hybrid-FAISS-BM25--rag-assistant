Well horses for courses. For a little utility app you would probably be better off using the VS "Visual/RAD" style of programming. Eg drag and drop tables etc on to the form, like most of the tutorials show. Strictly speaking, and for a larger app, a more correct way would be to make a separate assembly(.dll) that handles data access and you call the classes within that assembly from the main form. This concept goes under a number of terms, but effectively you want to separate your concerns. In other words, let the UI handle UI interactions, have a separate assembly/project/whatever that handles database interactivity, and another separate assembly/project/whatever that handles business logic etc. That last couple of sentences can mean different things to different people, and there is no 100% correct way to do things.
