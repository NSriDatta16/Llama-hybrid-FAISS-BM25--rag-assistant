How would the size of my dataset influence MCMC output?

I'm runing MCMC using Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to fit an equation with 6 parameters on a dataset composed of 30 instances. How will the fact that my dataset is so small impact the posterio distribution of each parameter? And therefore its confidence interval?
