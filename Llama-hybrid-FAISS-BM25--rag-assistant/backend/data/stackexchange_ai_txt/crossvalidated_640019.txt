First, I think the $p = .000$ just isn't being precise enough. You likely have a very large decimal value that is cutoff by the output here (I'm not sure how this works in Python so I am making assumptions). It would certainly be suspect if it was exactly zero. Based off what I think you say above, you have an absurdly high number of observations of around $n = 335,464$ (which is a good thing of course). Looking at your standard errors, they are consequently quite small. So whatever your p-value actually is, the output at least at surface value seems logical, but perhaps not as precise as it should be. In any case, if they are indeed considerably low and this is for a scientific article, you can simply report it as $p (as far as I know, this is the APA standard...one reports to the nearest three decimals possible). Having said all of that, note here that your $\beta$ coefficients here are, if set to the defaults in logistic regression, on the logit scale. To get an idea of what the actual effect size is for each predictor (how strong the effect is), you should probably transform the coefficients by exponentiating them to get odds ratios that are directly interpretable (rather than relying on $p$ values alone). Or you can transform them to probabilities and generate predictions based off different inputs. A couple more things. First: To be honest I am not exactly sure what add_constant() is for, but most online examples include it and my question stands regardless of it. Never use statistical functions if you don't know what they do. Check the documentation, but I think Python is sometimes known for having bad docs on stats topics. Second: I never learned any statistics, but from looking around I think this problem calls for a binomial logistic regression. You really ought to stop with your analysis and learn the basics of statistics before running models. Since you appear to be doing analysis on linguistics data, I recommend reading the book Statistics for Linguists by Bodo Winter. Though it is written in the R programming language, it does an excellent job of explaining regression modeling strategies that I think would be helpful in your case.
