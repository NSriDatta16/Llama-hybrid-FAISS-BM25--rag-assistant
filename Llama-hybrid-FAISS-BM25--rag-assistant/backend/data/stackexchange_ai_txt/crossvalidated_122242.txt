Fitting multiple models to a noisy measurement

I have measured a quantity for a set of data contains couple of thousands objects. Since the measurement is very noisy, I need a set of data contains a lot of objects. Then I have a model based on the measured quantity which is a function of four free parameters. The problem is that in the data that I am dealing with I can fit more than one model but I am not sure how many model I can fit. My first question is: How could I find out how many models I need to describe the data? Something like Dirichlet Gaussian Mixture model is the way to go or other methods? My second question: The data is very noisy and using an approach like Monte Carlo Markov Chain is not the best option, what are the other options to deal with noisy data and fitting more than one single model to the data?
