Making telephone call from ASP.NET application

I have a requirement that we need to make a telephone call using ASP.NET application. Our ASP.NET application is used in call center. Currently, they make a call to customer manually. Now, the call should go from our application by clicking the phone number link and starts recording the conversation between the agent (application user) and customer. What all would be the hardware requirements for the above scenario? How can we implement telephone calling in asp.net application and what are the required components to implement the same?
