Rubin's rules work on means and their standard errors, so they are only really valid if a normal approximation is appropriate for your statistic. PROC FREQ provides an asymptotic standard error for proportions ( $\sqrt{\hat p(1-\hat p)/n}$ ) which you can combine along with the proportion estimate using PROC MIANALYZE . This might be acceptable for larger samples with proportions that are not close to the boundaries (0 or 1). More commonly you would run a logistic regression and combine the estimated parameters in the log-odds scale along with its estimated standard error. The advantage here is that working in the logit scale will be more appropriate than doing the normal approximation in the proportion scale, but you'll have to back-transform your combined statistic to the proportion scale. There's obviously a lot of extenstions or other models you can apply as well. The gist however is that anything you combine using Rubin's rules assumes an asymptotic normal distribution.
