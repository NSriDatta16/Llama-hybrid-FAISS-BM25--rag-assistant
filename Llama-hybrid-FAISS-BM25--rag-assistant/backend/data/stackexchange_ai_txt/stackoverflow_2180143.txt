Can I call GORM "find" methods on an object instead of the class?

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that groovy is more dynamic than java. I'd like to have a block of code that does TypeA type = //do something to build an object TypeA dbType = TypeA.findBySomethingAndSomething(something, somethingelse) if(dbType != null) type.id = dbType.id type.save() but that can work for multiple objects that support the same findBySomethingAndSomething method. Is it possible to say def type = //do something to build an object def dbType = type.findBySomethingAndSomething(type.identifier, type.otheridentifier) if(dbType != null) type.id = dbType.id type.save() Is there a "better" way to accomplish this? I'm trying to avoid a large switch statement or if / else series that does essentially the same thing for each type.
