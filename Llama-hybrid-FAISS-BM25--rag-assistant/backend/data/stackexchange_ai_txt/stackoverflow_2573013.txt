First of all, embedding large amounts of binary data in XML is not a good idea, IMHO. To answer your question, you need an encoding scheme that supports binary data, such as Base64 . See this page for more than one way to represent arbitrary NSData as a Base64-encoded string: http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?BaseSixtyFour UPDATE: The link to Colloquy's NSData additions seems to be broken on that page. Here's the new URL: http://colloquy.info/project/browser/trunk/Additions/NSDataAdditions.m
