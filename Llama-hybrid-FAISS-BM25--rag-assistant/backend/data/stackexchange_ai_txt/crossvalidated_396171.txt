The reason why you see only a dot in the plot is because the dimensions you're plotting are actually the ones that contain the zeros you mention. The matrix A is 4x4, and the non-zero diagonal entries are in the third and fourth columns. If you use the corresponding columns from the matrix transformed_data you will see the correct data plotted. Also, as @galoosh33 said, the opt_sphere returns a semi-definite matrix, so non-diagonal negatives are OK. If you would like to plot that out you could use 2 or 3 out of the 4 dimensions, or use PCA to further combine them: c = [1,0,0;0,1,0;0,0,1]; scatter(transformed_data(:, 3), transformed_data(:, 4), ones(size(transformed_data,1),1)*30, c(id,:)); [~,score] = pca(transformed_data); scatter3(score(:,1),score(:,2),score(:,3),ones(size(data,1),1)*30, c(id,:)); It is much later than the original post, so I guess the OP found a solution, but I hope this still helps somebody.
