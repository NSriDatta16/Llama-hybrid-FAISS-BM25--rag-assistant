I've gotten this question a few times, so I decided to write up a small explanation of the overhead with some sample numbers based on common case. You can read it on my blog at http://netsekure.org/2010/03/tls-overhead/ . Summary from blog post: The total overhead to establish a new TLS session comes to about 6.5k bytes on average. The total overhead to resume an existing TLS session comes to about 330 bytes on average. The total overhead of the encrypted data is about 40 bytes.
