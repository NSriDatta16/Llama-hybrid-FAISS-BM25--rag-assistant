Best way to handle global state

I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice on 'best practices' for using global state in a web application - specifically PHP, although im looking for generic best practices i.e. design patterns etc. At the moment I just use a static class, calling it Configs. I suppose this is similar to using the registry pattern but surely there is a more elegant way of handling global data within an application - i just cant think of a better way though.
