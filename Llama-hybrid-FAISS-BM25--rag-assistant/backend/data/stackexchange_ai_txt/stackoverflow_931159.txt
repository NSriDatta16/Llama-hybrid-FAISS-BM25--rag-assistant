The easiest universal way I can think of to mod the alpha would be through a uniform passed to a vertex or fragment shader. VBO's might help, but it's a little hard to tell without more info about what you're actually doing... VBO's help when you have more vertices than your bandwidth to the card can handle in a frame - so if you have really complicated meshes (high res terrain for example) they might be what you're looking for. (In reply to comment) sounds like your DrawPixel routine is implemented in immediate mode, which is really inefficient. Try using vertex arrays instead of glBegin()...glEnd() - I bet you'll see a lot of the same performance improvement you got from draw lists.
