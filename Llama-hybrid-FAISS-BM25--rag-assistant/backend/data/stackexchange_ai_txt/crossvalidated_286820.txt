Intuitively understanding the formulation of Utility as 1 - alpha of a reward

I was reading the construction of a utility function in "Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis" by Jim Berger (page 52) -- below. So I get that if say you have two outcomes -- one the worst possible with reward r0 = 0 and one that best possible with reward r2 = 1 and if you are trying to determine the utility of reward r3, you can propose a gamble where the utility of r3 is equivalent to a gamble r1 with odds alpha and r2 with odds (1 - alpha) -- I follow it up to this part. What I don't understand intuitively is why the author then proceeds to define the utility of r3 as equal to (1 - alpha) -- I mean that is the coefficient of r2 -- why not just define it as alpha instead?
