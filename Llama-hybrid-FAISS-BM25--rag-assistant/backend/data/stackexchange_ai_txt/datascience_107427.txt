I found Superhuman AI for multiplayer poker a good paper on card games. Even though it is talking about a 6-player game, there is still much to use here. E.g. they reduce the huge number of betting moves to round numbers by action abstraction. (But note that this is mainly for training, and they let it be flexible when in actual play.) Also this bit sounds like it might apply to your game: The other form of abstraction that we use in Pluribus is information abstraction, in which decision points that are similar in terms of what information has been revealed (in poker, the playerâ€™s cards and revealed board cards) are bucketed together and treated identically The other game your description reminded me of is sokoban, which is single player. You could consider the number of next moves is just 4 (the 4 directions the player can move), but from that point of view the games last hundreds and thousands of moves, and a mistake on move N is only discovered when you find a deadlock on move N+100. (Minimizing the number of moves made is a common metric used to evaluate a solver.) arXiv:1802.04697 is a machine learning approach. I found it a bit disappointing, as I was more looking to find out what the state of the art currently is. They didn't compare their results to other sokoban solvers, which I take to mean their machine learning version was inferior, and that the best solvers are still hand-crafted expert systems. But from your point of view that might make it a useful paper, and the Related Work should give some more jumping off points.
