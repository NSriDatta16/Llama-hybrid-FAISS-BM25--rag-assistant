Netherlands Antilles dissolved as per 10-10-10, how to change Country dropdowns?

See also Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles . In a nutshell: Curaçao and Sint Maarten become autonomous and the remnant of the islands (the BES islands ) become special municipalities of the Netherlands. The question is: how should we replace Netherlands Antilles (with country code ISO-3166-2:AN ) in the country dropdown of the average webapplication? I can't find any information about the new country codes. Do we have to add Curaçao and Sint Maarten to the dropdown with the country code AN? How about the BES islands?
