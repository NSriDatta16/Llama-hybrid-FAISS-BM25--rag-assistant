One (storage-hungry) solution would be to pre-compute and store a number keyword prefices alongside the actual keyword itself. Then based on the look criteria you would do a direct equality comparison on the relevant prefix column (if one existed) or else fall back to performing a "like" comparison. For example, suppose to impose a limit that the search word must contain at least 3 characters. You could create columns Prefix3Chars, Prefix4Chars, Prefix5Chars. Say the user enters the search word "Hello" and your database contained a key word "Hello, World". You would elect to search on the Prefix5Chars column and would match against the key word "Hello, World". If the user performed a search with key word "Hello, W" you would fall back to searching using "like".
