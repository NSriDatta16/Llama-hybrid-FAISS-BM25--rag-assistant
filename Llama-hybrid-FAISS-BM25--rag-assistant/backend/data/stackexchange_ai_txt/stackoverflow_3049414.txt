A developer I work with encountered a similar problem, where the large streams used for the serialization fragmented the memory heap and the garbage collector was unable to compact it sufficiently to allow him to reallocate the memory. If you are serializing many objects repetitively I would allocate a single buffer, and then clear it each time you finish, as opposed to disposing it and creating a new one. That way you only need the memory to create it once and then your app should continue to work effectively. I'd also mention @yetapb comment that the data might be paged and written in a streamed fashion. That way you shouldn't need an enormous buffer in memory to store the data.
