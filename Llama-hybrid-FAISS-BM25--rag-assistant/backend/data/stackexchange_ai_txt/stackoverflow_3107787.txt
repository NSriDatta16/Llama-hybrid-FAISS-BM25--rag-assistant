Quote From http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html Accessing files on external storage If you're using API Level 8 or greater, use getExternalFilesDir() to open a File that represents the external storage directory where you should save your files. ... If the user uninstalls your application, this directory and all its contents will be deleted. From my understanding this will create a file on the sd card which has a scope (like a directory of your applications package namespace) and the phone will delete the directory when you uninstall the app. I assume this is how Google apps achieves this function.
