How can my SSIS package best compare tables, then update a destination table from a source table only if needed?

I've got an Employees table on a SQL 2005 server, and a nearly-identical Employees table on a SQL 2008 server (the servers are not linked). One table is in the production database, and the other is in a dev database. I have to pull data from production into the dev database on a scheduled basis and I'm using SSIS to build a package to do this. I need to set up an SSIS package that will: Compare the two tables to determine if they are not 'synched'. That is, to see if the prod table has rows that are not yet in the dev table. Only if necessary--update the dev table with just the new rows from the prod table. I've muddled around with a few ways of doing this, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution than what I've been able to come up with. What's the best way to do this?
