representing play in relational db

I run a project that deals with plays, mostly Shakespeare. Right now, for storage, we just parse them out into a JSON array formatted like this: [0: {"title": "Hamlet", "author": ["Shakespeare", "William"], "noActs": 5}, | info 1: [null, ["Scene 1 Setting", "Stage direction", ["character", ["char line 1", "2"]] | act 1 ...] and save them to a file. We'd like to now move to a relational database for a variety of reasons (foremost currently search) but have no idea how to represent things. I'm looking for an outline of the best way to do things?
