The documentation is pretty complete: for the multiclass case, SVC which is based on the libsvm library uses the one-vs-one setting. In the case of a linear kernel, n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2 individual linear binary models are fitted for each possible class pair. Hence the aggregate shape of all the primal parameters concatenated together is [n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2, n_features] (+ [n_classes * (n_classes - 1) / 2 intercepts in the intercept_ attribute). For the binary linear problem, plotting the separating hyperplane from the coef_ attribute is done in this example . If you want the details on the meaning of the fitted parameters, especially for the non linear kernel case have a look at the mathematical formulation and the references mentioned in the documentation.
