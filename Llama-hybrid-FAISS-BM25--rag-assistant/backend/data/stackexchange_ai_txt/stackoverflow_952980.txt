Ignore client generated files in Perforce workspace view

Is there a way to have Perforce ignore new files in a client workspace in the workspace view? I have 120 java files that generate over 700 class files, so managing these files in a single folder view is tedious. I recognize generating the output in a separate folder is an elegant solution but not one that is feasible at the moment. Question 55449 relates to ignoring files that exist on the server, but the workspace view still includes these files. EDIT: I'm trying to exclude just .class files (or some other arbitrary filter) not ALL files. Reconcile Offline Work still shows these class files as well.
