You could use SARSA with function approximation to handle the continuous states. A good reference is the "Reinforcement learning: An introduction" by Sutton and Barto. Q-learning with function approximation is not proven to converge (although it might work in some specific cases). SARSA with linear function approximation is proven to converge to a ball around the optimal point for MDP's so with this approach you'll have some guarantees. For your function approximation you could also use neural networks. In any case, as I mentioned before, Sutton's book is a good reference
