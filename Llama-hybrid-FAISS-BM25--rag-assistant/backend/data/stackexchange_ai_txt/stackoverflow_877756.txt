I think the most abused feature would be using the default templates as is. Many of the templates include "partial" as well as the regions and include/using statements that aren't required by the code inside of the class. After that, I'd have to agree with the #region blocks; however, those CAN be useful if done properly. Usually though they are used as a means to organize classes that are larger than they probably should be.
