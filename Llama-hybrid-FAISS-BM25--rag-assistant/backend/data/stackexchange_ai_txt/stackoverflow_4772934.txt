You need to use a technology called AJAX to achieve this. As your question is not very specific the answer can't be either I'm afraid, but the general idea is a javascript running in the browser polls the server every couple of minutes for data, and the server returns some (XML in true AJAX, JSON, a HTML fragment, etc). The script then processes the data and modifies the DOM based on the results of the processing.
