Which algorithm or tool to use for object detection and extraction?

I will collect a dataset consisting of blackberries with and without defects. For this purpose, before I venture into this business I want to make sure that I can detect and extract blackberries from an image. So I have this image With the otsu method, morphology opening and closing I'm able to obtain a masked version of the image: Now I want to obtain a bounding box or extract every blackberry from the image. What tool should I use? A trained neural network? Are there other non neural network technique for this purupose? Results:Thanks to Kevin M
