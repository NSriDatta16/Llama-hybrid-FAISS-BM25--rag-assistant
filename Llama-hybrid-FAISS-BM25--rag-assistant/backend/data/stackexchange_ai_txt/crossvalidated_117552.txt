Let $X_t$ be a zero-mean covariance-stationary time series such that $$X_t = \varphi_1 X_{t-1} + \varphi_2 X_{t-2} + \varepsilon_t$$ where $\varepsilon_t$ is white noise. Using $L$ to mean the lag (backshift) operator, the above can be expressed as $$(1-\varphi_1L - \varphi_2L^2)X_t=\varepsilon_t . \tag{1}$$ Since $X_t$ is a covariance-stationary AR(2) process, the roots of its characteristic polynomial $(1-\varphi_1 z - \varphi_2 z^2) = 0$ must lie outside the unit circle. Thus, Equation (1) can be written as $$(1-\lambda_1 L)(1-\lambda_2 L)X_t=\varepsilon_t $$ where $\vert \lambda_1 \rvert and $\vert \lambda_2 \rvert . The last two inequalities are true of a covariance-stationary AR(2) process since then the roots of the characteristic polynomial, $z^*_1=1/ \lambda_1$ and $z^*_2=1/ \lambda_2$ , will lie outside the unit circle. Therefore, $$X_t= \frac{1}{(1-\lambda_1 L)} \frac{1}{(1- \lambda_2 L)} \varepsilon_t .$$ Expand the two fractions on the right-hand side in the equation above using the geometric series. and you'll have the Wold decomposition of an AR(2).
