javascript library based on jquery

What would be the advice on starting and organising a library of useful code based on the jquery library? Im thinking of starting this for all of the code that I use alot and ends up just being copied and pasted between projects. I would like to have all of this functionality included in some sort of library of plugins? Any ideas or best practices in this area? EDIT: A lot of advice here is with regards to creating plugins - thats proving to be helpful. Although, what i was really interested in is how to organise all of the plugins in one placce where i can simply call any piece of functionality whenever its required.
