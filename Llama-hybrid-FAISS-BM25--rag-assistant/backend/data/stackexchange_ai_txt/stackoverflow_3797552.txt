Does an ActiveMQ consumer need to be open when explicit acking messages?

My application does batch processing by reading messages from ActiveMQ. I read using the async JMS API by implementing MessageListener . But I ACK the messages only when the batch processing succeeds by calling message.acknowldge() [1]. What I ideally want is that till the batch processing is going on I do not receive any messages from the JMS broker. But I have doubt as to whether after closing the consumer, I would be able to ACK messages that I read earlier and which are being processed. In other words, does explicit acknowledgment using message.acknowledge() require that the ActiveMQ consumer be open?
