An array of unknown size is equivalent to a pointer for sizeof purposes. An array of static size counts as its own type for sizeof purposes, and sizeof reports the size of the storage required for the array. Even though string2 is allocated without an explicit size, the C compiler treats it magically because of the direct initialization by a quoted string and converts it to an array with static size. (Since the memory isn't allocated in any other way, there's nothing else it can do, after all.) Static size arrays are different types from pointers (or dynamic arrays!) for the purpose of sizeof behavior, because that's just how C is. This seems to be a decent reference on the behaviors of sizeof.
