I'd encourage you not to think primarily in binary terms (outliers vs. non-outliers) but rather to look more comprehensively for predictors that are associated with this variable. It's an interval-level variable, which means you might be able to test associations using ANOVA or regression. Chances are you'll want to transform the scores first, since they are so skewed; taking the square root might help. If you conduct an ANOVA or regression and find promising predictors, you can at that point return if you want to the narrower task of identifying or predicting outliers: you'll have a basis for saying what sort of person is likely to have the highest number of errors.
