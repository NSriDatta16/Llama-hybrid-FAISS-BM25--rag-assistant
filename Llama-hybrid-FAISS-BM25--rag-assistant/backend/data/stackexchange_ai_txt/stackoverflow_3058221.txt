Assuming that you expect the least significant bits to 'vary' the most, I think you're probably going to get a good enough distribution by just using the lower 16-bits of the value as a hash. If the numbers you're going to hash won't have that kind of distribution, then the additional step of xor-ing in the upper 16 bits might be helpful. Of course this suggestion is if you're intending to use the hash merely for some sort of lookup/storage scheme and aren't looking for the crypto-related properties of non-guessability and non-reversability (which the xor-ing suggestions don't really buy you either).
