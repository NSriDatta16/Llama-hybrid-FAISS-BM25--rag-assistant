Registering callbacks from text configuration file

I have a general problem where I have an array of function pointers. The challenge is to bind the functions to locations in the array based on a text configuration file. Is there a better way to do this than a gigantic if-else-else-...-else block? Is it easier to implement functors and bind locations to instances of a type? EDIT: For example, I might have: void func1(); void func2(); void (*fptr[2])(); I want to have an input configuration file that tells me that func1 goes in fptr[0] and func2 goes in fptr[1]. func1, 0 func2, 1 if-else means I stream the line in and I get a string fname = "func1", and a location_in_the_array, 0. So I'll have a block: if (fname.compare("func1")) { fptr[location_in_the_array] = func1; } else if (...) {} A map is a good idea, and it has flitted in an out of my brain a couple of times, but I am a space cadet, and forgot it before I asked.
