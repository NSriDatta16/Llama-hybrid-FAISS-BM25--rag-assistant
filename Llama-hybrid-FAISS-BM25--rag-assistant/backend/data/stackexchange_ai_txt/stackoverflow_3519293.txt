C#.NET: a library that outputs the same file

You have a library, and one of the function in the library provides a functionality that, among other things output a file (maybe to different paths in every execution). The content and the name of the file is constant in each execution. What is the best way to carry this out? declare the content of the file as a string and print it each time (probably not a good idea, the file is around 1000 lines long)? or have a file which always exist in the same folder as the library dll? How to make sure that the compiler will always include this file? Or is there any better way, for example embedding the file to the dll somehow? Note that outputting this file is not the only thing that the library do, it's one of the subtasks that is done by a function in the library Thanks!
