Cross validation with time series

Question: Is it correct to use k-fold cross validation for choosing the best forecasting model among several regression models? Case: Data come from a time series (e.g. prices), but I have access only to a random fraction of them. Instead of having 365data/year, I have only some of these observations in a casual order (e.g. 50 out of 365). Thus, I built several forecasting models (regression) based on external features that are available for every day avoiding a classical time series approach (ARIMA, etc.). I have read that CV isn't adapt to time series due to autocorrelation issues; however, I'm wondering if this problem could affect my analysis. What kind of test should I perform? What are potential problems I should pay attention to?
