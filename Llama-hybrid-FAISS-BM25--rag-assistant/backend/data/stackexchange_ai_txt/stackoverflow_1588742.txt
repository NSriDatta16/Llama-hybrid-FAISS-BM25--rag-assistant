Using v for view as a standard is particularly bad in my eyes because it prevents you from using one of the best ways of refactoring a database which is to rename the table and create a view with the old name that mimics the old structure so nothing breaks while you are making the change but you can start finding and fixing all the old references without having to fix all of them before the change is put to prod. I'm also with akf on the idea that the real problem is taking naming conventions from some other organization and ignoring the naming conventions of the current organization. I'd stomp on this fast and insist that he change all the objects and associated code to whatever your standard is or this will continue to be a problem.
