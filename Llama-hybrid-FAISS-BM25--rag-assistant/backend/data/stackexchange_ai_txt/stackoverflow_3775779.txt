As far as a form is concerned, it makes no sense to "submit" data to a fragment identifier â€” that is never sent to the server. The query string always comes before the fragment identifier. If you want to achieve this, you'll need to build the URI using JavaScript and not using standard form submission techniques. Most general purpose JS libraries come with routines to serialise form data to standard encoded data, this will get you most of the way there.
