How to handle and interpret highly skewed predictor in logistic regression?

I'm doing a Simple Logistic Regression using R. The description of the variable is listed below: vars n mean sd median trimmed mad min max range skew kurtosis se X1 1 1382 14410.84 39410.4 2352.5 5507.66 3235.03 7 440000 439993 5.83 43.1 1060.12 The outcome: alive deceased 1341 66 The data is highly right skewed. As far as I understand, logistic regression doesn't really care about normality. However, with highly skewed data like this, should I not transform the data? or is it not required? And if I should transform, how do I know which transformation to use, and how to interpret it?
