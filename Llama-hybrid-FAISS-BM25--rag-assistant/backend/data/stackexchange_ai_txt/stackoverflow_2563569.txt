When should I open and close a website's cached WCF proxy?

I've browsed around the other articles on StackOverflow that relate to caching WCF proxies for reuse, and I've read this article explaining why I should explicitly open the proxy before calling anything on it. I'm still a little hazy on the best implementation details. My question is: when should I open and close proxies for service calls on a website, and what should their lifetime be (per call, per request, or per web app)? We aren't planning on leveraging cached security contexts at the moment (but it's not unforeseeable). Thanks!
