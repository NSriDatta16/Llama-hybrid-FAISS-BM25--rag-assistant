Examples of errors in MCMC algorithms

I'm investigating a method for automatic checking of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and I would like some examples of mistakes that can occur when constructing or implementing such algorithms. Bonus points if the incorrect method was used in a published paper. I'm particularly interested in cases where the error means that the chain has the incorrect invariant distribution, though other types of errors (e.g. chain not ergodic) would be of interest as well. An example of such an error would be failing to output a value when Metropolis-Hastings rejects a proposed move.
