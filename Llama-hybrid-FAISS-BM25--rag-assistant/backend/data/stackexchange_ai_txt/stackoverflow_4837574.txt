This is an extremely hard problem, even for experts in speech and signal processing. This page has much more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_recognition And some suggested technology starting points: The various technologies used to process and store voice prints include frequency estimation, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, pattern matching algorithms, neural networks, matrix representation,Vector Quantization and decision trees. Some systems also use "anti-speaker" techniques, such as cohort models, and world models.
