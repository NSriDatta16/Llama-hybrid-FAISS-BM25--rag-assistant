My understanding is you have a categorical variable that could take on one out of 10,000 possible values. That is probably too high of cardinality for scikit-learn's OneHotEncoder to be useful. There are many other possible category encoders . Given the high cardinality, an useful option might be using a pre-trained word embedding space such as OpenAI embeddings . The embedding space would provide numeric values that are very amenable to anomaly detection.
