Two observations about the many questions and responses that may help still. Part of the confusion comes from glossing over some deeper math of probability theory, which, by the way, was not on a firm mathematical footing until about the 1940s. It gets into what constitutes sample spaces, probability spaces, etc. First, you had stated that after a coin flip we know that there is 0% probability it did not come up tails if it came up heads. At that point it doesn't make sense to talk about probability; what happened happened, and we know it. Probability is about the unknown in the future, not the known in the present. As a small corollary to that about what zero probability really means, consider this: we assume a fair count has a probability of 0.5 of coming up heads, and 0.5 of coming up tails. This means it has a 100% chance of coming up either heads or tails, since those outcomes are MECE (mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive). It has a zero percent change, however, of comping up heads and tails : Our notion of 'heads' and 'tails' are that they are mutually exclusive. Thus, this has zero percent chance because it is impossible in the way we think of (or define) 'tossing a coin'. And it is impossible before and after the toss. As a further corollary to this, anything that is not, by definition, impossible is possible . In the real world, I hate when lawyers ask "isn't it possible you signed this document and forgot about it?" because the answer is always 'yes' by the nature of the question. For that matter, the answer is also 'yes' to the question "isn't it possible you were transported through dematerialization to planet Remulak 4 and forced to do something then transported back with no memory of it?". The likelihood may be very low -but what is not impossible is possible. In our regular concept of probability, when we talk about flipping a coin, it may come up heads; it may come up tails; and it may even stand on-end or (somehow, such as if we were snuck into a spacecraft while drugged and taken into orbit) float in the air forever. But, before or after the toss, it has zero probability of coming up heads and tails at the same time: they are mutually exclusive outcomes in the sample space of the experiment(look up 'probability sample spaces' and 'sigma-algebras'). Second, on all this Bayesian/Frequentist philosophy on confidence intervals, it is true it relates to frequencies if one is acting as a frequentist. So, when we say the confidence interval for a sampled and estimated mean is 95%, we are not saying that we are 95% certain the 'real' value lies between the bounds. We are saying that, if we could repeat this experiment over-and-over, 95% of the time we would find that the mean was, indeed, between the bounds. When we do it with one run, however, we are taking a mental shortcut and saying 'we are 95% certain we are right'. FInally, don't forget what the standard setup is on a hypothesis test based on an experiment. If we want to know if a plant growth hormone makes plants grow faster, maybe we first determine the average size of a tomato after 6 months of growth. Then we repeat, but with the hormone, and get the average size. Our null hypothesis is 'the hormone didn't work', and we test that . But, if the tested plants are, on average larger, with 99% confidence, that means 'there will always be random variation due to the plants and how accurately we weigh, but the amount of randomness that would explain this would occur less than one time in a hundred."
