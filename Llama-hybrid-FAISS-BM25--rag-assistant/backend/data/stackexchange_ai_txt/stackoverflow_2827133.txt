How do I add a reference to a Web Application Project in an Associated Class Library?

I'm working on an internet application that has been set up as a web SITE project (I know...) in Visual Studio. I need to add additional features/functionality so have added a class library to the project and referred to it in the main web site project. The issue now arises because I need to make use of core objects which live inside the App_Code directory in the web site project but this project doesn't appear to expose its DLL like web app/ code library projects do. Because of this I can't add a reference to the web site project in the class library to leverage the common site-wide code/objects. I can't move the stuff out of App_Code so I'm looking for a way to refer to the website project dll from the new class library. Can anyone suggest a workaround? All help v. gratefully received :-)
