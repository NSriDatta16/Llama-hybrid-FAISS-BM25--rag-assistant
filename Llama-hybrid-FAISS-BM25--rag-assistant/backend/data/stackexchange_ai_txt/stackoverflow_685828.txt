How to get a table storage information

SQL Server Edition : SQL Server 2005 w/ SP3 and 2008 Is there a built-in SQL Server stored procedures that will retrieve following information? Or a DMV (Dynamic Management View) would be great as well. I am interested mainly on how to find out FILEGROUP data of a table specifically. But it'd be better if there was a sproc that will return all of following result. By the way, is there any documents that shows one-to-one matching of how to retrieve data that SQL Server UI displays?
