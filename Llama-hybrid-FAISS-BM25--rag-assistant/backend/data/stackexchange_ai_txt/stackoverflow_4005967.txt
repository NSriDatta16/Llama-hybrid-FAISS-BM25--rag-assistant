It's possible to write one liners in Python but it's awkward (Python encourages well indented code which is somewhat at odds with the "one-liner" concept). It's a bit easier in Python 3 because print() is a function and not a statement. Here's one: python -c "fact = lambda x: x * fact(x-1) if x > 1 else 1; print(fact(5))" Here's how you could write a grep like function (this example prints lines from input containing "foo"): python -c "for s in __import__('fileinput').input(): __import__('sys').stdout.write(s) if 'foo' in s else None"
