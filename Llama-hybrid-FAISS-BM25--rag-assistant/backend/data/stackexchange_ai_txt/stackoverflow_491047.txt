How to create a polldaddy like editor

Most of you here must have used polldaddy. I would like to get some advise from you guys about how can I design an editor like the one seen in polldaddy. Below is a screenshot. On the left side there is a list of controls (Text box, list etc) and on the right there is a panel(editor). I can click and drag on of the control and as soon as I drop it in the panel it aligns itself int he panel and shows other options. How can I do this using asp.net? Any samples or ideas would be great. Thanks alt text http://hdwall1.googlepages.com/poll.JPG
