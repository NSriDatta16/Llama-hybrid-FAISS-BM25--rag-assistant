What you might try is estimating quantile regression to predict, let's say, 1st and 9th decile (or other n-tiles) of declared income given all the other information. Then, for the test data, you can treat realized income outside of predcited ntile range as unusual (procedure sort of similar to hypothesis testing). In fact, quantile regression is available in the context of many machine learning models (glms, random forets, boosting trees and so on). Another thing you can try are Vine Copulas to estimate multivariate probability density. Then, compute marginal distribution of your income and compare it to realized values.
