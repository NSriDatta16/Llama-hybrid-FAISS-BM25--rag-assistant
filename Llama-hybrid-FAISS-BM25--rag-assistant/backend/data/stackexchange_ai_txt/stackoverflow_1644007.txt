How do I render an array of Java beans to XML with struts2?

My output should be something like this: 123 123 123 And the action class would have a method getFoos which returns an array of uniform objects, e. g. like this: class Foo { // ... public long getId() { ... } // ... } I'm using the XSLTResult like this: foos Since I don't want to postprocess the XML, I didn't specify any template, after reading several tutorials that said this would work. Instead, it gives me this error: javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: Operation not supported. - [unknown location] So I tried using a template, but it never rendered a list at all. Instead I get all properties of the beans toString() ed together empty document empty tag (not , strangely) I couldn't find a tutorial that helped me, neither on Beans->XML rendering nor XSLT. One problem is that I have trouble coming up with good search terms: googling "struts xml" and similar returns a huge amount of completely irrelevant links about stuff in struts.xml , excluding "struts.xml" from the results is no good either, because pages I'm looking for would likely have example struts.xml snippets. I think I wouldn't really need the templates, so if it's possible to do without, great.
