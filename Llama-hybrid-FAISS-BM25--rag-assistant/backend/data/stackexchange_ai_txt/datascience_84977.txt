You can use the following techniques to mask sensitive data: Substitution cipher - any character of plain text from the given fixed set of characters is substituted by some other character from the same set depending on a key. Tokenization masking - mask source string data based on criteria that you specify in an algorithm. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or other dimension-reducing techniques - combine several features and then carry out ML training only on the resulting PCA vectors. Data Coarsening - decrease the precision or granularity of data to make it more difficult to identify sensitive data within the dataset. Also, read Data Masking on Wikipedia.
