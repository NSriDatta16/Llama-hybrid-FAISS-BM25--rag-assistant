Is elegant, semantic CSS with ASP.Net still a pipe dream?

I know Microsoft has made efforts in the direction of semantic and cross-browser compliant XHTML and CSS, but it still seems like a PitA to pull off elegant markup. I've downloaded and tweaked the CSS Friendly Adapters and all that. But I still find myself frustrated with bloated and unattractive code. Is elegant, semantic CSS with ASP.Net still a pipe dream? Or is it finally possible, I just need more practice?
