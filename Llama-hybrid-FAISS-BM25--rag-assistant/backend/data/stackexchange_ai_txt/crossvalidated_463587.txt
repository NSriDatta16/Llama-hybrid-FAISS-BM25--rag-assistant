I am sorry if I rescue a fairly old question but I was facing a very similar problem recently and I stumble upon a paper that might offer some help. The article is: " Semi-analytical approximations to statistical moments of sigmoid and softmax mappings of normal variables " at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00091.pdf Expectation of Softmax approximation For computing the average value of a softmax mapping $\pi \left( \mathbf{\mathsf{x}} \right)$ of multi-normal distributed variables $\mathbf{\mathsf{x}} \sim \mathcal{N}_D \left( \mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma} \right)$ the author provides the following approximation: $$ \mathbb{E} \left[ \pi^k (\mathbf{\mathsf{x}}) \right] \simeq \frac{1}{2 - D + \sum_{k' \neq k} \frac{1}{\mathbb{E} \left[ \sigma \left( x^k - x^{k'} \right) \right]}} $$ Where $x^k$ represents the $k$ -component of the $\mathbf{\mathsf{x}}$ D-dimensional vector and $\sigma \left( x \right)$ represent the one-dimensional sigmoidal function. To evaluate this formula one needs to compute the average value $\mathbb{E} \left[ \sigma (x) \right]$ for which you could use your own approximation (a very similar approximation is again provided in the aformentioned article). This formula is based on a re-writing of the softmax formula in terms of sigmoids and starts from the $D=2$ case you mentioned where the result is " exact " (as much as an approximation can be) and postulate the validity of their expression for $D>2$ . They validate their proposal by means of numerical validation.
