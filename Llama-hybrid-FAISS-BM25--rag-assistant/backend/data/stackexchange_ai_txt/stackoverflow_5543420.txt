It can be done and, if you just need it for one site, you won't even need a plugin. Here's how it works: Create a static page; Create an empty template file; On the page editor, assign your template to the new page; Forget about the page, you'll just use it for the routing; The template file is now like any other php file. Implement your registration page there, include any other file containing the logic. This is not elegant, obviously - but then again, if /code is poetry/, it might be considered a DADA work. Uh, all of a sudden I came to a deep understanding of the principles underlying Wordpress!
