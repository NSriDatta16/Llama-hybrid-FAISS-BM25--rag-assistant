You will have to use a canvas if you want the squares to appear where the user clicks and drags. The mouse down event would define one corner and the mouse up the second. You'd have to constrain the movement of the cursor so that the x and y dimensions of the rectangle were the same. On each mouse move event you'd have to check if the cursor were over one of the existing squares and prevent the square growing any further. For the dragging of existing squares modify the mouse down event to check what's under the cursor. If it's the canvas start the square drawing mode, if it's a rectangle (square) then start the dragging mode. Again you'd need to use the mouse move event to check that the square doesn't intersect with any existing squares.
