for defragmenting tables... USE YourTable EXCLUSIVE PACK if your table has any memo fields do PACK MEMO if the table has indexes, the pack will automatically reindex them. As Arnis mentioned, most stuff in VFP are based on tables... forms, classes, reports although they have different extensions. So you could do use YourForm.scx exclusive pack memo use YourClassLib.vcx exclusive pack memo use YourReport.frx exclusive pack memo use YourProject.pjx exclusive pack memo Additionally, if for your regular .dbf tables you want to kill individual indexes... use YourTable exclusive delete tag MyIndexTag or, to delete ALL indexes delete tag all
