Sometimes free is too expensive Nothing prevents you from going with Open Source products with Microsoft, either. There are many open source projects written in .NET that can be leveraged with your solutions, and Microsoft is becoming a lot more transparent.

C# compilers are free Certain versions of Visual Studio are free. Do not fall for the anti-microsoft brigade telling you that it is high cost.
