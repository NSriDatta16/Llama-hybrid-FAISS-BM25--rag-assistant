Is there comprehensive list of activation functions and their applications for a Neural Network?

I am aware of common activation functions like sigmoid, tanh,ReLu, Leaky ReLu. Even heard about a function called Swish. Now is there any detailed information on other activations functions and some applications/comparative study on what functions performed better on what scenarios/dataset/problems ?
