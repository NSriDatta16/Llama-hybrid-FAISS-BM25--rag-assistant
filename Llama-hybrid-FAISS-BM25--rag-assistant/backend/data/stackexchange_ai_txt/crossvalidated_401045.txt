Why no variance term in Bayesian logistic regression?

I've read here that ... (Bayesian linear regression) is most similar to Bayesian inference in logistic regression, but in some ways logistic regression is even simpler, because there is no variance term to estimate, only the regression parameters. Why is it the case, why no variance term in Bayesian logistic regression?
