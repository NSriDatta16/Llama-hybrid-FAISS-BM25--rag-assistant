Do you just want to eliminate the space between the paragraph and the list? If so, use: ul.errorlist { margin-top:0; } Then add "margin-bottom:0;" to the paragraph (or just put the errorlist inside the p tags). If you also want the list to display on a single line, use display:inline as the others suggested.
