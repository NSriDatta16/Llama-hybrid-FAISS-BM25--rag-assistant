The problem of named entity resolution is referred to as multiple terms, including deduplication and record linkage . I doubt that it is possible to determine precisely, what software belong to some of the most popular for solving that problem. There are various approaches and algorithms can be used for named entity resolution. Therefore, software which implements those can be seen as complementary to each other (perhaps, there exist multiple research studies that compare and benchmark entity resolution approaches and algorithms, but so far I have seen only two of them - see references below, denoted with a triple asterisk "***"). This nice tutorial (in a form of presentation slides) on entity resolution provides a comprehensive overview of the problem and the solutions, including both approaches and algorithms. The tutorial also provides an extensive set of references to sources with further information. Speaking about corresponding software, one may find open source or dual-license projects, such as Java-based Stanford NLP Group software (which includes Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) ), Stanford Entity Resolution Framework (SERF) , LingPipe (which includes a NER module ) and Duke library, as well as Python-based NLTK software ( http://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html ). I realize that named entity recognition and resolution are quite different tasks , however, some of the above-referenced software, focused on the former, might be useful for the latter, by using appropriate code segments. Additionally, the following IMHO related/relevant software and papers might also be of interest: Information Extraction framework in Python ; GATE software , in particular, ANNIE information extraction system; several other NER tools, mentioned in this paper*** ; this excellent overview*** of NER approaches, including neural networks and deep learning; Ontotext's S4 (Self-Service Semantic Suite) on-demand software provides access to linked data repositories, such as DBpedia, Freebase and GeoNames; Elasticsearch NER plug-in for Duke ; this paper on Swoosh algorithms, implemented by SERF software; Wikilinks Corpus , released by Google; this paper on entity disambiguation; book "Data Matching" on record linkage, entity resolution, and duplicate detection.
