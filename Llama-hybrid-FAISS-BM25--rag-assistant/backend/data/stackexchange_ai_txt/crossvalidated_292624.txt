Is it possible for the typical value of a variable to not be in a data set?

Let's suppose I have a quantitative variable which stores the height of 300 different roller coasters. Assume that the 300 roller coasters provide a good representation of the total population of roller coasters. Furthermore, all of the roller coaster heights are even numbers (I know that this is extremely improbable, but scenario is for the purposes of the question). The distribution for the heights of the 300 different roller coasters is roughly symmetric, being centered around 135 feet tall. There are no outliers in the data. If I were to find a value for the typical height of a roller coaster, since there are no outliers, I would logically use the average. Suppose this is 135 feet. Would 135 feet, then, be the typical value for the height of a roller coaster, even if 135 is not a data point in the sample of roller coasters? Is the typical value for a data point in the population restricted to the values of the data points in the sample? Any help is greatly appreciated.
