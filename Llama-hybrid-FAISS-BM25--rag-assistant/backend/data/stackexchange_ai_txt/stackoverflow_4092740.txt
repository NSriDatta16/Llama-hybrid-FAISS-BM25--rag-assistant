You should be able to fix this by using the appendTo option , which will tell it where to attach the helper object to in the DOM. The default is to use parent which means the helper that's being dragged is inside your overflow: hidden div. Changing it to, for example, body should fix it for you. I.e: $( ".selector" ).sortable({ appendTo: 'body' });
