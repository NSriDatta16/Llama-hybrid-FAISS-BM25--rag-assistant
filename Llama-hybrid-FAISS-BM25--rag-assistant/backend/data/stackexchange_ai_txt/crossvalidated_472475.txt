Should I feed my neural network with "not-approved" profiles, even though I want to predict the approvals?

I have a categorical classification problem to solve in which I have a profile of a consumer and a loan order (which has a unique partner) and an end state of that order. There are 10% approvals. I want to have the approval rate for each partner, so I separated only the approvals and trained the network. Is my approach correct? What would happen if I feed my network with not approved profiles (maybe with an equal quantity)? EDIT: The approval rate for each partner is the percentage rate any user has to be approved by any one partner: 'user1': {'partner1': 0.9, 'partner2': 0.08, 'partner3': 0.02, ...} and as classes it will look like this: 'user1': {'partner1': 1, 'partner2': 0, 'partner3': 0, ...} To be more specific to try to clarify the problem and question: If I were going to train a network for binary classification I would include the two classes (the not approved profile and the approved one) for sure. But as I want the approval rate in comparison with each partner, I don't know if feeding the network with not approved profiles that has all the labels zeroed (even though there is a partner that "generated" that one of the specific zero) would be beneficial or no. I also thought that I can put the approval binary (approved=1 and not approved=0) into the features and has the labels always with a partner associated (or a 1 into the dummies of labels). And in the prediction (as I want the approval rate) I can always pass the approved label as a "static" feature. Let me know I you need more clarification please =)
