Monte-Carlo Simulations with multiple random variables

I have the following observation model : $y_i=x_i+a_i$, where $a_i$ is a Gaussian random variable whose mean is function of a uniform random variable $b_i$. I have designed, $\hat{x}_i$, an estimator of $x_i$ and would like to evaluate its performance using Monte-Carlo simulations. I use the following logic, which I appreciate if you can criticize: For i=1:I n=0 Generate an $x_i$ uniformly from a given distribution for j=1:J Generate $b_j$ as a r.v. from a given uniform distribution for k=1:K Generate $a_jk$ as a normal r.v. conditional to $b_j$ Generate synthetic data: $y_jk=x_i+a_jk$ Obtain $\hat{x}_n$ using $y_jk$ n++ end end find $\hat{x}_i$ as the average of $\hat{x}_n$ end calculate the RMS of error. Note that the distributions of $a$ and $b$ can be anything. However, I don't have access to the joint PDF's. Instead I have the following: The distribution of $x$ The distribution of $b$ The distribution of $a|b$
