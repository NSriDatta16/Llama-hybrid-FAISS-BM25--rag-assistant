You are probably referring to this article: Simonyan K. and Zissermann, A. (2014): Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition. Arguably, their main message is not that small kernels are better, rather demonstrating that the depth of the network is much more important than the size of the kernels. Also, they accredit the idea of using small kernels to Cire≈üan, D. C. et al. (2011): Flexible, High Performance Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification , however, this work performs no thorough comparison of effects of using small kernel size.
