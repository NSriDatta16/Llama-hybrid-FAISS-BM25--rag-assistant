Whenever someone talks about bias, you need to ask: "bias with respect to what"? In order to decide whether you should or should not include a variable in a regression equation, you need to first be able to define what your target of inference is (e.g, a total effect, a direct effect, etc), For instance, in your example, let $Y$ be happiness and $X$ be "winning a lof of money." Clearly, $E[Y|do(x)] = E[Y|x]$ , and the total effect of winning money on happiness is identified in your setup, without adjusting for anything else, so long as that the lottery was indeed randomized. Now let $Z$ be time spent with family. Suppose you want to know: does money have a direct effect on happiness, not through its effect on time spent with family? Now your target query is different, it is not the total effect anymore. For instance, to be more precise, suppose your study question is, "how much does happiness increase if someone wins the lottery, but we hold their time spent with family constant?" This question is given by the controlled direct effect $E[Y|do(x), do(z)]- E[Y|do(x'), do(z)]$ . Obviously, in general, $E[Y|do(x), do(z)]\neq E[Y|do(x)]$ , that is, the average total effect in general will be different from a controlled direct effect. Thus to estimate the direct effect, you indeed need to "block" the mediation path due to $Z$ . However you cannot simply blindly add $Z$ to your regression, even when $X$ is randomized. Since $Z$ was not randomized, adjusting for $Z$ can actually induce bias, because there could be unmeasured confounders of $Z$ and $Y$ . If that is the case, after including $Z$ in your regression you do not have a valid estimate neither of the total effect nor of the direct effect. For details and more discussion on all this, read the Crash Course in Good and Bad Controls , especially Model 11 (reproduced below) which is very related to your question.
