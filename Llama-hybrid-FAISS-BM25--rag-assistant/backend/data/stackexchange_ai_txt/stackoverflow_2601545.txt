Changing classes on multiple divs when selecting specific radio buttons

Hey everyone I got a javascript problem I can't seem to find a specific solution for on the web. What I want to be able to do is select one of the radio buttons and have that change the class of #home-right to either .rackmount or .shipping and add the class of .displaynone to the type of dimensions I don't want shown. Case Finder Shipping and Storage Rackmount Enclosures H x W x L U Height x Rack Depth
