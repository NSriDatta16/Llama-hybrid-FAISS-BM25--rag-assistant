Memory error: Allocation failure: not enough storage is available to process this command

I was trying to run the cube script to install the cube-database in the analysis server. I changed the data source to point to the server I wanted, but I got the error as in the title with the error codes Error Code = 0x8007000E, External Code = 0x00000000: I tried the properties of the analysis server too and set the "MemoryLimitErrorEnbales" to false. That did not help. Any insight would be a great help. Thanx
