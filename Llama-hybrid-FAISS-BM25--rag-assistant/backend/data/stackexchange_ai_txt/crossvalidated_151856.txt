Ok, let's focus on some issues I can find here. As I already stated on the comments, the 'tracks' present in this arrangement characterize a split-block design with three replicates in each combination A x B. Pay attention to the term replicate, I will go back to it later. So, if you want to analyze your experiment in R, assuming you have a balanced data set (this is important too), the model should be: anova(lm(var ~ Block + type + Block/type + age + Block/age + type:age, data=dt.sb)) Fine. Problem solved, let's discuss it, right? Wrong! This arrangement is valid if the whole blocks are repeated. So, you should have at least three sets of that combination type X age to use this design. If you consider each of the replicates (remember I said I would go back to it) within the combinations as a repetition, you might be falling into the pseudo-repetition problem, besides the fact it does not meet the requirements for the model described above. Also be aware you have three residuals in this analyses, and by consequence three coefficients of variation. This experimental design is not very encouraged because of its lack of randomization and the pseudo-repetition problem is very likely to be pointed out as an important issue.
