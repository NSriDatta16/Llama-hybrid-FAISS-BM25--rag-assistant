You might consider DOMDocumentFragment rather than DOMDocument if you don't want headers. As for the id problem, this is from the manual : validateOnParse = true; $doc->Load('book.xml'); echo "The element whose id is books is: " . $doc->getElementById('books')->tagName . "\n"; ?> validateOnParse is likely the issue.
