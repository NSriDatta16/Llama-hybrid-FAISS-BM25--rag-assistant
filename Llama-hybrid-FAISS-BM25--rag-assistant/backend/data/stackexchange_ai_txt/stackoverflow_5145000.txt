try this public abstract Class getMainClass(); reorganized example by such warnings java tried prevents cases like this class OtherImpl implements Interface{ } A a = new B();//where A - your abstract class and B - implementation Class other = a. getMainClass();//some broken think, But _without_ runtime exception As @axtavt mentioned example was broken. I reorganized it.
