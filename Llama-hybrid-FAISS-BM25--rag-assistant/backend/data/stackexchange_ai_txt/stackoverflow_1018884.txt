I think Shea and ricebowl are spot-on: does your brother want to make some mediocre websites, or does he really want to learn how and why HTML and CSS work so he has the foundation to make some excellent sites? "Web page builder" type applications are great if you a) don't know HTML or CSS and b) you need to build a small Web site with limited functionality in a very short period of time. This is where Frontpage excelled, since it allowed anybody to build a Web page. Unfortunately, all the convenient "click this to add a link" and "drag over here to include it in your page" functionality can't help you as soon as you need to do something the application itself can't do. What if you want to embed a Google map on your site, but your application doesn't have a corresponding button in the toolbar? How do you fix the site if it doesn't look right to Opera or Internet Explorer 6 users, and there's no "Make site 100% compatible" menu item? Who do you call when your awesome site takes dial-up users 5 minutes to download? Frontpage (now Microsoft Expression Web, I guess) and similar programs insulate you from the underlying technical issues, which eventually becomes a liability. Notepad++ is a good choice, and so is TextPad ; either one provides syntax highlighting and coloring, which can be quite helpful if you're starting out. The former is free, the latter is shareware. Eclipse is quite versatile and free though perhaps intimidating when you start with it.
