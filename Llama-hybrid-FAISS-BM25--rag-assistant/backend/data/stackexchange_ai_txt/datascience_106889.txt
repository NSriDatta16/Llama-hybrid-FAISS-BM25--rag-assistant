Which method is more suitable? overfitting of traning data or low accuracy?

Recently, I tested two methods after embedding in my data, using Keras. Convolution after embedding Maxpooling after embedding The first method's loss and validation loss are like, The second method's loss and validation loss are As you can see, the first one reduces the loss a lot for the training data, but the loss increases significantly in the validation set. The second method's loss for the training data is higher than the first method, but both loss in the training data and validation data are almost same. Which method is more suitable for further analysis with additional variables?
