Here's the short of it. You get their UDID for their device and get a certificate from Apple (after paying the subscription). Then you build the app with the certificate for the device (not simulator) target. The user then installs the certificate. (they can just drag-drop on itunes). I believe the app should be zipped (like during submission to the store) but it's pretty much the same process as the certificate. If you need links, I can provide them, but this is how it works. In the future, if you build with that certificate, the user only has to re-install the application. If the user is not connected to a Computer, you won't get Debug information, but they can run it to their hearts content. Certificates expire after a while, so you'll have to get a new one every once and a while. But it's not that much of an issue.
