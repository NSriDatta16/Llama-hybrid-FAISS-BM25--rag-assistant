Interaction of regression and averaging

Let's say I run a simple OLS of y on x. Then I average out all values of y that correspond to the same x, and run the regression again. Should the results of the two regressions differ? If so, why? The dataset is many thousands of points. The number of data points with the same x is identical for all values of x (otherwise of course the second regression will change the effective weights of the points).
