If you have two signals with the same frequency, it's going to be difficult to separate them out. One idea is separation of the phases, maybe your environment "noise" is phase-shifted to the signal. Note, that I'm using quotes for noise, because it really is not. The noise must be white, while yours clearly is not. So, technically, it's a signal, which you want to separate out. Try fourier transform, but instead of, as usually, looking at spectral densities, pay attention to phases. The second idea is to use some sort of wavelet transforms. If you use straight FFT(DFT) there will be many overtones from both the signal and the "other stuff", which may make it difficult to separate out. Maybe wavelets would fit better in this case. UPDATE: In any case if your signal and other stuff have the same base frequency, it's a huge issue. Think of an extreme case: two sines with the same frequency and different phases: $\sin(wt)+\sin(wt+\phi)=2\cos(\phi/2)\sin(wt+\phi/2)$. This is just precisely one sine wave, FFT will not be able to detect two waves.
