Statistical learning when observations are not iid

As far as I am concerned, statistical/machine learning algorithms always suppose that data are independent and identically distributed ( $iid$ ). My question is: what can we do when this assumption is clearly unsatisfied? For instance, suppose that we have a data set whith repeated measurements on the same observations , so that both the cross-section and the time dimensions are important (what econometricians call a panel data set , or statisticians refer to as longitudinal data , which is distinct from a time series). An example could be the following. In 2002, we collect the prices (henceforth $Y$ ) of 1000 houses in New York, together with a set of covariates (henceforth $X$ ). In 2005, we collect the same variables on the same houses . Similar happens in 2009 and 2012. Say I want to understand the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ . Were the data $iid$ , I could easily fit a random forest (or any other supervised algorithm, for what matters), thus estimating the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$ . However, there is clearly some auto-correlation in my data. How can I handle this?
