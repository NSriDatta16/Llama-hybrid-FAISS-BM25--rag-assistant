Limit textarea symbols to visible part

Is there any way to limit textarea entered symbols to visible part only? I don't want scrolling, I have specified number of rows column for it and I want that user could not enter so many characters that possible scrolling will appear. Of course I could set overflow:hidden but symbols anyway will be entered. Limiting to the number of characters is not my case, because different character take different width: for example W and 1. I need this logic because data entered in textarea are used on some print report and there is no possibility for scrolling in paper. I have found only 2 possible solutions: Use some average number of characters. And limit by this number. This is very rough. Because for strings with average number of big characters greater than usual it will still hide some data. Use rendering of entered characters to some separate div and calculate its width/height. Seem to me will be very slow and not sure this is the correct implementation.
