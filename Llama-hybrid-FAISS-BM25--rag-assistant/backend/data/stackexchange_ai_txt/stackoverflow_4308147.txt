NEE is an NLP task that is not part of lucene. For open source, you can look at lingpipe and gate and opennlp. There are various for-money alternatives. GATE is entirely rule-based, and will be hard to use for high precision. You'll need a statistical engine for that; lingpipe has one, but you have to supply the training data. I'm not up to date on the contents of opennlp in this area.
