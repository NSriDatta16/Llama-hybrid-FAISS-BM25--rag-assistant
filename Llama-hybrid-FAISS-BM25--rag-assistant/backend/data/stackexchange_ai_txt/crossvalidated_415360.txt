guidance on how to conduct a logistic regression with three categorical dependent variables

I am also looking for guidance on how to conduct a logistic regression with three categorical dependent variables. My two independent variables are dichotomous and experimentally manipulated. Of the three dependent variables: two are dichotomous, one has four categories. None of the categories in the IVs or DVs are ordered. I'm in the process of exploring a 5-way logit (loglinear) approach following Wuensch's description on his teaching website. I did a screening run using hierarchical loglinear analysis (ignoring the fact that some variables are DVs), followed by a loglinear analysis of a model that include only effects involving the DVs (i.e., IV-only effects not included from the outset). The rationale Wuensch gives is that our random assignment of respondents to IVs ensures the effects of the IV-only terms are zero or near-zero, which makes logical sense and is what I found. Not sure this is the correct way, but it's all I've found to date. Would really appreciate comments on this approach! especially around the issue of excluding effects that are IV-only. Thanks!
