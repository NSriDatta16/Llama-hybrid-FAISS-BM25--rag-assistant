Another benefit of a convex loss function is it will have faster convergence for all models, both linear and nonlinear. There will be even faster convergence in a convex loss function if a momentum term is added to gradient descent. However often in real-world scenarios and with many models types, the loss function is not guaranteed to be convex. It is not clear what "convexity be completely disregarded" means. Machine learning systems should be designed to be robust to non-convex loss functions in order to find useful parameters in a board range of problems.
