Magento - How can I move the Navigation Block to be in the right column?

I've been editing Magento's default CSS to change the look and have come to a point where I want to move around some content blocks. I've killed off the left column through CSS .col-left { display: none; } And then increased the width of the main content part to create a 'two column layout'. What I want to do now is move the navigation for the categories into the right column. I just have no idea how... How do I move content blocks around in Magento? :/
