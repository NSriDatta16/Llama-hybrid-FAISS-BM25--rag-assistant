First question Your equation $$u_3 = X_3 - P_{H1}X_3 - P_{H_2}X_3= X_3 - \hat{X}_{1+2} - \hat{X}_{2+1}$$ is not right. Notice $H_1 \subset H_2$. $P_{H1}$ is not orthogonal to $P_{H_2}$. Second question It's immediate, exactly the same as, say, when the Hilbert space is $\mathbb{R}^3$. It's by induction: take $X_0$, and $X_1$, then in your notation, $$ \hat{X}_1 = \frac{\langle X_1, X_0\rangle}{\langle X_0, X_0\rangle} (X_0 - 0) = \theta (X_0 - 0) . $$ For real random variables with finite seconds moments, the inner product is expectation of the product. If there's an $X_2$, then $$ \hat{X}_2 = P_{\{ X_1, X_0 \} } X_2 = P_{\{ X_1 - \hat{X}_1, X_0 \} } X_2 = P_{ X_1 - \hat{X}_1} X_2 + P_{X_0 } X_2. $$ This is exactly the GS procedure. You see how the $\theta$'s can be computed recursively.
