Getting a ValueError from train_test_split

I'm working on this dataset. I'm trying to select features using Random Forest. This is the relevant code: x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = train_test_split(train, test_size = 0.3) sel = SelectFromModel(RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)) sel.fit(x_train, y_train) sel.get_support() selected_feat = x_train.columns[sel.get_support()] The code x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = train_test_split(train, test_size = 0.3) throws the following ValueError: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:/Users/security/Downloads/AP/Boston-Kaggle/Boston.py", line 25, in x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = train_test_split(train, test_size = 0.3) ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 2) I don't know what it means by not enough values . The dataset has a big dimension.
