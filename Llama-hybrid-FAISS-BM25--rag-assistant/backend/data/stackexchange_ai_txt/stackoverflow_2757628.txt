Is your application a Swing application or not? You are probably using an IDE which you automatically let organize the imports in your source file. The IDE added an import for javax.swing.text.Document instead of org.w3c.dom.Document . This is something I've encountered myself often while using the Eclipse IDE. What you have to do: Remove this line from the top of your source code file: import javax.swing.text.Document; Replace it with: import org.w3c.dom.Document;
