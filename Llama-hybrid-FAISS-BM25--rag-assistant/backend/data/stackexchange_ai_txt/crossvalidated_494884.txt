Like you said, you cannot compute the error in that fashion because the dimensional space is not the same, you would need first to 'reconstruct' your new-reduced space to the old-bigger dimensional space and there you can compute the error as you said. For the dimensionality reduction we do: $T = XP$ for the reconstruction we do: $\hat{X} = TP^{'}$ where $X$ is the original data, $T$ is the reduced space (formally called scores), $P$ are the loadings (PCs) and $\hat{X}$ is the reconstructed space. Finally, we commonly express the error as: $Error = (X - \hat{X})^{2}$ Edit: How do we interpret Error : Before, first we denoted $X$ as our matrix of original data $\mathbb{R}^{nxk}$ ( $n$ data points with $k$ dimensions each ), and then we moved to the reduced space $\hat{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{nxp}: p When we compute the error, we are computing the distance (norm) between the original ( $p$ dimensional) and the proyected ( $k$ dimensional) observation.
