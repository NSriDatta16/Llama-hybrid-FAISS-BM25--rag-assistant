Interactive gantt chart component for flex

My company have a web application product for distribution planning and scheduling. An important part of it is a gantt chart component where user can fine tune the schedules. Currently the gantt chart component is pure javascript+dhtml. I am currently looking into the possibility of moving to Flex to get richer interactivity and generally nicer UI. The question is: is there any good interactive gantt chart component for Flex? By "interactive" I mean that user can interact with the gantt chart and modify data using it, as opposed to just seeing it as part of a reporting use case. We don't mind paying if the amount worth it. Thanks
