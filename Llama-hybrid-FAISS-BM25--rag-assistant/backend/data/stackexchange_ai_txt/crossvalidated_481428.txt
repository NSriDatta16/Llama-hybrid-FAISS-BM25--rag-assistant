In Poisson regression, the observations are (conditionally) Poisson distributed. The errors with respect to the mean are not: if the predicted Poisson parameter is $\hat{\lambda}=0.1$ , then we expect future realizations to be $y\sim\text{Pois}(\hat{\lambda})$ distributed - but errors, i.e., $y-\hat{\lambda}$ , will take values of $-0.1,0.9,1.9,\dots$ , which is certainly not describable by a Poisson distribution. Why do we model noise in linear regression but not logistic regression? is a recent related thread on logistic as compared to Poisson regression. I can't recall a situation where errors would be Poisson distributed. Unless you would predict $\hat{y}=0$ for all realizations, which are actually Poisson distributed, $y\sim\text{Pois}(\lambda_y)$ . Then your errors are of course Poisson. But that doesn't look like a very helpful way of looking at things.
