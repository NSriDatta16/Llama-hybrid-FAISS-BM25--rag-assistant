Finding Distribution in R

I have a Bayesian Inference Question. My prior has a normal distribution and $f(x|\theta)$ also has a normal distribution. Now, I want to get the distribution of $h(x)$ in R, where $h(x)$ is the denominator of the posterior distribution; the integral of likelihood and prior distribution. Question: Is there any function or anything in R which could say whether $h(x) \sim \operatorname{Normal}(a,b)$, i.e, to what distribution it belongs?
