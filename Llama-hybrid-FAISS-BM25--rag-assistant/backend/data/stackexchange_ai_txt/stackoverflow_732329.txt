The problem with the get System.xxx method is that the method itself needs a few milliseconds to compute. The usually "accepted" way of doing it is running the test a few tens of thousands of times and calculating an average of this. Also, depending on your OS there is something called the time granularity (example for windows). This is the smallest amount of time your OS can compute. On some OS its a millisecond, on some others its a nanosecond. It might or might not be relevant in your case.
