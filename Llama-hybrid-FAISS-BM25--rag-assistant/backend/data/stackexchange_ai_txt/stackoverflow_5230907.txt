Videos can be played "inline" or by a "helper", depending on the HTML element you use. Inline Videos When a video is included in a web page it is called inline video. If you plan to use inline videos in your web applications, be aware that many people find inline videos annoying. Also note that some users might have turned off the inline video option in their browser. Our best advice is to include inline videos only in web pages where the user expects to see a video. An example of this is a page which opens after the user has clicked on a link to see the video.

Most helper applications allow manual (or programmed) control over the volume settings and play functions like rewind, pause, stop and play.
