C# How to connect to MS Access 2007 - you can find code example there. Also you do the following. Create a new winforms application. Go to Server Explorer (View->Server Explorer, Ctrl + Alt + S) There on server explorer, right click on data connections and add a data connection. Choose the Add Connection option. There change the Data source to Access Database. Open the mdb file you want to attach. It will generate its connection string automatically. Then you get to choose the tables you want to insert and the query to use. Just select the table and click on all fields. Once the connection is done, drag it and drop on the form. Visual Studio will generate the code behind for you automatically.
