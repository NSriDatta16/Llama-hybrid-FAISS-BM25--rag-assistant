Over-fitting diagnosis method

How much difference between train and test set errors can indicate over-fitting? For example in logistic regression. I am trying to classify 11746 comments based on their sentiments in three classes using logistic regression. My train accuracy is about 100% but in test i get accuracy about 52%. I want to know how much difference between these factors can indicate over-fitting?
