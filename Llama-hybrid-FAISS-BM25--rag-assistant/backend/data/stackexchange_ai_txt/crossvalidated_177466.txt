On page 82 of your book, second last paragraph they say: Random variables are denoted by capital letters, $X$, $Y$ and so on, to distinguish them from their possible values given in lower case, $x$, $y$. $S^2$ is used for sample variance (as a random variable) in that sense on p189 and p190 (in the second case with subscripts) for example. Lower case $s$'s would then go with the numbers from a sample (being a specific value taken by the random variable, as they said).
