Any way to alter text attributes within a UITextField?

Simply stated - I want to have a scrollable text field with a paragraph of text. Some of the sentences should be bold and blue while others are red and normal, while the remainder is simple black/normal text. Any way to alter the text attributes 'within / amongst' the text? Thanks!
