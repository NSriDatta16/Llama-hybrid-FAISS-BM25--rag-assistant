ASP.NET, XSLT, extracting values from a CDATA section

i have a small problem i have xome xml with a cdata section. This CDATA section contains fragments of HTMl. I would like to extract some of the data inside this CDATA element. Right now i have a XSLT transformation that outputs the rest of the document as HTMl, but i need only a small part of the CDATA HTML, not the entire part - e.g. a my Title tag. How to do this?
