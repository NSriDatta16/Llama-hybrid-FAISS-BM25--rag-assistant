You have done it the right way, but it appears that none of them are estimable. You might get a hint at why by doing coef(model) I would guess that several of the regression coefficients are NA , meaning that those predictors were excluded from the model. And more to the point, I'd guess that the genotypes are rather unevenly distributed among trays and batches, so that by averaging over them, there's bound to be a hole somewhere. You can only estimate what the model is able to estimate. By the way, all four of your leastsquare calls are exactly equivalent, except for the labelling of the output, so you only have needed to do one of them.
