As noted in the document you linked: LogisticRegression returns well calibrated predictions by default as it directly optimizes log-loss. So there is generally no need to calibrate logistic regression, the model structure automatically calibrates it to the training data. On the other hand, if you have a logistic regression model for which you expect the odds ratios to be valid for your problem, but possibly not the overall probabilities , then you can calibrate a logistic model a new dataset using the techniques in that article. The situation in the prior paragraph crops up, at least approximately, in business settings where it is expensive to implement a totally new model in production, but cheap to change only a simple part (i.e. an intercept term). This is common in actuarial work.
