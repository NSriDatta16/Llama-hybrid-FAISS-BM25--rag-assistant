According to the set documentation , the elements must be hashable . An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() or __cmp__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value. EDIT : added proper Hashable definition thanks to Roberto
