Safely escape strings for SQL fragments for joins, limits, selects, and so on (not conditions) on Rails

In Ruby on Rails, for conditions, it's easy to make SQL-injection-proof queries: :conditions => ["title = ?", title] where title comes from the outside, from a web form or something like that. But what if you are using SQL fragments in other parts of the query, like: :select => "\"#{title}\" AS title" # I do have something like this in one instance :joins => ["LEFT JOIN blah AS blah2 ON blah2.title = \"#{title}\""] Is there a way to properly escape those strings?
