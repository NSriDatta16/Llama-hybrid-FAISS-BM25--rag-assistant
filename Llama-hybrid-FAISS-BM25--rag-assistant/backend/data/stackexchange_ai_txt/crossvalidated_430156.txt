The book " Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications " (2007) by Bates & Watts springs to mind as an immediate suggestion. It is co-authored by one of the masters of regression algorithm design (D. Bates). Note that is is not exactly fresh ; the edition I link is published on 2007 but most of the material is from the 1989 edition. That being said, it is definitely authoritative and has aged very well. I used it as a reference book at times and it was very good. Especially when it came to computational aspects it was indispensable. It couples well with the " Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS " (2000) by Pinheiro & Bates, which is closer to a panel data paradigm of the problem. Secondary suggestions: Ruppert et al. " Semiparametric Regression " (2003) has less computational focus that B&W but I think it has a broader scope too. Depending on how we define non-linear regression, looking at Generalised Additive Models can be very insightful and to that extent Wood's " Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R " (2017; 2nd Ed.) is probably the most up-to-date reference out there, it is a great read. Similarly, if we care more for Local Regression Models, checking Fan & Gijbels " Local Polynomial Modelling and Its Applications " (1996) is definitely a classic too. (I appreciate that these secondary suggestions are moving even further away from the panel data paradigm but I need them to make my next point.) Comment: One could note that there are fewer non-parametric regression books coming out recently; that's not entirely a coincidence: Machine Learning happened. Putting aside best-in-class general books like: " Elements of Statistical Learning " (2009) by Hastie et al. and " Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective " (2013) by Murphy, looking into Devroye et al. " A Probabilistic Theory of Pattern Recognition " (1997) covers consistency results, bounds, error rates, convergence, etc. in great detail. Therefore there are some review articles on the intersection of Machine Learning and Econometrics like: " Machine Learning: An Applied Econometric Approach " (2017) by Mullainathan & Spiess or " Big Data: New Tricks for Econometrics " (2014) by Varian. They give an OK overview but they do not offer a rigorous mathematical treatment of the matter, they should though offer a reasonable list of references.
