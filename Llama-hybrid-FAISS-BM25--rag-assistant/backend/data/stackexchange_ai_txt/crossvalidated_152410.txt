$\mu_0$ is the prior mean and $\kappa_0$ is the number of prior measurements, both on the $\sigma$ scale. The dimensions refer to the number of dimensions in the $d \times d$ M matrix which is also the number of dimensions/variables in the multivariate Inverse-Wishart distribution. A basic noninformative prior distribution for the Inverse-Wishart distribution would be $M = I = d \times d$ Identity matrix $\nu_0 = d+1$ This gives noninformative marginal distributions, but the joint distribution is not uniform however. A noninformative $\kappa_0$ can be chosen to create a very large variance. $\mu_0$ would depend on the domain of your problem. Thoughts on how to create informative priors would require more information about your problem. More details can be found in section 3.6 of Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis
