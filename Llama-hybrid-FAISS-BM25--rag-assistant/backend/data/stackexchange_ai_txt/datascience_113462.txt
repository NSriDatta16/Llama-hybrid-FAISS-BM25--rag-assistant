Depending on your processing limitations I'd be tempted to do the following, for each client a single row consisting of: Age Sex (one hot encoded) Per store: Purchase Count Total Purchase Value Average Purchase Value Min Purchase Value Max Purchase Value Additionally if you have the transaction dates I'd try to include things like: Days since first purchase Avg. days between purchases Hopefully that helps you a bit, good luck!
