Items not being created by means of parents is indeed something that is tricky. You could do something like, ID referencing and build a PlayerManager that does the linking for you. By means of RUID 's (Runtime Unique ID's). But of course, you would like to have the parents be created first. So when creating something like an OO structure of your database, which I would encourage if you want to do some extra manipulations on it besides printing. It is doable to create a player from your DB and then, if it has a parent, create the parent as you would do normally. When arriving at the parent in your while-loop. You can just say, no it is already created. Use a Player-manager class for this, which holds your Players. So it can check if Players (and thus parents) are already there. So you get a bit of a different way of walking through your DB, instead of just doing it linear. As for: is it necessary to do so. I actually don't know that much about it myself. It seems, as far as I've seen on the web, that PHP classes are mostly used to created one object that can do smart things (like a DOMDocument ). But do you really have to convert your DB table to objects? It depends on your type of application. If printing is what you want, it doesn't seem logical. If some big manipulation with a lot of calls to the objects (or normally to the table), I maybe would like to see a nice OO programmed structure.
