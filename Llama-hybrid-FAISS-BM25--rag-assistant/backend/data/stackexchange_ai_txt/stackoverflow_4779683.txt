If you are dynamically creating an HTML table (and not using any of the built-in controls provided by ASP.net for presenting tabular data), then do the following: Add TextBox and Button controls to allow the user to input and control the page number to show Add logic to display the current page number and total pages, items, etc Change your data retrieval to use the current page number and total number of items per page to only display the items that you want. Ideally you would also only retrieve the items that you need (rather than retrieving the entire dataset and then only showing some of it). There are different ways to do this based on how you are retrieving your data.
