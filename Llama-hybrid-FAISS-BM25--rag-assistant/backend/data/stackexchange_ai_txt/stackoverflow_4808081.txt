You can select to not add a web role and instead add a web app. The web app should be added directly to the cloud service. Then, you can start adding in the Azure related components you need for the hosted version of your web app (storage, diagnostics, etc...). While this still doesn't give you a "blank" project (the adding of basic files in applies to all the VS project templates), it does further minimize the amount of extra files/settings that are being imported. Its also a useful approach when you're wanting to deploy a existing web app to Azure with minimal modification. To do this: 1) file -> new -> cloud service (click ok all the way through without adding any roles) 2) right click the solution, select add, and add a new web app project (not web site) 3) right click the "roles" folder in the cloud service project and select add -> Web Role Project in solution. 4) select the web app you added in step 2 Out of curiousity, why do you want a "blank" project? Just so you can plug your stuff in without having to remove anything?
