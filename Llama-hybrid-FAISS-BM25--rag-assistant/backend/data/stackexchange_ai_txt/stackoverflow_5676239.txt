In App Purchase (IAP) simple questions (I have an issue)

I've checked tremendous checklists and I've tried all the possible solutions, but my IAP never works! (Just have the last solution: re-start whole procedure including generate new App ID) My Checklist: V Have you enabled In-App Purchases for your App ID? : Of course V Have you checked Cleared for Sale for your product? : At the beginning V Have you submitted (and optionally rejected) your application binary? : My app is already on App Store and is being sold. V Does your projectâ€™s .plist Bundle ID match your App ID? : Sure, so that I can sell my App with Distribution profile. V Have you generated and installed a new provisioning profile for the new App ID? : Twice! (not my User Certification Profile) V Have you configured your project to code sign using this new provisioning profile? : Sure V Are you building for iPhone OS 3.0 or above? : I use iPhone4 and build for iOS3.0 V Are you using the full product ID when when making an SKProductRequest? : I tried both full ID and without prefix. V Have you waited several hours since adding your product to iTunes Connect? : It's been more than 3 whole days. V Are your bank details active on iTunes Connect? (via Mark) : Bank, Tax, and all three contracts are in effect. (How can I know that bank detils are 'active'? I filled all the blanks and submitted) V Have you tried deleting the app from your device and reinstalling? (via Hector, S3B, Alex O, Joe, and Alberto) : Many times... deleted reinstalled remove all profiles reinstalled... disconnect, reboot and so on... my IAP status is 'Waiting for Screenshot' Clean and rebuild : tried Make a new product ID : tried Make a new test user : tried (and logout my own account) Make a new AdHoc provisioning profile : tried I used explicit app ID You did not complete all the financial requirements (see the "Contracts, Tax, and Banking Information" section of this document). : YES You did not use an explicit App ID. : I used explicit ID like com.app.myapp (and com.app.myapp.product1 for my product id) You did not use the Provisioning Profile associated with your explicit App ID. : I use correctly so that my app is on the appstore. You did not use the correct product identifier in your code. See Technical Q&A, QA1329, 'In App Purchase Product Identifiers' for more information about product identifiers. : Checked checked checked checked copy and paste..... You did not clear your In App Purchase products for sale in iTunes Connect. : I checked. You might have modified your products, but these changes are not yet available to all the App Store servers. : been 48 or more hours.. If you or App Review rejected your most recent binary in iTunes Connect. : it's 'Ready for Sale'. (and currently, 'Ready for Upload' is added) and some more checklists on Google (For someone who are looking for the solution to IAP, I hope the checklist above may help you) + more clues... I added a new IAP to another app which is Ready for sale. -> Still not working I added a new IAP to another one which has never been released (prepare for upload). -> not working in my MyApp-Info.plist, [Bundle identifier: com.my.app], [Bundle display name: MYAPP] iTunes connect app name is different from 'bundle display name', like 'This is my app'. This problem might be related to iTunes connect or my account setting. But I cannot figure it out till now.
