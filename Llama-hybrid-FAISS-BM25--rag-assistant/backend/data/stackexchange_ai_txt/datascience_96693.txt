Feature Selection using Stacking Ensemble?

I want to combine some estimators, such as Logistic Regression , Gaussian NB and K-Nearest Neighbors for Features Selection , I tried to use StackingClassifier() estimator to do that, but there is no feature_importances_ attribute for this estimator. Is there any other method to select features combining those classifiers ?? Thank you in advance :)
