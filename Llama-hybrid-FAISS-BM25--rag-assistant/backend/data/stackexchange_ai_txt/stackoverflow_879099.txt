Compression typically works on a byte stream. When a stream has a non-uniform distribution of byte values (for instance text, or numbers stored as text), the compression ratio you can achieve will be higher, since fewer bits are used to store the bytes which appear more frequently (in Huffman compression). Typically, the data you are talking about will simply be stored as binary numbers (not text), and that's usually space and retrieval efficient. I recommend you have a look at The Data Compression Book
