Slide Menu ( Horizontal )

ASP.Net / Javascript / Jquery We come across a feature in http://www.cnn.com/TECH/ - Which has slide Menu bar in Tech Pulse section. Menu slides either automatically after 2 -3 seconds or manually. Is there any third party tool to help us or what would be the ideal solution for such scenario's. Thank you
