You can use the offset function for that. It gives you the element's position relative to the (left,top) of the document : var offset = $("#target").offset(); display("span is at " + offset.left + "," + offset.top + " of document"); Live example On my browser, that example says that the span we've targeted is at 157,47 (left,top) of the document. This is because I've applied a big padding value to the body element, and used a span with a spacer above it and some text in front of it. Here's a second example showing a paragraph at the absolute left,top of the document, showing 0,0 as its position (and also showing a span later on that's offset from both the left and top, 129,19 on my browser).
