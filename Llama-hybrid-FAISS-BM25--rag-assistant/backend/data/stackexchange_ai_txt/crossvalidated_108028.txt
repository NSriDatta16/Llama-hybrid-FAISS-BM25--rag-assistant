Depends on what you want to achieve. Let $X$ be the continuous, numerical variable and $K$ the (unordered) categorical variable. Then one possible approach is to assign numerical scores $t_i$ to each of the possible values of $K$, $i=1, \dots, p$. One possible criterion is to maximize the correlation between the $X$ and the scores $t_i$. With only one continuous and one categorical variable, this might not be very helpful, since the maximum correlation will always be one (to show that, and find some such scores, is an exercise in using Lagrange multipliers! With multiple variables, we try to find compromise scores for the categorical variables, maybe trying to maximize the multiple correlation $R^2$. Then the individual correlations will not more (except very special cases!) equal one. Such an analysis can be seen as a generalization of multiple correspondence analysis, and is known under many names, such as canonical correlation analysis, homogeneity analysis, and many others. An implementation in R is in the homals package (on CRAN). googling for some of this names will give a wealth of information, there is a complete book: Albert Gifi, "Nonlinear Multivariate Analysis". Good luck!
