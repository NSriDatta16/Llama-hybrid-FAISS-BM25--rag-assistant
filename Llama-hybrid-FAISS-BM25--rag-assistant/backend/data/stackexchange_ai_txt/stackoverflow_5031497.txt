The ../ notation is perfectly valid for signifying a operation. There isn't really a problem with using that notation, though it depends on your usage. The first instance of in your URL is the default behaviour of CRM to allow multi-tenancy - do you need to have the second instance? Could you have the Account.aspx page sat directly under the ISV folder, and use server side code to determine the organisation name? Basically the path you enter in the URL attribute is used as a relative path from the /" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/ / If you want to understand more about ASP.NET paths and how to work with them, Rick Strahl has a good post here: http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/132081.aspx
