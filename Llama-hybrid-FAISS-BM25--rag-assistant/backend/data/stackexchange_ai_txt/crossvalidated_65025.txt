Using the self-organizing map for sequences of categorical data

I have a number of vectors of categorical data (ex. {'re','ty','cf', ...} ) and I want to perform an unsupervised learning on them. I came across self-organizing map technique and I am trying to see if I can apply this method on my data. The vectors that I have are not similar in size and I was thinking if the self-organizing map can be applied on my data. Is there any version of this method that can do so?
