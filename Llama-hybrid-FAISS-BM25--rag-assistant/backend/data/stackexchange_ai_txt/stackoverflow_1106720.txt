How to display HTML as inline element?

This is probably a basic html/css question... I have a simple one-button form that I would like to display inline inside paragraph text. Read this sentence . Even though form has style=display:inline attribute, I get a linebreak before the form. Is there a way to get rid of it? Can form elements appear inside ?
