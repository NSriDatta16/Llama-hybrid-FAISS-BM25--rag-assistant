Android - Increase ROM Size

as i am facing problem here: Installing application on SD-card in Android sdk 2.2 , regarding application installation. In above question, you can view the image in which "Internal Phone Storage" is showing where only 43.38 MB is showing , and in latest android phone, i know it is coming with higher space, i have seen 13.45 GB in Samsung Galaxy Android Phone. But Right now, i am using HTC Hero, so my questions are: is there any way to increase ROM size without any side-effect? How do i increase ROM Size?
