core data missing records iphone

I have a strange and serious problem. When I am working with core data (not saving or editing or anything) just accessing the data from entity. Sometime strangely a few records or all records are missing(deleting) from the entity when my application restarts. I checked them by opening the SQLite database. Can anyone have the same problem ? Thanks, Raghu
