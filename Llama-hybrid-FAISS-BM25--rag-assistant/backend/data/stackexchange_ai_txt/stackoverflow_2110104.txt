Is there some code that can be used to locate an element and the offset by its parent's object and a text index?

I mean, take the following HTML codes as example, ignore the whitespaces. paragraph-text span text it I have the pNode object and the index of "a" in "span text" within pNode.innerHTML as a whole, that is 23 here since pNode.innerHTML="paragraph-text span text it ", the open span tag should also be counted. Is there some existing library that can be used like transform(pElement, 23), so that I can get the expected element and offset of "spanElement and 2"? Thanks in adavance. Regards, Steve
