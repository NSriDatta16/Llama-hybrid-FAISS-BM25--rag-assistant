Most of the files listed above can be stored in the same folder as the application exeutable themselves. As you've pointed out there's no admin account on a Windows Mobile device. Part of the reason for the organization of these files on the desktop is to maintain clean seperation of user settings. Since Windows Mobile devices are designed with a single user in mind there are not such facilities to seperate users. If these were files that were intended to be opened directly by the user (like a word document) then at that point I would suggest storing them in the My Documents folder. The one file over which I have concern is the log files. You mention they can get large in size. These can also be in the application folder but if they can get large in size you will need to be able to react to the devices storage space getting low (by clearing part of the logs).
