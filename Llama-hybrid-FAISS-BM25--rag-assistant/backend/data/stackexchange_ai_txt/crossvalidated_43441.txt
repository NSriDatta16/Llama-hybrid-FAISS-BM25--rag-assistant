Doing Bayesian regression is not an algorithm but a different approach to statistical inference. The major advantage is that, by this Bayesian processing, you recover the whole range of inferential solutions, rather than a point estimate and a confidence interval as in classical regression. (I can only recommend you to read a statistics manual to understand the difference between an algorithm and statistical inference.)
