give this a read: Controlling Constraints, Identities, and Triggers with NOT FOR REPLICATION In most cases the default settings are appropriate, but they can be changed if an application requires different behavior. The main area to consider is triggers. For example, if you define an insert trigger with the NOT FOR REPLICATION option set, all user inserts fire the trigger, but inserts from replication agents do not. Consider a trigger that inserts data into a tracking table: when the user inserts the row originally, it is appropriate for the trigger to fire and enter a row into the tracking table, but the trigger should not fire when that data is replicated to the Subscriber, because it would result in an unnecessary row being inserted in the tracking table.
