Base64 images to gmail

I'm generating some inline images for an email sent from the iPad. Looks great in all desktop email clients, but gmail doesn't seem to like the base64 image and it shows up as text. Anyone have any luck embedding images with base64 and gmail? Or know of a better solution for sending HTML emails with images from the iPad?
