Does a model with 0.5 AUROC imply an average precision equal to the proportion of positive examples?

A random model has an area under the ROC curve equal to 0.5. We also know that a random model has an area under the Precision-Recall curve equal to the proportion ( p ) of positive examples. Then, here's my question. Does a model with an AUCROC of 0.5 always imply an AUCPR of p ? Or is it possible to be different? If so, how can this scenario happen?
