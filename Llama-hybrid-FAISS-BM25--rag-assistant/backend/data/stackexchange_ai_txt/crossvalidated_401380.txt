In a Hierarchical Bayesian Model, how can we sample and see how a prior distribution looks like if it contains hyperparameters with hyperpriors?

I have a Bayesian Hierarchical Model that looks like: \begin{equation} Y_i \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \\ \mu \sim N(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2) \\ \sigma^2 \sim Gamma(1,1) \\ \mu_0 \sim N(0,1) \\ \sigma_0^2 \sim Gamma(2,2)\\ \end{equation} In this set-up, I have found the posterior of $\mu$ and am trying to compare it to how the prior of $\mu$ looks like on a density plot to view shrinkage. I am not sure how to construct the prior density of $\mu$ via sampling since it doesn't have fixed hyperparameters. I thought about the following code in R: mu0 But am not sure if I am properly doing the average, as it seems very spread out. Instead, should I take the mean of mu0 and sigma02 and plug them in like so? mu0 I lose variability here, but I am not sure if either works.
