How to debug a connection failure between Jboss and eclipse debugger

I have setup eclipse to attach to a local JVM. But when I try to do the same for a machine over the network I get "connection timed out exception". How do I go about debugging this issue? I tried: lsof -i :8787 on the remote machine, and it appears that a java process is in fact listening on that port. What else could be wrong and how to go about finding it. Please help. Thank you. Note: My JAVA_OPT looks like this on the remote machine. JAVA_OPTS=”-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n $JAVA_OPTS”
