Variance of mean of two independent normally distributed values

If I have two measurements (assumed to come from normal distribution) X1 = 250 and X2 = 260 where variances are V1 = 5 and V2 = 6 (variance could be thought as the uncertainty in the measurements). Now the average of the two is m = 255 but what is the resulting variance of this average? Is it possible to calculate this?
