Information scientists commonly use precision and recall as two competing measures of quality for an information retrieval system (like a search engine). So you could measure your search engine's performance relative to Google's by, for example, counting the number of relevant results in the top 10 (call that precision) and the number of important pages for that query that you think should have been in the top 10 but weren't (call that recall). You'll still need to compare the results from each search engine by hand on some set of queries, but at least you'll have one metric to evaluate them on. And the balance of these two is important too: otherwise you can trivially get perfect precision by not returning any results or perfect recall by returning every page on the web as a result. The Wikipedia article on precision and recall is quite good (and defines the F-measure which takes into account both).
