Good database for superfast storage of large amounts of financial data?

I'm storing large amounts of financial data for options. Recommendations for a database to store this data? Edit "large amounts" is 1GB initially, scaling up to around 100GB at some point in the future. Fine with either commercial and open source. Developing with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and C#. Latency/retention periods: need to store streaming realtime data in such a way that I don't lose any of the data coming in (probably about 10KByte/sec maximum data to store). Querying can be performed outside of market hours, so speed of querying is not an issue.
