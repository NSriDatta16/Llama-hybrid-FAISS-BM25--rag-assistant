internal is what you are after. It means the member is accessible by any class in the same assembly. There is nothing wrong with using it for this purpose (Product & ProductInstance), and is one of the things for which it was designed. C# chose not to make namespaces significant -- they are used for organization, not to determine what types can see one another, as in java with package private . partial is nothing at all like internal or package private . It is simply a way to split the implementation of a class into multiple files, with some extensibility options thrown in for good measure.
