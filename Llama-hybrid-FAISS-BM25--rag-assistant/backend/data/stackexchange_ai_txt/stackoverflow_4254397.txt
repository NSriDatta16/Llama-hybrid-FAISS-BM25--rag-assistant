The sortable widget has a handle feature. So: $(function() { $( ".gantt" ).sortable({ handle: '.bar' // Make it sortable by dragging the .bar instead of the container }); /* $( ".bar" ).draggable({ connectToSortable: '.gantt', containment: '.barWrap', grid: [20, 0] }); */ $( ".bar" ).resizable({ handles: 'e, w', grid: [ 20, 0 ] }); $(".gantt").disableSelection(); }); Edited (see comment) : You have to take out the draggable, which IMO isn't so bad because people can still use resizable to change the position. You could experiment with draggable handles to find a method where they both work.
