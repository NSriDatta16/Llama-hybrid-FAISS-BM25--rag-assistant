Software like Synergy that also works with windows

I'm using Synergy to control both a desktop and a laptop with a single set of mouse/keyboard. Unfortunately my desktop monitor is rather small (to programmer standards). I'd like to drag windows from my desktop and carry them to the laptop Is there any software that can do this?
