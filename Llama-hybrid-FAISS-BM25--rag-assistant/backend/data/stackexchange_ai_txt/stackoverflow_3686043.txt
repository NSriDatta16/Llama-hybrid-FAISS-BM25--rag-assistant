Why doesn't jQuery's $.get() insert script elements into the DOM?

I am using $.get() to retrieve an HTML snippet from a remote server and insert that snippet into the DOM. The snippet contains several basic HTML elements and a script element. All of the basic elements get inserted, but the script element does not. Example snippet: This is a paragraph // JavaScript that will work with the HTML in the snippet I have verified that the script element is in the retrieved snippet by looking at the resources retrieved in Chrome's web inspector. So, why doesn't $.get() insert the script element and is it possible to do what I am wanting to do? Edit: To clarify, I was retrieving the HTML snippet with $.get() and inserting it into the DOM with $().html(data) .
