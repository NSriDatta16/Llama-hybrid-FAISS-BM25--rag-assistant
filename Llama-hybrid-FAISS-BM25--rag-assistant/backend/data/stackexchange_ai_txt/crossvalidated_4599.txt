Nobody has suggested a Bayesian approach yet? I know the question has been answered already, but what the heck. Below is for only a 3-sided die, but I'm guessing it's obvious how to fix it for $n=37$ sides. First, in line with what @Glen_b said, a bayesian is not actually interested whether or not the die is exactly fair - it isn't. What (s)he cares about is whether it's close enough , whatever "enough" means in the context, say, within 5% of fair for each side. If $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ represent the probabilites of rolling 1, 2, and 3, respectively, then we represent our prior knowledge about $p=(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ with a prior distribution, and to make the math easy we could choose a Dirichlet distribution . Note that $p_1+p_2+p_3=1$. For a non-informative prior we might pick prior parameters, say, $\alpha_0=(1,1,1)$. If $X=(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ represents the observed counts of 1,2,3 then of course $X$ has a multinomial distribution with parameters $p=(p_1,p_2,p_3)$, and the theory says that the posterior is also a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $\alpha=(x_1+1,x_2+1,x_3+1)$. (Dirichlet is called a conjugate prior , here.) We observe data, find the posterior with Bayes' rule, then ALL inference is based on the posterior. Want an estimate for $p$? Find the mean of the posterior. Want confidence intervals (no, rather credible intervals )? Calculate some areas under the posterior. For complicated problems in the real world we usually simulate from the posterior and get simulated estimates for all of the above. Anyway, here's how (with R): First, get some data. We roll the die 500 times. set.seed(1) y (we're starting with a fair die; in practice these data would be observed.) Next, we simulate 5000 observations of $p$ from the posterior and take a look at the results. library(MCMCpack) A Finally, let's estimate our posterior probability (after observing the data) that the die is within 0.05 of fair in each coordinate. B 0.28)*(x The result is about 0.9486 on my machine. (Not a surprise, really. We started with a fair die after all.) Quick remark: it probably isn't reasonable for us to have used a non-informative prior in this example. Since there's even a question presumably the die appears approximately balanced in the first place, so it may be better to pick a prior that is concentrated closer to 1/3 in all coordinates. Above this would simply have made our estimated posterior probability of "close to fair" even higher.
