Logistic regression for risk adjustment

I'm not sure to understant how you can use logistic regression to calculate risk-adjusted rate. For example, I want to calculate an adjusted rate for acquiring C. difficile in a hospital. I have the real number of cases in the hospital, but I want to adjust for age, sex and other variables to compare with other hospital in Canada. I need to use the logistic regression to have my new rate adjusted. I know I need to use coefficient derived from the regression to calculate the number of expected case and then do: number of true case / number of expected case * Canadian average But how do I use coefficient to calculate the number of expected case?
