How to control sound in a pure DHTML game

I am looking into writing web based games using just Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It seems like there are large classes of games could be done using these technologies, except for one thing. I can't really find a good way of controlling sound, the only thing I see that it works is to embedding a control of some sort into the page. Is their a way to do fine grained sound effects in DHTML? Lets say I had a pool game and wanted to have the sounds of the balls hitting each other, is there a way to do this without using some sort of plugin?
