I'm not clear as to what find() is doing, is it going into each of the paragraph elements too? yes it does I just need it to traverse the top-level children - is there a way to specify that? yes, use .children() From API Doc: The .find() and .children() methods are similar, except that the latter only travels a single level down the DOM tree.
