I'm not so sure it makes sense to force a db engine type to be used. It makes more sense to allow the admin who's installing Joomla to select the engine type. Joomla's just going to take the default if nothing is specifically set. You can change your default storage engine by changing your mySQL configuration or using the start up parameters to change the default. See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/storage-engines.html
