That's not a TreeView, it's a ListView with View = LargeIcons. TreeView isn't a great control as a drop target since it hides sub-nodes. But you can solve both problems by implementing the DragOver event. Test where the mouse is at and expand and select the node: void treeView1_DragOver(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { var pos = treeView1.PointToClient(new Point(e.X, e.Y)); var hit = treeView1.HitTest(pos); if (hit.Node != null) { hit.Node.Expand(); treeView1.SelectedNode = hit.Node; } }
