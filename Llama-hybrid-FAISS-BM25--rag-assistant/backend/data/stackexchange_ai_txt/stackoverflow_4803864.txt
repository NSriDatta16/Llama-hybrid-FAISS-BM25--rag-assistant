So you've got a sorted array, you can do 2 things [ Performance Test ] var array = [ ... ]; // sorted array of elements var len = array.length; Detach the parent before appending the elements, then append the parent back. This seems to be the fastest alternative (especially for large collections). var parent = root.parentNode; var next = root.nextSibling; parent.removeChild(root); for (var i = 0; i Another option would be to use documentFragment , and then you append it to the DOM at once. var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); for (var i = 0; i Unfortunately, it slows down your code in Chrome. (faster in IE, and FF) I would like to point out that unless you're dealing with 1000+ elements the difference won't be noticable.
