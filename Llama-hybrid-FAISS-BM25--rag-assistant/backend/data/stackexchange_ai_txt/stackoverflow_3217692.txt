If you want k random integers drawn without replacement (to get unique numbers) from the set {1, ..., n}, what you want is the first k elements in a random permutation of [n]. The most elegant way to generate such a random permutation is by using the Knuth shuffle. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_shuffle
