how to make a 2d plot of where different CNN predictions lie

Current model is a trained VGG19 model in Keras on 10 categories. I want to see where different image categories lie in a 2d plane (to see whether images of the same class are being clustered and how far away different image categories are from each other). I am currently thinking of running X number of images of each category through the CNN and somehow using the final convolutional layer weights (64x64 matrix) as my plot points (not sure how to make an entire matrix a single point nor if this makes sense) Does something like what im trying to do already exist and if not, any idea on how to go about implementing this? Thanks
