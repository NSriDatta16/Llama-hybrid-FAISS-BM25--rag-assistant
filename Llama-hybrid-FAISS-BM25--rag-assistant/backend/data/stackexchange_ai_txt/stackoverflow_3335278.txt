I am completely unfamiliar with Python, however if you can access any of the prominent image processing libraries it is possible. Take a look here for ImageMagick Python solutions. Edit You may wish to take a look at this blog post for information regarding steganography (hiding information within an image) and an offshoot of the ImageMagick library. It uses C++ here but I'm sure you could figure out a way to incorporate the base processes in Python.
