Interesting Compiler Projects

I am looking at a semester long project in compilers that could also evolve into my graduate thesis. I do not have much experience in this field (I have written a small "translator" for Pascal as part of my undergraduate work) --- I have been more into Machine Learning, and AI. The idea is to take this up as a challenge, and learn something in the process. I did have a look at: Interesting compiler projects , but most of the ideas seem outdated. The same is also true of the LLVM Open Projects page --- http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html Since I will have a semester to work on it, I am aiming for something slightly significant. I would like to work broadly on optimisations, or parallelisation. What might be an interesting thing to work on?
