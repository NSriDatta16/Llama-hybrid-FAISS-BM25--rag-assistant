I have no problems with the first variant. May be the better way is to use the following: #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( once: ThatWarning ) //code with ThatWarning here #pragma warning( pop ) This will let you know that there're still warnings in the code, but the warning messages will not be so annoying. But that is the matter of taste.
