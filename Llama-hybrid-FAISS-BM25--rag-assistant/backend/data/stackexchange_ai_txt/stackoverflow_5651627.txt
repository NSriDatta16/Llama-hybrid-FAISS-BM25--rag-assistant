Populate a form with the new()-method

Problem solved. HTML5 localStorage messed with me. I'm trying to populate a form with parameters from the new()-method, and I can't get it to work. Every user has default values for the form saved in the database(in a table called defaults), and when you create a new record I want it to be populated with the values from that table. @default = Default.find_by_user_id(current_user.id) @invoice = Invoice.new(:title => @default.title, :company_information => @default.company_information) render 'create' and then in my view: form_for @invoice, :url => { :action => "create"} do |f| ... What happens is that the values that are default for invoice are created, but not the ones created in the new()-method. The weirdest part is that when I check the source code after the page is loaded, the inputs value attributes is filled with the correct information, but not rendered on the page...
