First - of course we should sample from p(z), but in some cases it is impossible and that is where MCMC is applicable. Second - the correct stationary distribution is ensured by detailed balance condition. If further conditions are met (in simple case of finite state space it is enough that state is aperiodic and irreducible) the stationary distribution is unique, moreover regardless of the starting distribution there will be convergence to stationary distribution. It is quite nicely explained in Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Time-homogeneous_Markov_chain_with_a_finite_state_space
