Directly using lag of target variable as a feature is a good approach. However, you need to be careful about if model is overfitting due to the lag feature. If you would like to estimate rare peaks on the data along with normal days, previous lag may only be overfitting, you may estimate peaks as a normal day. In addition to that, if other features are informative, and if lagged feature is highly correlated with the target variable, XGBoost may fail on capturing contribution of other features.
