Comparing patient proportions between one ER and the national average

I am looking to compare the proportion of emergency room attendances by hour of the day against a national average proportion (plus some other tests for ER variables such as referral methods and discharge destinations). Ho = no difference between the two distributions. I was intending to use a paired t-test for the normally distributed data and a Wilcoxon signed rank test for the non-normal. I have never used the Wilcoxon using proportions, though. Is this acceptable and if so does anyone know a good text / previous research to read? Many thanks.
