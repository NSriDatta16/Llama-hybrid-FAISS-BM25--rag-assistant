The scholarly literature guiding you into the best way to test a scientific hypothesis of comparative clinical effectiveness is quite large. Have a look for instance at Rosenbaum's Design of Observational Studies: https://www.amazon.com/Design-Observational-Studies-Springer-Statistics-ebook/dp/B00DZ0PT76/ . Having said this, I think some informal guidance can indeed be provided. First, carefully decide what you want to test/measure and which patients you want to inform when the study is completed and the data collected. This will tell you which patients to include and which endpoints to focus on. Second, ensure best research practice (irrespective of the presence/lack of randomization): explicit selection criteria, formal data collection process, validated outcome ascertainment. Third, figure out the sample size: this may depend on pragmatic issues, funding, or a formal power analysis, but in general terms the more patients (from several centers), the better. Regarding analysis, there is plenty of options. Most experts would argue however that propensity matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting, or instrumental variable analysis represent the most advanced and less likely to be biased ones. Bottomline: a prospective observational study is always a good start to confirm a promising retrospective one, but remember that association is not causation, and in the modern era of industrial medicine most treatments need to be supported by randomized trial data...
