I would recommend a rolling average, it can be quite robust and is not upset by slow changes over time. You then can use your existing data to determine at which level of deviation you want an alarm. This optimization depends on weither you want rather to catch most of the deviations or minimize the number of false positive alarms. EDIT1: In the end you will always need to tweak parameters. There is no real ground truth. An anomaly is always a subjective thing.
