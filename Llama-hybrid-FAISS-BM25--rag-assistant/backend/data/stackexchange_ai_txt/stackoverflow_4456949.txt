Companies that are serious about protecting their assets will have access logging on their core systems and active scanning to detect suspicious patterns. Similar security is implemented for employees of government agencies (e.g. tax, social security) holding sensitive personal information. Users who access data outside of their assigned cases can be flagged and investigated. I suspect (but don't know) that similar scanning could be implemented in high value source code repositories. Some organizations block the use of removable media (It has been reported that some agencies have reacted to Wikileaks with such policies), in some cases by physically gluing up the USB/media ports. This restricts potential thiefs to network transfers of material which can be scanned.
