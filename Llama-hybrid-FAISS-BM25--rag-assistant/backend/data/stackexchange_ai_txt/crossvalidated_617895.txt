Where does multilevlel modeling fit in with causal inference?

I am just now exploring the world of multilevel modeling and I am wondering how to contextualize MLM within the broader toolkit of causal inference techniques. In one of my graduate econometrics course, I was taught the fixed effects v. random effects dichotomy that Huntington-Klein helpfully breaks down and criticizes (random effects are only plausible with no correlation between fixed effects and right-hand side variables). In my brief exploration of Bayesian statistics via McElreaths Statistical Rethinking , he argues that MLMs should probably be the default over the standard regression model in most disciplines. Conceptually, some of these ideas are fairly new to me, especially with how MLMs fit into the causal inference toolkit. As a result, I have three questions on the topic: If MLMs incorporate fixed effects, should one consider using fixed effects anymore as a tool to make causal inferences? If MLMs provide more detail on group or unit-specific intercepts and slopes, should users consider using standard regression adjustment anymore? Where do MLMs fit into the broader causal inference toolkit. Given that regression is still used for estimation with most strategies (matching, DID, IV, RDD, etc.), can one use MLMs instead of the standard regression model for these contexts? Should one consider using MLMs?
