Logistic regression was invented by statistician DR Cox in 1958 and so predates the field of machine learning. Logistic regression is not a classification method, thank goodness. It is a direct probability model. If you think that an algorithm has to have two phases (initial guess, then "correct" the prediction "errors") consider this: Logistic regression gets it right the first time. That is, in the space of additive (in the logit) models. Logistic regression is a direct competitor of many machine learning methods and outperforms many of them when predictors mainly act additively (or when subject matter knowledge correctly pre-specifies interactions). Some call logistic regression a type of machine learning but most would not. You could call some machine learning methods (neural networks are examples) statistical models.
