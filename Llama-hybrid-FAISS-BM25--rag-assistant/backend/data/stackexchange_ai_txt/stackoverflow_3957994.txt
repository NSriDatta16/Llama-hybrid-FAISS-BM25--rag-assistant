Think about your list as a bucket of red and black balls. If you have one red ball in a bucket of ten balls, and you pick a ball at random and put it back in the bucket, and then repeat that sample-and-replace step a thousand times, how many times out of a thousand do you expect to observe a red ball, on average? Check out the Binomial distribution and check out confidence intervals . If you have a very long list and want to do things relatively efficiently, sampling is the way to go.
