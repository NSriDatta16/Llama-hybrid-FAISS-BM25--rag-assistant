Demonstrate change of predictor variable for a time series

I have the following problem: Assume there are three time series $h(t)$, $g(t)$ and $f(t)$. The hypothesis is that prior to $t_1$: $h(t)=a\cdot f(t-t_2)$ and after $t_1$: $h(t)=b \cdot g(t-t_3)$. Now the question is are there statistical or mathematical tests that would allow me to determine $t_1$? And prove that the assumed relationship between $h(t)$, $g(t)$ and $f(t)$ is correct?
