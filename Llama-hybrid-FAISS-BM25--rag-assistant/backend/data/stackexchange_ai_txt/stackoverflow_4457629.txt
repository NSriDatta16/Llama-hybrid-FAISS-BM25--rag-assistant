Please note that view selection formulas using variable times (@Now, @Today) are hell on server performance, since every time the view is accessed it needs to check when "now" is. In Notes and Domino 7, you would be far better off to use a hard-coded date range and a scheduled agent to change the view selection formula on a monthly or daily basis (depending on whether you mean "last month" or "between this date last month and today"). Please see the Performance Basics for Lotus Notes Developers whitepaper for more information.
