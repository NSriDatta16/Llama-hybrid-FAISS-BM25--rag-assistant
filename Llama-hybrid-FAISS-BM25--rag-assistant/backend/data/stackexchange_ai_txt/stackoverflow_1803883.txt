I discourage the checkout/checkin approach. A decent version control system should be able to merge changes. This provides you with plenty of choices: CVS, SVN and Git. As for "clutter" in your source files: I don't consider repository directories (e.g. .svn or .git ) clutter, as this allows you to copy the repository structure. Nevertheless, in SVN (not sure about Git) you can lock/unlock a file, basically mimicking the VSS checkout/checkin.
