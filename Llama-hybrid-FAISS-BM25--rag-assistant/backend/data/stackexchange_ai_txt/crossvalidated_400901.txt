Personally, I have experienced this once, but not with t-SNE or PCA. My original data is in 15-dimensional space. Using UMAP to reduce it to 2D and 3D embeddings, I got 2 perfectly and visually seperable clusters on both 2D and 3D plots. Too good to be true. But when I "looked" at the orginal data from the persistence diagram, I realized that there are much more "significant" clusters, not just 2. Clustering on the output of the dimension reduction technique must be done with a lot of caution, otherwise any interpretation can be very misleading or wrong because reducing dimension will surely result in feature loss (maybe noisy or true features, but a priori, we don't know which). In my opinion, you can trust/interpret the clusters, if: The clusters in the projected data correspond/confirm to some classification defined a priori (think of MNIST dataset, where the clusters of projected data match very nicely with the classification of digits), and/or, You can confirm the presence of these clusters in the original data using other methods, like persistence diagrams. Counting only the number of connected components can be done in a quite reasonable amount of time.
