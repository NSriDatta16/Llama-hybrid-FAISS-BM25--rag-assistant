Sorrow with Data Transfer Objects in Silverlight / WCF

I have a Silverlight app hosted in an Azure web role ASP project. The ASP project exposes a WCF service. I would like to have one set of class definitions for the data types. Someone recommended making a third project (class library) and adding a reference to it from the SL and ASP. I started doing this, but the Silverlight project complained that you can only add references to Silverlight projects. I then made a Silverlight class library and moved the data classes to it. However, I to add some .dll references, like to the Windows Azure storage client. Then the Silverlight class library tells me I can only add references to Silverlight 4-friendly .dlls, of which Windows Azure isn't one. Fantastic. Is there something I can do to get around this, or am I stuck with a less elegant, redundant solution?
