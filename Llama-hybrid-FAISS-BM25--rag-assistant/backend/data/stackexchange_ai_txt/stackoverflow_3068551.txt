Random and statistics are not favored in unit tests. Unit tests should always return the same result . Always. Not mostly. What you could do is trying to remove the random generator of the logic you are testing. Then you can mock the random generator and return predefined values. Additional thoughts: You could consider to change the implementation to make it more testable. Try to get as less random values as possible. You could for instance only get one random value to determine the deviation from the average distribution. This would be easy to test. If the random value is zero, you should get the exact distribution you expect in average. If the value is for instance 1.0, you miss the average by some defined factor, for instance by 10%. You could also implement some Gaussian distribution etc. I know this is not the topic here, but if you are free to implement it as you want, consider testability.
