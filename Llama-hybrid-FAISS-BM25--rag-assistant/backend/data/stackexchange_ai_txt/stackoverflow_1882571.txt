How do I build the boost "Getting Started" examples using XCode?

So let's say you want to build the Boost "Getting Started" examples and link to them using an Xcode project rather than building at the command line. You try the header-only option and it works fine. But then you take the example source: #include #include #include int main() { std::string line; boost::regex pat( "^Subject: (Re: |Aw: )*(.*)" ); while (std::cin) { std::getline(std::cin, line); boost::smatch matches; if (boost::regex_match(line, matches, pat)) std::cout And you do the following: Build the boost libraries using ./bjam install Open Xcode and create a new C++ command line utility project. Drag libboost_regex.dylib into the Products folder in the Groups & Files treeview (checking the option that allows it copy the file) Set the project options so that Header Search Paths points to the Boost include folder Build and Run the project! Sadly, if you have the console open (Run | Console) you're going to see an error that it can't find the dylib: dyld: Library not loaded: libboost_regex.dylib Referenced from: /Users/matt/Documents/Boost/test/GettingStarted/build/Debug/GettingStarted Reason: image not found So, not knowing a better way to get Xcode to do this, you copy the dylib into your_project/build/debug/ and it runs! Hooray! Detail-oriented person that you are, you type some stuff into standard in to try it out: > Subject: foo bar baz > foo bar baz And then it segfaults. Program received signal: “EXC_BAD_ACCESS”. ACK! But have no fear. I know what the problem is! And if nobody beats me to it, I'll post the solution after lunch.
