Concavity of SVM dual formulation

These notes have derived the following dual formulation of the SVM optimisation problem using KKT conditions that I have followed It then states that the objective function is quadratic and concave (in alpha) which I find is in no way obvious. The i, j th entry of the Hessian is easy to calculate and only depends on the datapoints, so I don't see why this has to be negative semidefinite. Would appreciate any help.
