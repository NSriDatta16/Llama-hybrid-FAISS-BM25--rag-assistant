locally disable function inlining

I need to make the compiler to not inline an inlined function. eg: I have an inline function A . I have a function B that calls A . In B , A is inlined and this is perfect. Now I have a function C that calls A many times. In C , A is inlined, and it is not good. Is it possible to tell the compiler to not inline A when it is called from C ? --edit-- The first Idea is to create the function __declspec(noinline) A1 (that simply calls A ) and call A1 instead of A in C . But I wondering if there is a more elegant solution ? note I know that inline is only a suggestion, but in my program, I have some unlikely or error cases where the compiler inline functions but should not because in these cases I prefer function calls to reduce code size. I also noticed that the compiler is not always able to make the best choice (in the point of view of the developer)
