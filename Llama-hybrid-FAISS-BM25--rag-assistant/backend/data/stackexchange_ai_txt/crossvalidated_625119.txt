Would repeating random forest class prediction 1000 times and choosing most frequent class improve accuracy?

I want to improve class prediction accuracy using random forest. I was wondering if I repeat the class prediction for each point 1000 times and choosing the most frequent answer make any sense (especially that the model itself has by default multiple iterations)? Is there a way to choose the iteration that had highest accuracy compared to ground truth? Here is a simple function to calculate accuracy of one iteration get_prediction % dplyr::select(-c(Species)) train % dplyr::pull(Species) return(round(sum(predict == truth)/length(truth)*100,2)) } # here I repeat the function 1000 times df % as.data.frame() %>% dplyr::rename_with(.cols=1, ~ "V1") # plotting the total accuracy of each iteration ggplot(df, aes(x=V1)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), alpha=0.3, fill="red", linewidth=1, colour="black", bins=30) + geom_line(stat="density") + theme_cowplot(font_size=20) + xlim(0, 100) + labs(title="Accuracy", x="%", y="Density") + geom_text(aes(label=paste("Mean accuracy =", round(mean(V1),2), "%"), x=25, y=0.1), size=9)
