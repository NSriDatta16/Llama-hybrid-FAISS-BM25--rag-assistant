Simulations are often done when you can't get a closed form for something (such as a distribution) or you want a nitty-gritty and fast way to get that something. For example, say I'm running a logistic regression using one variable $X$ to explain $Y$. I know that distribution of the coefficient $\beta$ for $X$ is asymptotically Normal from MLE theory. But let's say I'm interested in the difference of two estimated probabilities $f(\beta) = P(Y=1|X=1) - P(Y=1|X=0)$. It may be very difficult (or impossible) to derive the exact distribution of this function but, since I know the distribution of $\beta$, I can simulate values from $\beta$ and plug it into $f(\beta)$ to get an empirical distribution.
