You are attempting sql heresy. I'm actually pretty open-minded and know a lot of times one must do things that seem crazy. It annoys me when people arrogantly answer with "you should do that differently", when they have know idea what the situation is. However I must tell you that you should do this differently . heh heh. No, there is no way to do this elegantly with sql\DataAdapter. You could do it through ADO.NET with a series of t-sql commands. You have to, every time, turn on an identity-overwrite mode ( set identity_insert theTable on ), do your query where all the values on that table are incremented up one, and then turn of autonumber-overwrite mode. But then you would need to increment all the other tables that use this as a foreign key. But wait, it gets worse: You would need to all this in a transaction , because you cannot have anything else happening to these tables during this time, and because if there was a failure you would most definitely need to rollback. This could be a good-size chunk of processing; your tables would be locked for a good bit. If you have any foreign key constraints between these tables, you would need to turn them off before you do this, and re-implement them afterwards.
