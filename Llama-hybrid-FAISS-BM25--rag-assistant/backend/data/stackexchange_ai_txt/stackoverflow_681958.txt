LINQ expression parsers are pretty much at liberty to support (or not) any set of operations they choose. In the case of LINQ-to-SQL and EF, they will throw an exception if they get confused by something (and I would expect the above to fall into this) - but it sounds like Db4o is just saying "no matches". Does Db40 have the ability to log the queries it executes? Maybe it is doing something funky... but we can only guess...
