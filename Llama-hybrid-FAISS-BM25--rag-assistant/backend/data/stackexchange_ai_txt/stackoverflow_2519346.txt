Dreamweaver and GZIP files

I've recently tried to optimize my site for speed and brandwith. Amongst many other techniques, I've used GZIP on my .css and .js files. Using PuTTY I compressed the files on my site and then used: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !Konqueror RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.gz -f RewriteRule ^(.*)\.css$ $1.css.gz [QSA,L] RewriteRule ^(.*)\.js$ $1.js.gz [QSA,L] ForceType text/css ForceType text/javascript AddEncoding gzip .gz in my .htaccess file so that they get served properly because all my links are without the ".gz". My problem is, I cant work on the GZIP file in Dreamweaver. Is there a plugin or extension of somesort that allows Dreamweaver to temporarily uncompress thses files so it can read them? Or is there a way that I can work on my local copies as regular files, and server side they automatically get compressed when they are uploaded. Or is there a different code editor I should be using that would completely get around this? Or a just a different technique to doing this? I hope this question makes sense, Thanks
