There are some good utility classes in the WCF REST Starter Kit , for implementing .NET REST clients that invoke services implemented in any platform. Here's a video that describes how to use the client-side pieces. Sample code fragment: HttpClient c = new HttpClient("http://twitter.com/statuses"); c.TransportSettings.Credentials = new NetworkCredentials(username, password); // make a GET request on the resource. HttpResponseMessage resp = c.Get("public_timeline.xml"); // There are also Methods on HttpClient for put, delete, head, etc resp.EnsureResponseIsSuccessful(); // throw if not success // read resp.Content as XElement resp.Content.ReadAsXElement();
