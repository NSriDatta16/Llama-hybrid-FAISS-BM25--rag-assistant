Violation of linearity assumption in Logistic Regression

I built a logistic model with 7 continuous independent variable and 8 categorical (dummy) variables in R. I tested for the linearity assumption using the Box Tidwell test and all my variables show high significance. I am wondering now, if the assumption is violated what it would mean for the coefficient estimates and if I still can run the model with caution. I read about the approach of using regression splines but I am confused how I would determine those and interpret the model then.
