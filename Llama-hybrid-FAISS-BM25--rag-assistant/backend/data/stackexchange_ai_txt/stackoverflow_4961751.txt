Nested UIScrollView won't scroll when outter view is zoomed

I'm having quite a problem here when nesting UIScrollViews. I have an outter paged scroll view, that does paged scrolling with it's UIScrollView subviews. These subviews contain a subview that have a CALayer with a big image. Whenever is needed this CALayer subviews can be have small scrollview added to them that act as small picture galleries. These galleries have their own viewcontroller called SlideViewController. view | v mainScrollView | v UIScrollView (page) | v view with CALayer | v ScrollView like gallery. Everything works like a charm until the ipad is rotated to landscape and the page scroll view is zoomed a 33%. All of the subviews are in their place. their bounds are correct, so as their frame. The thing is that when I swipe over the little galleries they don't scroll any more. The big page does. I've tried setting canCancelContentTouches to NO to all of the involved scrollviews. I also subclassed the gallery scroll view to get a grip on the touchesEnded/began/cancelled and try to disable the super view scrolling from there with no success. I tried to set the galleries as a first responder when I called init on them. With no further results. Now I can scroll the galleries only if I put my finger for a while on them, so no gesture recognizer steals the swipe from them, and then scroll gently to the next picture of the gallery. If I swipe normally, sometimes the big outter scrollview would steal the swipe and change the page, and sometimes the little gallery would catch it first. this only happens when the scrollview containing the CA layer (the page) is zoomed otherwise works amazingly great with no issues what so ever. Am I screwing the UIResponder chain? How could I fix this? I could paste you some code snippets, but this involves a handful of classes, that I don't know which ones could be of use or not. Thanks in advance
