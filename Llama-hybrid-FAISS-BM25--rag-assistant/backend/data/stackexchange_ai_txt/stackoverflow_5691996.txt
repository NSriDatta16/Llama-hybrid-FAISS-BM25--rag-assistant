Are there any iPhone plugins for video conferencing? Like a face-time plugin?

i'm trying to do some R&D with my iPhone and want to have a 'page' that can do facetime or some video conf thing. I know this has been asked before on SO .. but i'm not sure if that's the same question or applicable answer for me. Bascially, i want to start a vid conf with another person - in my app .. but leverage existing infrastructure. If it's a paid service - then fine. I'm just R&D'ing stuff right now. Can anyone suggest any pointers?
