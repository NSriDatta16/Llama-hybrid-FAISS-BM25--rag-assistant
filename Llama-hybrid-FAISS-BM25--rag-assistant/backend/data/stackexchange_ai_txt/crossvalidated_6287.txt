Threshold models and flu epidemic recognition

I'm fooling around with threshold time series models. While I was digging through what others have done, I ran across the CDC's site for flu data. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/ About 1/3 of the way down the page is a graph titled "Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality....". It shows the actuals in red, and two black seasonal series. The top seasonal series is labeled "Epidemic Threshold" and appears to be some constant percent/amount above the "Seasonal Baseline" series. My first question is: Is that really how they determine when to publicly say we're in an epidemic (some percent above baseline)? It looks to me like they're in the noise range, not to mention the "other factors" influence that is obviously not accounted for in that baseline series. To me, there are way too many false positives. My second question is: Can you point me to any real world examples/publications of threshold models (hopefully in R)?
