I prefer Firefox myself, but nowadays they all quite close to each other. FF just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions, so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or chrome extensions. Firefox has Firebug, FireQuery, JSONView and Wev Developer extensions to provide you w/e you need to debug AJAX-rich apps. Opera has Dragonfly out of the box, with similar to Firebug capabilities. Chrome has Chrome Developer Tools, which again, is on par with Firebug. Even IE8 got itself some fancy developer tools with basic firebug caps. Real answer tho is all of them, since there are often browser-specific problems which need to be debugged with that browser's own tools.
