You should be using os.path.join rather than just concatenating dirname() and filenames. import os.path in_file = os.path.join(dirname(__file__), input_file_name) out_file = os.path.join(dirname(__file__), input_file_name + ".json") will fix your problem, though depending on what exactly you're doing, there's probably a more elegant way to do it.
