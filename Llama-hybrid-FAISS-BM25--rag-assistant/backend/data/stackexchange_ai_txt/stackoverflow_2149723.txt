html hyperlinks show URL in brackets in Entourage

I have an email script written in .Net that sends html emails. The email uses normal html hyperlinks to insert a link in the email, like this: StackOverflow The problem is that in Entourage, a hyperlink like this always shows up for me like this: StackOverflow How can I format the hyperlink in my email so that in Entourage the text "StackOverflow" is the actual hyperlink, and the URL is not displayed after the text? Is there an html meta tag that needs to be set? Do I have to set the content-type somewhere? Or is there a different html syntax on the hyperlink itself that I should use?
