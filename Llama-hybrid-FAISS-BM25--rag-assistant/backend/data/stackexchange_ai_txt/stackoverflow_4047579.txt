averaging event values associated with date values by hour, day, etc

I have a bunch of events with values (how many people went through a doorway). Each event is associated with a Date. There is no fixed period to the events .If no one comes through the door, no event is generated, but often multiple people can go through at once, so the value can be greater than one. Sometimes events are minutes apart for a time, sometimes there is gaps of a few hours, Using the Date class, is there an easy way to average my values over periods of time?
