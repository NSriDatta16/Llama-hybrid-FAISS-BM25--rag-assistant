Anastasia, Assuming you have the calculation for the average and a unique key in the table, you could do something like this to get just the latest occurrence of the timing for each unique 07-xxx result: select Column1, Avg(Convert(decimal,Column2)) from Table1 where TableId in ( select Max(TableId) from Table1 group by Column1 ) group by column1 This was assuming the following table structure in MS SQL: CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Table1] ( [TableId] [int] IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL , [Column1] [varchar] (50) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NULL , [Column2] [int] NULL ) ON [PRIMARY] Good Luck!
