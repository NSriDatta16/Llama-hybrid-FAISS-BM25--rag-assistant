End of a time series have to be "corrected" before decomposition if partial period?

I have a few times series that are Google search terms which a period of length 1 year with 12 months in each year. As we are in February, the latest data shows only one and a half months. All my decomposed series show a downward trend at the very end of each graph. Is this a real trend or do I need to apply a correction due to the end of the time series being an incomplete cycle? See this image (from the beginning of January) where I have a severe dip at the end: Would this be an outlier? A change in the trend? Or am I missing a correction value for having just a fraction of the period?
