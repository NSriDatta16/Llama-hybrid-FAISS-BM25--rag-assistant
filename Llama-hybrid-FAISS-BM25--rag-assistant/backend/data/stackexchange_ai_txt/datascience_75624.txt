I normally dont use sklearn for the encodings but "category encoders package": Have you consider using their Hashing Encoder ?: The advantage of this encoder is that it does not maintain a dictionary of observed categories. Consequently, the encoder does not grow in size and accepts new values during data scoring by design. The output are int64 features. Category encoders API es easy to use and can be implemented in a transformer
