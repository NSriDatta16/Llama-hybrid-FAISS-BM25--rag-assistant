I am not sure if you need to take the spatial autocorrelation into account in this problem. One possible way to test that difference is to calculate the average difference in each region in each image, and then perform a paired t-test or some other paired test to check if average differences between regions are significant. You take into account that the region intensities are coming from the same image by using a paired test.
