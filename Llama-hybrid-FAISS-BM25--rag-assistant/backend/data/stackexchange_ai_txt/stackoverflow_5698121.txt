How to merge with SVN server prior to 1.5 (retrieval of mergeinfo unsupported)?

Locally I've got TortoiseSVN version 1.6.11 installed. This is using Subversion 1.6.13 My central SVN repository uses version SVN Server version 1.4.2 (and I can't upgrade it). Every time I try to merge I get the message: retrieval of mergeinfo unsupported by http://svn01.xxx.xxx.com/svn/ This is because the server uses an older version of SVN, which doesn't support mergeinfo, meaning my local version won't work. So how can I merge?
