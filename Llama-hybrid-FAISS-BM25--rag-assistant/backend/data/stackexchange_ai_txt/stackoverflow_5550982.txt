Renaming an SQL database in android

When referring to database tables I usually use syntax like this: my_database_name.my_table_name I am trying to do the same in Android but am having trouble understanding how to name a database. Would you just execute this SQL as you would in the Sqlite3 client? i.e. ATTACH "my_database_file" AS my_database_name; Here is what I tried in my onCreate method: db.execSQL("Attach 'hq_db' AS hq_db;"); but I'm getting this error: 04-05 11:13:35.676: ERROR/AndroidRuntime(860): Caused by: android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException: cannot ATTACH database within transaction: Attach 'hq_db' AS hq_db; How do I execute SQL statements on Android outside of a transaction to make this work? Edit: It might also have something to so with the superclass constuctor, though the super class constructor string sets the file name (which is working properly) and it seems nothing else: private class databaseOpenHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper { public q_player_databaseOpenHelper() { super(MyApp.getContext(), "my_db_file", null, 1); } @Override public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) { db.execSQL("Attach 'my_db_file' AS my_db_name;"); db.execSQL("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;"); } Note: I have stripped this code down so it would fit my problem
