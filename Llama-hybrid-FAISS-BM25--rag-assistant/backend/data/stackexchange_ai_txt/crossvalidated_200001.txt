Different Granger causality results in Matlab versus R

I'm trying to test for Granger causality of two data sets A and B. The time series length is 106. First I used Matlab function granger_cause and the results are as follow: [F,c_v]=granger_cause(a,b,0.05,7) F = 6.2566 c_v = 2.1955 Then I used R function granger.test in the package MSBVAR to do the same thing: granger.test(c,7) F-statistic p-value b -> a 0.9553480 0.4691375 a -> b 0.9224725 0.4934965 Here c is the combination of column vectors a and b . Clearly, the first function specifies the $\alpha$ level and outputs the critical value of the $F$-test, while the second gives the $p$-value and lets user determine the $\alpha$ level. What I don't understand is why these two functions give me different $F$-values? Is there anything I need to be aware of? Thanks!
