The standard error of the mean (to 1 or 2 significant digits, I chose 2) is 9.8/sqrt(3400) = 0.17. The mean should be reported with the number of significant digits that makes it consistent with its standard error, i.e., 172.40. The result should be reported as 172.40 +/- 0.17 and you should identify it as being the estimated value of the height and its standard uncertainty. The Guide to Uncertainty in Measurement ( GUM ) takes us this far. I have not seen explicit guidance on the number of significant digits to give in the upper and lower coverage intervals that are constructed with the mean, standard uncertainty, and coverage factor, but is seems reasonable to express them to the same number as the standard uncertainty, i.e., (172.07, 172.73) if we assume normality (coverage factor = 1.96) and want a 95% coverage interval.
