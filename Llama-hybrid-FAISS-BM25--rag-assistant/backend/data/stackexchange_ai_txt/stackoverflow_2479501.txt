not any(d for d in l) is equivalent by De Morgan's Law to all(not d for d in l) , but applies just one not operator. The short-circuiting behavior is also equivalent. Edit 1 : the inner genexp is actually (innocuous but) redundant: not any(l) is faster and more concise. Edit 2 : a comment claims that all(not d for d in l) is "more what you want to express" than not any(l) , and I strongly disagree: even in natural language, "all items of the list are unpopulated" isn't any more normal, direct or clear than "no item of the list is populated" -- beyond the absolute logical equivalence by the laws of logic, the two ways of expression are very close and roughly equivalent in terms of human psychology, too.
