The difference is that in blocking we're ultimately trying to make a comparison between these groups, while in sampling we're interested in making some inference on the whole population. Eg, in testing Drug A vs Drug B we might try to make both groups contain the same proportions of males and females. That increases the similarities between the groups, and thus the correlation between the group outcomes. A larger correlation between the groups means that treatment differences between groups becomes easier to detect, since there's less random noise. Imagine if we knew the outcomes from the two groups would be perfectly correlated except for the treatment effect. In that case all we'd have to do is measure the treatment effect, there'd be no need for complex statistics. In sampling clusters we aren't trying to compare clusters with each other. We're trying to learn something about the population. In that regard having a new observation which is highly correlated with another observation doesn't give us much value. For example, suppose I want to estimate the average length of the legs of adults. I might randomly select either a person's left or right leg and measure the length. I could also measure their other leg, I've already got them in the office so it won't take much more effort. But since I already know the length of their first leg it's highly unlikely that the length of their other leg will be much different. (Although they will probably be slightly different.) Sampling both "units" inside each "cluster" doesn't help as much as if I measured the leg of an entirely different person. Now as you say, increasing the percentage of sampled clusters does increase the precision of the estimates. If I go sample 10 more people and their 20 legs that will improve the estimate. But it would be more efficient to sample 20 legs from 20 different people.
