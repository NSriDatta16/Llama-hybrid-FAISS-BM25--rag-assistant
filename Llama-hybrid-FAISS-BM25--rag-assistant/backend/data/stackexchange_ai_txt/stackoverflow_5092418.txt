Deleting contents of silverlight isolated storage from an MSI

I have a scenario where an MSI needs to delete the contents of the silverlight isolated storage directory for a particular silverlight app. Since the location of isolated storage for my app is different from user-to-user/machine-to-machine, the MSI can't do this directly and needs to call out to some sort of script/executable to get the job done. So my question is two parts What's the best way to determine what the location of silverlight isolated storage is for a particular silverlight app? My current thinking is walk all the folders underneath \AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\Silverlight\is\ and find an id.dat file that matches my app. What framework/language should I use to write a program to do (1) above and then delete the contents of the folder? I would like to have as few external dependencies as possible; e.g., I could easily do this with .NET, but then my MSI would require the user to have .NET just to delete a couple of files (unfortunately, unacceptable). For (2), I'm thinking a straight win32 app or a vbscript, but I have no experience with win32, and I'm not sure of any hurdles I may need to jump through if people have disabled vbscript for security reasons.
