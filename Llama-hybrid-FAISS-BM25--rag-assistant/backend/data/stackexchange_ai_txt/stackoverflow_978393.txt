Vim substitution of a list of words with another same length list of words?

I need to substitute a list of words with with an equally long list of words. So for example you have: "a","b","c","d","e","f" And you want to replace each word with the uppercase version of each word: "A","B","C","D","E","F" I know how to find each string using the regex: (a\|b\|c\|d\|e\|f) I know you could do a global substitution for each word. But when the length of the words gets large this approach would become un-wieldly and inelegant. Is there a way to somehow do one global substitution? Similar to: :%s/\(a\|b\|c\|d\|e\|f\)/INSERT_REPLACEMENT_LIST/ I am not sure if this is even possible.
