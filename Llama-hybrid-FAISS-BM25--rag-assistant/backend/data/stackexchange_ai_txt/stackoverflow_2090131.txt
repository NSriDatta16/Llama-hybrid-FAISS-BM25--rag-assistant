Target Membership grayed out ( disabled )

I'm trying to create a new unit test build target for my iphone app. The problem I'm running into is that my source code "group"'s Target Membership options are grayed out. I did delete the original "Classes" folder, and created new "SourceCode" folder with an actual disk structure (thanks xcode). I imported it as a group, not a folder. It added automatically to my standard build target's Compile Sources, but I can't add it or drag it into my new target. Any thoughts? alt text http://img.skitch.com/20100118-mhurmqc33ecaq4xq3y2e5k3hs4.jpg
