Anyway you slice it, you are still going to have to go through the list. There are more and less elegant ways to do it. Depending on the python version you are using, you can use list comprehensions. ids=line.split(",") print "%s:%s" % (ids[0], ":".join(["case%d" % x for x in range(1, len(ids)) if ids[x] != "null"])
