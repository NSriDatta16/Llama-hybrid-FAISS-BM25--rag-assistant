Selecting the best GLM (generalized linear model)

R's glm function for generalized linear models is a logistic regression when the response is dichotomous(yes/no, male/female, etc..) and the family parameter is passed the argument binomial . I'm wondering how to judge if the model we built is good eough? As we know, in OLS regression some criterion like R^2 and adjusted R^2 can tell us how much variations are explained but not for GLM. See example I performed: > summary(fit.full) Call: glm(formula = ynaffair ~ gender + age + yearsmarried + children + +religiousness + education + occupation + rating, family = binomial(), data = Affairs) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6575 -0.7459 -0.5714 -0.2552 2.5099 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.71792 0.96165 0.747 0.455336 gendermale 0.28665 0.23973 1.196 0.231811 age -0.04494 0.01831 -2.454 0.014142 * yearsmarried 0.09686 0.03236 2.993 0.002758 ** childrenyes 0.37088 0.29466 1.259 0.208147 religiousness -0.32230 0.09003 -3.580 0.000344 *** education 0.01795 0.05088 0.353 0.724329 occupation 0.03210 0.07194 0.446 0.655444 rating2 -0.02312 0.58177 -0.040 0.968303 rating3 -0.84532 0.57619 -1.467 0.142354 rating4 -1.13916 0.55740 -2.044 0.040981 * rating5 -1.61050 0.56649 -2.843 0.004470 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 675.38 on 600 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 608.22 on 589 degrees of freedom AIC: 632.22 After removed the insignificant variables, the reduced model look like below,although the AIC decreasd, we still do not know if this is the model with the lowest AIC we can achieved: > summary(fit.reduced) Call: glm(formula = ynaffair ~ age + yearsmarried + religiousness + +rating, family = binomial(), data = Affairs) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.5117 -0.7541 -0.5722 -0.2592 2.4123 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
