What is the best WYSIWYG for Rails - Ruby on Rails Blog

What is the best way to allow for the adding of images and embedding of video in the body:text field of a Ruby on Rails blog. I understand that I can use an attachment like Paperclip to add a photo to a record but I am wondering how to get images/vids into the actual body of the post.
