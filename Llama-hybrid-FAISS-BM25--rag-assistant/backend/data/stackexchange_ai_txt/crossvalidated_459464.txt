Strange looking funnel plot after computing cluster robust standard errors

I fitted the following hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analytic model using rma.mv() in the metafor R package. mod where yi are relative risks, V study variances, and region and subtype are dummy variables. I then requested a funnel plot: funnel(mod) which looks like this: However, because some articles in my meta-analysis use the same data (please see @Wolfgang reply here): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44811867/multilevel-meta-analysis-using-metafor I also decided to run the fitted model through the robust() function, specifying study as a cluster effect: mod_rob I then requested a funnel plot of this model corrected for cluster effects: funnel(mod_rob) The corresponding funnel plot looks really weird after correcting for cluster effects using the robust() function, with the data points aligned in two lines either side of the plot. I would be most grateful if anybody knows why this is and whether it is valid to use funnel plots in such instances? Thank you kindly.
