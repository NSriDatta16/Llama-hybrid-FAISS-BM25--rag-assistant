It would probably be best to use a loss function based on the absolute, rather than the squared errors. This will give a model that computes the conditional median of the target distribution, rather than the conditional mean. For details, see M Saerens, "Building cost functions minimizing to some summary statistics", IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 11 (6), 1263-1271, 2000. which is a very nice paper and ought to be much better known that it is. It is probably not too doficult to use the SFE itself as the loss function, although it will involve more programming.
