Ramin, that is perfect for what I am trying to do. I did not have a custom annotation view defined though. I solved this by using a category and it worked perfect! Here is the header: #import #import @interface MKPinAnnotationView (ZIndexFix) - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; @end And the Implementation: #import "AEBMapViewCategory.h" @implementation MKPinAnnotationView (ZIndexFix) - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.superview bringSubviewToFront:self]; [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } @end
