Would Topic Modelling be classified as NLP or NLU?

I recently started my journey into the world of NLP, it's been one heck of a ride. I'm currently trying to understand whether topic modelling would be considered as NLP or NLU. Initially I would assume that topic modelling would be classified as NLP. However, if we use word embeddings for topic modelling wouldn't it then be classified as NLU, as we have deeper understanding of how the words relate to each other in vector space? Maybe I'm having trouble formulating the inherent difference between NLP and NLU, when do we draw the line between the two? Your insight regarding this matter would be highly appreciated.
