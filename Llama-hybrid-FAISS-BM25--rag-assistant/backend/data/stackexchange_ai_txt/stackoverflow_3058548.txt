If as you say, the information will be saved on the server it should definitely be in a database. The typical game protocol is store the user information in a database - pull it into memory when they login, with lazy updates to the db for changes to the object in memory (keeps game performance high) as they play the game and update their "in memory" user game state object. Don't limit the scalability of your game by starting with file based storage just because it might be slightly easier.
