Programmatically adding appointments to Oracle Calendar 10

I'm trying to integrate a Web scheduling appliance with my organization's calendar system, Oracle Calendar 10. Getting meetings out is just a matter of parsing the UNICPOUTR output, and I thought I had a handle on getting meetings in with UNICPINR, but I'm getting a couple of odd errors. Basically I grab the room description from UNICPOUTR, append the data for the new meeting, write out to /usr/tmp, and try to import the resulting file. I created a test resource to try things out, but something's gone odd. Here's the resource description from UNICPOUTR: { F Unison Export File V A.02.53 E FALSE X R a Test Resource R b R c 10 R d R e R f R g I P 4 480 1080 1 30 190 2 1 60 0 0 10 N 0 } But trying to use this as a basis for an import file results in the rather odd error: "R=Test Resource/N=Test Resou/CA=10/LOC=10/PHONE=10/EXT=10/FAX=10/PSW=g" does not exist Trying to get a handle on the resource with the -ls flag on UNICPINR, as unicpinr -ls /usr/tmp/meeting.test just spits out unicpinr: file pattern not found - First after a message on how to use the utility. Is anybody out there familiar enough with the system that they can tell me what's going wrong here, or better yet suggest an alternate way to get new meetings in?
