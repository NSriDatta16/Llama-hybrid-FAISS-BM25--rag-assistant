Intervention analysis via autoregressive and moving-average time series models is suited for this kind of analysis. This allows you to measure the effect of an intervention at a know time point (e.g. marketing campaign, policy change,...). The answer to this post given by @forecaster gives a good introduction. In that and other answers you can see some illustrations. Different patterns can be considered for the intervention effect. The intervention may have a permanent or a transitory effect or affect just one observation. See for example this post .
