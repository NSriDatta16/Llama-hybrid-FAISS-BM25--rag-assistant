How can I add a UIElement to a Windows Forms application?

I have a WPF custom control I'd like to add to a Windows Forms application. So I added a reference to the WPF assembly, created an ElementHost and set the Child property in code. Is there a way to do this with drag and drop i e without writing code? I have tried the ElementHost popup but it does not list my component. As far as I can see, it lists only WPF components that are in a project (as opposed to an external assembly ).
