Thats what most machine learning algorithms try to do! You essentially asking us to suggest machine learning algorithms for performing machine learning! If you specifically want to understand how optimization in general is done, there are some free convex optimization courses online. Convex optimization is basically the "ideal" case for a problem (easiest to solve), you can branch out to other cases from there. Why we might want to optimize a particular model with a particular set of parameters is a whole other very long discussions. The best I can recommend is to just keep taking courses and reading on machine learning & statistics.
