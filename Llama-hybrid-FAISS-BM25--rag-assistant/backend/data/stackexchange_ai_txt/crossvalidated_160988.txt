Understand the reason for calculating the MSE

Im following an introduction course into R-machine Learning. Im doing the following: Load the faithful dataset (standard in R) Creating a model that predicts waiting time -> eruptions of the first 136 items of the dataframe. mymodel = glm(data=faithful[1:136,], waiting ~ eruptions) Calculate the mean standard error on the second half of the data. mean((faithful$waiting - predict(mymodel, faithful[137:272, ])), ^2) The way I see it you take the mean of all waitingtimes - the predicted values (using the glm model) and do exponent^2. I do not understand however why exactly this is done? Could anybody explain this to me in plain English?
