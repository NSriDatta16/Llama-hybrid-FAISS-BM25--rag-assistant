If you could take the mode (you can't here), its called MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) estimate. It's a common point estimator (may not be the best sometimes). If you take the expected value/mean it's called conditional expectation given data, $\mathbb E[X|\mathcal D]$ or the posterior mean, which is a commonly used point estimator as well. The advantage of methods similar to MCMC is having the posterior distribution available, i.e. you can find any defined moment you like, assess the variance, and have confidence intervals etc. Having a point estimate for the mean is also possible, but undervalues the importance of the posterior.
