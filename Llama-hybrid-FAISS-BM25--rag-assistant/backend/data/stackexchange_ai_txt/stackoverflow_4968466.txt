Magento Configurable Product Attributes

hey guys, having an issue with magento which i just cant seem to find a solution to. i have tried many ways of getting a configurable products attributes (simple products) and listing them, now i have them listing from 2 ways but the way im working with is below $confAttributes = @$_product->getTypeInstance(true)->getConfigurableAttributesAsArray($_product); $sizes = array(); foreach($confAttributes AS $atts){ //print '';//' '.print_r($atts).' '; if($atts['label'] == 'Size'){ foreach($atts['values'] AS $val){ $sizes[] = $val['store_label']; } } } my only problem with this now is i need to only pull back the size attributes which are in stock - looked through mage files to find solution but just cant see anything - the result i need is done in config product php file but i cant access it from in the code where i need to list the size attribute. any help would be great, thanks!
