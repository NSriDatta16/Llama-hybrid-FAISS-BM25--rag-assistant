Don't optimize this unless you have to. What is the average length of a key? Will this table be so big it won't all fit into your server's memory if you implement it the naive way? I'd suggest implementing it the simplest way, measure the performance, and then re-implement only if performance is a problem. If performance is a problem, then using an integer key and a separate table is probably the way to go (JOINS on integer columns are typically faster than JOINS using variable-length-string columns). But the first rule of optimizing is MEASURE FIRST-- make sure your supposedly-optimized code actually does make thing run faster.
