I would say that it's preferable to use as few special characters as possible in REST URLs. One of the benefits of REST is that it makes the "interface" for a service easy to read. Camel case or Pascal case is probably good for the resource names (Users or users). I don't think there are really any hard standards around REST. Also, I think Gandalf is right, it's usually cleaner in REST to not use query string parameters, but instead create paths that define which resources you want to deal with. http://api.example.com/HelloWorld/Users/12345/Order/3/etc
