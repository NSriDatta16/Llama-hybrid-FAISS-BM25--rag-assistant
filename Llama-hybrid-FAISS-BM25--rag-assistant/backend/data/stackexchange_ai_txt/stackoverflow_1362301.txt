Asp.net page - user control communication

I have a page Product.aspx,there I have a user control ProductDisplay.ascx which has been created by drag and drop. Now when a button is clicked in ProductDisplay.ascx,I want a logging function to be called which is in Product.aspx. To achieve this I have used delegates on ProductDisplay.ascx public delegate void LogUserActivity(ProductService objService); public event LogUserActivity ActivityLog; on Product.aspx protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!IsPostBack) { ProductDisp.ActivityLog += new User_UserControl_ProductDisplayBox.LogUserActivity(LogProduct); } } Now button click event of ProductDisplay.ascx protected void imgBtnBuyNow_Click(object sender, ImageClickEventArgs e) { if (ActivityLog != null) { ActivityLog(Product); } Response.Redirect("~/User/ShoppingCart.aspx"); } My problem is that whenever i click this button ActivityLog is null.Why is it null? My idea is that once i click this button,page posts back and its previous state is lost. Please help me out with a reason and solution. Secondly,I want to do away with null checking **if (ActivityLog != null)** { ActivityLog(Product); } I saw some code which instantiates a delegate with a default value the moment it is declared,but i was not able to find it.Please help.
