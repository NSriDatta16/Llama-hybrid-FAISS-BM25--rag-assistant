How to convert a literal object into user defined object in javascript?

Writing a ton of web applications leveraging JSON/AJAX, I find myself returning tons literal javascript objects (JSON). For example, I may be request all the Cats from GetCats.asp. It would return: [ { 'id': 0, 'name': 'Persian' }, { 'id': 1, 'name': 'Calico' }, { 'id': 2, 'name': 'Tabby' } ] Now, these are all Cat objects with behaviors. However, if I define a Cat object, function Cat() { }, I know of no EFFICIENT way to coax these literal objects into the behaviors of a user defined object. I can do this by brute force of iterating through them and assigning functions, but it's not going to be pretty. Is there a nice, one line(or few), way of somehow "casting" this behavior onto these literal objects?
