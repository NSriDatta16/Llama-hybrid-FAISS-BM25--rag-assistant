Use: SELECT e.Name, e.Extension, Count(pc.*) AS CallCount, AVG(pc.Duration) AS AverageCallTime, SUM(pc.Duration) AS TotalCallTime FROM Employees e LEFT JOIN PhoneCalls pc ON pc.extension = e.extension AND pc.StartTime BETWEEN "2010-09-12 09:30:00" AND NOW() GROUP BY e.Name, e.Extension The issue is when using an OUTER JOIN, specifying criteria in the JOIN section is applied before the JOIN takes place--like a derived table or inline view. The WHERE clause is applied after the OUTER JOIN, which is why when you specified the WHERE clause on the table being LEFT OUTER JOIN'd to that the rows you still wanted to see are being filtered out.
