How can I correlate groups of variables?

I have conducted a survey to find out the correlation between organizational justice and turnover intention within an organization. So, in the survey, I have asked some Likert-scale questions around organizational justice and some around turnover intention. When I enter the data into SPSS, I have to enter each question as one variable. It means that there will be some variables about organizational justice and some variables about turnover intention. My problem is that I don't know how to group these variables into two main variables -"organizational justice" and "turnover intention" in SPSS. Does anyone have any idea about what I can do?
