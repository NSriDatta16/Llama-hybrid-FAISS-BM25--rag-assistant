Econometrics is an intensely mathematically rigorous discipline. Statistical computing skills alone do not point to a successful career as an econometrician, but they are probably useful for various types of Bayesian analyses, microsimulation models, and so on. At your stage of development, I would not be concerned about statistical computing but would rather focus on exposing myself to all forms of mathematical statistics, especially measure theory, probability, and classical inference. Econometrics is of great value in the government and private sectors. Some types of work they do include forecasting costs/revenues, risk assessment, policy evaluation, and so on. You can have hard money positions within organizations like Vanguard or government, or you can have soft money positions in academics, or consulting. Whether it's "worth the effort" is subjective. You should be proactive and setup phone interviews or shadow other econometricians in your city to see if it's right for you.
