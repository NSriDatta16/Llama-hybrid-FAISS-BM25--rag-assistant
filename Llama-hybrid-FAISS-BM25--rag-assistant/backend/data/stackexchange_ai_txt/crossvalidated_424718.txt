Typically, the “business use” of a classifier depends on sensitivity and specificity, not on AUC. What you have is two models with same average performance (what the AUC measures) where one is best in the high sensitivity/low specificity region, and the other is optimal in the opposite use case. So the right question to ask is: what is the quantity you want to maximise/minimise? Clearly AUC does not tell you anything about it, but if you can answer this question, you'll know what to do!
