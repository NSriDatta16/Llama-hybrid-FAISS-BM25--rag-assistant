Test to identify change in median in a time-series

the question is trivial, but is there any statistical test (can be done in R) to show that the median is changing in a time-series?? For example, if you go to the following link, you would notice that, after the first few samples (6 or 7), the time series takes a sharp rise. I was wondering if there is a formal statistical way of saying it! https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6GUNg-8d30vMzB3cUxJM1dBbXc/edit?usp=sharing
