Possible extensions to the default diagnostic plots for lm (in R and in general)?

I started digging a bit into the plot.lm function, this function gives six plots for lm, they are: a plot of residuals against fitted values a Scale-Location plot of sqrt(| residuals |) against fitted values a Normal Q-Q plot, a plot of Cook's distances versus row labels a plot of residuals against leverages a plot of Cook's distances against leverage/(1-leverage) And I am wondering what other common/useful extensions of current plots exists for linear models, and how can they be done in R? (links to articles of packages are also welcomed) So the boxcox function (from {MASS}) is an example of another useful diagnostic plot (and such an answer would be great), however, I am more curious about variations/extensions on existing default diagnostic plots for lm in R (although general other remarks on the topic are always welcomed). Here are some simple examples of what I mean: #Some example code for all of us to refer to set.seed(2542) x1 To plot the residuals vs each of the potential x plot(resid(fit)~x1); abline (h = 0) plot(resid(fit)~x2); abline (h = 0) # plot(resid(fit)~x1+x2) # you can also use this, but then you wouldn't be able to use the abline on any plot but the last one To add the the 0-1 line (how is this line called in English?!) to the qqplot so to see how much the qqline deviates from it plot(fit, which = 2); abline(0,1, col = "green") To plot the qq-plot using externally studentized residuals # plot(fit, which = 2); abline(0,1, col = "green") # The next command is just like this one qqnorm(rstandard(fit), ylim = c(-2.2,4.2)); qqline(rstudent(fit), lty = 2) ;abline(0,1, col = "green") qqnorm(rstudent(fit), ylim = c(-2.2,4.2)); qqline(rstudent(fit), lty = 2) ;abline(0,1, col = "green") # We can note how the "bad" points are more extreme when using the rstudent
