What is the difference between an Epoch and an Episode?

I am working on DQN and have confused myself with Epoch and Episode. I have gone through this answer but the confusion is increased. I will explain my scenario and would like to understand the difference through it if anyone could guide me better. Here is my scenario: I have written a DQN Agent with the following properties: class DQNAgent(nn.Module): def __init__(self, state_size, action_size): super().__init__() self.state_size = state_size self.action_size = action_size self.memory = deque(maxlen=2000) # print(f"self.memory {type(self.memory)}") self.gamma = 0.95 # discount rate self.epsilon = 1.0 # exploration rate self.epsilon_min = 0.01 self.epsilon_decay = 0.995 self.learning_rate = 0.001 self.model = self._build_model() def _build_model(self): # Neural Net for Deep-Q learning Model model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=4, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear')) model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(lr=self.learning_rate)) print(model.summary()) return model def memorize(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done): self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done)) print(f" action {action} reward {reward}") def act(self, state): if np.random.rand() self.epsilon_min: self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay Here is the way I am calling the Environment class: for episode in range(100): for time in range(500): call step function of gym.Env class if len(agent.memory) > batch_size: agent.replay(batch_size) memory_size=2000 batch_size=1024 I am confused with the epoch, time, and episode in my scenario. What I am getting is as follows: 1 Episode = 500-time slots So, 1 epoch will train on the data stored in replay memory after the completion of episode 1. When Episode 2 completes, it will train on the entire data it has stored inside the memory this time. And until the forward propagation and backward propagation does not complete on the data, it will keep iterating? Am I getting it right? I am just confused with the episode, time and epoch concept here.
