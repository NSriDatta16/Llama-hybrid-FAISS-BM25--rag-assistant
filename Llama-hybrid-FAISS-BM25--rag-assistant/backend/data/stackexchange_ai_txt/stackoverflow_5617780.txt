SELECT Max(ProductID), ProductName,thumb FROM tbproduct WHERE status =2 GROUP BY `CATEGORYID` ORDER BY ProductID DESC LIMIT 4 Does this not work? Not sure if this will help, see the updated query. See usage of Group-by Aggragate . Note: This will not reliably return other columns. Please look here for left-self-exclusion join
