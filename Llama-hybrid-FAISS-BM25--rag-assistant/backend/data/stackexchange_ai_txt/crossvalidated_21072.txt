Gaussian regression or Gaussian mean estimation are about the same from a risk point of view. If you consider (by sufficiency) a Gaussian observation $x\sim\mathcal{N}_p(\theta,I_p)$, the "best [unbiased]" estimator is $x$. Any Bayesian estimator based on a conjugate [normal] prior is of the form $\alpha\theta_0+(1-\alpha)x$. While those estimators are admissible (i.e. cannot be dominated uniformely), they are not minimax and, in fact, the maximum of the risk difference with the risk of $x$ [equal to $p$] is infinity. In addition, in dimension 4 or less, only generalised Bayes estimators (i.e. estimators associated with improper priors) can be minimax. (This was shown by William Strawderman in 1973.)
