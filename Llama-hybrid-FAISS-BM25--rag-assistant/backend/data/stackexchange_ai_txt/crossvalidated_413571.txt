The fit from the linear model is very different because it's a linear probability model, i.e. you're directly estimating $$ P(Y=1|X=x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ whereas in logistic regression you're modeling the log odds as a linear model $$ \log \left( \frac{P(Y=1|X=x)}{P(Y=0|X=x)} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ which is very different, i.e., the coefficient $\beta_1$ has a totally different meaning. Also, to clarify: you estimate the coefficients in a logistic regression model by maximum likelihood--i.e. by maximizing the binomial (actually Bernoulli) likelihood, not by solving a system of equations.
