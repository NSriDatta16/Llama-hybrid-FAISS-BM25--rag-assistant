This is a common property of object detectors such as Faster R-CNN: They predict every object several times. It is the job of a Non-maximum suppression function to filter out the duplicates. Loosely explained, the NMS takes couples of overlapping boxes having equal class, and if their overlap is greater than some threshold, only the one with higher probability is kept. This procedure continues until there are no more boxes with sufficient overlap. This minimum overlap ratio is one of the hyperparameters you can tune. The second hyperparameter you can tune is the threshold for the class probability (e.g. 70%). All the objects predicted with lower probability are simply ignored. Tuning these two hyperparameters should give you a satisfactory prediction quality.
