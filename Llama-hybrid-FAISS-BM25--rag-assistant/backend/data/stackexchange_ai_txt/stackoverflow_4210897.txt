Is it possible to use powershell to logon https site (secure http)

I have previously automated login process on a website before which uses http however the same code is not working for another website which is using https (secure protocol). so i am not sure whether i have to do some extra work to logon that website using powershell. EDIT: Adding code from comment $ie = New-Object -ComObject "internetExplorer.Application" $ie.Visible = $true $ie.Navigate("secure.websitename.com/xyz/login.aspx";) while ($ie.Busy -eq $true){Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 1000;} Write-Host -ForegroundColor Magenta "Attempting to login"; $doc = $ie.Document $LoginName = $doc.getElementsByName("txtUserName") $LoginName.value = "username" $txtPassword = $doc.getElementsByName("txtUserPass") $txtPassword = "password" $btnLogin = $doc.getElementsByName("cmdLogin")
