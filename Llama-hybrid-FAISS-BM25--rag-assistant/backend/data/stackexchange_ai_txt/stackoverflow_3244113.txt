How to retrieve part of the NSString * from NSString *

I want to ask an NSString * question. I have a NSString * object. The content is like the following example. (like the CSV file) Example: (my file is longer than this one so much) First Name,Last Name,Middle Name,Phone,Chan,Tim,Man,123-456-789,Tom,,,987-654-321 (if it is empty, no space between the ',') How can I use the objective C to storage different value by the NSArray * or NSMutableArray *? Thank you very much.
