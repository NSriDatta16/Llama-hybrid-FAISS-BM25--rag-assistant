Is there an established way to quantify the number of parameters in a random forest?

I'm interested in applying an F-test to random forest regression models I've trained. The formula for calculating an F-statistic (found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test ) requires values for $p_1$ and $p_2$ , where $p_2$ is the number of parameters of the unrestricted (random forest) model. I know this is pretty unconventional, but I was just wondering if anyone has suggestions as to how I could quantify $p_2$ rigorously given the nonparametric nature of random forest methods.
