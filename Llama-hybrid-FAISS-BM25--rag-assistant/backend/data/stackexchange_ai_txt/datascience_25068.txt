Tool for designing CNN architectures

I am currently building a (simple sequential) fully convolutional network for an object recognition task. Designing the architecture essentially amounts to choosing kernel size, stride and unit number for each layer. While doing this, I have to keep track of several properties of my layers: parameter count field of view of each kernel, wrt to the input/data a margin in the last layer that I need to account for when creating the label images I've written a small script that computes these quantities for different CNN configurations. It's not very complicated, butâ€¦ I'm under the impression that everyone using CNNs has to do this, so there should be a (graphical) tool for this. It could also be used to draw the fancy architecture diagrams. Because it works on the same input data. Is there such a tool? How do you compute these quantities for your models?
