Last-Modified not working for .htaccess

I'm tyring to implement browser caching and follow Google PageSpeed's recommendation about setting Last-Modified to a data that is "sufficiently far enough in the past." I have the following in my .htaccess: Header Set Last-Modified "Fri, 01 Jan 2010 12:00:00 GMT" I have mod_headers installed on my server. Unfortunately, Google PageSpeed still complains and warns me: Leverage browser caching The following cacheable resources have a short freshness lifetime. Specify an expiration at least one week in the future for the following resources: And then lists PNGs, GIFs, JPGs, etc. Yahoo YSlow says basically the same thing. Looking at the response headers of one of my resources that should be caching, I see this: Date: Tue, 19 Oct 2010 20:12:04 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) Last-Modified: Tue, 07 Sep 2010 23:51:33 GMT Etag: "2e0e34-2a43-48fb413a96a20" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 10819 Content-Type: image/png As you can see, the Last-Modified data does not match what I specified in .htaccess. Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
