Slow feature analysis ( SFA ) uses the smalles Eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of temporal differences to find the slowest features in a time series, Minor component analysis ( MCA ) uses the smallest components in a probabilistic setting--here, not directions of variations are found but constraints, Extreme component analysis ( XCA ) is a combination of probabilistic PCA and MCA, In Canonical Correlation Analysis (where you analyse the correlation btw two different data sets), the smaller components of the correlation matrix correspond to so called "private" spaces. These represent the subspaces of each variable which do not correlate linearly with each other.
