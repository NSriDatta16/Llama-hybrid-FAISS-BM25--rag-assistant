Simple test, accessing http://localhost:8000/hello?foo=bar#this-is-not-sent-to-server python -c "import SimpleHTTPServer;SimpleHTTPServer.test()" Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ... localhost - - [02/Jun/2009 12:48:47] code 404, message File not found localhost - - [02/Jun/2009 12:48:47] "GET /hello?foo=bar HTTP/1.1" 404 - The server receives the request without the #appendage - anything after the hash tag is simply an anchor lookup on the client. You can find the anchor name used within the URL via javascript using, as an example: alert(window.location.hash); The parse_url() function in PHP can work if you already have the needed URL string including the fragment ( http://codepad.org/BDqjtXix ): Output: fizzbuzz But I don't think PHP receives the fragment information because it's client-only.
