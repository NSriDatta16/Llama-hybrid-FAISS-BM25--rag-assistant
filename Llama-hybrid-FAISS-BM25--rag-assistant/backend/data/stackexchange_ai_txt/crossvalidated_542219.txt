How to visualize data from a test?

Context I have some data that would be obtained by conducting an assessment/test. The primary data is the score obtained by each candidate that would take the test which would also decide if the student passes the test. Data For each assessment, I have the: Passing Score Min Score (the lowest score obtained in the test) Max Score (the highest score obtained in the test) Total Score (the total of the scores of all questions; the maximum anyone can score in the test) Average Score For each candidate, I have the following data: Score Status ( Passed / Failed ) Also, the questions in the test have three difficulty levels( Easy , Medium and Hard ) because of which the score obtained by each candidate consists of the sum of scores they have obtained for each difficulty level. Problem I'm using a pie chart to show the percentages of students who have passed and failed the test. I'm also able to show the distribution of questions of the three difficulty levels as a bar chart showing the number of questions in each difficulty level. To visualize the scores, the only option I could find was a histogram. And I'm actually creating a dashboard summarizing a single assessment at a time for a web app. However, using a histogram has some limitations as many visualization libraries don't support it out of the box. I'm having to group the data manually into bins and then make a bar chart. Moreover, the scale of the test scores and the number of candidates per test is unpredictable and I'm new to data visualization. Is there a better alternative to visualize the scores other than histograms? Is it possible with a line chart? I don't necessarily need to show the frequencies like a histogram does, I'm just looking for a visualization that well summarizes the data. Using all the data I've specified here, it would be great if someone could suggest chart types/visualization techniques to represent this data and provide better insights.
