Nice name for `decorator' class?

I would like to separate the API I'm working on into two sections: 'bare-bones' and 'cushy'. The idea is that all method calls in the 'cushy' section could be expressed in terms of the ones in the 'bare-bones' section, that is, they would only serve as convenience methods for the quick-and-dirty. The reason I would like to do this is that very often when people are beginning to use an API for the first time, they are not interested in details and performance: they just want to get it working. Anybody tried anything similar before? I'm particularly interested in naming conventions and organizing the code.
