The Kruskal-Wallis test (generalization of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) is a special case of the proportional odds (PO) ordinal logistic regression model. You can use the the PO model to get any contrast you need, and even to get simultaneous confidence intervals. These effects are on the odds ratio scale. The R rms package orm , contrast.rms , and summary.rms functions make these easy to do.
