If your session cookie changes every page load, then likely you are not logging in correctly. But you could try forcing the JSESSIONID to be the same for each request. Construct your own cookie jar and tell WWW::Mechanize to use it: my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies->new(file => 'cookies', autosave => 1, ignore_discard => 1); my $agent = WWW::Mechanize->new(cookie_jar => $cookie_jar, autocheck => 0); The ignore_discard => 1 means that even session cookies are saved to disk (normally they are discarded for security reasons). Then, after logging in, call: $cookie_jar->save; Then, after each request: $cookie_jar->revert; # re-loads the save Alternately, you could sub-class HTTP::Cookies and override the set_cookie method to reject re-setting the session cookie if it already exists. Also I think the site requires a CERT (Well in the browser it does), would this be the correct way to add it? Some browsers (Internet Explorer for example) prompt for a security certificate even if one is not needed. If you are not getting any errors and the response content looks good, you probably don't need to set one. If you do have a certificate file, check the POD for Crypt::SSLeay . Your certificate is PEM0-encoded so yes, you want to set $ENV{HTTPS_CERT_FILE} to the path of your cert. You might want to set $ENV{HTTPS_DEBUG} = 1 to see what's happening.
