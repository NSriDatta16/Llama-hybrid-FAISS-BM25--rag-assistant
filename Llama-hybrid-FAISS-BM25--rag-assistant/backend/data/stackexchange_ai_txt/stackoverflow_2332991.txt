Check out http://www.williamsconcepts.com/ci/codeigniter/libraries/template/index.html Template is right for you if: You feel like using views can be clunky, especially when "embedding" views. You don't like calling header, footer, and other global views from every Controller method. You prefer having one "master template" that can be changed for any controller in order to meet unique application design needs. You don't want to drastically alter the way you interface controllers and views. You like clear, thorough documentation on par with CodeIgniter's User Guide.
