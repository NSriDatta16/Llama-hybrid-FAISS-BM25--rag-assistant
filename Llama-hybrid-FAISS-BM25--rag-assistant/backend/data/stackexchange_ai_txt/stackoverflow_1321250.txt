Creating Breadcrumbs structure from SQL Query

I am using SQL Query and below are the tables. Organization OrgID Name RAOGID RAOID SubGroupID 1 Org RAOG 1 NULL NULL 2 Org RAO NULL 1 NULL 3 Org Sub Group NULL NULL 1 RAOG RAOGID AccredID 1 2 RAO RAOID RAOGID 1 1 Sub Group SubGroupID RAOID 1 1 I have four tables as shown above, I need to make breadcrumb from above table’s structure, so I want to write query which will return the data in below format, please see below. RAOGID >> RAOID >> SubGroupID For example from above data my breadcrumb will be Org RAOG >> Org RAO >> Org Sub Group The “Organization” table contains all the IDs of ROAG, RAO and SubGroup, I need the query which will return the data in above format. One more functionality is required. I don't want to show the breadcrumb if there is no subgroupid so my breadcrumb will be Org RAOG >> Org RAO and there is no RAOID then there will be only one breadcrumd i.e. Org RAOG Thanks, Best Regards, Manoj
