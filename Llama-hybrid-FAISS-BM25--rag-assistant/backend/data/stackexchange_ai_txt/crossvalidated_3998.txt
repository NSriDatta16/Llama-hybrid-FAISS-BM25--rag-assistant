A few points: I'm not sure why that's happening. Clearly the POSIXlt slots are wrong. I typically use POSIXct unless I absolutely need to adjust the slots. One option is to use the dates directly rather than messing with the slots, and say and >= to subset. Something like ae[ae$date >= as.POSIXlt("2009-10-01") & ae$date You should consider using a time series for this, since that's the exact purpose of that data structure (and they provide many useful functions for dealing with data over time). One of the most common is zoo . xts also includes a number of functions that can help with this kind of thing.
