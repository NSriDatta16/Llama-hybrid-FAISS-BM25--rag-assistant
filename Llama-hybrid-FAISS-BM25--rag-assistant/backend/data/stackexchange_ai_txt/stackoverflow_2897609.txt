How can I unit test django messages?

In my django application, I'm trying to write a unit test that performs an action and then checks the messages in the response. As far as I can tell, there is no nice way of doing this. I'm using the CookieStorage storage method, and I'd like to do something similar to the following: response = self.client.post('/do-something/', follow=True) self.assertEquals(response.context['messages'][0], "fail.") The problem is, all I get back is a print response.context['messages'] How can I turn this into something useful, or am I doing it all wrong? Thanks, Daniel
