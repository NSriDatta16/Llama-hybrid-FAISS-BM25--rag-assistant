Out of sample ARCH forecast

I have estimated a conditional mean model for a time series: $ x_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ . Say I have estimated it using periods 1 to 10. I can do an out of sample conditional mean forecast by multiplying the estimated coefficients with the respective variable values of period 11, i.e. I can strictly out of sample forecast period 12. However, how do I do this with an ARCH model that is based on the conditional mean model mentioned above, i.e. a conditional variance model: $\epsilon^2_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \epsilon^2_{t-1}$ . Say I have estimated it using periods 1 to 10 again. If I again use this information in period 11 to generate a forecast in period 12, it is not strictly out of sample. This is because $\epsilon_{11}$ is based on the non out of sample conditional mean forecast for period 11 (it is not out of sample, because the forecast is partially based on data from period 10 to forecast for period 11, and period 10 is not out of sample). In other words: my first real "out of sample" ARCH-Model input is the squared error of the abovementioned out of sample conditional mean forecast. Hence, I can not provide an out of sample conditional variance for period 12. Is this correct? EDIT : By (strictly) out of sample I mean that the data used for forecasting is different than the data used for estimation.
