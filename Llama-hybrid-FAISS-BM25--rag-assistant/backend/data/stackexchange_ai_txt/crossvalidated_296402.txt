It's three time series , each plotting the status of a single machine over time. Instead of the value of each of the three series being indicated by a y-coordinate, it is indicated by one of three colors (as there are only three possible values of the machine status). Note that the choice of colors is not good: many humans possess a visual system that does not distinguish well between red and green wavelengths of light. Images that convey information with color should always take this into account. I recommend downloading an application that simulates color impairment.
