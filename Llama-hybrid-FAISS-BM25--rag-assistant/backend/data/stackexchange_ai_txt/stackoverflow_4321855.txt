I appreciate most of Google's contributions to the open source community and I'm sure it's got some cool stuff but overall I find Closure bulky, overwrought, and inelegant. If you must turn everything into Java I suppose it's downright spiffy. Edit: Fair enough. I didn't really compare. Closure is like a giant warehouse with every possible tool you could possibly want located... somewhere. Sort of like .NET or a massive Java library. Once you find what you need, you can find highly specific stuff that does highly specific jobs. And then for production you can remove all the cruft. JQuery on the other hand, is more of an easily modified sonic screwdriver.
