Let us do a simulation where we apply the test 1000 times for time series of length 120. > fun set.seed(111) > mc sum(mc So you get 39 cases out of 1000 for which the null is rejected if we assume threshold 0.05. This is perfectly normal. The test statistic is a random variable which has a distribution. This means that it can get values which are unlikely, or likely with small probability. We reject the null hypothesis when the value is unlikely, yet by doing this we commit Type I error .
