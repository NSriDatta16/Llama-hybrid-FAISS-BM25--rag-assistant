ANTS Profiler from RedGate is a really nice performance profiler. dotTrace Profiler from JetBrains is also great. These tools will allow you to see performance metrics that can be drilled down the each individual line. Scree shot of ANTS Profiler: ANTS http://www.red-gate.com/products/ants_profiler/images/app/timeline_calltree3.gif If you want to ensure that a specific method stays within a specific performance threshold during unit testing, I would use the Stopwatch class to monitor the execution time of a method one ore many times in a loop and calculate the average and then Assert against the result.
