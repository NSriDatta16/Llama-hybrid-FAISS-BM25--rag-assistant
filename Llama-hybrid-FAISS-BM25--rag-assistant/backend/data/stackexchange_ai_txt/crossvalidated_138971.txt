SOM dimension doubt

I'm currently working on a research of data clustering using an ANN for self-organizing maps. I'm performing experiments using Matlab, over a Dataset of 20,000 samples and almost 80 variables. The ANN requieres to set up a "one or two dimensional lattice", which is used to place neurons at each node. this map's function is to transform an arbitrary signal (with n dimensions) into a discrete representation with topological order. I haven't found yet a rational criteria to select a lattice with one or two dimensions, it's worth noting that a node does not represent necessarilly a cluster because you can group a set of nodes in one cluster (it depends on how close are each other). Does anybody knows a good criteria to set up the lattice? Greetings!
