I suspect you want a deeper answer, and I'll have to let someone else provide that, but I can give you some thoughts on ridge regression from a loose, conceptual perspective. OLS regression yields parameter estimates that are unbiased (i.e., if such samples are gathered and parameters are estimated indefinitely, the sampling distribution of parameter estimates will be centered on the true value). Moreover, the sampling distribution will have the lowest variance of all possible unbiased estimates (this means that, on average, an OLS parameter estimate will be closer to the true value than an estimate from some other unbiased estimation procedure will be). This is old news (and I apologize, I know you know this well), however, the fact that the variance is lower does not mean that it is terribly low . Under some circumstances, the variance of the sampling distribution can be so large as to make the OLS estimator essentially worthless. (One situation where this could occur is when there is a high degree of multicollinearity.) What is one to do in such a situation? Well, a different estimator could be found that has lower variance (although, obviously, it must be biased, given what was stipulated above). That is, we are trading off unbiasedness for lower variance. For example, we get parameter estimates that are likely to be substantially closer to the true value, albeit probably a little below the true value. Whether this tradeoff is worthwhile is a judgment the analyst must make when confronted with this situation. At any rate, ridge regression is just such a technique. The following (completely fabricated) figure is intended to illustrate these ideas. This provides a short, simple, conceptual introduction to ridge regression. I know less about lasso and LAR, but I believe the same ideas could be applied. More information about the lasso and least angle regression can be found here , the "simple explanation..." link is especially helpful. This provides much more information about shrinkage methods. I hope this is of some value.
