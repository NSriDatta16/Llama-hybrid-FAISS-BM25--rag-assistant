The plain and simple is if you love what you are doing, the energy will be there to achieve what you need to do. Even though the team might be working on different projects at the time, spending a lunch together, having a chat, or morning scrum meetings as to where you are, and what is happering your performace, can greatly increse productivity. You will be amazed at what you think you have no idea of fixing/sorting, that your fellow rpogrammer might have read an article about, or have heard a discussion. All in all, the passion you have for what you do, will mostly dictate the end result You might find that as a coder, on these days without fire, you might have some other encouraging task, just that needed completing, that there was no time for. When you get to the stage where you feel you have been stuck to long, step back, take a beak(lunch/coffee) and work on something interesting. We do this on Fridays. Fridays is our day for working in concepts (that management might not accept) but we know will make life better, or seems like a nice to have. The rest of the week is grinding X-) Simple pratices would be to set yourself reasonable goals/timelines to meat. Also a good thing to do is in these standup meating that you have, developers should brag about something really good they did this week, and a small prize should be given to the developer that wins that week. Let say a round of drinks. As lead, you might consider spreading the prize so that no developer feels that they are always last. No team member wants to be the burden.
