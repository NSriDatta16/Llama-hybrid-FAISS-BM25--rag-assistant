Do we need to scale our features before applying ICA, like in PCA?

I am reasonably certain that we don't need to scale data before applying ICA, like we do for the PCA. In PCA we do this because it assumes normal distribution of the features, and in ICA we don't impose such a requirement. Is that a correct line of thought?
