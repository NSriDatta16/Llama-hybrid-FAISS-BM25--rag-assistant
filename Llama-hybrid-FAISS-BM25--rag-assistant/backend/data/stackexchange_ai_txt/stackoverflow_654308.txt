Java naming clash between method variable and package names

I have some classes generated from WSDL files by the Axis Framework. In one of these classes, there is a generated method public com.initechsystems.www.initech7.initechbo.Organization createOrganization(com.initechsystems.www.initech7.initechbo.Organization org) throws java.rmi.RemoteException { //(... snip ...) _call.setProperty(org.apache.axis.client.Call.SEND_TYPE_ATTR, Boolean.FALSE); //(... snip ...) } The variable name org in the method parameter creates a naming clash with package org.apache.axis.client, as the compiler cannot differentiate between the package and variable. I realize I can fix this easily by changing the variable name org in the method, but I would like to avoid this, because it slows down the workflow. Is there some way around this other than either modifying the WSDL file or the generated classes? Compiler error: D:\projects\java\initechdir\target\generated-sources\axistools\wsdl2java\com\initechsystems\www\initech7\initechws\OrganizationManagement\OrganizationManagementSoapStub.java:[1678,29] cannot find symbol symbol : variable apache location: class com.initechsystems.www.initech7.initechbo.Organization
