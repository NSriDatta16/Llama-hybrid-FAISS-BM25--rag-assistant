Explanation of the proof that SCAD penalty has the oracle property

I am trying to understand the proof that the SCAD has the oracle property. Could you help me with an explanation and a full break down of the steps, so that I can understand it? I'm unclear on how exactly it is shown that SCAD has the oracle property. I'm new to the concept of oracle, and I don't understand the steps of the proof or how it was done. I was hoping to get an explanation on that or a break down of the proof. And if there are other alternative ways or easier ways to show it, i would be interested in learning about them. I was referred to the original Fan and Li paper: https://fan.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf5476/files/documents/penlike.pdf And this paper by Huang and Xie: arxiv.org/abs/0709.0863 this is the definition of oracle property: An estimator $\hat{\beta}$ has the oracle property if there exists a sequence $\lambda_{\text{n}}$ such that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(\hat{\beta} = \hat{\beta}_{\text{O}}) = 1.$$ I'm new to this platform, before closing the question please specifically tell me what to improve in the question and provide me with the chance and some time to make the corrections. it's quite discouraging to see the question closed since i have been working on this problem for a while.
