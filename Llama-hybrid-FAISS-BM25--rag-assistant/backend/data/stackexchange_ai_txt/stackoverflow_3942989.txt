XCode - move files from one folder to another in a SCM aware way?

I have an XCode project in SVN. I would like to relocate some files from one physical directory to another but can't seem to find a way to do this in XCode. If I do the move in XCode it simply moves the file references from one Group folder to the next, without changing their location on disk. If I move the files in Organizer - well Organizer seems to be SVN unaware as Ive just spent the afternoon manually unwinding the move so that I can do a check in. At the moment my only option(s) seem to be: 1. lots of svn command line mojo, or 2. do a checkout on windows where TortiseSVN can be used to do all kinds of stuff (But then my XCode project will be all confused). I'm really hoping ive missed something...
