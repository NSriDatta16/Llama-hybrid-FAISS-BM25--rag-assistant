Use ML to predict rule based model's output

We have a legacy rule based model as a binary classier (0 vs 1). We want to replace it with a ML model. This rule based model uses only 4 features (age, race, gender, salary) and output 0/1. We have 20 extra features. So in total there are 24 features for 10 M unlabelled data points. Here is our planned process: Use this rule based model to generate label for this 10 M data points (using only 4 features) Use ML models( like RF/logistic regression) to train on these data. The ML model will use 20+4 features to try to predict the label generated by rule based model Questions: Will this ML model has any chance to outperform the rule based model? Will it be able to "extrapolate" from label generated by rule based model? Or will it just use the extra 20 features to add noise? Any document / site discussing about this approach?
