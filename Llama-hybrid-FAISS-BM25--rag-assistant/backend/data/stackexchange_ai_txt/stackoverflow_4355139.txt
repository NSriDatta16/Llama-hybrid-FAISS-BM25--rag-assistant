Have a look at how the filter chain works - can you find a point where the response has been sent but execution is still running? If so, you should be able to add your own filter to the chain at this point. Not sure this'll quite do what you want though - don't think the browser will see it as finished, so the spinner will keep going even if content has loaded and is shown, and won't it delay document.ready etc? The sfStorage classes use shutdown stuff i think - might be worth looking at what they do.
