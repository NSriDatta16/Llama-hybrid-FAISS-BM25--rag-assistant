How do I determine the efficacy of a ranking metric?

I have a dataset where I am attempting to perform a classification task. At present only 15% of the data is a positive class. I believe with some feature engineering I've been able to generate a ranking system with the hypothesis, the higher in the ranking system the more likely it is to be in the positive class. To evaluate it I've taken the first 30 and last 30 in the rank and done a ratio of positive to negative class for each and compared the two, expecting the first 30 to have a significantly higher ratio and certainly above 0.15. I was wondering whether anyone had a better/more precise way if there is a genuine signal here.
