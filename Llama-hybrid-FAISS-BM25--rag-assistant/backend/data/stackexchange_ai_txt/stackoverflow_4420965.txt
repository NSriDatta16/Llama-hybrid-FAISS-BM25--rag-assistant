extending XML with unknown elements

Suppose I have a XML schema and want to support some extensions at several nodes. An extension should be valid XML within these nodes. I know this might be implemented with the element in you schema. However In my XML that uses my schema I want this extension to only use nodes from an other XSD. So specifying the Schema of the extension at runtime and then being able to validate this extension against the extension schema. The following example uses a static extension schema: Now I want to specify this schema in my XML, for example (I'am a newbie), like this: Hello, World! What is the best approach for this? Ideally I want to have a list in my XML of the schema's I use in the extension nodes of my XML. Thanks! == Edited, more detailed explanation: == I want to support user defined XML data within specific nodes. I don't know the schema of these extension during the writing of my "master" schema. I have specified the following fragment in my XSD: And want to use the following XML: Hello, world! Now I do want an parser error because element that is not valid.
