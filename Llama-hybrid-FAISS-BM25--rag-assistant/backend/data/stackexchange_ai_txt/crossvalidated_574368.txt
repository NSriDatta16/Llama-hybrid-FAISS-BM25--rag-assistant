This paper Bayesian analysis of mixture models with an unknown number of componentsâ€”an alternative to reversible jump methods by Matthew Stephens is somewhat along those lines However, our approach appears the more natural and elegant in this context, exploiting the natural nested structure of the models and exchangeability of the mixture components. As a result we remove the need for calculation of a complicated Jacobian, reducing the potential for making algebraic errors It's a bit more complicated than your setting -- the full conditional for $k$ isn't available so $k$ is modified by a birth-death process
