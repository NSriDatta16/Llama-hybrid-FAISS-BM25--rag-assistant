It appears that a standard approach is to compute the average of the softmax scores from a few forward passes (which is an estimator for $\mathbb{E}[f(y|x)]$ ), select the class $y^*$ which gives the highest average, and then pick the standard deviation of the softmax scores for class $y^*$ from those forward passes. In other words, the uncertainty score for $x$ is (a finite-sample estimate for): $$U(x) = \text{Var}[f(y^*|x)]^{1/2}, \text{ where } y^* = \arg\max_y \mathbb{E}[f(y|x)].$$
