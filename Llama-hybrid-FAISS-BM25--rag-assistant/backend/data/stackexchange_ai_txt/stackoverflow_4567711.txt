want to create a data warehouse... new database or just pile the tables into the existing database?

So I've got a MySQL database for an web community that is a potential stats goldmine. Currently I'm serving stats built via all sorts of nasty queries on my well-normalized database. I've run into the "patience limit" for such queries on my shared hosting, and would like to move to data warehousing and a daily cron job, thereby sacrificing instant updates for a 100-fold increase in statistical depth. I've just started reading about data warehouses, and particularly the star schema, and it all seems pretty straight-forward. My question essentially is - should I toss all that crap into a new database, or just pile the tables into my existing MySQL database? The current database has 47 tables, the largest of which has 30k records. I realize this is paltry compared to your average enterprise application, but your average enterprise application does not (I hope!) run on shared-hosting! So, keeping my hardware limits in mind, which method would be better? I really don't know much about this at all, but I assume reading Table A, calculating, then updating Table B is a lot easier in the same database than across databases, correct? Should I even care how many tables my DB has?
