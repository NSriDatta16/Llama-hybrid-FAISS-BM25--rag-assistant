The proper way to read hdf5 files from C is to use the hdf5 API - see this tutorial . In principal it is possible to directly read the raw data from the hdf5 file as you would with the .npy file, assuming you have not used advanced storage options such as compression in your hdf5 file. However this essentially defies the whole point of using the hdf5 format and I cannot think of any advantage to doing this instead of using the proper hdf5 API. Also note that the API has a simplified high level version which should make reading from C relatively painless.
