Random forests are notorious for overfitting. Univariate screening of variables before running RF is not at all appropriate. RF (which requires enormous sample sizes to be successful) requires access to all of the candidate predictors. Univariate screening may be used because of a perception of helping with overfitting but it just makes things works and can result in missing predictors that are important only after adjusting for other predictors. Looking at class imbalance is not appropriate but may be indicating to us that you are using a discontinuous accuracy scoring rule such as proportion "classified" "correctly". Use probabilities of class membership and associated proper accuracy scores. Ill effects of univariate screening are even worse if this screening was not repeated afresh at each cross-validation step.
