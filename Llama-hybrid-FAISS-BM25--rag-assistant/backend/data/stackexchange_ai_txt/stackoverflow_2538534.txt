I disagree with sanitizing the data for storage in controller, and think the best place is to do it in model, as controller should not know how the data is stored, but sanitizing needs that knowledge (e.g. mysql_real_escape_string() for storing a MySql vs. pg_escape_string() for PostgresQL, or maybe checking for valid XML if stored in an XML file, or something else for different storage mechanisms). To prevent things like cross site scripting, do not sanitize the data before storing, as you may have some legitimate use for some html tags later on, and do that (ideally) in view or in controller.
