What is the iPad user agent?

From what I gather, the iPad is using iPhone OS, but with a different screen resolution from the iPhone and iPod touch. So many sites may have to change their user agent detection to adapt to the iPad. So, can anyone with access to the iPad or the iPad SDK give us the user-agent string?
