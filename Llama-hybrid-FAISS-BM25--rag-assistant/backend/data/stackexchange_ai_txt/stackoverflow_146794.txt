Any way to un-register a WPF dependency property?

I'm running into an unusual problem in my unit tests. The class I'm testing creates a dependency property dynamically at runtime and the type of that dependency property can vary depending on the circumstances. While writing my unit tests, I need to create the dependency property with different types and that leads to errors because you can't redefine an existing dependency property. So is there any way to either un-register a dependency property or to change the type of an existing dependency property? Thanks! OverrideMetadata() only lets you change a very few things like default value so it isn't helpful. The AppDomain approach is a good idea and might work but seems more complicated than I really wanted to delve into for the sake of unit testing. I never did find a way to unregister a dependency property so I punted and carefully reorganized my unit tests to avoid the issue. I'm getting a bit less test coverage, but since this problem would never occur in a real application and only during unit testing I can live with it. Thanks for the help!
