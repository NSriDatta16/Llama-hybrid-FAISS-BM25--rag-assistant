Estimating Markov Switching Probit

I attempt to fit the following probit model to a time series where we observe the binary variable $R_{t}$ and another variable $X_{t}$, a latent unobserved variable $y^{*}_{t}$ and a state variable $s_{t}$: $$ y^{*}_{t} = -c_{0t} -c_{1t}\,X_{t-k} + u_{t} $$ where u_{t} is (0,1) normally distributed and $R_{t} = 1$ if $y^{*}_{t} \le 0$ and $R_{t} = 0$ otherwise. $c_{it}$ depends on the current state $s_{t}$ which can take either 0 or 1 values, such that $$ P(R_{t} = 1 | s_{t}, X_{t-k}) = N(c_{0t} +c_{1t}\,X_{t-k}) $$ See for example this paper page 47. Now my problem is that I do not find any derivation of how to estimate the parameters. It should be straightforward and easy to solve, but I do not find anything related to probit but only (vector) autoregressions with Markov switching. Any ideas?
