Your stylesheet does not output HTML but rather an XHTML fragment, and that in a way (with qualified names) that you need to serve it as application/xml to a browser (like Mozilla, Opera, Safari, IE 9, but not IE 6-8) that understands that content type. So make sure you do something like header('Content-Type: application/xml'); before sending the content to the browser. Or drop any XHTML namespace and any prefixes from the result elements, then the XSLT stylesheet outputs an HTML fragment many more browsers can parse and understand as text/html and render it as you want.
