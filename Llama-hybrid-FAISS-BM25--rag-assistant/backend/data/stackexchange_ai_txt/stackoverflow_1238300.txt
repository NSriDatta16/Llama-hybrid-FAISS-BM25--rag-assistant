What are some "zen" moments of code commenting that you have created or reviewed?

I am looking for examples of reasonably short, but reasonably complicated segments of code (objects, functions, classes, a particular set of variable names, etc) that strike that perfect zen like balance of self documentation and implementation elegance. It could either be something you are really proud of or something that you came across and experienced an "Aha!" moment of enlightenment. Some potential criteria (not all need to be met in a single example): Sparse and Focused Self evident. Perhaps so clearly written that even a non programmer could understand what you are trying to do, even if they don't understand the syntax or implementation details. Manifestly Useful (has multiple use cases, e.g. a sorting algorithm, handy recursive method, etc.) Clever Enlightening Production quality and functional (e.g. not pseudo code) I am looking for an example snippet followed by a brief commentary of what makes the code special. Of course the best examples will require minimal additional commentary because they are well documented. Note to moderators: I am new to stackoverflow, so if this question is somehow not appropriate or must be closed, can you provide an explanation of where it runs afoul of stackoverflow's norms? I am not intending to waste people's time. The goal of this question it to learn good commenting practices through examples provided and rated by the community.
