To safely use strncpy, one must either (1) manually stick a null character onto the result buffer, (2) know that the buffer ends with a null beforehand, and pass (length-1) to strncpy, or (3) know that the buffer will never be copied using any method that won't bound its length to the buffer length. It's important to note that strncpy will zero-fill everything in the buffer past the copied string, while other length-limited strcpy variants will not. This may at some cases be a performance drain, but in other cases be a security advantage. For example, if one used strlcpy to copy "supercalifragilisticexpalidocious" into a buffer and then to copy "it", the buffer would hold "it^ercalifragilisticexpalidocious^" (using "^" to represent a zero byte). If the buffer gets copied to a fixed-sized format, the extra data might tag along with it.
