Think a little about this - and you understand that this can not be done: Interfaces are like a contact. all the public fields of the interface are parts of the contact. So, you can't hide them in a subclass... What would happen if someone were to upcast your class object to the interface's type ? You'd probably want to change your design - may be split your interface in to two interfaces? or and interface and an abstract class? we need more details to know...
