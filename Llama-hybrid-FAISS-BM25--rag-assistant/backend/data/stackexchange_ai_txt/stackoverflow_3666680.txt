What's the correct way to store an object in a Model property?

I need to store a Django template object in a Model property. My solution so far has been to pickle the object before assigning it to a BlobProperty : entity.template_blob = pickle.dumps(template) entity.put() And then after a fetch from the datastore, I do : template = pickle.loads(entity.template_blob) Am I doing this wrong ? I couldn't find a property suited to the storage of any object.
