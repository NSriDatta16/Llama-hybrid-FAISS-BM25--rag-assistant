Increasing the clarity in the tasks of image generation using CNN

What methods exist to improve the quality of generated images and the clarity of contours in the tasks of image denoising/debluring (using CNN), style transfer etc? I am interested in approaches that don't change network architecture and dataset (maybe special loss function?). Are there any articles devoted to this problem?
