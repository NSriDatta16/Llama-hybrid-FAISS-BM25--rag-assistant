Indexing will solve 90% of your problems. Finding one unique element out of a million in a binary tree will require traversing only 30 nodes (0.003% of the total number of records). Depending on the data, you could make aggregation tables. So if you were recording a statistic and sampled every 5 minutes, you could simply aggregate the data into a table with each row representing an average reading over a period of an hour, a day, and so on.
