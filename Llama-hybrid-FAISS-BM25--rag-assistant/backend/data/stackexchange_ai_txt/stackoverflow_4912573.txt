NetLogo not creating turtles in random intervals

I'm trying to create a procedure in NetLogo to create a turtle agent every 0-60 seconds. Using the following code and then running the procedure in a loop, it appears that the random generator is not working. The graph plot (agents to ticks) is linear. to go every random 60 [crt 1 [ set xcor random 20 - 10 set ycor random 20 - 10 ] ] plot count turtles end But if I were to do: to go every 2 [crt 1 [ set xcor random 20 - 10 set ycor random 20 - 10 ] ] plot count turtles end It seems to work as expected. Every 2 seconds a new turtle gets created. Am I doing something wrong?
