PERMANOVA test and its assumptions

I have collected data based on a 5 point Likert scale (very low, low, neutral, high, very high) on factors considered by individuals before making investment decisions. There are five factors (D.Vs) influencing investment decisions. I am interested in knowing whether there is a significant difference in preference level of male and female (IVs) for the above said factors. Number of males is 252 and of females is 98. I have applied Permutational Manova in adonis function of R, since data are ordinal in nature, and the result is not significant. I have read that the permutation test is non-parametric. Does for the permutation test equality of variance is highly important. Also the computation of mean, SD and variance are discouraged by many scholars for ordinal data. Can you throw some light on the permutation test and its assumptions and on violations of those?
