The task you are looking for is called machine translation quality estimation or sometimes reference-free evaluation (there is a nuanced difference in evaluation, cf. Results of the WMT21 Metrics Shared Task ). You can search for tools for that. If you work with languages that appear in the annual WMT competition , the best choice is the COMET score ( paper ). It is based on the XLM-R model, so it might work reasonably well also for other languages. Alternatively, BERTScore ( paper ) based on mBERT or XLM-R might also get reasonable results.
