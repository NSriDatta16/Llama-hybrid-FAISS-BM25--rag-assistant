This worked for me: Login to your iPhone provisioning portal through https://developer.apple.com Add the UDID in devices Go back to Xcode, open up the Organizer and select "Provisioning Profiles", ensure that "Automatic Device Provisioning" is checked on the top right pane, then click on the "Refresh" button, and magically all your devices set in the provisioning portal will be automatically added.
