Over the past few decades, at least a dozen papers have explored variations on the Dirichlet featuring more complex interactions among the dimensions than the original. As Ian R. James and James E. Mosimann showed in A New Characterization of the Dirichlet Distribution Through Neutrality , the original Dirichlet maximizes the independence among the dimensions through "complete neutrality", such that removal of some dimensions always leaves the relative proportions among the remaining dimensions unaffected. Since you are interested in modeling more complex interactions among your four dimensions, I would recommend that you consult David D. K. Chow's superb unifying overview of the various ways that the Dirichlet has been generalized . Chow explains: Through a special mixture distribution based on the Schlomilch integral, we shall provide a unified framework for several distributions appearing in the literature. Special cases include the G3D generalized Dirichlet distribution [17] or scaled Dirichlet distribution [18], the shifted-scaled Dirichlet distribution [19] or simplicial generalized beta distribution [20], the flexible Dirichlet distribution [21], and the tilted Dirichlet distribution [22]. In a similar manner, we shall also obtain a family of distributions that includes the Concrete or Gumbel-softmax distribution [23, 24]. By including additional parameters, these generalizations of the Dirichlet distribution allow for behaviours that the Dirichlet distribution itself cannot model, for example positive covariances Cov(Xi , Xj ). Chow makes good on his claim to organize and unify the whole Dirichlet family through helpful charts like this: While I don't pretend to understand all the details, Chow provides an invaluable framework within which to compare different ways to add parameters and induce the kinds of interactions about which you are inquiring. I hope you find it as useful as I did when trying to make sense of the various generalizations of the Dirichlet that have been proposed. The book Dirichlet and Related Distributions: Theory, Methods and Applications by Kai Wang Ng, Guo-Liang Tian, and Man-Lai Tang also devotes chapters to some of these variations, but does not tie them together as nicely as Chow.
