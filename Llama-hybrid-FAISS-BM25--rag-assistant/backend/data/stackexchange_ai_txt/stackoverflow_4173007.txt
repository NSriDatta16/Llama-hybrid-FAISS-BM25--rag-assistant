If the entire string, including the reference to the image, is handed off for localization, then any qualified translator will be able to position the image in the appropriate place in the sentence. For instance, if I received this sentence to translate: Click New button [icon here] to begin creating your first thing in this area. in German I would write: Klicken Sie auf die Schaltflaeche 'Neu' [icon here], um das erste Element zu erstellen. whereby [icon here] is the reference to the image. Any qualified translator will know where to place the image reference so it makes sense in the respective target language context. On the other hand, if you're concatenating the string at runtime from two different sentence fragments whereby the word order Subject - Object - Infinitive Phrase is hard-coded, translators will complain because word order is dependent on the syntax of the target language. If you're going to be doing this a lot, researching general internationalization and localization issues would be advisable because people have been dealing with these things for over 20 years now and many issues already have well-defined answers. Good luck.
