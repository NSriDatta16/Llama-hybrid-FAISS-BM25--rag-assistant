Elastic net parameters tuning

My goal is time series forecasting. I have several external regressors as : promo budget, discount percent etc. I want to determine alpha and lambda parameters for elasticnet model. How can i do this? Common k-fold CV is not appropriate because i have deal with time series. Should i do something like CV for time series (rolling origin), but in this case what should i choose as a measure of model quality?
