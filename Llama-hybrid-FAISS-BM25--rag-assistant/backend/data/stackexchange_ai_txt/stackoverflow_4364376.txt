I'm assuming you use html and javascript on the client. If you want to save a client's job you must do somekind of serverside work. Maybe save in a database or for a project that is only visible to you, you can save in a xml file. However all these functions must take place in the server as javascript is client side scripting not allowing disk operations. And the last that i can think of is to use cookies for temporary storage.
