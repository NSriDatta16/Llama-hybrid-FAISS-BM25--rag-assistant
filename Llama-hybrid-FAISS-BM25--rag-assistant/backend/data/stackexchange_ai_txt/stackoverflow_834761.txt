That's a way to do it. In my application we either use drag-and-drop, or have one up arrow and one down arrow to move the selected element up/down. If you have some property determining the sort order, when the user clicks the up arrow you just need to permutate the current element's sort position with the previous element's sort position, unless it's the first element (do nothing in that case). Use the reverse logic for the down arrow... Edit: If your items don't have a sort position yet, you could just go through your list and assign a sort position from 1 to n. In case of a deleted row, decrease the sort position of all following items by one.
