Comparison of 12 measurements in 2019 and 12 measurements in 2020 of the number of individuals in a facility. What is the best method?

I need to compare attendance measurements within the same facility, taken each last day of the month in the year 2019 and the year 2020. So I have 12 measurements in 2019 e 12 measurements in 2020. The question I am trying to answer is whether there was a significant reduction in the average number of individuals present within the facility in 2020. Is it a paired t.test sufficient to answer this question or a non parametric test like Wilcoxon Mann Whitney would be better? Or am I completely off the track? Thanks in advance. As maybe you can tell I am new to the field of statistics, so you will forgive a basic question. These are the data month 2019 2020 Jan 778 871 Feb 787 891 Mar 818 781 Apr 803 690 May 827 656 Jun 855 674 Jul 853 706 Aug 842 822 Sep 855 735 Oct 879 722 Nov 870 731 Dec 851 671
