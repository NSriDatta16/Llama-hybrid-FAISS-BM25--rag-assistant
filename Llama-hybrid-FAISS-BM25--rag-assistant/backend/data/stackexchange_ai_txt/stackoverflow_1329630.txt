What are the use cases that make COM shine? Interop between different languages (e.g. C++ and Visual Basic) Interop between different processes (e.g. OLE, embedding an Excel spreadsheet in a Word document) Interop between different vendors (e.g. if you want to write a shell extension which plugs-in to Windows Explorer, you do that using COM because Explorer declares a COM interface for extensions which it's willling to invoke).
