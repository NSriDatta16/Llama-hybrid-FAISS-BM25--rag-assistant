Is there a class that we can use to host both window form and controls?

I am trying to build an application that has a container as the workspace. In this workspace, I can drag and drop windows form and controls. I have get the panel drag and drop working, but I can host window in it. Please let me know if there is such a container class ready for use. I am using visual studio 2008 and c# Thanks
