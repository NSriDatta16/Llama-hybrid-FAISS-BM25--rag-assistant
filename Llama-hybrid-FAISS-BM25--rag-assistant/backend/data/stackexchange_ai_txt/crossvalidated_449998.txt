How to convert VAE L2 Reconstruction Loss to a Log Likelihood

I have been puzzled trying to convert MSE to Log Likelihood in VAEs. Relevant Questions: What is bits per dimension (bits/dim) exactly (in pixel CNN papers)? Why is mean squared error the cross-entropy between the empirical distribution and a Gaussian model? Relevant Discussion: Reddit: [Discussion] Calculation of bits/dims In the paper: Masked Autoregressive Flow for Density Estimation They provide a formula from going from "Pixel space" to logit space, but I don't understand the logic behind it. They normalize the pixel values and then multiply by some hyper parameter that is chosen arbitrarily. They then derive this formula: For which it is not clear if $x_i$ is an image in the dataset/batch or a pixel of image $x_i$ (most likely the later one but still unsure) For which $x_i$ is a pixel value of image x. But it is not clear what is p(x) for my VAE trained on MSE.
