Multi-country model or single model

I am working on a ML model to be deployed in a product operating in many countries. The issue that I am having is the following: should I train one model and serve it for all countries? train a model per country and serve each model in its country? I've faced this problem several times, and to me, there's a trade-off in the learning: in the first case, the model has more data to learn, and it'll be more robust (also, the solution is simpler). In the second case, I'll have a more tailored model to each country, and will be able to see effects that are specific to that country. I'm very interested in knowing if there's an intermediate solution - a general model with some country-specific fine-tuning that can see all the data but also specialize in each specific country. If I were to use Neural Networks, this fine-tuning is natural - you train some epochs with all the data, then the last epochs with each specific country. I am wondering if something similar can be done in Linear regression models and Xgboost, which are the models I generally use. Is there any literature on this? I think it is kind of a generic topic and there should be some.
