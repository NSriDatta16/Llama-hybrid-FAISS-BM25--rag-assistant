What underlying code is it trying to run that Firefox 3 won't support? Is it just using a bad agent sniffer? that can't handle v3? The only thing I've encountered in v3 that isn't handled as nice as v2, is the ability to call .focus() on non-form elements. It worked better in v2, v3 seems to have some issues.
