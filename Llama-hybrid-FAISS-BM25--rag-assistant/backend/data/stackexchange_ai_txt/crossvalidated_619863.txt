I used the meanwhile excellent facility in SPSS28 to impute data. If one runs five rounds of imputations, this multiplies the data set fivefold. One gets a new variable qualifying each data set. To pool the data according to Rubin's rule, this multiplied data set needs to be restructured by sorting it according to Participant ID. This gives five lines for each participant. When restructuring the long data set into a wide format, SPSS thankfully eliminates surplus variables but numbers the imputed variables which can then be averaged. Voila.
