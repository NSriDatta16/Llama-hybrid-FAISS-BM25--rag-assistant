PCM Wave file - stereo to mono

I have an audio file which is stereo. Is converting it to mono just a case of skipping every other byte (after the header)? It's encoded in 16bit signed PCM format. I've got javax.sound.sampled available. Here's code I tried that didn't work: WaveFileWriter wfw = new WaveFileWriter(); AudioFormat format = new AudioFormat(Encoding.PCM_SIGNED, 44100, 16, 2, 2, 44100, false); AudioFormat monoFormat = new AudioFormat(Encoding.PCM_SIGNED, 44100, 16, 1, 2, 44100, false); byte[] audioData = dataout.toByteArray(); int length = audioData.length; ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(audioData); AudioInputStream stereoStream = new AudioInputStream(bais,format,length); AudioInputStream monoStream = new AudioInputStream(stereoStream,format,length/2); wfw.write(monoStream, Type.WAVE, new File(Environment. getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath()+"/stegDroid/un-ogged.wav")); This code is used after reading a .ogg file using Jorbis to convert it to PCM data. The only problem is the result is stereo and I need it to be mono, so if there's another solution I'm happy to hear it!
