With XGBoost you can come up with your own loss and metric. It is relatively simple to just add a custom loss. However, I have no experiance with problems described by you, so you would need to see if what you have in mind will fit into the standard XGB. Find an implementation of custom loss (R) here: https://github.com/Bixi81/R-ml/blob/master/xgboost_custom_objective_fair_loss.R
