Uninformative Parameters and Model Selection Using Akaike’s Information Criterion. Journal of Wildlife Management Aurr et al 2010. A protocol for data exploration to avoid common statistical problems. Methods in Ecology and Evolution Symonds and Moussalli 2011. A brief guide to model selection, multimodel inference and model averaging in behavioural ecology using Akaike’s information criterion
