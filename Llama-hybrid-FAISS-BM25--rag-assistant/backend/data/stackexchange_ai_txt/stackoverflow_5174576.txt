default.aspx is in a subfolder, use it as startpage on www.mysite.com

I have a problem. The structure for my website looks something like this. root web.config root|aspx|anonymous|default.aspx root|aspx|members|members.aspx root|images|.png root|includes|css I really dont know if this is the best way to organize.. But since i use roles and the membership provider i want to keep control of the users. Now to the problem, adress to my website is www.mysite.com and if i put the "default.aspx" directly in the root folder everything works fine. But as it is now the users has to enter www.mysite.com/aspx/anonymous/default.aspx to access the startpage. This is logical since it is where my "default.aspx" is located. But i want to know if i can somehow redirect users comming to www.mysite.com to the real "startpage" www.mysite.com.. And yes default.aspx is SET to be startpage in my VS project.
