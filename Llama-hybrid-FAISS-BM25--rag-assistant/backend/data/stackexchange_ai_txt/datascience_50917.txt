Selection of Features and Data in Random Forest

First, I am confused whether at each node in all the trees, do we randomly pick features from the lot to be pitted for best split or does each tree get a random subset of feature and then all the nodes in that tree have to work with those features? Now, regardless of the case whether we pick random features at tree or node level, why do choose random subset of data for each tree? Because if the features are different at tree/node level, the trees will be different. Why do we need to add another level and make the distribution of data also random to the trees and not just feed the complete original dataset to the trees.
