This data isn't really multidimensional, it's just a simple time series, and there are many ways to analyse it. I'd suggest you start with the Fourier Transform , it detects "rhythms" in a series, so this data would show a spike at 7 days, and also around thirty, and if you extended the data set to a few years it would show a one-year spike for seasons and holidays. That should keep you busy for a while, until you're ready to use real multidimensional data, say by adding in weather information, stock market data, results of recent sports events and so on.
