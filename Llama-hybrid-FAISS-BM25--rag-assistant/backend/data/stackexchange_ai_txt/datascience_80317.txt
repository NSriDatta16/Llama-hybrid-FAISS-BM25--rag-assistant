I'm assuming your 32x32x3 CNN was trained on CIFAR and you are looking to apply it to MNIST (correct me if I'm wrong). If that is the case, you probably shouldn't try to adapt the CIFAR model for MNIST. There are a few reasons not to do this, but the main ones are: the features are probably going to be dramatically different the colorspaces are different, which makes the features even less relevant As suggested by @aminrd, you could reshape your 28x28x1 to 32x32x3 to force a correct input shape, but you'd probably get better results with just training a new network. Forcefully retraining in this manner would effectively be throwing excess data at your final layer while likely ignoring data that would have been extracted had you trained from scratch.
