I see a similar problem with my application with regarding to having loads of resources to copy up on deployment. I'm considering building a file handler that serves up image resources to the browser. I.e. When linking to images you'd having something like /filehandler.ashx?image=/ads/101/o3904838402384.jpg then you can have just have a config setting that points to different or the same filestorage folders for both Test and Live environments. Here is a link to the fundamentals of how it works. http://dotnetperls.com/ashx-handler
