Why does hypothesis of SVM output 0 or 1?

Prof. Andrew Ng in his Machine Learning class says that unlike Logistic Regression, SVM outputs hypothesis as 1 or 0. But I donâ€™t understand why SVM's behavior differs from that of logistic regression even though both these algorithms use the same sigmoid function? In other words, $h(x)$ for Logistic Regression is continuous: $0 \le h(x) \le 1$. But $h(x)$ for SVM is discrete: $h(x) = \{0, 1\}.$ Why?
