Brief Answer I would heavily recommend reading up on Bayes before using Bayes. There is a serious danger of the defaults (Gelman & Yao, 2021; Moyé, 2008; Smid & Winter, 2020), which are the uniform priors referred to by Sextus (which he simply describes and probably isn't explicitly advocating for). Some practical reading exists out there (see Statistical Rethinking in the references for a less math-intensive text) which can help shore up this hole. The main thing you need to consider is a prior that actually makes sense for your scenario. As an example, what is a reasonable mean score in the literature for gender? How much does it vary? One could straightforwardly use a normally distributed prior with a mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$ as $N(\mu,\sigma)$ on this coefficient given it can be positive or negative and fluctuate around a mean. However, prior understanding of the research should help provide insight on selection of the actual mean and variance values that should go here. To your question, in some respects models with uniform priors essentially produce the same thing as frequentist models, so it's not usually useful to use such priors if one wants to be "truly Bayesian". I would first investigate what is causing the near perfect separation and determine if Bayes is even necessary. There may be a solution that may be much easier if there is a way to fix the issue first, but first one must determine why the outcome is essentially perfectly predicted by the categories given. As a final comment, I'm not sure why you need to make age categorical. Binning continuous variables is in general a poor practice (Royston, 2006). References Gelman, A., & Yao, Y. (2021).
