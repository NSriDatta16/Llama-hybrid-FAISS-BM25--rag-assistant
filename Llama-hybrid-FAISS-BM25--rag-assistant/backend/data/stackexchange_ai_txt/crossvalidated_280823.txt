What is the mathematical rigorous proof that L1 regularization will give sparse solution?

It is given in the book Machine Learning A probabilistic Perspective, but i am not able to understand it. Can some one provide an explanation for that ? I am not clear with the way sub gradient is defined and how is it helping in the optimization .
