Unless I'm mistaken, it sounds like you need to rethink your container and ClassLoader design. You're trying to achieve the same sort of functionality that your average servlet container supports, so it might be an idea to look at that for inspiration. As to the specific problem: instance x of type A is only an instance of class A if x.getClass().getClassLoader() == A.class.getClassLoader() . So, even though two or more objects might be of class A , Java treats them as different types if they have different ClassLoaders. It sounds like the interface you're trying to cast to should be in a common base (or the system) ClassLoader.
