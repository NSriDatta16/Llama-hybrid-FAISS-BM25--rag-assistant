In general, multicollinearity isn't really an issue if your goal is a predictive model. The predictions remain unbiased if MC is the only "issue" because none of the assumptions needed for unbiasedness and consistency are violated. In a time series, however I don't have much predictive modeling experience. R-squared will generally be very high until you partial out time, and you ought to be careful as autocorrelated errors will likely be the case and violate some important assumptions for unbiasedness and consistency in ordinary linear regression-- an autoregressive model would be a possible other option.
