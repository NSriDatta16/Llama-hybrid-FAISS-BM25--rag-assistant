Participant non-compliance: How to include data in analysis

I conducted a study in which participants were to do one of three treatment options and then write a test. The intention was to separate the participants based on the option they selected and using a one-way ANOVA, analyze whether these groups were statistically different from one another by comparing test grades. The number of participants that did one of three treatment options were as follows: Option 1, n = 27 Option 2, n = 98 Option 3, n = 69 The issue I ran into is that several participants misread the instructions and did all three options, or some combination of two of the three options. The number of participants that did more than one treatment option: Options 1, 2 and 3, n = 13 Options 1 and 2, n = 17 Options 1 and 3, n = 10 Options 2 and 3, n = 20 Is there a way to use the test data from this group of people (those that did more than one treatment option) in the statistical analysis? For example, can I somehow compare these groups’ test grades to those of the single option groups? Or should they be excluded from the analysis (i.e. per-protocol analysis)? I looked into complier-average causal effect (CACE) analysis, however in this case I don’t have a control group and there’s no way to determine which of the treatment options (for those that did more than one) had the effect, if any, on the test grade. Any guidance you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thank you! -Carmen
