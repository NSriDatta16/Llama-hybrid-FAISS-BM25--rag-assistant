Ordinal multinomial logistic regression on one-hot encoded data

I have a task I am unable to tackle by principle. I'm working on survey data for one of our clients such that my design matrix is made of one-hot vectors with 15 features (originally 3 variables with 5 categorical classes). I want to evaluate the importance of every feature in predicting a discrete outcome (the net promoter score going from 1-10). What I already know is that one-hot encoded data has perfect co-linearity, meaning that using the design matrix as is will yield unstable and meaningless results. What I already tried is using a linear model with penalization such as Lasso and Ridge. The results were catastrophic with p-values hitting 99%. I wish to tackle the problem from a logistic regression approach in hopes of getting more significant results but I have no idea how to implement it. The functions I already used such as polr and the DisplayR package assume low multicolinearity, is there a penalized logistic approach? Or a way to process my data?
