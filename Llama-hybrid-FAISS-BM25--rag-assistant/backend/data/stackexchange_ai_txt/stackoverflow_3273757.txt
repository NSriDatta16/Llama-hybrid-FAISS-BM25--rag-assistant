Well, my PHP is a bit rusty, but let me crack my dusty knuckles on this one: I would make a transformer function for this. It accepts the first array as its input (the one with "6712" et. al. as its key), and returns the second array as its output. Sorry for any and all syntax errors, but here it goes: function indexer ($array) { $result = array(); $i = 0; foreach ($array as $key => $value) { $result[$i][$key] = $value; $i++; } return $result; } But! If you don't strictly need the two-dimensional array, you can iterate over an array without all that overhead. See the reset() , next() and prev() functions. In case you're interested in the key (which you probably are, in your case), see also the each() function. Remember that each array has a stateful internal pointer. This means, if you pass around the array a lot, the state of the pointer will be remembered. So call reset() appropriately.
