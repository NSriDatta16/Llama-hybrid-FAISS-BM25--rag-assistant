Java Swing: How to access variables in a 2nd frame from the first frame?

I'm programming a desktop application in Java using NetBeans . My question is this: 1st: I have a Jframe that is the principal frame of the application. 2nd: In some moment I want to create a new object of some kind, so I press addButton y create a new JFrame (I create a new class window that extends Jframe) with some text fields in it. private void addButtonMouseClicked(java.awt.event.MouseEvent evt) { w = new window(); w.setVisible(true); } this is a screenshot simplified with a simple string instead of a full class http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/3361/screenshotlw.png 3rd: In this new window have I read the text fields and create the object when I press some button. Finally when I press the accept button I want the new frame to get the object in the 2nd frame. Question : what is the most elegant/efficient/easy/better way of getting the object in the 2nd frame from the first one?. My First Solution: was to create a static method setNewData() on the first windows, and the second windows calls this method when you press the button. Now I came with a New Solution : On the second frame I have a method to set a mouselistener on the button. And a getString() Function. On the first frame I got this: private void addButtonMouseClicked(java.awt.event.MouseEvent evt) { w = new window(); w.setHandler(ml); w.setVisible(true); } MouseListener ml = new MouseAdapter() { @Override public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { TextFieldOn1stFrame.setText(w.getString()); } }; And on the second frame I got this public void setHandler(MouseListener ml){ button1.addMouseListener(ml); } public String getString(){ return texto.getText(); } Note: Sorry for the Long Text, I'm new on java and don't know if this solutions are the best. btw sorry about my english too.
