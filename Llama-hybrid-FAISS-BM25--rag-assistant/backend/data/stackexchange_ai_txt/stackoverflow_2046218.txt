Yes its true. Calling static functions from outside the class is slow. I recently tested this for myself, over 10,000 iterations it was 220ms for static vs 160ms for calling the function on an instance. Other tips would be to avoid the Adobe compiler. I have recently started using Haxe which converts to LLVM and then to ABC code (actionscript byte code). There are some hidden opcodes for dealing with memory that Haxe takes advantage of (same as Alchemy). Speaking of alchemy it will compile C++ --> LLVM --> ABC. Might be useful for you if you have lots of c++ libraries. (someone ported Doom, Hexen, and Heritic over to Flash this way) EDIT: for anything performance related http://lab.polygonal.de/ and http://blog.joa-ebert.com are good places to start.
