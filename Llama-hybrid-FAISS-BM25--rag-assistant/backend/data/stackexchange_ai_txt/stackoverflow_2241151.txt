How to display data in ExtJS tree received using jsonArray from struts2 action

I am new to ExtJs and I am just having a hard time reading the json array received from struts2 application. Following is the json array that I received from struts application [{ "children": [{ "children": [], "cls": "file", "id": 11, "leaf": true, "text": "A Child 1" }, { "children": [], "cls": "file", "id": 12, "leaf": true, "text": "A Child 2" }], "cls": "folder", "id": 10, "leaf": false, "text": "A Folder" }] it works fine if I save it in the .json file and call it using dataUrl: 'json.json'. But when I call it using dataUrl: 'myAction.action', the data is not loaded. I would really appreciate if someone could throw some insight on something I am missing here. Following is my .js, which is similar to example provided by extjs Ext.onReady(function(){ // shorthand var Tree = Ext.tree; var tree = new Tree.TreePanel({ useArrows: true, autoScroll: true, animate: true, enableDD: true, containerScroll: true, border: false, // auto create TreeLoader dataUrl: 'myAction.action', root: { nodeType: 'async', text: 'Ext JS', draggable: false, id: 'src' } }); // render the tree tree.render('tree-div'); tree.getRootNode().expand(); });
