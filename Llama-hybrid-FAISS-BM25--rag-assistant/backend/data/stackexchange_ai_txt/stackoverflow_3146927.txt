I'm not too knowledgeable about cocos2d's contract but shouldn't you release the SecScene you alloc in ccTouchesBegan on this line: [[CCDirector sharedDirector] replaceScene:[[SecScene alloc]init]] I don't see any reason why replaceScene wouldn't retain, so now the SecScene has a retain count of two when it should have one. More importantly, if you added MainScene in a similar way that would explain why its retain count is one higher than you'd like it to be, so it will never get deallocated.
