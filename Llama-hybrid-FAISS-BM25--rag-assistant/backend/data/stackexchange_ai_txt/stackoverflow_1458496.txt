Regular Expression to find querystring portion of a hyperlink

I'm pretty new to regular expressions, but I'm sure a regex would give me something much more elegant than anything I could do with string methods. I've got a hyperlink in the form of: hello I want to yank out just the querystring portion. Also, what's a good reference for .net regular expressions (sheepish grin)? I find the MSDN reference very hard to follow.
