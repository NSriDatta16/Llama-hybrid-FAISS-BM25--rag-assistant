passing data on two domains using Ajax

This is a client Request, Client has two domains www.file.domain1.com and www.cfile.domain2.com, in Different servers both contains the info about the patients information files, which shows in tree structure. Our client request is "Move files from one domain to another in DRAG & DROP method" because it is easy for him to access :( What we suggest is Viewing both file structure in iframes and shall use jquery or Dojo framework for DRAG & DROP. Drag the file from one iframe and put it another iframe (i.e) both iframes are different domains, and destination iframe want to be updated Is that possible OR Any other views...
