SVM confidence according to distance from hyperline

For a probabilistic multi-class classifier we can get probabilities of membership of a new point $x$ to each class $y_i$; in case of 3 classes suppose that we get $P(y_a|x) > P(y_b|x) > P(y_c|x)$, thus the most probable class of x is $y_a$. Now suppose that we have a multi-class svm where we can get scores of membership of $x$ to each class (according to distances from hyperlines); in case of 3 classes suppose that we get $Score(y_a|x), Score(y_b|x), Score(y_c|x)$, How is in this case the first, second and third most likely class of $x$ (without converting these scores to probabilities) ? Usually I get positive and negative values like for instance $Score1 = -8622, Score2 = 5233, Score3 = -665$
