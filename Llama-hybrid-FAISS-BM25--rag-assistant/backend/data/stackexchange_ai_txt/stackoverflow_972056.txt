Jquery hide/show not working in Firefox/Chrome

I have a bit of HTML/JQuery code that only seems to be working for IE 8. I am attempting to embed a meebo chat widget into a wiki by adding some direct html code. I don't want the widget to load by default, as it takes a bit of time, so I am putting it in a div and hiding it using Jquery. Unfortunately, this only seems to work in Internet Explorer. In Firefox 3, when I click on the toggle button, nothing happens. When I tried in Google Chrome, the show/hide text would toggle, but the embedding widget doesn't show up. Does anyone know if this is an issue using JQuery, or perhaps a browser compatibility issue? There is a lot of backend wiki code that could be affecting the issue as well. For instance, the place where I embed the widget is nested in both tables and other divs. Could this be causing problems with the JQuery selectors? Any help would be appreciated. Jquery Code: $(document).ready(function(){ $(".btn-slide").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $("#meebo-panel").toggleClass("meebo-open").toggleClass("meebo-closed").toggleClass("meebo-hide").toggleClass("meebo-show"); $(".btn-slide").toggleClass("show-text").toggleClass("hide-text"); $(".show-hide-panel").toggleClass("green-panel").toggleClass("grey-panel"); $(".meebo-show").show(); $(".meebo-hide").hide(); $(".show-text").text("Chat with me"); $(".hide-text").text("Hide"); return false; }); }); My HTML: Chat now Test EDIT: It appears that this issue occurs regardless of what is in the div. I simplified the example to include text instead, since I believe it streamlines the code a bit.
