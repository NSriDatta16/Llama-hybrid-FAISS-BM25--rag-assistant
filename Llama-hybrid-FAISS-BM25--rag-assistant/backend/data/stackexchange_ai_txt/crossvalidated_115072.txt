My take on this question is, that coding the four possible states with just two variables is less expressive with some machine learning algorithms than using 4 variables. For example, imagine that you want to do linear regression and your true mapping maps the values 0,1 and 2 to 0 and the value 3 to 1. You can quickly check that there is no way of learning this mapping with linear regression when coding your categorial variable with just two binary ones (just try to fit the corresponding plane in your head). On the other hand, when you use a 1-Of-K coding, this would not be a problem.
