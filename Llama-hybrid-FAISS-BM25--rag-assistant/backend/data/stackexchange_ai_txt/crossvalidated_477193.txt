Get predicted (leveled) value of y from a differenced regression in time series

Suppose I have two time series variables (x and y) which have unit root (non-stationary). I would like to regress y against x, but because they are non-stationary, I first stationarized them by differencing. So, the differences variables: diff_x and diff_y are stationary. Now, I regress as follows: diff_y = constant + slope * diff_x I am able to get the predicted values of diff_y, and I can invert those differences to get the leveled values. My question: if I want to find the comparable value of y when x = 6.5, then how do I calculate from the differenced equation above? Here, x = unemployment rate (measured in %), and y = employment to population ratio
