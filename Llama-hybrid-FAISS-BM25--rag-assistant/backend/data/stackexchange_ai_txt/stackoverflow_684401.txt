Probably you should get intimately familiar with "PHP Sessions", maybe using a framework that already has this in place, because it's non-trivial and you don't want to mess it up. The session management software will then handle all this for you, including login screens, "I forgot my password", etc. Then you can focus your attention on what your site is really primarily there for. Sounds like fun (actionscript + php + mysql) - good luck!
