You might be better off with less threads for some of your components. Having too many is actually less efficient. You are better off with a queue and being able to process your work more efficiently, allowing the threads to spend more time working and less time context switching. That being said, I would not say that a server with a load average of 1 is too loaded. It might be working hard, but if there is only one process that is ready for a CPU at a time, on average, that is not bad at all. Is it "too slow"? Jacob
