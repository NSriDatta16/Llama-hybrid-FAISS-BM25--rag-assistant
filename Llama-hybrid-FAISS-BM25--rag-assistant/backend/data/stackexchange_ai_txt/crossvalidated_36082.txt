Document image analysis and retrieval with online incremental clustering

Is there any interesting problem in the area of "Document Image Analysis and Retrieval" which by nature needs an online/incremental clustering process ? The problem may be in the context of "Logical Structure Analysis", or "Document Layout Analysis" to identify regions of interest in a scanned page, or any other related topics. What matters is that the considered problem naturally needs an online/incremental clustering. Do you have any ideas or suggestions about such problems ? Note: the considered document images are actually a scanned administrative documents
