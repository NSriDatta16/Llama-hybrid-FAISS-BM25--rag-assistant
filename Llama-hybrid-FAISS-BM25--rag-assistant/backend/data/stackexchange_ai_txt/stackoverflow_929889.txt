Using a NSTreeController, NSOutlineView with Drag and Drop

I have found a Tutorial here on how to implement drag and drop in an Outline View. The only problem I have is I don't know where to put the code from the tutorial. I would appreciate it greatly if you could tell me where I should put the code in a Xcode Project to make it work. Thanks!
