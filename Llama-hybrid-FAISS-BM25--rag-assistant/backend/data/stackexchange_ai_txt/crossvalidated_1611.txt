Do working statisticians care about the difference between frequentist and Bayesian inference?

As an outsider, it appears that there are two competing views on how one should perform statistical inference. Are the two different methods both considered valid by working statisticians? Is choosing one considered more of a philosophical question? Or is the current situation considered problematic and attempts are being made to somehow unify the different approaches?
