How to create an interface at Runtime

Assuming I have a class like public class FooImpl { public void bar(){}; } Is there a way to create its interface at runtime? e.g. public interface Foo { public void bar(); } I have been looking into Javasssist and the truth is it's reflection that I'm interested in using the interface for (as Esko Luontola and Yishai stated) So I want an interface that specifies a subset of the original class' methods to make a proxy from. I came to realize there are more things to be concerned about like Should you reuse that interface or create a new one each time? The proxy class is effectively a new instance of type java.lang.reflect.Proxy, which might cause implications depending on the use case. The last point made me wonder on how some frameworks manage to handle this, do they deep copy the object? do they encapsulate the proxy inside the original instance? So maybe it's just easier (though maybe not as elegant) to require for the client code to create the interface for the class.
