How do you calculate the greatest number of repetitions in a list?

If I have a list in Python like [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1] How do I calculate the greatest number of repeats for any element? In this case 2 is repeated a maximum of 4 times and 1 is repeated a maximum of 3 times. Is there a way to do this but also record the index at which the longest run began?
