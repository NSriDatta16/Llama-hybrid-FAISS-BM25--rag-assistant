Need statistical features of time series for classfication

I have a time series classification task to solve, based on statistical features like maximum, minimum, standard deviation, etc. It is a multiclass classification and my estimator seems to be confused with the two classes shown in picture. It can more or less well identify all the other classes, but fails on these ones. Do you have any suggestions which statistical features would be suitable to make the two types of time series shown in the picture seperatable? I am not too much into statistics and am sure, there is something I just don't know. What my model already includes is: mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, number of values below 50. I am happy to get some inspiration about features I could extract from the time series in order they improve my model! EDIT: The values of the time series differ quite a lot. Some have ranges over 70000, others between 0 and 100 (2nd picture) I normalized the time series of all classes to visualize them in one plot (3rd picture)
