Comparing 2 or more groups over 3 sessions

So far I've done only simple and multi-variant linear regression analysis using R. Now I need to do something new and I'm somewhat clueless. I have four groups of students, with 7 people in each group. The people of each group, come on day 1, learn a series of words and are tested on those - the learning of and testing on the list is repeated 2 more times on that day. On the next day, Day 2, the process repeats for the same list (3 times). The process repeats one last time after 6 days. Of course there are differences between the learning styles of the groups, and that is what I would like to test - hence assigning dummy variables to the groups. But I don't know how to start when dealing with time series (that also appear to be "seasonal") D11 D12 D13 D21 D22 D23 D31 D32 D33 layal 0 1 0 0 7 9 8 12 11 amir 0 2 2 1 9 15 11 18 22 rozan 0 4 8 4 12 13 11 16 22 adam 0 0 0 2 8 11 12 22 22 bushra 1 9 13 8 20 24 nelly 1 1 4 6 8 17 19 24 24 bshara 0 1 4 4 6 10 18 20 22 andalus 0 0 0 0 4 5 0 5 6 omar 0 1 1 0 5 5 3 3 7 almat 0 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 4 wateen 0 0 0 1 2 9 8 11 11 mohamed 0 0 2 0 7 9 6 12 14 nihal 2 3 5 4 9 13 16 18 18 antwan 1 0 2 6 6 9 16 16 18 maysam 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 8 9 nortan 0 0 1 2 4 3 2 6 6 samer 0 4 4 4 8 11 10 14 18 karolin 2 3 4 4 4 5 4 7 10 mostafa 0 2 2 0 6 7 5 12 12 talia 0 0 0 0 0 4 6 8 12 diana 1 2 6 10 11 17 16 23 24 gabriela 0 9 13 20 22 24 24 24 24 mariam 1 2 1 5 4 3 5 4 3 ninette 0 0 2 3 3 5 5 9 9 suzan 0 1 1 2 4 7 5 8 11 siwar 0 0 0 3 1 2 2 8 8 angel 0 2 1 7 10 12 14 16 18 nahla 1 2 0 2 1 3 5 9 12 Thank you in advance!
