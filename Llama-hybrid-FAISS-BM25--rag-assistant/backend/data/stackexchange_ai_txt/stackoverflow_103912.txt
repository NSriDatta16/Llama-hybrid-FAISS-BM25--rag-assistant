Unless you are running out of page file space, this issue isn't that the computer is running out of memory. The whole point of virtual memory is to allow the processes to use more virtual memory than is physically available. Not knowing how the JVM handles the heap, it is a bit hard to say exactly what the problem is, but one of the common issues is that there isn't enough contiguous free address space available in your process to allow the heap to be extended. Why this would be a problem after the machine has been running a while is a bit confusing. I've been working on a similar problem at work. I have found that running the program using WinDBG and using the "!address" and "!address -summary" commands have been invaluable in tracking down why a processes' virtual address space has become fragmented. You can also try running the program after reboot and using the "!address" command to take a picture of the address space and then do the same when the program no longer runs. This might clue you in on the problem. Maybe something simple as an extra DLL getting loading might cause the problem.
