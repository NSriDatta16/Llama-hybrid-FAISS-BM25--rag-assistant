You can wrap it in make_scorer for use in GridSearchCV. from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score, make_scorer from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC kappa_scorer = make_scorer(cohen_kappa_score) grid = GridSearchCV(LinearSVC(), param_grid={'C': [1, 10]}, scoring=kappa_scorer)
