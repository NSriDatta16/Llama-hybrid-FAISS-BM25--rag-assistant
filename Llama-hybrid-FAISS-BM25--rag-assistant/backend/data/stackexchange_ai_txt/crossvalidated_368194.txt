Reparameterization trick for gamma distribution

I am reading the work of Welling on Vartiational Auto-Encoders (VAE), and wonder if there is any way to generate Gamma distributed samples via a similar reparametrization? The idea of reparameterization is quite simple. To generate a sample from a particular distribution, i.e. $z\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ , we generate samples from another distribution, i.e. $\epsilon\sim N(0,1)$ , and then transform it into genuine samples from the desired distribution, i.e. via $z=\mu+\sigma\times\epsilon$ . This has some nice consequences in the VAE framework, i.e., reduces the variance of the gradient (not really important here). I basically wonder if such transformation exists for Gamma distribution.
