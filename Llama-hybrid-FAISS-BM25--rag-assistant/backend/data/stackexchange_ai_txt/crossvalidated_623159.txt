I second mkt comments. What are you trying to accomplish? You're comparing different weight distribution. There are many ways of doing so. You could compare group means, group variances, skewness, entropy, check KL divergence.. When you take the abs diff you're essentially measuring the dispersion within the distribution. If you first measure dispersion then average across group you have a measure of...average dispersion of groups. If you average all dispersion you lose any notion of groups and simply have a measure of dispersion of your "population". The reason your averages are different is not due to the 1/6 or 1/2 weighting, but due to the absolute value which makes your measure non linear. Had you used a linear operation at the numerator (e.g. a difference, a sum, etc) averaging the average would yield the same result.
