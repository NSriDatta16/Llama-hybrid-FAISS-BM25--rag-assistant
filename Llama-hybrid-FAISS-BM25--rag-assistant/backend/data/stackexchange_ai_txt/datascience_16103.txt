In the specific case where the grouping variable is categorical, it is only very slightly clunky but it makes sense and is just fine. It sounds a bit smoother to use something like 'greater' in that case. For example you might want to say: The average effect for the female group was X. When looking at the male group, the average effect increased to Y. But you probably would be slightly better off to say: The average salary for the female group was X. When looking at the male group, the average effect, Y, was greater. If the grouping variable in question is numeric and you use 'increase' or 'decrease' to describe it, then describing the metric with 'increase' or 'decrease' also sounds just fine. E.g.: As height increased, X decreased.
