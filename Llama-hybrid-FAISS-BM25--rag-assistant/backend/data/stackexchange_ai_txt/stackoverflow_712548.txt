Apart from trying that Brian said, you could also check the following 1) Run tcpdump on any one of the servers, and see the sequence of message flows from the time when a job is initiated to after the delay, when all processing is complete. That will tell you which side is causing the delay (W or S). Check if there are any retransmissions, missed acks, and so on. 2) Is there some kind of fragmentation happening between W and S? 3) What are the network load conditions on the servers on which the bytes are stuck? Is heavy load causing output errors, resulting in socket queues not being emptied? (There could also be a NIC bug, wherein after hitting some error condition, the NIC buffers are not flushed, or fails to resume transmission, and such a condition is getting cleared by some sort of a watchdog) More information on the above two would definitely help.
