Simple answer is to avoid using this library. No offense to the authors, they might have done v.good and hard work but if it can not be utilized after all kinds of possible tries then it is useless. They mention in doc that a function belongs to a particular interface but when you go there, it doesn't exist in ANY of the available interfaces. For those who are curious: I did contact the authors through their site but didn't get a reply even after 8 days. There are other alternatives available like OpenNLP (java) or its C# counterpart SharpNLP .
