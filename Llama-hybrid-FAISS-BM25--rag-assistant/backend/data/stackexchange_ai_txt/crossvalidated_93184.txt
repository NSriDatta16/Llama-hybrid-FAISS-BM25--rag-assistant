Should I specify Prior or Cost matrix with Tree Bagger in Matlab

I'm trying to create Random Forests in Matlab and there are more observations in some classes than there are in others. Do I need to specify this as a cost matrix or as a prior probability or will Matlab figure this out automatically and the fact the data is skewed won't matter. Thanks
