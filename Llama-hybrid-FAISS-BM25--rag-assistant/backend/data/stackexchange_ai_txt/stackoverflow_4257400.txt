It doesn't seem to me that there is much difference between returning a NULL or returning a zero. Either way, your code still has to do something different than it would do if a result was returned. You're still going to have an if-else . If a record is returned, do this, else do some other thing. So I don't really see much difference. I would encourage you not to use a DataReader to return a single value. It would be better to use ExecuteScalar , or for better performance, an output parameter from a stored procedure.
