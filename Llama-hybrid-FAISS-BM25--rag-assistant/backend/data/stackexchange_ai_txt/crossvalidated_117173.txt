Stepwise regression does not work well with logistic regression and I expect it to be equally unsuccessful here. What made you think you need feature selection as part of the modeling process? If you absolutely do need to incorporate feature selection, choose a method that keeps together multiple parameters describing one predictor, such as $F$ tests with multiple numerator degrees of freedom or other simple translations of partial sums of squares.
