Don't understand where the localhost comes from ? I believe it comes from the JNLP file that is cached locally. There are various ways to test this theory, some more reliable than others. 1) Try the web version on a PC never used in testing on the localhost. For the development machine itself. 2) Uninstall the application from the Java Cache before launching the 'live' web based version. Or.. 3) Move the cache entirely, for the purposes of each test. As two asides.. I was not clear from the code snippets above whether the JNLP href was being written to the response. If it is, remove it. It is usually both unnecessary and counterproductive to include the href in a dynamically generated JNLP. Please edit your post to format the input/output, code/code snippets, HTML/XML as code.
