left join with empty results when no match is found

Say I have these three tables: Table: Baskets id | name 1 Sale 2 Premium 3 Standard 4 Expired Table: Fruit id | name | basketid 1 Apples 1 2 Oranges 2 3 Grapes 3 4 Apples 2 5 Apples 4 Table: Veggies id | name | basketid 1 Carrots 1 2 Peas 2 3 Asparagus 1 It may seem like the second two tables should have just been one table called produce, but in the real situation there is good reason for them to be different tables. I need to write a join that returns rows if the basket has rows in either the fruit or veggie tables. I thought I could accomplish this with two left joins like so: Select Baskets.*, fruit.name as fruit, veggies.name as veggies from Baskets left join Fruit on Baskets.id = Fruit.basketid left join veggies on Baskets.id = Veggies.basketid where Baskets.id = 2; But this statement returns values in fields that I would like to be empty. The actual output: id | name | fruit | veggies 2 Premium Oranges Peas 2 Premium Apples Peas The output I would like: id | name | fruit | veggies 2 Premium Oranges 2 Premium Apples 2 Premium Peas How can I accomplish this?
