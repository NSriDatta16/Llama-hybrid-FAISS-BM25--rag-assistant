jQuery cleanup task

So this may be a little tricky, but take a look at the div below. I need some jQuery code that is going to go through this div, and delete the rows OR the cells that contain a textbox or a dropdown, or really any kind of input field, WITHOUT any data in it, or just a blank choice ("" or " "). It would also need to delete the corresponding label, for example in the case Account Number m.STPData.BorrowerAccountNumber, new { @class = "economicTextBox", propertyName = "STPData.BorrowerAccountNumber", onchange = "this.value = ConvertToPasswordCharacters(this.value, '*', 4);UpdateField(this);" }) %> If that above textbox didn't have any data in it, I wouldn't want to see the cell that contained the text 'Account Number' either. Any ideas? I know this is really tricky, might need like a jQuery expert here.
