How to know the security or penetration test coverage

Does anyone know how to understand the security or penetration test coverage? I found the traditional method for functional test coverage measurement is not quite useful for security test. Because for security test, actually, you don't need to cover every logic branch. If you cover the whole URLs and parameters, basically, you cover everything. Any idea? Thanks.
