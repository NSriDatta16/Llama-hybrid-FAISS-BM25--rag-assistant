Network/Graph Analysis Beginner Resources

I am a beginner to Network/Graph Analysis. I have data in the following format: Customer | CustomerSpend Anna $10 Bob $30 Charlie $50 ... ... Customer1 | Customer2 | RelationshipStrength | Location Anna Bob 5 NY Bob Charlie 10 TX ... ... I want to visualize and conduct some analysis on the data set (which groups spend most, which locations spend most, etc.). I am thinking of using NodeXL or igraph (in R) to get started. I also want to brush up on graph theory to understand the various metrics I could look at. What resources can I leverage to get started?
