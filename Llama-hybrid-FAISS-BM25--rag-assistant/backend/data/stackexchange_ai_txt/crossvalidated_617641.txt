It depends if you ask about summing or averaging random variables. By the basic properties of variance , for the sum of independent variables, their variance is $$ \mathrm{Var}\Big(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\Big) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{Var}(X_i) $$ If you average them, it however is smaller than the average of variances $$ \mathrm{Var}\Big(\tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\Big) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{Var}(X_i)}{n^2} $$ and with $n \to \infty$ the variance goes to zero.
