What is a good way to compare two data pre-processing methods e.g better predictions and/or narrower HPDs?

Given one dataset and two different data pre-processing pipelines, does it make sense to say that one of the processing pipelines is better if, given a regression model, it subsequently leads to a higher predictive accuracy? If we use a Bayesian model to estimate the parameter uncertainty, does it make sense to say that one is better because the regression coefficient HPDs are narrower? Doesn't the HPD depend on the magnitude of the estimated parameter e.g. the HPD might be narrower, but does this mean that the uncertainty is lower? couldn't it be because its magnitude is smaller ?
