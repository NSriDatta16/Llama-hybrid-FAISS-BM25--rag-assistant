Just a thought, but have you ever used Solution Folders to organize your solutions? I have a common ordering that I like my projects to be listed in, so I started creating root solution folders that start with a number, and inside of them I added child solution folders that group each project by a particular kind. For example: 1. Clients App Web Lib Tst Doc 2. API Lib Tst Doc 3. Domain Lib Tst Doc 4. Data Access Lib Tst Doc 5. Framework Lib Tst Doc This works out nicely and keeps large solutions organized, but may be overkill if you only have a few projects in your solution. You might just try the root folders, numbered in the order you preferr.
