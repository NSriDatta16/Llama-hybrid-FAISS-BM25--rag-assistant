Is is possible to return an object or value from a Python script to the hosting application?

For example in Lua you can place the following line at the end of a script: return The value/object that is returned can then be retrieved by the hosting application. I use this pattern so that scripts can represent factories for event handlers. The script-based event handlers are then used to extend the application. For example the hosting application runs a script called 'SomeEventHandler.lua' which defines and returns an object that is an event handler for 'SomeEvent' in your application. Can this be done in Python? Or is there a better way to achieve this? More specifically I am embedding IronPython in my C# application and am looking for a way to instance these script-based event handlers which will allow the application to be extended using Python.
