Everyone is recommending Casella & Berger, which is almost universally used in graduate statistics programs. It's not a bad reference book, but I'm not sure I'd do more than scan the first 4-5 chapters. I don't think you need the theory of how to construct a Neyman-Pearson type test before delving into "statistics" i.e. data analysis. Instead, I would focus on learning methods. My graduate program used Applied Linear Statistical Methods for the frequentist tests, and it's a pretty decent comprehensive reference, but might not be the most approachable book from a self-teaching standpoint. A course or two from MIT or coursera might be a better way to start in on that, because you'll get a broader overview with more examples than you might from reading a book. For Bayes, the book I've seen used most often is Doing Bayesian Data Analysis , which comes with puppy pictures (clearly, this makes the book superior to other Bayesian introductory textbooks). I've never used the book myself, but I've paged through it and it seems pretty decent - much better than Gelman's book, which I found somewhat incomprehensible AFTER two classes in Bayesian statistics - the explanations are terrible.
