JavaScript, HTML - Is it possible to show value Html.TextAreaFor in Javascript ConfirmBox?

I'm trying to show Value of Html.TextAreaFor in Javascript Confirm Box but my code doesn't work. Maybe somebody has a good idea how to fix it.. This is my code: m.Quote,7,40,null)%> View function ViewQuote() { if (confirm(document.valueOf( "here I'trying to show value of TextAreaFor"))) { return true; } else { } return false; } Thank you all and take care, Ragims
