How do you copy from a rectangular source region to a non-rectangular/non-paralellogram destination region in .NET?

I know how to use the DrawImage() method of the Graphics object to copy from a rectangular source region to a rectangular destination region, and how to copy to a paralellogram region defined by a three-element Point[] array. Is there any way in .NET to copy from a rectangular source region to a 4-sided non-rectangular destination region (which is defined by four arbitrary points)? Update . Here is some sample code that copies an image to a parallelogram region: using (Graphic g = this.CreateGraphics()) { List pts = new List (); pts.Add(new Point(0, 0)); pts.Add(new Point(100, 0)); pts.Add(new Point(10, 100)); g.DrawImage(pbSource.Image, pts.ToArray()); } If I add a fourth point, I get a "Not Implemented" exception. Update 2 . It is possible to do this entirely in .NET: alt text http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/a770d1e97f.jpg but you have to do it yourself, pixel-by-pixel. Graphics courtesy of Jonbert .
