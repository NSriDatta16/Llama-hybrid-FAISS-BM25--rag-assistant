I also recommend ColdFusion. I've been building Flex/AIR apps daily for three years. I've developed them with backends built in PHP, .NET, and Java. ColdFusion is by far the smoothest integration. There are many, many other benefits as well. For those saying CF is dying, it's growing by leaps and bounds every year. Instead of posting your random, unverifiable, negative information, post some real & verifiable information to back up your statements. Otherwise anything you say is complete fail. People like you have been saying CF is dying for 10 years. Oddly, given that it's dying, the developer base has grown 30% over the last two years alone, according to Evans Data (buy the reports if you want to verify these figures). It has grown by 400% since 2004. Two major open source CFML engines have been developed in the last few years. Pretty amazing someone would go through all that effort for a dying language. http://www.getrailo.org www.openbluedragon.org The vast majority of Fortune 100 companies use ColdFusion: www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/customers/ So back to the original point. ColdFusion is a viable backend for Flex/AIR apps and like to be the best choice for many solutions. Your needs should determine what the obvious choice will be for you, be it CFML/BlazeDS, PHP/AMFPHP, Java/BlazeDS, .NET/Web Services, etc.
