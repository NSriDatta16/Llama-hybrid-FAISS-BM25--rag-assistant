In Java there are two types of reference variable casting: Downcasting : If you have a reference variable that refers to a subtype object, you can assign it to a reference variable of the subtype. You must make an explicit cast to do this, and the result is that you can access the subtype's members with this new reference variable. Upcasting : You can assign a reference variable to a supertype reference variable explicitly or implicitly. This is an inherently safe operation because the assignment restricts the access capabilities of the new variable. Yes , you need to implement the interface directly or indirectly to enable assigning your class object reference to the interface type.
