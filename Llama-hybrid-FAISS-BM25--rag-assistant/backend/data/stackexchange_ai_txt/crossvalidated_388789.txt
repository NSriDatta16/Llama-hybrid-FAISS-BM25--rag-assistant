In your data, we can see a clear trend in the series - aside from the peaks and valleys that we observe due to seasonality. In this regard, given that you are trying to test cointegration - examining the trend between the two time series would be sufficient for this purpose. The premise of cointegration is that the time series will converge regardless of short-term divergence as a result of seasonality. Consider a stock price: Assume the data frame for the above is called pricetimeseries . Here is how we can decompose this series in R: pricetimeseriescomponents Here is a plot of the time series components, with plots of the observed, trend, seasonal, and random components: Suppose you wish to extract the trend component - you would do so as follows: > pricetimeseriescomponents$trend Jan Feb Mar Apr May 2005 NA NA NA NA NA 2006 522.4662 529.3182 534.8247 541.8366 548.0212 2007 593.4455 601.4741 615.8859 629.7638 641.6483 2008 733.6673 743.6278 752.2227 766.4457 787.9554 2009 965.6929 996.8343 1027.5245 1055.4893 1080.0541 2010 1351.7832 1372.8470 1391.3127 1403.0279 1412.5826 2011 1527.3403 1553.4908 1579.0567 1605.7978 1637.1384 2012 1915.9968 1954.4039 2000.5238 2043.3551 2074.7826 2013 2122.9231 2159.4696 2190.1142 2235.0433 2301.6488 2014 3011.0224 3065.9748 3124.0549 3182.1676 3230.7467 2015 NA Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct 2005 NA 514.7937 514.4616 515.6833 517.4935 2006 552.2900 558.2910 563.3892 565.7217 571.3616 2007 652.8290 662.4862 672.6203 683.4498 694.0758 2008 811.8698 835.3667 858.7176 881.3508 899.9198 2009 1107.9877 1144.7267 1186.2736 1226.7556 1264.7067 2010 1424.5948 1436.3032 1453.0420 1471.7128 1482.5863 2011 1669.3786 1703.6051 1726.6751 1749.0592 1789.6872 2012 2089.7982 2087.0113 2082.9266 2077.2431 2070.2600 2013 2380.8170 2464.3157 2553.0360 2651.3149 2753.5820 2014 3279.1748 3328.5332 NA NA NA 2015 Nov Dec 2005 517.1992 517.5922 2006 580.4228 588.1642 2007 705.7303 720.1067 2008 917.9098 938.9571 2009 1298.6959 1328.0321 2010 1492.7199 1506.7854 2011 1829.7861 1872.8303 2012 2076.1825 2092.9732 2013 2852.7439 2941.1436 2014 NA NA 2015 Here is a plot: We can see that the overall trend still remains, but the "peaks and valleys" that we saw in the first graph no longer remain. In this regard, you might try extracting the trends in your time series using R and then using VECM.
