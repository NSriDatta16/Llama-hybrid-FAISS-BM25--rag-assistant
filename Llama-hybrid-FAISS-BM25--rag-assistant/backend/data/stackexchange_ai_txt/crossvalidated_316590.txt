What is the reason behind the name "adonis" (for permutational MANOVA)?

Does any one know why Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices (PERMANOVA) is also called adonis ? See https://www.r-bloggers.com/adonis-permanova-assumptions or http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/adonis.html
