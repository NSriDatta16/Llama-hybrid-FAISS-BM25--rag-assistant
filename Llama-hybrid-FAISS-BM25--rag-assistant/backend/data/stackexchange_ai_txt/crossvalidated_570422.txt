The article from Pearl on The seven tools of causal inference, with reflections on Machine Learning is probably a concise enough intro to get you started. In a way, I would suggest ignoring the "ML" part of your question and first focusing on the "Causal" part. The principles will be the same and ML, isn't a panacea, if our causal assumptions are violated when using a "simple Stats" model, using an "advanced ML" model will fail just as well. Starting off with Cunningham's The Mixtape book or Huntington-Klein's The Effect book would be suitable suggestions for a new starter. (Both books are free online too.) For something more formal would be the What If book from Hernan & Robins and Elements of causal inference by Peters et al. These four freely available books would most likely cover the vast majority of CI use cases one come across.
