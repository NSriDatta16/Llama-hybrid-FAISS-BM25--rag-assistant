What are the more Advanced models for time series

As far as my studies go, I did: ARIMA in all sauces Dynamic linear models/state space model. The basics VAR(IMA) VECM I then tried to see if there is a model that combines some or most of the ideas underlying the previous models and I only found BVAR So my question is, what are the models that are currently "popular" in research nowadays? (If this question is too broad, then the models which are popular in economics.)
