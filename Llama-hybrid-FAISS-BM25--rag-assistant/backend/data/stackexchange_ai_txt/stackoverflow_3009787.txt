It all really depends on how you're testing this. On Firefox 3.6 and IE8, clicking on a link and then on a link that move you back to the first page will use the cache correctly with max-age. Hitting the Return key again in the URL field will show the same behavior. However, hitting F5 will ask again for the file but allows 304 responses. Hitting Ctrl+F5 will always ask again for the file, with Cache-Control and Pragma set to no-cache, forcing a 200 response.
