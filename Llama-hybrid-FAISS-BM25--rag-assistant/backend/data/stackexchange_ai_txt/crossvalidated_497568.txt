The average between what and what of what? Do you want an average time, or an average amplitude? You did not specify whether you want a probability density function or not, and this is a statistical site, not a mathematical site, so the answer is in terms of statistics. Edit: After the OP explained the question well enough to specify what was actually being asked, it turns out that the question seems to be an algebra question, not a stats question. The formula for compound interest is $$P \,\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{\,n\;t}\;\;,$$ where $P$ is the initial principal balance, $r$ is the interest rate, $n$ is the number of times interest is compounded per time period, and $t$ is the number of time periods. Since the population is eating food, we organize the principal to be the amount of food consumed in any time period to be $P$ . Then, the total amount is merely the the sum of the increasing principal for each period, which we can write as $$\Sigma_{i=1}^n P \,\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{\,n\;t}\;\;,$$ Now, if instead we desire the integral solution (as in continuous compounding), we take the limit as $n$ goes to infinity: $$\underset{n\to \infty }{\text{lim}}P \left(\frac{r}{n}+1\right)^{n\, \tau }=P\, e^{r\, \tau }$$ The integral from $\tau$ goes from $0$ to $t$ is then $$\int_0^t P e^{r \tau } \, d\tau=\frac{P \left(e^{r t}-1\right)}{r}$$ (Note the use of tau, $\tau$ , as a dummy variable. This is a formal requirement for definite integration.) This seems to be the answer you sought. It is a statement equivalent to the total amount of food eaten by a "continuously" growing population up to time $t$ . In other words, $$F(t)=P\frac{e^{r t}-1}{r},$$ where $r$ is the population growth rate assumed equal to the food eating growth rate per unit time period, $t$ is in time periods, $F(t)$ is the total amount of food eaten from time is zero to $t$ , and $P$ is the rate of food consumption of an initial population per time period, for example tons of food eaten per year for 10,000 people, if the rate is in years, where we do not need to know exactly what the population is, just the rate at which a fixed number of people eat food. Note, you did not ask for what the population is at any time, but it's growth rate is assumed to be identical to $r$ . However, if you want that number then it is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which food is eaten, which latter is $P e^{r\,t}$ , as above. Put some numbers in and check it for yourself. It is, in any case, a math problem and seems to have nothing to do with stats per se . Old answer, under the assumption that the question was statistical follows. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case: The indefinite integral is $$\int p r^t \, dt=\frac{p r^t}{\ln (r)}$$ The definite integral between $x=0$ and $x=t$ is $$\int_0^t p r^x \, dx=\frac{p r^t}{\ln (r)}\;\;,$$ where $x$ is a dummy variable for time, and $t$ is the elapsed time. As a probability density function from $p r^t$ , we write the function $$f(t)=-r^t \ln(r)\text{ for }r because by definition $\int_0^{\infty } -r^t \ln (r) \, dt=1,$ for $r . Notice that the variable $p$ has disappeared. It is not needed for a density, but if you wish to scale the density to have a particular amplitude (for example for curve fitting or for scaling to match some other amplitude), then multiply the density by $p$ . The cumulative density function is $$F(t)=1-r^t\text{ for } r Now finally, the mean value of the independent variable of a density function is $\overline{f(t)}=\int_0^\infty t f(t) dt$ , thus (assuming $t$ is time) is the mean residence time (MRT), equal to $$\text{MRT}_{f(t)}=r\;\;.$$ At this point, you must specify which average you want: an average functional height or an "averaged" time. There is generally not an incomplete residence time from $x=0,t$ , so there is some question as to what that would mean. Why do you want what you asked for, and what were you asking?
