Unbalanced Panel Data Machine Learning

Are there any methods in R that can handle unbalanced panel data for classification tasks? See the data below. I am trying to predict likelihood of failure (column C) using all the other data available. Suppose I have different groups of units (column B) each with different intervals for time (Column A). I'd like to use a mixed effect logistic regression model, but because the intervals and frequencies are different each group, the data is highly unbalanced. I've considered creating new features to extract the important elements of the date column (e.g. day of week, weekday/weekend, number of times group has appeared in time series, etc.), but I do not want to potentially lose the longitudinal aspect of the data. Is there a machine learning algorithm that would be better suited for this task? edit: in the real dataset, there is only one failure per group, but most times, no failures per group. Also, if there is a failure, it will happen on the last date listed for that group.
