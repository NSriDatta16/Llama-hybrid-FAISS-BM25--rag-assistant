What part of an ARMA model requires a stationary time series - the AR or the MA? The AR parte require stationarity condition. As said in comments, the MA is inherently stationary; usual require for MA is invertibility. Could I use a non-stationary time series with simply an Autoregressive model? For non-stationary case extensions like ARIMA was proposed. However, for example, if your series is an $ARIMA(p,1,q)$ process you can take the first difference and model it with ARMA.
