White-box: pros: simple (very natural concept) you have more control over things cons: requires intrinsic knowledge on component internals can be difficult to implement (OO inheritance constraints) sometimes it leads to broken\incorrect inheritance chains Black-box: pros: low coupling (gives late binding and other goodies) cons: not obvious (code is much harder to understand) interfaces are more fragile than classes (i.e. interfaces vs inheritance)
