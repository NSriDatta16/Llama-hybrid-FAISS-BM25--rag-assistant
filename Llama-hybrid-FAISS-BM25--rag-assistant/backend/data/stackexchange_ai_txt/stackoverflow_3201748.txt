Get Package Name of Generic Type Argument

How can I get the package name (in general, the class) of a generic type argument? I have a class similar to this: public class MyClass {} What I'd like to do is something like this (non-working pseudo-Java): return T.class.getPackage().getName(); I need this, since JAXB needs this as the context path ( JAXBContext.newInstance(String) method). Of course I'm open to more elegant ways of working with JAXBContext .
