How can i use HTML5 local storage along side PHP, use that for php sessions, and store other information that php uses

I have been looking on the web for some time now and HTML5 local storage seems to look like something useful to me and a solution to my problem that I am having with PHP sessions, the problem is that they are not consistent even if I set them to remember me the next time I come to my home page I am taken to the login page, this is not always, but often, PHP sessions are proving inconsistent for me. I would like to know if i can use local storage for consistent session storage that php can use, all the examples i have seen on the web use javascript.
