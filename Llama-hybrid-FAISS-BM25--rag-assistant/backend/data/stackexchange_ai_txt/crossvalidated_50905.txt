What is meant by the "level" of a time series?

In much of the literature I'm studying it's one of those terms that occurs frequently yet without a rigorous definition to be found. Specifically, I am told: For time-indexed random variables (RVs) $\{X_t\}$, the additive decomposition model is given as $$X_t = {ll}(X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, \ldots) + {fc}(X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}, \ldots, \varepsilon_t, \varepsilon_{t-1}, \ldots)$$ where $ll$ is the long-term level , which is a stochastic process and can be visualised as a smoothed version of $\{X_t\}$, not to be confused with trends which are deterministic patterns $fc$ is the fluctuation component which represents changes in local level , assumed stationary and with zero mean level $\{\varepsilon_t\}$ are innovations , and are IID mean-zero RVs But what is the difference in meaning between trend vs. long-term level vs. local level vs. mean level ? Additionally, aren't the fluctutation component and innovations modelling the same thing, which is the noise associated with each observation? So why complicate things by including both?
