If I understand your interpretation, it is accurate. Inside a function static means " allocate data segment memory so the value persists between function calls and so that all function instances (think, recursion or threads) share the same actual storage ." This matters a lot if a previous value is used in a later function call or if a reference is leaked out of the function by an external call or by returning a pointer.
