Atari is probably a bad example here, since it is actually a discrete game running at some constant framerate. Of course there are many other control problems such as "inverted pendulum" which can be formulated as a continuous time environment. Also note that the performance of Q-learning quickly degrades as the delta between time-steps decreases (and the environment approaches a continuous version), since at the limit $Q(s,a) = V(s)$ , subject to some conditions -- see "Making Deep Q-learning approaches robust to time discretization"
