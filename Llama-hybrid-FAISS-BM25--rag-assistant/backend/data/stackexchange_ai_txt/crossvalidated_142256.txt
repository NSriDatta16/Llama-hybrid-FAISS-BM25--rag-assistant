Why does adding independent variables make all independent variables insignificant?

I am running a logistic regression in Stata to try to determine which independent variables potentially cause a response in a binary dependent variable. When I run certain independent variables against the dependent variable I get very high significances around $p=.005$. However, when I add all of my variables together into one logistic regression equation all of the significances spike to $.1$ or higher, and many go from $.05$ to $.5$ or higher. It seems that the more variables added, the lower the significance goes, even if the variables are all significant by themselves against the dependent binary variable.
