Splitting a sentence to meaningful parts

I have the following sentence query = u'tell me about people in konoha who have wind style chakra and are above jonin level' I want to split the above sentence into the following three parts [ "tell me about people in konoha", "who have wind style chakra", "and are above jonin level" ] I have looked into sent tokenizers in spacy and nltk , but they are not giving me the desired results. I am just a beginner in nlp and machine learning and have very limited knowledge so far. It would be awesome if you could direct me to some techniques or available packages through which I could achieve the above results. EDIT I'll be having question-like queries like the one above where I would be asking for details about the subject based on some constraints In the above query the subject was people in Konoha and the constraints are have wind style chakra and above jonin level I want to extract such relationships from similar queries.
