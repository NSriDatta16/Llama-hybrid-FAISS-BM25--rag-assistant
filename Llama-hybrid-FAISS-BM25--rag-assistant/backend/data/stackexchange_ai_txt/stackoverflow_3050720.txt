You might try the Enterprise Library 's Caching Application Block . It's easy to use, stores in memory and, if you ever need to later, it supports adding a backup location for persisting beyond the life of the application (such as to a database, isolated storage, file, etc.) and even encryption too. Use EntLib 3.1 if you're stuck with .NET 2.0. There's not much new (for caching, at least) in the newer EntLibs aside from better customization support.
