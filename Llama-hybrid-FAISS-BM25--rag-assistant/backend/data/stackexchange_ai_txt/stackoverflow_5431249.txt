The only way that 2*4+6-3/2 will be stored on the "stack" in standard C++ is like: #include int main() { std::stack s; s.push(2*4+6-3/2); } The value 13 is stored in the stack. Now if, as I suspect, you were not in fact referring to stack but to statically-allocated objects (don't forget, C++ doesn't care where they go physically), then you should consider that "2*4+6-3/2" is an rvalue (a temporary , in this case). Only when assigned to a variable will storage take place. And then, the literals will be evaluated to produce the single value "13". The mathematical expression will not be kept.
