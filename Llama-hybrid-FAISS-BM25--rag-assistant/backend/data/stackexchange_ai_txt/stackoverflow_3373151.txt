Remote Address Parameter in Zend_Http_Client

Am developing a public site that uses the Zend_Http_Client to access remote logic.Is there a property/way in the Client adapter that I could set the remote address of the user browsing the site? Currently am using this workaround which combines both remote address and remote useragent. $client = new Zend_Http_Client(); $client->setConfig(array( 'useragent' => 'Get Remote Address'.'Get User Agent', )); Is there a specific property for remote address?
