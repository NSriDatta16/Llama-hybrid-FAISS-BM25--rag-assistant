Recursion for user input - elegant or strange?

Dev-cpp comes with an example program Jackpot, which has a GetResults function in it: void GetResults () { . . . else if (i>j) { cout Is this an elegant way of repeatedly asking for user input? Sure it is more readable than wrapping the ~20 lines around with a do-while loop. I tend to like it but I don't see such a thing often, so I'm not sure. What's your opinion? EDIT: In your example, recursion depth is prevented by the number of lives, so that seems OK as this won't get bigger than 1000 or even 100 - this is exactly why I have considered it, but now I can see it was a rather stupid idea :) I wonder who put this in an example program ... Thanks for the input guys!
