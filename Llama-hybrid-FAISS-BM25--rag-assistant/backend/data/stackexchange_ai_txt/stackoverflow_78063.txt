You should definitely look at OSGi . It aims at being the component/plugin mechanism for Java. It allows you to modularize your code (in so-called bundles) and update bundles at runtime. You can also completely hide implementation packages from unwanted access by other bundles, eg. only provide the API. Eclipse was the first major open-source project to implement and use OSGi, but they didn't fully leverage it (no plugin installations/updates without restarts). If you start from scratch though, it will give you a very good framework for a plugin system. Apache Felix is a complete open-source implementation (and there are others, such as Eclipse Equinox ).
