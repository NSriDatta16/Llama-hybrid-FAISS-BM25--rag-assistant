Can we calculate the theoretical stationary distribution from a continuous Markov chain?

I have the transition distribution $p(X_{t+1}|X_t=x_t) = \text{N}(\phi x_t,1)$ where $âˆ’1 . Can we calculate the stationary distribution and its mean and variance? I know I can do that if the Markov chain is discrete, by multiplying the transition probability matrix $Q$ many times. How can I do that if the transition probability is continuous? I am talking in general not just for this example. Can we calculate the theoretical stationary distribution of a continuous Markov chain if we have the transition distribution?
