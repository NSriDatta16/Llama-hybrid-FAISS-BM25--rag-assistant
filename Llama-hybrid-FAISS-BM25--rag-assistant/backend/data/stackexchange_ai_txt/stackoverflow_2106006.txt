jquery droppable accept where not parent

I'm trying to figure out how to write a statement which will stop the jQuery droppable function if the the dragged element is the parent. Basically what I have is a table, and each cell has the id of x-axis:eq+'-'+y-axis:eq. (x over-x-down). When the user drags an element to a different cell, I update the info, so if you drag from cell 3-3 to 3-4, I update the data. However, if the user starts dragging from 3-3, and then stops dragging still within the 3-3 cell, I want to prevent the droppable function from firing. I've been looking at using the 'accept' function, but can't figure out how to say !jQuery('td#3-3') Here's what I've got jQuery('div','table').draggable({axis:'y', containment: 'table'}); var cellId=jQuery(this).parents('td').attr('id'); jQuery('td','table').droppable({ accept : !jQuery('td#'+cellId), drop: function(){ jQuery.ajax({ update stuff in db}); } });
