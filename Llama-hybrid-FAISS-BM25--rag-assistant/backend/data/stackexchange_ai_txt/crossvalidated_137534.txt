It is obviously ill posed as there is no unique mathematical solution to the problem. The parameters can be estimated in infinitely many ways. Obviously, the empirical frequencies are natural estimators. If something can be assume on the $\pi$s, then other options become available. Say, if $p$ belongs to some low dimensional parametric family ($ If you are not willing to assume a finite dimensional parametric family, you can still add regularization by assuming the marginal distribution of $\pi$s. This corresponds to a Bayesian approach. Say, you assume $\pi$s are beta distributed, you could use the mean (or the mode, or the median) of the posterior distribution of $\pi$ given the observed frequency of category $i$ as an estimate: $$ \pi \sim Q \;; \hat{\pi}_i:=\mathbb{E}[Q|x_i,N] $$
