How can I make a XAML Slider element snap to allowed values only?

I have a slider with minimum value 0 and maximum value 1 . When I currently slide it, the value gets set to a decimal value between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.2342343 . However, I want the value to only be either 0 or 1 (so that my ViewModel property will register the change only if it is 0 or 1 and not multiple times as the user drags it from 0 to 1). How can I make the slider value only be 0 or 1? I tried SmallChange, LargeChange and SnapsToDevicePixels, but none of these work.
