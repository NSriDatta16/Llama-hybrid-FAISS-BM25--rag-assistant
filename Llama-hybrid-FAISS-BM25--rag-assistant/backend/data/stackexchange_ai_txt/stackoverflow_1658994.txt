PHP: Create array of arrays, ignoring empty arrays

I need to create an array of arrays. I have been using array_map(null,$a,$b,$c) to do this and it works fine, however, it doesn't work if one of the mapped arrays doesn't exist. To get around this problem I have used: $myArray= array(); if (isset($a)) { array_push($myArray,$a); } if (isset($b)) { array_push($myArray,$b); } if (isset($c)) { array_push($myArray,$c); } Is there a more elegant/shorter method of writing this? I've tried applying some functions via array_map($function,$a,$b,$c) but with no luck.
