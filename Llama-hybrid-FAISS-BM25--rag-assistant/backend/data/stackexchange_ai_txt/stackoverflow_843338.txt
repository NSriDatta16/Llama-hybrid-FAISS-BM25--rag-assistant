Why doesn't UIView.exclusiveTouch work?

In one of my iPhone projects, I have three views that you can move around by touching and dragging. However, I want to stop the user from moving two views at the same time, by using two fingers. I have therefore tried to experiment with UIView.exclusiveTouch, without any success. To understand how the property works, I created a brand new project, with the following code in the view controller: - (void)loadView { self.view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 460)]; UIButton* a = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeInfoDark]; [a addTarget:self action:@selector(hej:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; a.center = CGPointMake(50, 50); a.multipleTouchEnabled = YES; UIButton* b = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeInfoDark]; [b addTarget:self action:@selector(hej:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; b.center = CGPointMake(200, 50); b.multipleTouchEnabled = YES; a.exclusiveTouch = YES; [self.view addSubview:a]; [self.view addSubview:b]; } - (void)hej:(id)sender { NSLog(@"hej: %@", sender); } When running this, hej: gets called, with different senders, when pressing any of the buttons - even though one of them has exclusiveTouch set to YES. I've tried commenting the multipleTouchEnabled-lines, to no avail. Can somebody explain to me what I'm missing here? Thanks, Eli
