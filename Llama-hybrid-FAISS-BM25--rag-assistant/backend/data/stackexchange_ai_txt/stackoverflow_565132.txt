A major roadblock for Java Webstart is probably that you still need to have a JVM installed before it can even attempt to download and start your application. Everyone has a browser. Not everyone has a JVM. Edit: I've since acquired some hands-on webstart experience and can now add these two points: The Deployment Toolkit script and the modularized JVM released somewhere around Java 1.6u10 make the JVM requirement less problematic since it can automatically download a JVM and the API core and start the program wile downloading the rest. Web Start is seriously buggy. Even among the Java 1.6 releases there was one which downloaded the entire app every time, and another which downloaded it and then failed with an obscure error message. All in all, I cannot really recommend relying on such a fragile system.
