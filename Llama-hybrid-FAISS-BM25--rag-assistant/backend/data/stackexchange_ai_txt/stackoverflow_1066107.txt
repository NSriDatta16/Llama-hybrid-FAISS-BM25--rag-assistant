NCover Exclusion Rules

I have a couple of questions related to NCover: 1) I'm using MSBuild to build my project. In my .proj file I specify exclusions like so: Assembly /Testing.*/i true In terms of the exclusion type, if I have a .exe file, would my pattern match it as well as a DLL? 2) Does NCover 2.1.0.0, support coverage inclusions (i.e. I specify one exe or dll and it only checks that one)?
