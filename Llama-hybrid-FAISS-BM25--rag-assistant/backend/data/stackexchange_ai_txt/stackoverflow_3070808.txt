I think storage costs are going to be your biggest concern. Even if you go the cloud route I doubt you will be able to manage costs for that amount of data. My suggestion would be to move the data to ultra-cheap storage and deploy a solution that can operate on that data in an efficient manner. For example, you could move log files from your server(s) to a local machine with a huge hard drive (and appropriate backup solution) and then run tools locally that can analyze the data. Log parser is effective if you can operate against a small subset of that data. You can run a database locally but even optimized queries might run slowly. You might consider purchasing a log analysis tool like WebLog Expert to operate against these files.
