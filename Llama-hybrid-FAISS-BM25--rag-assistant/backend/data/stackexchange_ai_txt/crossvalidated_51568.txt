I finally found a literature solution to my problem Bayesian models for multiple outcomes nested in domains by Thurston et al. 2009. They propose a hierarchical model for single or multiple domains that reflects the domain dependent nature of the variables. It incorporates random effects for individuals and individuals across domains (if there are multiple domains). It can also be easily extended to include repeated measures or longitudinal designs. Note: I'll post a JAGS model on here to complete the answer soon
