Answer for the OP's edification. It is known that $$\left(\frac 16 - \frac{1}{6^3}\right)\phi(6) ~ 6) ~ where $\phi(6)$ is the value of the standard normal density function evaluated at $6$ . If your tables of the value of the standard normal density function extend only up to $z=3$ or $3.49$ , use the formula $$\phi(6) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-6^2/2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-18}$$ to evaluate $\phi(6)$ -- use a "scientific" calculator, not a four-function calculator for this. You should get an upper bound and a lower bound on $P(Z > 6)$ that differ by very little. Use either (or their average) as the estimate of $P(Z >6)$ . It is also known that $P(Z>6) = P(Z snd so the same calculation suffices for both answers. And there you have it: no muss, no fuss, no nonsense about value of function versus probability. Original answer for everyone else For $z>0$ , there are known upper bounds $\frac 1z \phi(z)$ and lower bounds $\left(\frac 1z - \frac{1}{z^3}\right)\phi(z)$ on $Q((z) \stackrel{\Delta}{=} P\{Z > z\}$ . See, for example, this answer over on math.SE for a derivation. Here, $\phi(z)$ is the value of the standard normal density function at $z$ . So, try evaluating the bounds when $z = 6$ (using a calculator instead of R since you want to avoid the use of R). You will probably get bounds that differ by very little, and you could use either value (or their average if you like) as your answer. Presumably you are aware that $P\{Z > z\}$ and $P\{Z have the same value, and so the same answer will work for both calculations.
