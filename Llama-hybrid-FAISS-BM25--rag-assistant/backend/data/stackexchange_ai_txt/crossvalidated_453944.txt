Using caret::sbf to apply feature selection and classification

I'm aiming to use caret::sbf to filter a large number of predictors before using different machine learning models to predict a binary outcome. I would also like to optimise tuning parameters and do some internal cross-validation. Below is an example code using SVM with a simple grid search and cv: data = twoClassSim(n = 100, linearVars = 300) fit However, I get the following error code: Error in { : task 1 failed - "Only one model should be specified in tuneGrid with no resampling" Can anyone explain why this is happening? I have been through the caret vignettes and can't seem to find an answer. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
