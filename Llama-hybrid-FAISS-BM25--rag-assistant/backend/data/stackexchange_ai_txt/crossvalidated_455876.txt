If I understand you correctly your hypotheses is that: "people who score high on STER are more likely to have a transpersonal experience" Is this correct? To find the appropriate statistical tool to test this hypothesis we need to know what your data looks like. How did you quantify both STER and transpersonal experience? Because I don't know enough details to answer the questions I can't give you an answer yet, I can do some assumptions though: I can guess that you used likert and verbal frequency scales to measure STER and a binomial scale that measures if someone either had or didn't have a transpersonal experience? In this case the very simple answer would be use logistic regression because your outcome variable is categorical and your input variable is numerical. However, when using likert of verbal frequency scales the interpretation of your data can influence the results a lot. Treating a 5 point likert scale as a continues variable is a bit of a stretch, but it is in most behaviorial sciences common practise to do so. Also when sampling from several kinds of venues you might want to include the venue as a variable in your analyses to acount for the correlation between people from the same venue. I can easily go on for another couple of pages about how to interpret and analyse this kind of data but I first need to know more about how you measured your variables and how your data and hypotheses looks like.
