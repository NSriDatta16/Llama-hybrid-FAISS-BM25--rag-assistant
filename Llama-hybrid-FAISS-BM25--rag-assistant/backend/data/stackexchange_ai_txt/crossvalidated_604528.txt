I would say it's basically representation learning followed by classification at the end. Consider an Image Classification Problem. -> We have to find some way(some characteristics/attributes) to tell if the image is a dog or a cat (which in our terms is referred to as features ) -> Extracting the useful features is the most important part of machine learning & we call this extraction of features as representation learning (i.e basically extracting the useful features from the raw data). -> For the given example (dog vs cat), it's difficult for the model to get hold of the most important features in the first glance itself (i.e we can't use the pixel information and extract the target features directly). -> Which leads us to the deep learning concept, where we look to extract the features in stages/layers (by using the previous layers information). In our problem, it would look something like: Layer 1 - learns about the edges (which gives an outline of the object in the image) Layer 2 - learns about the corners & contours (which gives information about the shapes in image) Layer 3 - learn about the object parts (legs, nose etc) Final Layer - which basically tries to classify the data/features (that it learned from the previous layers)
