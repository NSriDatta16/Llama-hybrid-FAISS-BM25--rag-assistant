online detection of plateaus in time series

I need to detect plateaus in time series data online. The data I am working with represents the magnitude of acceleration of a tri-axis accelerometer. I want to find a reference time window that I can use for calibration purposes. Because of that, the system must not move and hence only gravity should influence the system. How can I find such plateaus or is there even a more principled approach that I can take?
