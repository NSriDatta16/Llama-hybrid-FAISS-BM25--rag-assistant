The rejection rate is only indirectly linked to convergence. Broadly speaking, diagnostics such as the rejection rate or autocorrelation plots tell you about whether your MCMC works efficiently, while convergence diagnostics and visual inspections of the trace tell you if your sampler has converged. If you have high rejection rate, the sampler will take longer to converge, but if your diagnostics indicate convergence (despite high rejection rate), there is no more reason to doubt that than in a case of low rejection rate. So, the answer to your question is: no, the acceptance rate does not affect the reliability of standard convergence criteria. As a side note - have you tried the BayesianTools R package (disclaimer - I'm one of the developers) - I wouldn't be surprised if the differential evolution samplers in this package (default) would work better for your problem.
