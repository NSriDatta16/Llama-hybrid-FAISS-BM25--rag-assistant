If you are using Framework 4.0, you have the option of working with a MemoryMappedFile . Memory mapped files can be backed by a physical file, or by the Windows swap file. Memory mapped files act like an in-memory stream, transparently swapping data to/from the backing storage if and when required. If you are not using Framework 4.0, you can still use this option, but you will need to either write your own or find an exsiting wrapper. I expect there are plenty on The Code Project .
