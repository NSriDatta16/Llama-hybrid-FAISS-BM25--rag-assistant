What is meant by syntactically distinct hypotheses?

While reading about Concept Learning , in Chapter 2 of the book Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell , I came across this term ( syntactically distinct hypotheses ). I tried looking it up on Google but I could not find any reasonable explanation for this term. It will be really helpful if anyone can explain because this term is used in Machine Learning literature quite a number of times.
