No, I'm not quite sure what you are after, but you could provide normal form controls to add an additional item to the list (i.e. outside the markup of the ListView), or use a third party grid which provides in place editing such as the Telerik RadGridView or the Infragistics XamDataGrid . You could also swap out the CellTemplate based on the currently selected ListViewItem as described here .
