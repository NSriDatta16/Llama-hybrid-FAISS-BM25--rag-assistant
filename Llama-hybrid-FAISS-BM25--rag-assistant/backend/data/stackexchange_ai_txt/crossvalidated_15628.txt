Now that it is clear that you have a weighting function, I suggest that you use Bayesian intervals (often called credible intervals) with the weighting function being the prior. Multiply that by the likelihood function provided by your results to get the posterior. Any interval containing 95% of the area under that posterior distribution is a 95% credible interval. The likelihood function is easily calculated: start with a uniform (0,1) indicating no data and so no evidence. For each photon received you multiply the distribution by y=x and for each photon sent but not received multiply it by y=1-x. When you've done that for all of the photons sent you will have the likelihood function representing the evidence inherent in your data. You can scale it to a maximum of 1 to look conventional, if you like. [Of course, y represents the likelihood and x is the hypothetical probability of success in each trial.] There is a formula for the likelihood function, but I find it easier to understand in the way I've expressed it here.
