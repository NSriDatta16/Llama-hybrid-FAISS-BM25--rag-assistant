What does it mean for a time series to be autocorrelated?

I am trying to become more familiar with time series analysis. I am reading through Dangers and uses of cross-correlation in analyzing time series in perception, performance, movement, and neuroscience: The importance of constructing transfer function autoregressive models by Dean and Dunsmuir, and they mention time series that are "individually autocorrelated". What does this term mean? I am familiar with computing the autocorrelation function of a time series as a function of time lag, but I am not sure what it means for a time series to itself be autocorrelated. Is there just some criteria you check with the autocorrelation function to say whether or not the whole time series is autocorrelated?
