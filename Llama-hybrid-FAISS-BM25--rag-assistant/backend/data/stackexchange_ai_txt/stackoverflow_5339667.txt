web page design

These days I am building a web site,and I am crazing by the page design. For example: There is a page when can be spitted to two parts,the left and the right. The left is some menus,and the right is the main content. When user click one menu in the left,the content in the right should be changed accordingly. However,not all the contents own the same structure,so how to do? Suppose the menu are listed below: My group product01 product02 My information My post my reply modify my information. So ,how to design? Use the jsp:include / tiles ? but no matter use whatever, I have to create so many jsp fragment? What is the best practice these days?
