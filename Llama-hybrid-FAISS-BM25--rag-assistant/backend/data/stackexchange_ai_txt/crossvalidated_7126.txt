Your distribution is parametric, and you should just store the parameters that are sufficient statistics, if you can identify them. That includes the distribution family. For a time series, you can take advantage of autocorrelation and store the parameters of the predictive distribution conditional on its previous values. The entropy of the prior (predictive) distribution of the parameters determines the upper bound for compression strength, but you may not need to compress them further. If you do, use arithmetic compression. Decreasing entropy, say by discretizing quantiles, will give greater compression.
