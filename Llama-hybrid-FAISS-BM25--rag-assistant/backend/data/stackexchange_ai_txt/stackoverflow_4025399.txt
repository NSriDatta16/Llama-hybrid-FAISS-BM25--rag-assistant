Purists would say that tables should only be used for tabular data. Your site is not tabular data, it's a layout, so using a table here is a hack. It's a perfectly fine hack if it works, but it may not ultimately be the cleanest solution. The pragmatic part of me (which is much bigger than the standards Nazi in me) says there might be a cleaner approach using CSS. This could eliminate the need to clutter your source with unnecessary table cruft. You really have two divisions, each with paragraphs containing images, links, and text. It would be ideal if your HTML didn't have to contain anything but that. If you use CSS well, you can get exactly that result: http://www.aharrisbooks.net/demo/sample.html Use 'view source' to see the HTML and CSS code. A few notes: I used the 'fieldset' element (which is supposed to be used in forms, but it works well here) I guessed on colors Modify the CSS to get exactly the effect you're looking for I (obviously) used only one icon, but the same effect will work for the whole page Only one div is needed (even that isn't necessary, but it looks nice to center content on the page What I like about this design is how clean it keeps the HTML. Best of luck, and feel free to drop a line if you have questions. PS for more fun, add the following CSS3 syntax to the fieldset box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #333; border-radius: 10px; -moz-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #333; -moz-border-radius: 10px; -webkit-box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #333; -webkit-border-radius: 10px; These attributes add rounded corners and drop shadows for a very nice effect. It won't work in IE, but the other recent browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and most mobile browsers) will see really nice effects. Yay for CSS3!
