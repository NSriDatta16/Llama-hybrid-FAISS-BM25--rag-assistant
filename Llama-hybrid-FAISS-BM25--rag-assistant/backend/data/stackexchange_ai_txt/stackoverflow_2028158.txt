There is only a short list of characters that can be safely carried through in a path component of a URL. unreserved = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~" All the other characters will have to be either removed (if you're creating a "slug") or escaped. Removal can be done with the regex /[^a-zA-Z0-9-._~]/ . Escaping can be done with encodeURIComponent() . If you wish to achieve an equivalent of ICONV transliteration (that is, turning é into e and € into EUR ), you'll have to do your own, although you can leverage existing solutions and perhaps transform a transliteration table to JS format.
