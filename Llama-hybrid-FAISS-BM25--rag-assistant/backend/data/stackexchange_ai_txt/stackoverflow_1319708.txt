Key value pairs in C# Params

I'm looking for a way to have a function such as: myFunction({"Key", value}, {"Key2", value}); I'm sure there's something with anonymous types that would be pretty easy, but I'm not seeing it. The only solution I can think of is to have a params KeyValuePair [] pairs parameter, but that ends up being something similar to: myFunction(new KeyValuePair ("Key", value), new KeyValuePair ("Key2", value)); Which is, admittedly, much uglier. EDIT: To clarify, I'm writing a Message class to pass between 2 different systems. It contains a ushort specifying the the Message Type, and a dictionary of string to object for "Data" associated with the message. I'd like to be able to pass all this information in the constructor, so I am able to do this: Agent.SendMessage(new Message(MessageTypes.SomethingHappened, "A", x, "B", y, "C", z)); or similar syntax.
