It's all right to use constants to represent abstract values, but quite another to represent constructs in your own language. const int FIRST_ROW = 0 doesn't make sense. const int MINIMUM_WIDGET_COUNT = 0 makes more sense. The presumption that you should follow a coding standard makes sense. (That is, coding standards are presumptively correct within an organization.) Slavishly following it when the presumption isn't met doesn't make sense. So I agree with the earlier posters that some of the smelly constants probably resulted from following a coding standard ("no magic numbers") to the letter without exception. That's the problem here.
