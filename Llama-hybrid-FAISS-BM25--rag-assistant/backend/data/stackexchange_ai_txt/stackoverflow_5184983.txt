Protocol buffers for serializing several data objects of a post/comment into a single serialized piece of data

I am developing a social application on top of Java and Cassandra database. I need to store posts/comments of the user's shared posts, in database for which I am looking to serialize data per single comment/post & then store serialized data in the database in one column. Thus for each comment, there'll be a single column that stores this data in serialized format:- Comment data(String around 700 characters max) CommentorId (long type) CommentTime (timestamp) Similarly a posts' data will be serialized and stored as a single column. Fast Deserialization would be required at each retrieval of that post by the frontend. I am looking at protocol buffers as the probable solution for this. Would like to know whether choosing protocol buffers for this task is the right choice or not. I am looking for a high performance & fast serialization & deserialization algorithm that can serve for heavy usage in the application. Also, is it possible to send the data in serialized format, to client and then there could it be deserialized ? server to client communication?
