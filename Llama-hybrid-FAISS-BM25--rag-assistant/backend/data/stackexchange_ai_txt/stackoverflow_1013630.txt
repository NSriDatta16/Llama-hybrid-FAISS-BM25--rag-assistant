Can you tell what about those queries got slower? New access plans? Same plans but they perform slower? Do they execute slower or are they suspended more? Did all queries got slower or just some? And last but not least, how do you know , ie. what exactly did you measure and how? Some of the usual suspects could be: The new storage is much slower (.mdf on slow disk, or on a busy disk) You changed the data structure during move (ie. some indexes did not get ported) You changed the data size (ie. compression options) resulting on more pages for the same data Did anything else change at the same time, new app code or anything the like? By extending the data size (you do no mention deleting the old tables) you are now trashing the buffer pool (did the page lifetime expectancy decreased in performance counters?)
