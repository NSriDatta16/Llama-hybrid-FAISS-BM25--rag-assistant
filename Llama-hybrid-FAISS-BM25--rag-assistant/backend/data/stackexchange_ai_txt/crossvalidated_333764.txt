I don't think this is possible in R (or in any other software). After all, the L stands for "loess", which is a local smoothing method. Every implementation of loess I have seen uses values on either side of the focal value. (loess is not limited to time series.) You could look at Single Exponential Smoothing, which is implemented as ses in the forecast package. Or an equivalent state space formulation via forecast::ets or smooth::es .
