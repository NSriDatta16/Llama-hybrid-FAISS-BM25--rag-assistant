The truth of the matter is that jQuery simply does not have a particularly elegant way to do what you want. While chaos' answer does work, you have to wonder whether the complicated selector (that would be about as slow as a selector can be in a complicated webpage) is worth it over the more verbose but faster filter function you have. This is not really that big of a deal, I am just personally weary of particularly long, convoluted selectors when I can avoid it. A different option is to create your own selector, since jQuery is awesome: jQuery.expr[':'].parents = function(a,i,m){ return jQuery(a).parents(m[3]).length The expr map is part of the Sizzle selector engine and documentation can be found here: Sizzle Custom Pseudo-Selectors
