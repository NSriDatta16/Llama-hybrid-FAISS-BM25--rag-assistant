The first time I looked into PRADO, I spent about 10 days using it and kept saying to myself: "This framework is amazing!". A couple of months later, I started working on a big project where the customer had chosen to use PRADO... And Hell began... As long as we kept using PRADO's base components, everything was perfect and development was fast. But as soon as the customer wanted an out-of-the-box thing, we literaly spent 2 to 3 times the amount of time we would have done it with another framework. And I'm not talking about big customizations. The PRADO framework forces the application to have a particular structure and workflow. If that logic is not working for you, then check out another framework.
