Variational Autoencoder and validation loss

I'm experimenting with Keras (Tensorflow backend) and Variational Autoencoder. My loss function is the classical one, i.e, the sum of reconstruction error and KL divergence. When I provide my model with validation data, Tensorboard shows a 'validation_loss', computed on validation data. I'm wondering what the correct form of 'loss' function on validation data should be; I think it should only contain the reconstruction error, not the KL part: is it correct? In other words, what would be the meaning of KL divergence on validation data?
