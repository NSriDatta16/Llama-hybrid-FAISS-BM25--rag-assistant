It depends on what you really want. Do you want to preserve schema information and database metadata? What about column names? On the other hand your current method should work fine for data storage as long as the schema and column order don't change, buy you should consider the case of some record with the "|" character in it and escape that value appropiately, and apply the corresponding logic when you read and parse the file back. You might want to look into Text::CSV for a fast, realiable and flexible implementation that does most of the work for you in both directions, both writing an reading the file.
