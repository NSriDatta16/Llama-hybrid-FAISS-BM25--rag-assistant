This may be a matter of taste, but having tried out Rspec I prefer using the built-in Rails testing framework along with a gem called Shoulda . In my opinion, that combination lets you write much clearer, more succinct and understandable tests than Rspec by far. But not everyone would agree. Shoulda's contexts let you organize your tests into logical hierarchies which really helps when you're trying to test all the possible paths some crazy, branching situation, like user logs in with right pw, wrong pw, right pw but registration not confirmed, etc. In addition be sure to install the ZenTest gem. That lets you just execute the command $ autotest and your tests will run automatically every time you change a file.
