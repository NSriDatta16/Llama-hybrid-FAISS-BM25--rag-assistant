Fitting multivariate models with lme4 or nlme is a bit fiddly, but solutions can be found in this document by Ben Bolker . Else if you want to stay in a frequentist framework, the mcglm package can handle multivariate models, even with non-normal distributions. A detailed tutorial should be published soon. If you are not familiar with design matrices, designing the matrix of random effects can be a bit tricky though. In a Bayesian framework, the MCMCglmm package is also very good at modelling multivariate traits incl. non-normal distributions, and handles random effects in a simpler way than mcglm does. Its use for multivariate models is also well described by Ben Bolker . But you first have to make yourself familiar with Markov chain Monte Carlo, as well as with the principles of Bayesian statistics. So either way, there might be a slow learning curve at the beginning, depending on your familiarity with either methods!
