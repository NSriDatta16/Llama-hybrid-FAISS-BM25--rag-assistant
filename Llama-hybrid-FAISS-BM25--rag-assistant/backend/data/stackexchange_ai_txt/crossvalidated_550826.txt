using Mann Whitney U test and t-test with multiple trials

I am testing some visualisations under two conditions and this is a between-subjects study, participants do two trials. Initially, I separated the trials and used a Mann Whitney U test to analyse my dependent variable (time). Now I have been advised to merge the two trials, Can I still use Mann Whitney? or will I have to change the test because now I have a repeated measure? participant condition time Task_type 0 1194 E 20.0 G 1 1194 E 70.0 S 0 1190 P 42.0 G 1 1190 P 30.0 S I am thinking I could calculate the average for each participant and then use the Mann Whitney U test, could this work? I have a similar question with another set of data that is ordinal and normally distributed and I used a t-test for that, can I calculate the average and use a t-test?
