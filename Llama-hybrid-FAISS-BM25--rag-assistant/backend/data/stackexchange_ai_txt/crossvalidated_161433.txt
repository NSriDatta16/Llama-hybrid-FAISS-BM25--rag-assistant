In addition to amoeba's nice answer, there is an even simpler way to see the equivalence. Again let $X$ be the data matrix of $N \times D$ size with $D$ variables in columns and $N$ data points in rows. Standard PCA corresponds to taking a singular value decomposition of the matrix $X = U \Sigma V^\top$ with $U$ the principal components of $X$. The singular value decomposition of the linear kernel $XX^\top = U \Sigma^2 U^\top$ has the same left singular vectors and so the same principal components.
