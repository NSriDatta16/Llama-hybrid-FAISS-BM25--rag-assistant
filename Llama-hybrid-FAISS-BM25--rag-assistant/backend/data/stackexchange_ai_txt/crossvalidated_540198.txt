I used the dividing by the mean method in my research because it's actually helpful in assessing the inequality across region. I'm doing a research which basically about assessing how some certain burden parameters are distributed across different territories in a region. This normalization method let me know how many folds compared to the average value of a burden does a certain region holds. Value of 2 would mean that a region is holding 2 times the average burden (overburden), a value of 0.5 would mean that a region is holding half of the average burden (underburden). The preferred situation is of course for every region to have the value close to 1 which would indicate low inequality of burden, because the value for all region is already close to the average value. I might be really late into this but hopefully my answer could somewhat be of any help.
