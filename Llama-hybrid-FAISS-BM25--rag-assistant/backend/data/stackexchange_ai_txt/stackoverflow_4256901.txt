Initialize the pointer fields in the structure to null pointers; as pointed out in the comments, memset is not the right option here - use c99 way or do it explicitly for each field. If reading a field fails for some reason, you should free the already allocated fields. For example, if reading average fails for a student and you decide to ignore that student's record, you should free his name fields to prevent memory leaks (assuming they're malloc'ed, of course).
