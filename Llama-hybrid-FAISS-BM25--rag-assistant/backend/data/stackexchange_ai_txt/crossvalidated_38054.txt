still trying in R with CI and predictions

I looked over the tutorial in R for prediction and decided to reword my question. I need the prediction on average for male with a 95%CI then repeat with maximal values using the variables status, income and verbal. Now If I did the predictions correctly shown below with the mean then the max values. But doesn't that give 2 prediction intervals and 2 confident intervals for both the average and max. values g2 ie..Average > g1 predict(g,g1, interval='confidence', level=.90) fit lwr upr 1 28.11506 19.7603 36.46983 > predict(g,g1, interval='prediction', level=.90) fit lwr upr 1 28.11506 -10.95281 67.18293 Max Values used: > predict(g,g2, interval='confidence', level=.90) fit lwr upr 1 71.30794 47.07516 95.54072 > predict(g,g2, interval='prediction', level=.90) fit lwr upr 1 71.30794 26.10037 116.5155 Do I need both the prediction and confidence interval? Question: how do I plot the CI to determine which is wider?
