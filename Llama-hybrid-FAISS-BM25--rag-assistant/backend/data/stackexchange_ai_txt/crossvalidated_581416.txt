Train the model using whole reviews, not just sentence by sentence. That seems to be your goal: the sentiment of the review as a whole. If you must use sentences, I think averaging is fine. Otherwise you could define your own function so long as you justify it, and the prediction is valid in your classification scheme (between 0 and 1 by the sounds). Adding up will lead to an invalid classification if you are classifying between 0 and 1 (e.g. 1 + 2*0.5 = 2... 200% positive sentiment?).
