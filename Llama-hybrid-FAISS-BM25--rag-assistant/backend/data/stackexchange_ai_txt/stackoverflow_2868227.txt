After much research, I have determined that although the System.Drawing namespace is not supported, it will probably work for many people (probably not for us due to the high volume of images manipulation that we do). However, what is supported is Windows Imaging Components , however it is not managed code though they do provide a thin .Net wrapper around the Win32 calls. Bertrand Le Roy's blog has an article on how to use it: The fastest way to resize images from ASP.NET. And itâ€™s (more) supported-ish . WIC seems to be significantly faster than GDI+. Bertrand also covers how to manipulate images uses WPF, which is not supported but uses WIC, seems to perform on par with direct WIC, and is probably easier to code. The article for that is: Resizing images from the server using WPF/WIC instead of GDI+ Both WIC and WPF require full trust so if you are working in a medium trust environment, you will be stuck with GDI+.
