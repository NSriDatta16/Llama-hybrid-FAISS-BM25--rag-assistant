Yes, there's no magic to this though. In your Java AJAX handler just return a forward or redirect to the JSP page you want. The response will then be available as the responseText in your AJAX callback. You can use JSP to generate just the elements you need as a sort of incomplete HTML fragment then returns this from your server-side handler. Then in your JavaScript callback you can insert the fragment into your existing HTML like this element.innerHTML = resp.responseText //element is the parent you want to insert to //resp is the parameter supplied to your callback
