Kalman filter is the analytical implementation of Bayesian filtering recursions for linear Gaussian state space models. For this model class the filtering density can be tracked in terms of finite-dimensional sufficient statistics which do not grow in time$^*$. So I would say that it is pretty Bayesian and as you stated it is considered in Bayesian context in general. However, the origins of Kalman filtering can be traced up to Gauss. He invented recursive least squares for prediction of orbits (Gauss, C. F. Theory of the Combination of Observations Least Subject to Errors (translated by G. W. Stewart). Philadelphia: SIAM Publishers, 1995.) which I assume can be considered frequentist or classical in some sense. $^*$(btw other exact finite-dimensional nonlinear filters exist like Benes, Daum filters but there is no Fisher-Koopman-Darmois-Pitman theorem for filtering). For general models your best bet is sequential Monte Carlo.
