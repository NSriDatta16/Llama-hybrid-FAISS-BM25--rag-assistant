Look at some of the other questions on writing compilers, such as learning-to-write-a-compiler , and having worked through something like the dragon book or Programming Language Pragmatics , you'll understand enough of LLVM or gnu lightning to use them as your back end. Don't try to write a C++ compiler unless you have several years to devote to the exercise; on the other hand creating something based on an existing back-end and expression templates might only take a couple of months.
