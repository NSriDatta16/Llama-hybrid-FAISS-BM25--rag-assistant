Github error: Repository under migration

There are two accounts on github I'd like to use. The first, my private one, is working correctly, I'm able to set up new repositorys, clone and push as I like. Then I signed up with a second user two days ago. It is meant to be my 'official' working account. So I try to set up some repositorys from this user. It seems to work, but all I get - instead of the usual set up instructions etc is: Repository under migration. The route for your user could not be found. Usually this means that your repositories are being migrated to a new storage server to better serve you. Your repository should be available again very soon. I tried forking another project too, but all I get is the same 'error' message. Working: xijo/reverse-markdown Still not working: echo-on-waves/test Anyone know how long this will last or what I'm doing wrong? I can't figure out the problem which makes setting up repositorys on two similar users working in different ways.. Thank you for your help! ;) Joe
