I'd choose the 'freeze and write a new app' route. Leverage as much VB6 code/methods as you can, or as you see fit, from the VB6 app. Sounds like you might go VB.NET, and some code might survive the upgrade. Either way, there are code converters that can help. Start redesigning at the database. Write scripts to transform the data into a normalized form that makes sense to you. Then start a module-by-module migration to a new application. If you can help it, don't make any more maintenance changes/fixes/enhancements to the new app.
