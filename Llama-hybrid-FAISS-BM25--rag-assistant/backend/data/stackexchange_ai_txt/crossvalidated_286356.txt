Logistic regression with categorical independent variables and binomial count dependent variables

The problem is from football. I have the full time goals(FTG), and shots on target minus goals(FST), as the dependent variables (integers). Team names, opponent team names (strings) and home field indicator (=1 if at home; =0 if away) are independent variables. I want to analyse the probability of a shot on target actually becomes a goal conditional on the independent variables. formula2='FTG+FST~Team+Opponent+Home' mod2 = smf.glm(formula2, data=df, family=sm.families.Binomial()).fit() It gives ValueError: The first guess on the deviance function returned a nan. This could be a boundary problem and should be reported. I would like to ask how to implement this logistic regression. Thanks a lot.
