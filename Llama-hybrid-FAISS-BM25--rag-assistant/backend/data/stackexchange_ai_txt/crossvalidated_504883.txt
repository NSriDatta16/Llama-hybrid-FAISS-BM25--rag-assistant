How to convert coefficients of logistic regression into score values when constructing scorecard?

I have built a logistic regression model which takes a dataframe of dummy values as an input and produces binary classification (0 for accept, 1 for default). I have already split all variables into ranges and calculated logistic regression coefficients for each of these ranges. Here is the sample of what my input looks like: (pictures are taken from this article ) And coefficients for these inputs (which are taken from the coefficients of logistic regression model): I want to convert these values into scores, but I am not sure how to accomplish this. I saw some texts and questions here that mention PDO and linear scaling. But I cant figure out how to actually produce score values. Any help would be appreciated
