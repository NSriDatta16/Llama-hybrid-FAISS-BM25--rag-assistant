Once you touch upon a row in one table.. You must create a image of the row you want to drag This could be done by editing didSelectRowAtIndexPath function from where you can actually determine which row was selected. then move that image along with your drag (by custom implementation of touches:Moved) CGPoint gesturepoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; imageview.centre = gesturepoint;
