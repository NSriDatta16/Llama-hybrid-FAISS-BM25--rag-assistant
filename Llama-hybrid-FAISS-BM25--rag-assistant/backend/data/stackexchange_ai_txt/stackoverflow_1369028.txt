The problem with "profiler 101" is that it embodies lots of ideas whose justification is more a matter of popularity than sound thinking. The biggest such idea is that the best way to find performance problems is by measuring performance. That is top-down thinking, and it is like trying to find waste in government by looking at each department's budget. An alternative is a bottom-up approach, such as picking several random units of either money or time and (most important) determining fully why each one is being spent. If there is waste, this will quickly find it. The reason is simple, if some percent (say 40%) is being wasted, then that percent of samples (on average) will show you precisely how it is being wasted. This is the language-agnostic method I use. ADDED: You may think a large fraction like 40% is unrealistic, because you can't imagine it, but it's entirely possible .
