I belive that better results in solo development one can achive with appropriate tools support and tasks that compensate lack of ohers people and help to organize working time. Any tool that generate metada with minimal create time cost describing your software is helpful. VCS and tools for tracking user actity/code changes history - very important is to add good commit messages mind-mapping tools for storing project related data (e.g. XMind), blacboard is useful too :) time tracking tools (e.g. Toggl.com) write a lot of acceptance test and use acceptance testing frameworks Of course these clues also fits in non solo development :)
