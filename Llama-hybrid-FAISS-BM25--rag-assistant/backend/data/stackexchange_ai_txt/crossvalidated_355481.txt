"for instance the number of products they sell may not make any difference to the predicted values of sales going forward" I disagree. The number of products they sell is called a retail assortment and usually has a significant effect on the revenu of a store (if you wanted to buy a new outfit, do you go to the store that has only 3 options or the store that has 30 options?) Can anyone suggest any types of models that might be appropriate? Bayesian Structural Time Series are good for this type of problem, where you can add other variables besides the time series to generate forecasts. Also most of the forecasts methods in R's Forecast package can take in exogenous variables (i.e. other variables besides the time series itself), I don't know how good they are though.
