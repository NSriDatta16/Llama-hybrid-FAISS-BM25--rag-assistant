You can derive Bayesian statistics from mathematical logic. See its axiomatization in logic at Cox, R. T. (1961). The Algebra of Probable Inference. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. I cannot answer how many statistics professors are required to study logic at a deep level. You can find its extension at Edwin Thompson Jaynes, Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, Cambridge University Press (2003). You can also pick up anything on decision theory and you are back in mathematical logic combined with a utility function.
