Magento email template format date of invoice

I'm trying to apply the german format of a date to a Magento email. I can get the invoice date with {{var invoice.created_at}} but that gives me "2010-05-21 15:46:24". I would like to have 21.05.2010 and PHP doesn't work in the templates. I'm totally new to Magento so please be patient :-P Greetz Spanky
