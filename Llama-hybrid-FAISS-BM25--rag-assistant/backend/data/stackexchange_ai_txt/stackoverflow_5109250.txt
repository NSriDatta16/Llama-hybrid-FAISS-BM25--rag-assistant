Programmatically move/animate a UITableView row from one position to another

I have a UITableView and I want to programmatically move one row from position N1 to position N2 and I would like it to animate from the old location to the new. I've looked through the UITableView documentation and I'm only seeing inserts, reloads, and deletes. Do you know of a way I can do this programmatically? A couple of notes: I know that I can animate the deletion from location N1 and animate the insertion to location N2 at the same time. That's my fallback, but I'd like the user to understand that it is truly moving from N1 to N2. I'm not talking about allowing the user to drag it from one place to another. I understand how to do that, I'm looking for a way to initiate and animate the move programmatically.
