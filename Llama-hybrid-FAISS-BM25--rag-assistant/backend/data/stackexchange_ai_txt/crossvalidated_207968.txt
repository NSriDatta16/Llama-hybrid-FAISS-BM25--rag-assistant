Cronbach's alpha vs. Average Item-Sum correlation?

I have heard that Cronbach's alpha is used to measure reliability of a test (to check if a set of items/question are measuring the same construct). How does the Cronbach's alpha compare with the average of Item-Sum correlation or the Item-(Sum minus Item) correlation of all the items? I have a set of testing items and I am interested in understanding if they are measuring different concepts/constructs or are measuring the same construct.
