a coefficient of variation ... is supposed to give some measure of reliability of the averaged relatedness measure of the group. most papers using similar methods do not provide any measurement of this sort. They usually don't investigate the dispersion of their estimates within subgroups at all. There is a third way here: provide a measure of dispersion within groups (a very good idea), but don't divide by the mean values. There is no need to divide a measure of dispersion by the mean value. In fact, for evaluating differences among groups, you want to do something like the opposite. To estimate the reliability of an observed difference between groups , which presumably is of some interest, you start by dividing the observed difference by a pooled within-group error estimate. That's the basis of analysis of variance and linear regression. Furthermore, in those contexts the error magnitude is assumed to be constant across the range of values. In that case, dividing the error by the mean imposes unnecessary systematic differences as mean values change. The coefficient of variation, the ratio of standard deviation to the mean, can be informative if there's reason to think that errors are proportional to mean values. That certainly doesn't seem to be the case for your data. Furthermore, if errors are proportional to mean values you probably should be using a type of model that explicitly takes the error-mean relationships into account, like generalized linear models. Just report a measure of within-group dispersion, and possibly use that to help evaluate the differences among the groups.
