Fit Gompertz curve to growth data with decline phase

I measured the change in three traits ( y1 , y2 , y3 ) over time ( x ). The three traits each reached a maximum at different times and then declined. I am interested in the phase until the max and would like to fit Gompertz curves in the following form: $$ y = \alpha \exp(\beta(1−\exp(−\gamma x))) $$ as the estimated parameters have biological meaning and will be used for further calculations. One approach I found in an (old) paper is a two-phase (until and after the max) fitting of Gompertz curves. Major problems: I could not determine until which time point of the data I would use for the fitting (i.e. to discard the decline phase): Within the same group, y1 , y2 and y3 reached max at different times (graph below: y2 reached max earlier than y1 and y3 ). The decline is greater in some groups than others (graph below: the decline phase is more obvious in treatment a than in treatment b). The graph shows the Gompertz curves I fit to all data ( y1 ) and data until x = 55 ( y2 and y3 ) for treatments a and b. Attempt: A solution I think of is to first fit broken-line regression to find the max point, and then fit the Gompertz curve to the data until that point. However, it is difficult to fit Gompertz curves to less than four time points of observations (e.g. for y3 in treatment b, the estimated upper asymptote of the Gompertz is higher biased). Is there any better approach to fit the Gompertz curves? Any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance. Edit: Sample data are pasted. There are 7 time points each with ~10 observations, which also differed in time in a microscopic scale. In the dataset below, 3-4 observations per time are provided. After reading the comments , I am abandoning the idea of fitting Gompertz curves to those data (I did not expect the declines at different times). I would like to compare 1) time to max among treatments and among traits, 2) max y among treatments 3) growth rate and 4) decline rate. For 2), as they reached max y at different times, would it be a fair comparison if I just take the max y regardless of x ? For 3) and 4), the same problem with time remains. As the $\Delta x$ are different, would it be more suitable to compare the instantaneous initial growth rate (at x = 0) and final decline rate (at x = 100) rathre than compare the averages from the initial to max point (or from max to final point)? x y1 y2 y3 1 3.088 7.922 0.368 2.575 2 2.994 8.061 0.368 2.636 3 2.860 7.962 0.361 2.560 4 2.741 7.915 0.353 2.499 5 21.430 8.383 0.396 2.955 6 21.285 8.127 0.391 2.811 7 21.561 8.262 0.386 2.863 8 35.046 8.690 0.385 3.056 9 35.142 8.513 0.376 2.984 10 35.256 8.386 0.377 2.998 11 53.666 8.743 0.386 3.122 12 53.767 8.664 0.359 2.997 13 53.545 8.542 0.365 2.966 14 68.315 8.490 0.347 2.744 15 68.083 8.820 0.359 2.983 16 68.215 8.205 0.347 2.756 17 86.383 8.567 0.346 2.823 18 86.275 8.709 0.346 2.860 19 86.505 8.707 0.331 2.823 20 99.480 8.465 0.328 2.705 21 99.399 8.545 0.331 2.747 22 99.553 8.523 0.325 2.657
