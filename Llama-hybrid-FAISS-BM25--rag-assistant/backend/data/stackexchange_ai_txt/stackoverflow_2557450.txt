I suspect that BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad is adding the images to the Framework's memory footprint, but since you do not own the objects in the image cache, they do not appear in the results from GC method calls. Try using BitmapCacheOption.None instead and see if that solves your memory issues. Note: Doing this will have a drastic performance impact.
