Memcached connections maxed out

I am running a very large Rails app. We use a pool of Memcached servers and the Evan Reaver's gem memcached, and have two namespaces one for the object/fragments and one for sessions. We use half the number of servers for sessions as we use for object/fragments. For some mysterious reason the Rails app only opens around 20-30% of the maximum available connections set by the memcached daemon. It also seem to take the max connections from the first server listed. Does anyone have any input for this weird behavior?
