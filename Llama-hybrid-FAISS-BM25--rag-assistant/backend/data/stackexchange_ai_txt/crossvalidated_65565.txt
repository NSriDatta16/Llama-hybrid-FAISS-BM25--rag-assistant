What is the belief parameter (nu)?

I am reading up on MCMCglmm in R using this course - could someone explain to me what the belief parameter is, it is first mentioned on page 12. I would like to understand it, and it's relationship to the Wishart distribution and parameter V. For a single variance component the inverse Wishart takes two scalar parameters, V and nu. The distribution tends to a point mass on V as the degree of belief parameter, nu goes to innity. The distribution tends to be right skewed when nu is not very large, with a mode of Vnu nu+2 but a mean of Vnu nu2 (which is not dened for nu Reading material suggestions in the comments would also be really helpful as I look for beginner material in Bayesian Statistics as a newbie/non-mathematician - I'm an evolutionary biologist :)
