How can I generate a plot similar to that produced by plot.bugs and plot.jags from an mcmc.list?

R seems to be able to output nice summary plots from the bugs and jags objects generated by the functions R2WinBUGS::bugs and R2jags:jags . However, I am using the rjags package. When I try to plot the results of the function rjags::coda.samples using R2WinBUGS::plot.mcmc.list the results are diagnostic plots (parameter density, chain time series, autocorrelation) for each parameter. Below is the type of plot that I would like to produce, from Andrew Gelman's tutorial "Running WinBuugs and OpenBugs from R" . These were produced by using the plot.pugs . The problem is that plot.bugs takes a bugs object as an argument, while plot.mcmc.list takes the output of coda.samples . Here is an example (from the coda.samples ): library(rjags) data(LINE) LINE$recompile() LINE.out What I need is either a way to generate a similar, information-rich, one-page summary plot similar to the one produced by plot.bugs a function that will convert LINE.out to a bugs object or
