I changed my requirements a bit and got the code to work as follows. Change being now I create a shortcut to the ProgramData folder. It works fine and creates the shortcut fine. However there is one problem since it creates the shortcut on AllUsers Desktop while I want it to be created on the Current User's desktop. What change should I do? Also note that my installer performs a all-user install, and I'm not at liberty to change that. I merely needs a way to create this shortcut on Current User's desktop while the installer can still do a all-user install.
