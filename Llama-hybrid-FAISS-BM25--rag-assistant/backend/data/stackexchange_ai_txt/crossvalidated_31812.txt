This is an answer to the last part of your question, how to quickly generate the data you want for the pollinator hypothesis: n = 16 max = 4 p1 = 0.1 p2 = 0.9 Y1 = rbinom(10000*n,1,p1) Y2 = matrix(Y1*rbinom(10000*n,4,p2),ncol=16) You can also use rzibinom() in package VGAM. Although I'm not sure what you want to do with it. You have 2 free parameters, p1 and p2, that need to be estimated. Why not use a zero inflated binomial model to estimate them from the data? You should look at package VGAM, which fits ZIB models among others. In fact, you can get the expected distribution for a ZIB from the VGAM function dzibinom() , which you could use to compare your observed distribution with if you know the parameters of visitation and pollination. Again, you really should fit the ZIB model. If your partial selfing hypothesis is exclusive to insect pollination, then the expected distribution is simply binomial, and you could estimate the parameters with a binomial family glm or perhaps a glmm with plant id as a random effect. However, if they can partial self AND receive insect pollination, then you're back to needing a mixture of two binomial distributions. In that case I would investigate using OpenBUGS or JAGS to fit the model using MCMC. Once you have the two models fitted to your data you then compare the models to see which one fits better, using AIC or BIC or some other metric of your choice.
