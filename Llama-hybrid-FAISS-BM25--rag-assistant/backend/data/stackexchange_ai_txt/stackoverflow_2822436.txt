Thanks for posting the question. I just ran into this problem and figured out a cause that you may be running into. An asynchronous exception may have occurred During my test setup, I create an object that queues a worker thread in the thread pool. If I run through debugging fast enough my code passes. If the worker thread kicks off and has an error BEFORE the test setup completes, then I get a result of Aborted with no reasoning. If the worker thread kicks off and has an error AFTER the test has begun, then I get a result of : Error - The agent process was stopped while the test was running. Important to note: this is a component that I use throughout several of my tests. If the test framework encounters too many of these errors it aborts the rest of the tests. Hope this helps
