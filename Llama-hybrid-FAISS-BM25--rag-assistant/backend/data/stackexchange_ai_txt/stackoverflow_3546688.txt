How does YouTube embedding work without a classid in the object tag?

A typical code fragment obtained from the YouTube embed feature looks like this: Now, the element has a type attribute to tell the browser it is embedding a flash file, but for browsers using the tag, there appears to be no information available to the browser! Why is a classid or codebase attribute not required here? The only options I can think of are: IE assumes Flash embedding in the absence of other information or, IE reads this information from the tag I can't find documentation to verify either option. And I'm curious! EDIT: found a great comparison of Flash embedding techniques here . Still want to know how it works though...
