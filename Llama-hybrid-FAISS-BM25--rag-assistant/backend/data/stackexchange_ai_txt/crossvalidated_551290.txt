is there any better approach then K folds and nested K fold

I am trying to understand what problem is K-folds solving. It does not seem to be solving data leakage at all, as we are still testing on test data and then taking an average of all test folds and then retune the model. I can understand that with each model, it is like training on new data set, this seems to be the positive point. Now, if I understand correctly, nested K folds seems to be solving this data leakage problem. but it is like performing the model tuning K times and coming up with K models. I really dont see much benefit rather then having 5 model and using them on real time. Now, why cant simply we have alternative approach. Have K folds, keep 1 fold as only test data. Use K-1 folds for K fold validation (K-2 for train, 1 fold for CV). Using this way, we evaluate our model on unseen data. But certainly, there must be some drawbacks with this, I want to understand why this alternative approach is better then K folds and nested K fold.
