Any way to have a schema use user-defined elements in its structure?

I'm wondering if it's possible to have a schema use user-defined elements (from the XML) for its structure. As in, as a user, I would be able to have something like: plane bird organic awesome false true true false So the schema would know about: subjectType questionType subjectInterview question but not the user-defined sub-elements. It would understand how the elements nest in relation to each other and have other restrictions (it would treat the user-defined values like enums to prevent typos and prevent duplicate questionType's per subjectType). How would I go about getting this type of user-defined content to be enforced in a schema? edit: If it matters, I also plan on unmarshalling the user-defined xml to java classes. Thanks
