Extractiv provides commercial NLP powered by Language Computer Corporation that can parse entities and relations in either uploaded documents or from web crawls. The former service utilizes a REST API. I dropped this URL in, and it extracts 4/5 of the addresses. Note, having them strung like that together makes them especially difficult. Search for "address" in this JSON output: http://rest.extractiv.com/extractiv/?url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5099684/detect-parse-mailing-addresses-in-text&output_format=json One of them: { "id": 11, "len": 17, "offset": 1557, "text": "128 E Beaumont St", "type": "ADDRESS" }, (Note: if you use the HTML output, which is more for demos, it filters out non-sentence content, which is why I showed the JSON instead). Disclaimer: I work at Extractiv. Update : Extractiv is no more.
