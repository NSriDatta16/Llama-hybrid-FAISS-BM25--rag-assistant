Don't set targets for code coverage or any other code metrics. It usually turns out that hard targets do more damage than good . If you give other developers hard code metric targets they will just game the targets if they don't understand the underlying reasons for the target. As a parallel example, you will not believe how many "Keep FxCopy happy" code comments I've seen in my career. If you set a hard target for test coverage, lazy developers may skip writing null checks etc. because it decreases their coverage if they don't write the corresponding tests. The end result is poorer code quality. Conversely, developers who understand the benefits of TDD don't need the target because they'll do the right thing regardless. That doesn't mean that the code coverage metric is irrelevant. It is very relevant, but instead of setting a hard target, I think you should have a rule that says that it must never decrease . So measure it regularly and make sure it's only going up. That doesn't preclude you from having your own personal goal, but don't set a hard target.
