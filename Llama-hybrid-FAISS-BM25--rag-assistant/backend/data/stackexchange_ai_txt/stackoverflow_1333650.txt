The tag in application.xml is a JavaEE5 feature, and I don't think that JBoss 4.3 is fully JavaEE5-compliant (it can do EJB3, yes, but it's only partial support). So you need to go back to using explicitly declared JAR files: lib/core.jar As for your properties files, you need to add the directory that they're in as a java module, so for your example: lib/classes
