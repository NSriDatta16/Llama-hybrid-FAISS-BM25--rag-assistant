I don't like these videos. They only make understanding PCA more difficult by bringing in irrelevant details. Also, they're long and wordy. The idea of PCA is very simple when it comes to applications. You have a several series of data, call them variables. Say you have N variables (series) $x_1(t),x_2(t),\dots,x_N(t)$. Sometimes there are a few underlying factors that drive all these series. Let's say there are M factors $f_1(t),f_2(t),\dots,f_M(t)$, and you suspect (or know for sure) that they drive the variables: $$x_1(t)=c_{11}f_1(t)+\dots+c_{1M}f_M(t)\\\dots\\ x_N(t)=c_{N1}f_1(t)+\dots+c_{NM}f_M(t)$$ So, you're interested to extract the factor values $f_j(t)$ and the coefficients $c_{ij}$. So, PCA is one way of accomplishing this. In fact, if you don't know what is the exact number of components M, it can help you find that out too.
