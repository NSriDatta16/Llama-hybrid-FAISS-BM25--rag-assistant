Your approach would not be the best. It treats the predictor as the outcome, which is dubious scientifically speaking. After all, your question is about $E(y \vert x)$ not $E(x \vert y)$ . The best way would be to perform a logistic regression. I'm not going to get into the details here, there are lots of resources for learning about logistic regression. Here is a small example in R. I've generated a continuous predictor and a binary outcome. In the plot below, I've binned the predictor and computed the average of the outcomes. As the predictor increases, we seem to get more outcomes where $y=1$ . We can perform a test of association by fitting a logistic regression. In R, model=glm(y~x, data=my_data, family=binomial()) summary(model) > summary(model) Call: glm(formula = y ~ x, family = binomial(), data = my_data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0942 -0.8878 -0.8205 1.4394 1.8072 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.79111 0.06868 -11.518 Look at the row for x in the summary. It has an associated p value and an estimate for the effect. The effect is the log-odds ratio (again, something you can easily read up on). If this estimate is positive, then as the predictor increases then so too will the probability we see a positive outcome. If it is negative, the opposite is true.
