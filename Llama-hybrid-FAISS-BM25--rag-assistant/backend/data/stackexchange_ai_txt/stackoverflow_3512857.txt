There is paper in the Wikipedia article Symbolic Boolean Manipulation with Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams which gives lower and upper bounds for certain function classes (symmetric, representing binary arithmetic). I think that in the average case 2n*log n >= 2^k holds, where n is the number of nodes in the diagram and k is the number of variables of the function. The upper bound is n achieved with the full binary tree.
