I've once worked in a company that used Perl, and have similar problems. The solution we come up with, was to reorganize the functions in files, taking in consideration a 3-tier architecture (presentation, business and persistence), and the elements being manipulated. So, we have one perl file to each main table in database, one perl file for each entity to manipulate their business operations, and so on ... with this, it's easy to avoid code duplication, because you know exactly where to look for a given function.
