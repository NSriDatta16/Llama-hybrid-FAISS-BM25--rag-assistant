I might be wrong, but usually (meaning, at least in most languages) when you allocate an array, it means you are asking for a continuous block of memory. A single array of doubles with 100,000,000 elements will need 100000000 * 8 bytes of memory (+ possible overhead), roughly 800 megabytes. Even if you have said amount of memory free (in total), it doesn't necessarily mean that the free memory is continuous, it might be fragmented into multiple free areas of different sizes, and the allocation will fail.
