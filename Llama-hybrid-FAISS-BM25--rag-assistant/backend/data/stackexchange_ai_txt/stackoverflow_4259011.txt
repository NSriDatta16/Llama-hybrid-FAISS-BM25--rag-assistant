Outlook Automation - Security Warnings

I know this is a duplicate of this Question , but it was asked over a year ago. Things changed and maybe there is "a real answer" nowerdays - so here it comes; How to avoid those security warnings, when using autolook automation when sending mails (using outlook 2007+)? Regards EDIT: I checked the Trust Center, it tells me that my Anti-Virus is valid and the setting for security is set to "alert me when my anti virus is out of date". But i keep getting those annoying Popups. Further i have to add that it already used to run without the messagebox, but after i added/modified some profiles the popups began. I did NOT change any code! Any ideas? A 3rd Party component is an option, but i would like to avoid it whenever possible.
