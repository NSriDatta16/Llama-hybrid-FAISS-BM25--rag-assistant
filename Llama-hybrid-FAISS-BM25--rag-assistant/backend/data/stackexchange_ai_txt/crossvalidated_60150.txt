This can cut two ways, but mostly one. In logistic regression, as with any flavour of regression, it is fine, indeed usually better, to have continuous predictors. Given a choice between a continuous variable as a predictor and categorising a continuous variable for predictors, the first is usually to be preferred. At the crudest level, you are just throwing away information by categorising a continuous variable. There is discussion in several places. Frank Harrell in his Regression Modeling Strategies (New York: Springer, 2001; Cham, Springer, 2015) has a nice treatment of the issue and gives references. Also, there is not really a equivalent of empty cells to worry about. Values of family size, which is your leading example here, may not exist for 13, 14, 15, 16 members, or for that matter for 42 or 420. This is no more a problem than using persons' height as a predictor and not having someone 3 metres tall in your dataset. It's true that the same problem may bite in terms of outliers, but that can happen with the categorical solution too. If some points are 0 and a few are 1 or a very few are 5, that's possibly an outlier situation too. The qualification is that by entering a predictor as is you are implying that its effect is additive and linear. But that's not a fatal objection: just consider adding an interaction term or transforming it, as appropriate. Or use a formulation in terms of splines: the book just cited is rich in examples.
