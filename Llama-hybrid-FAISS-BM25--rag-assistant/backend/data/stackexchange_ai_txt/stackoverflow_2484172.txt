As for #1, you can see how to create popup panels in this sample project from one of my books. As for #2, I do not believe it is possible, strictly speaking. Certainly, there is nothing built in for that, at least that I have seen. You could attempt to detect a touch event, get rid of the existing overlay item, draw your own copy of the icon where the overlay item had been, manually animate that as the user drags, and then put the overlay item where the user drops it (getting rid of your manually-drawn icon).
