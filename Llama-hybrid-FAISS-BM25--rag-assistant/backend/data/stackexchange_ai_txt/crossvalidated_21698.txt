Non-overlapping aggregation and autocorrelation

I have a time series that follow an MA(1) process , I do non-overlapping aggregation with aggregation level $m=2,3,\dots$, and then I calculate autocorrelation of basic and aggregated series, for negative value of moving average parameter, aggregated autocorrelation becomes close to zero, means that the aggregated series want to be like white noise, I was wondering if anybody can explain the reasons behind this behavior?
