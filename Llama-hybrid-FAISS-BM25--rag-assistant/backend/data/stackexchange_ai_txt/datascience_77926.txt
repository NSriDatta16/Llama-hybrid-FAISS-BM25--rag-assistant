What does it exactly mean when we say that PCA and LDA are linear methods of learning data representation?

I have been reading on representation learning and I have come across this idea that PCA and LDA are linear methods of data representation, however, auto-encoders provide a non-linear way. Does this mean that the embedding learned by PCA can be transformed only linearly to reproduce data points ?
