This one needs to be put to bed. I am interested in learning more about applying Bayesian linear models for covariates some of which are continuous and some are binary. As people have pointed out in comments, there's no distinction - linear regression is linear regression whether your x's are continuous or binary. This applies to Bayesian linear regression as well. If they were all binary, you might call it Bayesian ANOVA perhaps, but it's still also Bayesian regression. What is the appropriate terminology for such models so that I can search online for literature related to these models. It's all just Bayesian linear regression. (There are also a number of questions on site that discuss aspects of the topic.)
