How would you categorize / extract information out of job descriptions?

I have a bunch of job descriptions entered by users. There are all sort of misspells and bad data. i.e: ... tulane univ hospital tulip tullett prebon ... weik investment weill cornell university medical center weis weiss waldee hohimer dds welded constrction l.p. welder welder welder ... What steps would you take to 'augment' this values with job related insights ? The best I can think of is to give it to wolfram alpha. But I wonder if there are other accessible techniques that I can utilize using python. Update: I found out that there is a Standard Occupational Classification , I really would like to match the name to the SOC and the SOC to a range of average salaries.
