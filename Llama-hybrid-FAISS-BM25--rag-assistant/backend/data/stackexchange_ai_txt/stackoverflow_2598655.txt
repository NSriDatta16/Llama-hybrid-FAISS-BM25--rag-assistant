You can detach all entities with clear but detaching just one entity is not in the JPA 2.0. http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html You probably had hibernate impl in your build path, and another implementation on your application server (EclipseLink? or old hibernate version)... The entityManager.detach(...) is in Hibernate but not in JPA so you need the hibernate impl on your application server to use this function...
